 15                                       BACKGROUND
              Many potential lignocellulosic feedstocks are available today, including
     agricultural residues, woody biomass, municipal waste, oilseeds/cakes and seaweed, to
     name a few. At present, these materials are often under-utilized, being used, for
     example, as animal feed, biocompost materials, burned in a co-generation facility or even
 20  landfilled.
              Lignocellulosic biomass includes crystalline cellulose fibrils embedded in a
     hemicellulose matrix, surrounded by lignin. This produces a compact matrix that is
     difficult to access by enzymes and other chemical, biochemical and/or biological
     processes. Cellulosic biomass materials (e.g., biomass material from which the lignin
 25  has been removed) is more accessible to enzymes and other conversion processes, but
     even so, naturally-occurring cellulosic materials often have low yields (relative to
     theoretical yields) when contacted with hydrolyzing enzymes. Lignocellulosic biomass
     is even more recalcitrant to enzyme attack. Furthermore, each type of lignocellulosic
     biomass has its own specific composition of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.

WO 2014/138543                                                               PCT/US2014/021609
                                                   SUMMARY
               Generally the inventions relate to methods, equipment and systems for processing
     materials, such as biomass. For example, processes are disclosed herein for saccharifying
  5  or liquifying a biomass material, e.g., cellulosic, lignocellulosic and/or starchy
     feedstocks, by converting biomass material to low molecular weight sugars, e.g.,
     saccharifying the feedstock using an enzyme, e.g., one or more cellulase and/or amylase.
     The invention also relates to converting a feedstock to a product, e.g., by bioprocessing,
     such as fermentation. Novel systems, methods and equipment for conveying and/or
 10  cooling materials, such as biomass materials, that have been treated, e.g., to reduce their
     recalcitrance are described herein. Cooling (which can occur during conveying) materials
     after any treatment or processes described herein can enhance processing rates and can
     prepare the materials for additional treatments or processes without delay. For example,
     if it is desired to treat a biomass material to a total dose that would exceed its
 15  decomposition temperature if treated without sufficient cooling, it is advantageous to
     parse the total dose into two or more doses with cooling between doses.
               In one aspect the invention relates to a method of handling materials, e.g.,
     biomass, including conveying a recalcitrance-reduced biomass along the interior portions
     of a screw conveyor. The methods can include delivering the biomass to a feed inlet and
 20  also optionally discharging the biomass through an outlet of the screw conveyor.
     Optionally, the method includes treating the biomass with accelerated electrons to reduce
     its recalcitrance, for example, wherein the electrons have an energy between about 0.3
     MeV and about 5 MeV, such as between about 0.5 MeV and about 3.5 MeV, or between
     about 0.8 MeV and about 2 MeV. Optionally, prior to conveying (e.g., with the screw
 25  conveyor), the biomass receives a dose between about 0.5 Mrad and about 50 Mrad, such
     as between about 1 Mrad and 20 Mrad, between about 1 Mrad and about 15 Mrad, or
     between about 5 Mrad and about 15 Mrad.
               In some implementation the interior portions along which the biomass is
     conveyed, such as screw shaft, fighting and/or housing, are cooled. For example, the
 30  interior portions are cooled using a chilled liquid, such as water or glycol water mixtures.
     Optionally, the chilled water is chilled utilizing a cooling tower and/or geothermal
     cooling.
               In some other implementations, the conveyer has a biomass inlet and a biomass
     discharge and the difference in temperature between the biomass at the inlet and the
                                                     2

WO 2014/138543                                                              PCT/US2014/021609
     discharge is less than about 110  0C  (e.g., less than about 75 C, less than about 50 C,
     less than about 25 C).
              In other implementations, the method further includes comminuting the biomass
     material while conveying the biomass material e.g., by shredding and/or shearing.
  5  Optionally an additive is combined with the biomass material prior to, during or after
     conveying the treated biomass material, for example, the additive can include, water, an
     acid, such as sulfuric or hydrochloric or phosphoric acid, a base, a metal, a resin, an
     inorganic material, and mixtures of these.
              In another aspect the invention relates to a method of processing a material, e.g.,
 10  a biomass material, including providing a material to a first treatment cell equipped with
     a first electron beam device, and irradiating the material using the first electron beam
     device. The method also includes cooling and conveying the material with a screw
     conveyor from the first treatment cell. Optionally, the method further includes conveying
     (e.g., while cooling) the material with the screw conveyor from the first treatment cell to
 15  a second treatment cell equipped with a second electron beam generator and irradiating
     the material with an electron beam using the second electron beam device. The screw
     conveyor can include interior portions such as screw shaft, fighting and/or housing that
     is cooled, e.g., cooled using a chilled liquid, such as water or glycol water mixtures.
     Optionally cooling reduces the temperature of the material by between about 1 0 C and
 20  about 110 0 C (e.g., between about 10 0C and about 75 0 C, between about 10 0C and
     about 50 0C). Optionally the total dose delivered by the irradiation is between about 1
     and 200 Mrad (e.g., between about 10 and about 200 Mrad, between about 10 Mrad and
     about 50 Mrad, between about 20 Mrad and about 40 Mrad, between about 25 and about
     35 Mrad). In some cases, the temperature (e.g., the temperature of the biomass) during
 25  the irradiation does not exceed about 200 C (e.g., does not exceed about 180 C, does
     not exceed about 160 C, does not exceed about 150 C, does not exceed about 140 'C,
     does not exceed about 130 C, does not exceed about 120 C, does not exceed about
     110 C). Optionally, the temperature of the material during irradiation increases by
     between about 10 C and about 250 C (e.g., between about 10 C and about 150 'C,
 30  between about 50 C and about 150 C, between about 75 C and about 150 C).
              Optionally the screw conveyors described in the methods and systems herein can
     include two or more screws.
              In some implementations of the inventions described herein, the material includes
     biomass material such as cellulosic and/or lignocellulosic material. For example, the
 35  biomass can be selected from the group consisting of wood, particle board, sawdust,

  5  following summarized features. In some implementations, the selected features can be
     applied or utilized in any order while in other implementations a specific selected

     once in any sequence and even continuously. In addition, an entire sequence, or a portion
     of a sequence, of applied or utilized features can be applied or utilized once, repeatedly
 10  or continuously in any order. In some optional implementations, the features can be

     according to one embodiment. FIG. 1B is a detailed view of a portion of the cooling
 10  system.

 15                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
              Using the methods described herein, many materials such as biomass (e.g., plant
     biomass, animal biomass, paper, and municipal waste biomass) can be processed to
     produce useful intermediates and products such as sugars, sugar alcohols, organic acids,
 20  salts of organic acids, anhydrides, esters of organic acids and fuels, e.g., fuels for internal
     combustion engines or feedstocks for fuel cells. Included herein are many methods that
     involve saccharification of biomass to produce sugars, and in some cases fermentation of
     the resulting sugars to form other products and/or intermediates. Methods and materials
     described herein include controlling the temperatures during and/or after treatment steps
 25  to reduce or eliminate destruction (e.g., decomposition) of the treated material.
              Cooling biomass materials that have been treated, e.g., treated to reduce their
     recalcitrance, are described herein. For example, the material can be irradiated as
     described herein which can increase the temperature of the biomass, for example,
     increasing the temperature of the biomass by between about 10 0 C and about 250 0 C
 30  (e.g., between about 10 0C and 200 0 C, between about 10 0 C and 150 0C, between about
     10 0C and 100 0 C, between about 20 0 C and about 100 C , between about 20 and 75 0 C,
     between about 50 0C and about 200 0 C, between about 50 0 C and 150 0 C, between about
     75 0C and about 150 0 C).
              Cooling materials after any such treatment or process described herein can
 35  enhance processing rates and reduce losses, e.g., loses due to thermal decomposition, and
                                                    7

WO 2014/138543                                                             PCT/US2014/021609
     can prepare the treated or processed material for additional treatments or processes
     without delay. Referring to FIG. 1A, cooling water can be piped to an inlet 10 of a
     geothermal ground loop 12, which further removes heat above that obtained from a
     cooling water tower. The geothermal ground loop 12 includes a tortuous length of pipe
  5  14 (e.g., copper or plastic) that is embedded through foundation 30. In some instances,
     the pipe 14 is installed when the foundation is poured, and the foundation is used in an
     area of the plant that requires a thick foundation pad, for example an area containing the
     irradiation equipment discussed below. In some alternative embodiments the geothermal
     ground loop is located in another area, for example, away from any buildings, equipment
 10  and/or foundations so that it can be easy to access (e.g., dug out). For example, the
     geothermal ground loop can be in an area that would not serve for other construction,
     such as under a pond. In some alternative embodiments an open geothermal loop or a
     closed geothermal loop can be utilized. Open and closed geothermal loop options are
     discussed in "Recommendations for Geothermal Heating and Cooling Systems", Ohio
 15  Water Resources Council, State Coordinating Committee on Ground Water, Feb. 2012,
     accessed online at the website
     http://wwwapp.epa.ohio.gov/ddagw/SCCGW/Documents/GHCS.pdf , March 3, 2013 the
     entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Foundation 30 is shown in
     FIG. 1A supporting a vault for irradiation of biomass, while ground is not shown so as
 20  not to obscure the views of the foundation and buried tubing. In some embodiments the
     geothermal loop can be completely embedded in the foundation. Water leaves the
     geothermal ground loop 12 at exit 20, at a temperature of about 55'F, and enters the
     casing of conveyor 16, e.g., an ash cooler, the structure of which will be discussed below
     with reference to FIG. 2A and B, through an inlet 17. A motor for driving the shaft of 16
 25  can be enclosed in enclosure 60. The temperature of the water entering the ash cooler 16
     is sufficiently low so that the water will be able to cool biomass that has been heated to a
     temperature of about 75 to 150 'F, which enters the ash cooler through an inlet 18.
     Cooled biomass, at a temperature of about 73'F, exits the ash cooler 16 through a
     biomass outlet 19 while the cooling water, which has now returned to an elevated
 30  temperature, exits through a water outlet tube 22. The temperature difference between
     the inlet and outlet of the cooler can be less than about 110 deg. C (e.g., less than about
     75 deg. C, less than about 50 deg. C, less than about 25 deg. C). The material can be
     cooled, for example, by between about 1 0 C and about 110 0 C (e.g., between about 10 0 C
     and about 75 0C, between about 10 0C and about 50 0C).

              FIG. 1B is a detailed front view of a bag filter in fluid communication with a
     closed loop air conveyor and ash cooler 16. Biomass is conveyed in a gas (e.g., air by
     pneumatic conveying) to the bag filter through pneumatic pipe 46. The bag filter traps
     fine biomass particles and allows larger biomass particles to drop through the inlet 18 of
  5  the ash cooler 16 as indicated by the arrow. A rotary valve positioned at 50 and driven by
     motor 52 can control the flow of biomass and gases. Gas is returned to complete the
     circuit of the closed air loop conveyor by pipe 48. Gas is also drawn off into flow
     chamber 40. Optionally, flow chamber 40 can include gas abatement systems (such as air
     pollution control technologies), e.g., a carbon filter, for removal of ozone, volatile
 10  organic carbon compounds and/or hazardous air pollutants. A fan 42 (e.g., an axial fan)
     draws air through the flow chamber in the direction shown by the arrows drawn in
     chamber 40 and out into the atmosphere through outlet 44. Optionally the outlet air flows
     through chamber 40 at a rate of about 300 ft3/min (e.g. between about 20 and 1000
     ft3/min, between about 50 and 500 ft3/min, between about 100 and 400 ft3/min ). Air
 15  flow in the closed loop air conveyor is from about the same as the air flow exiting outlet
     44, to higher than the flow in the closed loop conveyor. The air flow exiting the outlet
     can be about 1 to 10 times higher than the flow of air in the closed air loop conveyor
     (e.g., 1 to 6 times, 1 to 3 times, I to 2 times).
              Referring to FIG. 2A which is a side cross-sectional view of a cooling conveyor,
 20  cooling water flows through a casing 23, which includes an inner shell 25 and an outer
     shell 27 that define a space there between for fluid flow. Hot biomass (e.g., at a
     temperature TI) is conveyed through 16 (e.g., ash cooler) by a screw conveyor that
     comprises a rotating screw 24. The shaft 26 and flight 28 of the screw 24 are hollow,
     and are also cooled by recirculating water from the geothermal ground loop 12. A drive
 25  motor (not shown) is mechanically connected to the shaft providing the torque needed to
     rotate the shaft and screw.
              In 16, the biomass particles are subjected to continuous movement by the helices
     of the screw 25 and are constantly changing location. This causes them, as they move
     through the conveyor, to come into frequent and repeated contact with the internal
 30  surfaces of the conveyor that are cooled because they are in thermal communication with
     the cooling water, e.g., the outer surface of screw 24 and inner shell 25. The rotation,
     conveying, interfolding and dispersing action increases the heat exchange between the
     biomass and the cooling fluids in the screw and casing. Therefore, the temperature of the
     biomass exiting the screw cooler (T2) is lower than the temperature of the biomass
 35  entering the screw cooler (e.g., Ti>T2).

WO 2014/138543                                                               PCT/US2014/021609
              In some embodiments the ash cooler includes more than one screw. For example,
     FIG 2B is a top cross-sectional view of a cooling screw conveyor with two screws. The
     screw conveyors can intermesh as shown. The dual screw conveyor has similar
     components as the single screw conveyor but has a larger internal volume containing the
  5  two screws. Hot biomass enters (e.g., drops into) the cooler through inlet 218 on the top
     of the conveyor and moves through the cooler, for example as shown by the arrows, due
     to the screwing/turning/conveying action of the screws 224. The cooled biomass exits
     (e.g., drops out of) the screw conveyor through outlet 220 disposed on the underside of
     the conveyor. Cooling water flows through casing 223, which includes inner shell 225
 10  and outer shell 227 that define a space there between for fluid flow. The shafts 226 and
     flights 228 of the screws 224 are hollow, and are cooled by recirculating water from
     geothermal ground loop 12. In other embodiments, three, four, five, six or even more
     screws can be used in the cooling conveyor. As, in the single screw embodiment, the
     temperature of the biomass entering the screw cooler (TI) is greater than the temperature
 15  of the biomass (T2) exiting the screw cooler.
              The conveyors (e.g., the flights, shaft, inner shell of a screw cooler) can be made
     of or coated with corrosion resistant materials. For example, the conveyors can utilize
     structural materials that include stainless steel (e.g., 304, 316 stainless steel,
     HASTELLOY@ ALLOYS and INCONEL@ Alloys). For example, HASTELLOY@
 20  Corrosion-Resistant alloys from Hynes (Kokomo, Indiana, USA) such as
     HASTELLOY@ B-3@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ HYBRID-BC1@ ALLOY,
     HASTELLOY@ C-4 ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ C-22@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ C
     22HS@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ C-276 ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ C-2000@ ALLOY,
     HASTELLOY@ G-30@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ G-35@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ N
 25  ALLOY and HASTELLOY@ ULTIMET@ alloy. For example, some coatings that can
     be utilized and corresponding microhardness are listed here: Titanium nitride (TiN: 2300
     HV 0.05), Aluminum Chromium Nitride (AlCrN: 3200 HV 0.05), Titanium Carbo
     Nitride (TiCN: 3000 HV 0.05), Tungsten Carbide/Carbon (WC/C:
     1500HVO.05/1000 HV 0.05), Chromium Nitride (CrN: 1750 HV 0.05), Diamond-Like
 30  Carbon (DLC: >2000 HV 0.05), Titanium Aluminum Nitride (TiAlN: 3300 HV 0.05 and
     TiAlNx: 3400 HV 0.05), Titanium Chromium Nitride (TiCrN: 2100 HV 0.05). In some
     embodiments, a coating process known as TDX is used which is a process is ideally
     suited for sever applications. The TDX coating is applied in a molten salt bath resulting
     in a very uniform and smooth layer of carbides. The TDX carbides are metallurgically
 35  bonded to the tooling resulting in extremely high adhesion strength and peel resistance.

     The hardness values of TDX coatings are about 4200 Vickers. For example, some
     optional coatings can be provided by Tool Dynamics Inc (Columbus, IN) such as TDX
     Supreme I, TDX Supreme II and TDX Supreme III.
              Coatings can be applied by methods such as physical vapor deposition (PVD),
  5  Thermal spray, HVOF (a high velocity, low temperature coating process), plasma spray,
     Arc spray and electroplating. The coatings can provide protection for various kinds of
     wear, for example, impact wear, abrasion, erosion, compression, cavitation, galling,
     corrosion and oxidation.
              Conveyors that can be used for the methods herein described (e.g., cooling
 10  conveyors, ash coolers, heat exchange conveyors) include conveyors that can be
     purchased. For example from AFM Bruns (Germany), Zhengzhou Yufeng Heavy
     Machinery Co., Ltd. (China), Therma-Flite Inc. (USA) Qingdao Shongdian Energy
     Equipment Co., Ltd. (China), Magalidi Industrie S.R.L (Italy), Quigdao Zhongdian
     Energy equipment Co. Ltd. (China) and Jiangsu Hongbang Environment Engineering
 15  Co. Ltd. (China), Xinxian Shengxiang Material Trading Co. Ltd and Thomas Conveyor
     (USA). The conveyors can be purchased and also modified (e.g.,with coatings, etc.)
              The cooling water can be replaced by other cooling fluids, for example, an oil
     and/or an alcohol (e.g., ethanol, butanol and/or glycol). Mixtures of water and alcohols
     can also be utilized, e.g., water with ethanol, water with glycol. For example, water
 20  glycol mixtures with between about 5% and 80% glycol can be used (e.g., between 5 and
     20%, between about 10 and 50%, between about 10 and 30%, between about 40 and
     60%). Other additives can be added, for example bactericides, bacteriostatic agents and
     or anti-corrosion agents.
              In some implementations, an additive is combined with the treated biomass
 25  material either prior to, during or after, conveying the treated material. For example, the
     additive may be an additive selected from the group consisting of water, an acid, a base,
     a metal, a resin, an inorganic material, and a mixture of these.
              In some implementations, the biomass and or other material may be comminuted
     (e.g., shredding, ripping and/or tearing the materials) in/by the ash cooler. For example,
 30  the flight can be notched or the gap between the flight and the inner shell 25 of the screw
     conveyor is large enough to grind material there between. In configurations where more
     than one screw are used, the screws can be positioned to increase and/or decrease
     shearing and ripping, for example, by intermeshing the screws and/or bringing the
     surfaces of the flights closer or further to each other. Alternatively, the screw conveyor
 35  can extrude material through a mesh (e.g., wire mesh) or plate with holes.

              The ash cooler can also be utilized for heating the biomass or any material
     conveyed therein. For example, by flowing a heating fluid (e.g., oil or water) in the
     hollow screws, shaft and casing of the screw conveyors. For example, wherein the
     temperature of the biomass is increased by at least 20 C (e.g., at least 30 C, at least
  5  50 C, at least 100 C). After cooling, the biomass material may be returned to the
     recalcitrance treatment area for further treatment, e.g., irradiation, or may be transferred
     to another processing step, such as saccharification.
              In some embodiments, the cooling fluid from the screw cooler is coupled to a
     head exchanger that transfers energy to other processes, such as, a saccharification
 10  process. In such an emobodiment, the heating due to processing of biomass is
     transferred to a saccharification step, e.g., to heat the biomass, water and cellulase
     mixture to between about 40 0 C and 60 0 C.
              Some more details and reiterations of processes for treating a feedstock that can
     be utilized, for example, with the embodiments already discussed above, or in other
 15  embodiments, are described in the following disclosures. In particular, the cooling
     systems discussed herein can be utilized, for example, in processes that include the
     feedstock treatment and processing steps described in the following sections.
                          SYSTEMS FOR TREATING A FEEDSTOCK
 20
     Processes for conversion of a feedstock to sugars and other products, in which the
     conveying methods discuss above may be used, can include, for example, optionally
     physically pre-treating the feedstock, e.g., to reduce its size, before and/or after this
     treatment, optionally treating the feedstock to reduce its recalcitrance (e.g., by
 25  irradiation), and saccharifying the feedstock to form a sugar solution. Saccharification
     can be performed by mixing a dispersion of the feedstock in a liquid medium, e.g., water
     with an enzyme, as will be discussed in detail below. During or after saccharification,
     the mixture (if saccharification is to be partially or completely performed en route) or
     solution can be transported, e.g., by pipeline, railcar, truck or barge, to a manufacturing
 30  plant. At the plant, the solution can be bioprocessed, e.g., fermented, to produce a
     desired product or intermediate, which can then be processed further, e.g., by distillation.
     The individual processing steps, materials used and examples of products and
     intermediates that may be formed will be described in detail below.

WO 2014/138543                                                               PCT/US2014/021609
                                     RADIATION TREATMENT
              The feedstock can be treated with radiation to modify its structure to reduce its
     recalcitrance. Such treatment can, for example, reduce the average molecular weight of
  5  the feedstock, change the crystalline structure of the feedstock, and/or increase the
     surface area and/or porosity of the feedstock. Radiation can be by, for example electron
     beam, ion beam, 100 nm to 28 nm ultraviolet (UV) light, gamma or X-ray radiation.
     Radiation treatments and systems for treatments are discussed in U.S. No. Patent
     8,142,620 and U.S. Patent Application Series No. 12/417,73 1, the entire disclosures of
 10  which are incorporated herein by reference.
              Each form of radiation ionizes the biomass via particular interactions, as
     determined by the energy of the radiation. Heavy charged particles primarily ionize
     matter via Coulomb scattering; furthermore, these interactions produce energetic
     electrons that may further ionize matter. Alpha particles are identical to the nucleus of a
 15  helium atom and are produced by the alpha decay of various radioactive nuclei, such as
     isotopes of bismuth, polonium, astatine, radon, francium, radium, several actinides, such
     as actinium, thorium, uranium, neptunium, curium, californium, americium, and
     plutonium. Electrons interact via Coulomb scattering and bremsstrahlung radiation
     produced by changes in the velocity of electrons.
 20           When particles are utilized, they can be neutral (uncharged), positively charged
     or negatively charged. When charged, the charged particles can bear a single positive or
     negative charge, or multiple charges, e.g., one, two, three or even four or more charges.
     In instances in which chain scission is desired to change the molecular structure of the
     carbohydrate containing material, positively charged particles may be desirable, in part,
 25  due to their acidic nature. When particles are utilized, the particles can have the mass of
     a resting electron, or greater, e.g., 500, 1000, 1500, or 2000 or more times the mass of a
     resting electron. For example, the particles can have a mass of from about 1 atomic unit
     to about 150 atomic units, e.g., from about 1 atomic unit to about 50 atomic units, or
     from about I to about 25, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12 or 15 atomic units.
 30           Gamma radiation has the advantage of a significant penetration depth into a
     variety of material in the sample.
              In embodiments in which the irradiating is performed with electromagnetic
     radiation, the electromagnetic radiation can have, e.g., energy per photon (in electron
     volts) of greater than 102 eV, e.g., greater than 103, 104, 105, 106, or even greater than 107
 35  eV. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation has energy per photon of
                                                    13

WO 2014/138543                                                                PCT/US2014/021609
     between 104 and 107, e.g., between 105 and 106 eV. The electromagnetic radiation can
     have a frequency of, e.g., greater than 1016 Hz, greater than 1017 Hz, 1018, 1019, 1020, or
     even greater than 1021 Hz. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation has a
     frequency of between 1018 and       1022 Hz, e.g., between 1019 to 1021 Hz.
  5          Electron bombardment may be performed using an electron beam device that has
     a nominal energy of less than 10 MeV, e.g., less than 7 MeV, less than 5 MeV, or less
     than 2 MeV, e.g., from about 0.5 to 1.5 MeV, from about 0.8 to 1.8 MeV, or from about
     0.7 to 1 MeV. In some implementations the nominal energy is about 500 to 800 keV.
             The electron beam may have a relatively high total beam power (the combined
 10  beam power of all accelerating heads, or, if multiple accelerators are used, of all
     accelerators and all heads), e.g., at least 25 kW, e.g., at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 65, 70, 80,
     100, 125, or 150 kW. In some cases, the power is even as high as 500 kW, 750 kW, or
     even 1000 kW or more. In some cases the electron beam has a beam power of 1200 kW
     or more, e.g., 1400, 1600, 1800, or even 3000 kW.
 15          This high total beam power is usually achieved by utilizing multiple accelerating
     heads. For example, the electron beam device may include two, four, or more
     accelerating heads. The use of multiple heads, each of which has a relatively low beam
     power, prevents excessive temperature rise in the material, thereby preventing burning of
     the material, and also increases the uniformity of the dose through the thickness of the
 20  layer of material.
             It is generally preferred that the bed of biomass material has a relatively uniform
     thickness. In some embodiments the thickness is less than about 1 inch (e.g., less than
     about 0.75 inches, less than about 0.5 inches, less than about 0.25 inches, less than about
     0.1 inches, between about 0.1 and 1 inch, between about 0.2 and 0.3 inches).
 25          It is desirable to treat the material as quickly as possible. In general, it is
     preferred that treatment be performed at a dose rate of greater than about 0.25 Mrad per
     second, e.g., greater than about 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, or even greater than
     about 20 Mrad per second, e.g., about 0.25 to 2 Mrad per second. Higher dose rates
     allow a higher throughput for a target (e.g., the desired) dose. Higher dose rates generally
 30  require higher line speeds, to avoid thermal decomposition of the material. In one
     implementation, the accelerator is set for 3 MeV, 50 mA beam current, and the line
     speed is 24 feet/minute, for a sample thickness of about 20 mm (e.g., comminuted corn
     cob material with a bulk density of 0.5 g/cm 3).
             In some embodiments, electron bombardment is performed until the material
 35  receives a total dose of at least 0.1 Mrad, 0.25 Mrad, 1 Mrad, 5 Mrad, e.g., at least 10,
                                                       14

WO 2014/138543                                                              PCT/US2014/021609
     20, 30 or at least 40 Mrad. In some embodiments, the treatment is performed until the
     material receives a dose of from about 10 Mrad to about 50 Mrad, e.g., from about 20
     Mrad to about 40 Mrad, or from about 25 Mrad to about 30 Mrad. In some
     implementations, a total dose of 25 to 35 Mrad is preferred, applied ideally over a couple
  5  of passes, e.g., at 5 Mrad/pass with each pass being applied for about one second.
     Cooling methods, systems and equipment can be used before, during, after and in
     between radiations, for example utilizing a cooling screw conveyor and/or a cooled
     vibratory conveyor.
             Using multiple heads as discussed above, the material can be treated in multiple
 10  passes, for example, two passes at 10 to 20 Mrad/pass, e.g., 12 to 18 Mrad/pass,
     separated by a few seconds of cool-down, or three passes of 7 to 12 Mrad/pass, e.g., 5 to
     20 Mrad/pass, 10 to 40 Mrad/pass, 9 to 11 Mrad/pass. As discussed herein, treating the
     material with several relatively low doses, rather than one high dose, tends to prevent
     overheating of the material and also increases dose uniformity through the thickness of
 15  the material. In some implementations, the material is stirred or otherwise mixed during
     or after each pass and then smoothed into a uniform layer again before the next pass, to
     further enhance treatment uniformity.
             In some embodiments, electrons are accelerated to, for example, a speed of
     greater than 75 percent of the speed of light, e.g., greater than 85, 90, 95, or 99 percent of
 20  the speed of light.
             In some embodiments, any processing described herein occurs on lignocellulosic
     material that remains dry as acquired or that has been dried, e.g., using heat and/or
     reduced pressure. For example, in some embodiments, the cellulosic and/or
     lignocellulosic material has less than about 25 wt. % retained water, measured at 25'C
 25  and at fifty percent relative humidity (e.g., less than about 20 wt.%, less than about 15
     wt.%, less than about 14 wt.%, less than about 13 wt.%, less than about 12 wt.%, less
     than about 10 wt.%, less than about 9 wt.%, less than about 8 wt.%, less than about 7
     wt.%, less than about 6 wt.%, less than about 5 wt.%, less than about 4 wt.%, less than
     about 3 wt.%, less than about 2 wt.%, less than about 1 wt.%, or less than about 0.5
 30  wt.%.
             In some embodiments, two or more ionizing sources can be used, such as two or
     more electron sources. For example, samples can be treated, in any order, with a beam
     of electrons, followed by gamma radiation and UV light having wavelengths from about
     100 nm to about 280 nm. In some embodiments, samples are treated with three ionizing

     The biomass is conveyed through the treatment zone where it can be bombarded with
     electrons.
              It may be advantageous to repeat the treatment to more thoroughly reduce the
     recalcitrance of the biomass and/or further modify the biomass. In particular, the process
  5  parameters can be adjusted after a first (e.g., second, third, fourth or more) pass
     depending on the recalcitrance of the material. In some embodiments, a conveyor can be
     used which includes a circular system where the biomass is conveyed multiple times
     through the various processes described above. In some other embodiments, multiple
     treatment devices (e.g., electron beam generators) are used to treat the biomass multiple
 10  (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more) times. In yet other embodiments, a single electron beam generator
     may be the source of multiple beams (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more beams) that can be used for
     treatment of the biomass.
              The effectiveness in changing the molecular/supermolecular structure and/or
     reducing the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing biomass depends on the
 15  electron energy used and the dose applied, while exposure time depends on the power
     and dose. In some embodiments, the dose rate and total dose are adjusted so as not to
     destroy (e.g., char or bum) the biomass material. For example, the carbohydrates should
     not be damaged in the processing so that they can be released from the biomass intact,
     e.g. as monomeric sugars.
 20           In some embodiments, the treatment (with any electron source or a combination
     of sources) is performed until the material receives a dose of at least about 0.05 Mrad,
     e.g., at least about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60,
     70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 175, or 200 Mrad. In some embodiments, the treatment is
     performed until the material receives a dose of between 0.1-100 Mrad, 1-200, 5-200, 10
 25  200, 5-150, 50-150 Mrad, 5-100, 5-50, 5-40, 10-50, 10-75, 15-50, 20-35 Mrad.
              In some embodiments, relatively low doses of radiation are utilized, e.g., to
     increase the molecular weight of a cellulosic or lignocellulosic material (with any
     radiation source or a combination of sources described herein). For example, a dose of at
     least about 0.05 Mrad, e.g., at least about 0.1 Mrad or at least about 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0,
 30  1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, or at least about 5.0 Mrad. In some embodiments, the
     irradiation is performed until the material receives a dose of between 0. 1Mrad and 2.0
     Mrad, e.g., between 0.5rad and 4.0 Mrad or between 1.0 Mrad and 3.0 Mrad.
     It also can be desirable to irradiate from multiple directions, simultaneously or
     sequentially, in order to achieve a desired degree of penetration of radiation into the
 35  material. For example, depending on the density and moisture content of the material,

     such as wood, and the type of radiation source used (e.g., gamma or electron beam), the
     maximum penetration of radiation into the material may be only about 0.75 inch. In such
     cases, a thicker section (up to 1.5 inch) can be irradiated by first irradiating the material
     from one side, and then turning the material over and irradiating from the other side.
  5  Irradiation from multiple directions can be particularly useful with electron beam
     radiation, which irradiates faster than gamma radiation but typically does not achieve as
     great a penetration depth.
                                RADIATION OPAQUE MATERIALS
 10
              As previously discussed, the invention can include processing the material in a
     vault and/or bunker that is constructed using radiation opaque materials. In some
     implementations, the radiation opaque materials are selected to be capable of shielding
     the components from X-rays with high energy (short wavelength), which can penetrate
 15  many materials. One important factor in designing a radiation shielding enclosure is the
     attenuation length of the materials used, which will determine the required thickness for
     a particular material, blend of materials, or layered structure. The attenuation length is
     the penetration distance at which the radiation is reduced to approximately l/e (e =
     Eulers number) times that of the incident radiation. Although virtually all materials are
 20  radiation opaque if thick enough, materials containing a high compositional percentage
     (e.g., density) of elements that have a high Z value (atomic number) have a shorter
     radiation attenuation length and thus if such materials are used a thinner, lighter
     shielding can be provided. Examples of high Z value materials that are used in radiation
     shielding are tantalum and lead. Another important parameter in radiation shielding is
 25  the halving distance, which is the thickness of a particular material that will reduce
     gamma ray intensity by 50%. As an example for X-ray radiation with an energy of 0.1
     MeV the halving thickness is about 15.1 mm for concrete and about 2.7 mm for lead,
     while with an X-ray energy of 1 MeV the halving thickness for concrete is about 44.45
     mm and for lead is about 7.9 mm. Radiation opaque materials can be materials that are
 30  thick or thin so long as they can reduce the radiation that passes through to the other side.
     Thus, if it is desired that a particular enclosure have a low wall thickness, e.g., for light
     weight or due to size constraints, the material chosen should have a sufficient Z value
     and/or attenuation length so that its halving length is less than or equal to the desired
     wall thickness of the enclosure.
                                                     17

WO 2014/138543                                                              PCT/US2014/021609
              In some cases, the radiation opaque material may be a layered material, for
     example having a layer of a higher Z value material, to provide good shielding, and a
     layer of a lower Z value material to provide other properties (e.g., structural integrity,
     impact resistance, etc.). In some cases, the layered material may be a "graded-Z"
  5  laminate, e.g., including a laminate in which the layers provide a gradient from high-Z
     through successively lower-Z elements. In some cases the radiation opaque materials can
     be interlocking blocks, for example, lead and/or concrete blocks can be supplied by
     NELCO Worldwide (Burlington, MA), and reconfigurable vaults can be utilized.
              A radiation opaque material can reduce the radiation passing through a structure
 10  (e.g., a wall, door, ceiling, enclosure, a series of these or combinations of these) formed
     of the material by about at least about 10 %, (e.g., at least about 20%, at least about 30%,
     at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least
     about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about
     97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, at least about 99.9%, at least about 99.99%,
 15  at least about 99.999%) as compared to the incident radiation. Therefore, an enclosure
     made of a radiation opaque material can reduce the exposure of
     equipment/system/components by the same amount. Radiation opaque materials can
     include stainless steel, metals with Z values above 25 (e.g., lead, iron), concrete, dirt,
     sand and combinations thereof. Radiation opaque materials can include a barrier in the
 20  direction of the incident radiation of at least about 1mm (e.g., 5 mm, 10mm, 5 cm, 10
     cm, 100cm, im, 10m).

 25           The type of radiation determines the kinds of radiation sources used as well as the

              Alpha particles are identical to the nucleus of a helium atom and are produced by
     the alpha decay of various radioactive nuclei, such as isotopes of bismuth, polonium,
     astatine, radon, francium, radium, several actinides, such as actinium, thorium, uranium,
     neptunium, curium, californium, americium, and plutonium.
  5           Sources for ultraviolet radiation include deuterium or cadmium lamps.
              Sources for infrared radiation include sapphire, zinc, or selenide window ceramic
     lamps.
              Sources for microwaves include klystrons, Slevin type RF sources, or atom beam

             Electrons may be produced by radioactive nuclei that undergo beta decay, such as
     isotopes of iodine, cesium, technetium, and iridium. Alternatively, an electron gun can
     be used as an electron source via thermionic emission and accelerated through an
     accelerating potential. An electron gun generates electrons, which are then accelerated
  5  through a large potential (e.g., greater than about 500 thousand, greater than about
     Million, greater than about 2 million, greater than about 5 million, greater than about 6
     million, greater than about 7 million, greater than about 8 million, greater than about 9
     million, or even greater than 10 million volts) and then scanned magnetically in the x-y
     plane, where the electrons are initially accelerated in the z direction down the accelerator
 10  tube and extracted through a foil window. Scanning the electron beams is useful for
     increasing the irradiation surface when irradiating materials, e.g., a biomass, that is
     conveyed through the scanned beam. Scanning the electron beam also distributes the
     thermal load homogenously on the window and helps reduce the foil window rupture due
     to local heating by the electron beam. Window foil rupture is a cause of significant
 15  down-time due to subsequent necessary repairs and re-starting the electron gun.
             Various other irradiating devices may be used in the methods disclosed herein,
     including field ionization sources, electrostatic ion separators, field ionization generators,
     thermionic emission sources, microwave discharge ion sources, recirculating or static
     accelerators, dynamic linear accelerators, van de Graaff accelerators, and folded tandem
 20  accelerators. Such devices are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,931,784 to
     Medoff, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
             A beam of electrons can be used as the radiation source. A beam of electrons has
     the advantages of high dose rates (e.g., 1, 5, or even 10 Mrad per second), high
     throughput, less containment, and less confinement equipment. Electron beams can also
 25  have high electrical efficiency (e.g., 80%), allowing for lower energy usage relative to
     other radiation methods, which can translate into a lower cost of operation and lower
     greenhouse gas emissions corresponding to the smaller amount of energy used. Electron
     beams can be generated, e.g., by electrostatic generators, cascade generators, transformer
     generators, low energy accelerators with a scanning system, low energy accelerators with
 30  a linear cathode, linear accelerators, and pulsed accelerators.
             Electrons can also be more efficient at causing changes in the molecular structure
     of carbohydrate-containing materials, for example, by the mechanism of chain scission.
     In addition, electrons having energies of 0.5-10 MeV can penetrate low density
     materials, such as the biomass materials described herein, e.g., materials having a bulk
 35  density of less than 0.5 g/cm 3 , and a depth of 0.3-10 cm. Electrons as an ionizing

 30  include cost to operate, capital costs, depreciation, and device footprint. Tradeoffs in
     considering exposure dose levels of electron beam irradiation would be energy costs and
     environment, safety, and health (ESH) concerns. Typically, generators are housed in a
     vault, e.g., of lead or concrete, especially for production from X-rays that are generated
     in the process. Tradeoffs in considering electron energies include energy costs.

              The electron beam irradiation device can produce either a fixed beam or a

     Further, available sweep widths of 0.5 m, 1 m, 2 m or more are available. The scanning
  5  beam is preferred in most embodiments described herein because of the larger scan width
     and reduced possibility of local heating and failure of the windows.

 10           The extraction system for an electron accelerator can include two window foils.
     The cooling gas in the two foil window extraction system can be a purge gas or a
     mixture, for example, air, or a pure gas. In one embodiment, the gas is an inert gas such
     as nitrogen, argon, helium and/or carbon dioxide. It is preferred to use a gas rather than
     a liquid since energy losses to the electron beam are minimized. Mixtures of pure gas
 15  can also be used, either pre-mixed or mixed in line prior to impinging on the windows or
     in the space between the windows. The cooling gas can be cooled, for example, by using
     a heat exchange system (e.g., a chiller) and/or by using boil off from a condensed gas
     (e.g., liquid nitrogen, liquid helium). Window foils are described in PCT/US2013/64332

            HEATING AND THROUGHPUT DURING RADIATION TREATMENT
              Several processes can occur in biomass when electrons from an electron beam
     interact with matter in inelastic collisions. For example, ionization of the material, chain
 25  scission of polymers in the material, cross linking of polymers in the material, oxidation
     of the material, generation of X-rays ("Bremsstrahlung") and vibrational excitation of
     molecules (e.g., phonon generation). Without being bound to a particular mechanism, the
     reduction in recalcitrance can be due to several of these inelastic collision effects, for
     example ionization, chain scission of polymers, oxidation and phonon generation. Some
 30  of the effects (e.g., especially X-ray generation), necessitate shielding and engineering
     barriers, for example, enclosing the irradiation processes in a concrete (or other radiation
     opaque material) vault. Another effect of irradiation, vibrational excitation, is equivalent
     to heating up the sample. Heating the sample by irradiation can help in recalcitrance
     reduction, but excessive heating can destroy the material, as will be explained below.

              The adiabatic temperature rise (AT) from adsorption of ionizing radiation is given
     by the equation: AT = D/Cp: where D is the average dose in kGy, Cp is the heat capacity
     in J/g 'C, and AT is the change in temperature in C. A typical dry biomass material will
     have a heat capacity close to 2. Wet biomass will have a higher heat capacity dependent
  5  on the amount of water since the heat capacity of water is very high (4.19 J/g C). Metals
     have much lower heat capacities, for example, 304 stainless steel has a heat capacity of
     0.5 J/g C. The temperature change due to the instant adsorption of radiation in a
     biomass and stainless steel for various doses of radiation is shown in Table 1. At the
     higher temperatures biomass will decompose causing extreme deviation from the
 10  estimated changes in temperature.

              High temperatures can destroy and or modify the biopolymers in biomass so that
 15  the polymers (e.g., cellulose) are unsuitable for further processing. A biomass subjected
     to high temperatures can become dark, sticky and give off odors indicating
     decomposition. The stickiness can even make the material hard to convey. The odors can
     be unpleasant and be a safety issue. In fact, keeping the biomass below about 200 0 C has
     been found to be beneficial in the processes described herein (e.g., below about 190 0 C,
 20  below about 180 0 C, below about 170 0 C, below about 160 0 C, below about 150 0 C, below
     about 140 0 C, below about 130 0 C, below about 120 0 C, below about 1 100 C, between
     about 60 0 C and 180 0 C, between about 60 0 C and 160 0 C, between about 60 0 C and 150 0 C,
     between about 60 0 C and 140 0C, between about 60 0 C and 130 0 C, between about 60 0 C
     and 120 0 C, between about 80 0 C and 180 0 C, between about 100 0 C and 180 0 C, between
 25  about 120 0 C and 180 0 C, between about 140 0 C and 180 0 C, between about 160 0 C and
     180 0 C, between about 100 0 C and 140 0 C, between about 80 0C and 120 0 C).
              It has been found that irradiation above about 10 Mrad is desirable for the
     processes described herein (e.g., reduction of recalcitrance). A high throughput is also
                                                   23

WO 2014/138543                                                             PCT/US2014/021609
     desirable so that the irradiation does not become a bottle neck in processing the biomass.
     The treatment is governed by a Dose rate equation: M = FP/D-time, where M is the mass
     of irradiated material (Kg), F is the fraction of power that is adsorbed (unit less), P is the
     emitted power (kW=Voltage in MeV x Current in mA), time is the treatment time (sec)
  5  and D is the adsorbed dose (kGy). In an exemplary process where the fraction of
     adsorbed power is fixed, the Power emitted is constant and a set dosage is desired, the
     throughput (e.g., M, the biomass processed) can be increased by increasing the
     irradiation time. However, increasing the irradiation time without allowing the material
     to cool, can excessively heat the material as exemplified by the calculations shown
 10  above. Since biomass has a low thermal conductivity (less than about
     0.1 Wm-'K 1), heat dissipation is slow, unlike, for example, metals (greater than about 10
     Wm-'K-1) which can dissipate energy quickly as long as there is a heat sink to transfer
     the energy to.
 15                             ELECTRON GUNS - BEAM STOPS
              In some embodiments, the systems and methods include a beam stop (e.g., a
     shutter). For example, the beam stop can be used to quickly stop or reduce the
     irradiation of material without powering down the electron beam device. Alternatively
 20  the beam stop can be used while powering up the electron beam, e.g., the beam stop can
     stop the electron beam until a beam current of a desired level is achieved. The beam stop
     can be placed between the primary foil window and a secondary foil window. For
     example, the beam stop can be mounted so that it is movable, that is, so that it can be
     moved into and out of the beam path. Even partial coverage of the beam can be used, for
 25  example, to control the dose of irradiation. The beam stop can be mounted to the floor,
     to a conveyor for the biomass, to a wall, to the radiation device (e.g., at the scan horn), or
     to any structural support. Preferably the beam stop is fixed in relation to the scan horn so
     that the beam can be effectively controlled by the beam stop. The beam stop can
     incorporate a hinge, a rail, wheels, slots, or other means allowing for its operation in
 30  moving into and out of the beam. The beam stop can be made of any material that will
     stop at least 5% of the electrons, e.g., at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, at
     least 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or even about
     100% of the electrons.
              The beam stop can be made of a metal including, but not limited to, stainless
 35  steel, lead, iron, molybdenum, silver, gold, titanium, aluminum, tin, or alloys of these, or
                                                     24

WO 2014/138543                                                              PCT/US2014/021609
     laminates (layered materials) made with such metals (e.g., metal-coated ceramic, metal
     coated polymer, metal-coated composite, multilayered metal materials).
             The beam stop can be cooled, for example, with a cooling fluid such as an
     aqueous solution or a gas. The beam stop can be partially or completely hollow, for
  5  example with cavities. Interior spaces of the beam stop can be used for cooling fluids
     and gases. The beam stop can be of any shape, including flat, curved, round, oval,
     square, rectangular, beveled and wedged shapes.
             The beam stop can have perforations so as to allow some electrons through, thus
     controlling (e.g., reducing) the levels of radiation across the whole area of the window,
 10  or in specific regions of the window. The beam stop can be a mesh formed, for example,
     from fibers or wires. Multiple beam stops can be used, together or independently, to
     control the irradiation. The beam stop can be remotely controlled, e.g., by radio signal or
     hard wired to a motor for moving the beam into or out of position.
 15                                         BEAM DUMPS
             The embodiments disclosed herein can also include a beam dump when utilizing
     a radiation treatment. A beam dump's purpose is to safely absorb a beam of charged
     particles. Like a beam stop, a beam dump can be used to block the beam of charged
 20  particles. However, a beam dump is much more robust than a beam stop, and is intended
     to block the full power of the electron beam for an extended period of time. They are
     often used to block the beam as the accelerator is powering up.
             Beam dumps are also designed to accommodate the heat generated by such
     beams, and are usually made from materials such as copper, aluminum, carbon,
 25  beryllium, tungsten, or mercury. Beam dumps can be cooled, for example, using a
     cooling fluid that can be in thermal contact with the beam dump.
                                      BIOMASS MATERIALS
 30          Lignocellulosic materials include, but are not limited to, wood, particle board,
     forestry wastes (e.g., sawdust, aspen wood, wood chips), grasses, (e.g., switchgrass,
     miscanthus, cord grass, reed canary grass), grain residues, (e.g., rice hulls, oat hulls,
     wheat chaff, barley hulls), agricultural waste (e.g., silage, canola straw, wheat straw,
     barley straw, oat straw, rice straw, jute, hemp, flax, bamboo, sisal, abaca, corn cobs, corn
 35  stover, soybean stover, corn fiber, alfalfa, hay, coconut hair), sugar processing residues

WO 2014/138543                                                               PCT/US2014/021609
     (e.g., bagasse, beet pulp, agave bagasse), algae, seaweed, manure, sewage, and mixtures
     of any of these.
              In some cases, the lignocellulosic material includes corncobs. Ground or
     hammermilled corncobs can be spread in a layer of relatively uniform thickness for
  5  irradiation, and after irradiation are easy to disperse in the medium for further
     processing. To facilitate harvest and collection, in some cases the entire corn plant is
     used, including the corn stalk, corn kernels, and in some cases even the root system of
     the plant.
              Advantageously, no additional nutrients (other than a nitrogen source, e.g., urea
 10  or ammonia) are required during fermentation of corncobs or cellulosic or lignocellulosic
     materials containing significant amounts of corncobs.
              Corncobs, before and after comminution, are also easier to convey and disperse,
     and have a lesser tendency to form explosive mixtures in air than other cellulosic or
     lignocellulosic materials such as hay and grasses.
 15           Cellulosic materials include, for example, paper, paper products, paper waste,
     paper pulp, pigmented papers, loaded papers, coated papers, filled papers, magazines,
     printed matter (e.g., books, catalogs, manuals, labels, calendars, greeting cards,
     brochures, prospectuses, newsprint), printer paper, polycoated paper, card stock,
     cardboard, paperboard, materials having a high a-cellulose content such as cotton, and
 20  mixtures of any of these. For example, paper products as described in U.S. App. No.
     13/396,365 ("Magazine Feedstocks" by Medoff et al., filed February 14, 2012), the full
     disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
              Cellulosic materials can also include lignocellulosic materials which have been
     partially or fully de-lignified.
 25           In some instances other biomass materials can be utilized, for example starchy
     materials. Starchy materials include starch itself, e.g., corn starch, wheat starch, potato
     starch or rice starch, a derivative of starch, or a material that includes starch, such as an
     edible food product or a crop. For example, the starchy material can be arracacha,
     buckwheat, banana, barley, cassava, kudzu, ocra, sago, sorghum, regular household
 30  potatoes, sweet potato, taro, yams, or one or more beans, such as favas, lentils or peas.
     Blends of any two or more starchy materials are also starchy materials. Mixtures of
     starchy, cellulosic and or lignocellulosic materials can also be used. For example, a
     biomass can be an entire plant, a part of a plant or different parts of a plant, e.g., a wheat
     plant, cotton plant, a corn plant, rice plant or a tree. The starchy materials can be treated
 35  by any of the methods described herein.

              Microbial materials that can be used as feedstock can include, but are not limited
     to, any naturally occurring or genetically modified microorganism or organism that
     contains or is capable of providing a source of carbohydrates (e.g., cellulose), for
     example, protists, e.g., animal protists (e.g., protozoa such as flagellates, amoeboids,
  5  ciliates, and sporozoa) and plant protists (e.g., algae such alveolates,
     chlorarachniophytes, cryptomonads, euglenids, glaucophytes, haptophytes, red algae,
     stramenopiles, and viridaeplantae). Other examples include seaweed, plankton (e.g.,
     macroplankton, mesoplankton, microplankton, nanoplankton, picoplankton, and
     femptoplankton), phytoplankton, bacteria (e.g., gram positive bacteria, gram negative
 10  bacteria, and extremophiles), yeast and/or mixtures of these. In some instances,
     microbial biomass can be obtained from natural sources, e.g., the ocean, lakes, bodies of
     water, e.g., salt water or fresh water, or on land. Alternatively or in addition, microbial
     biomass can be obtained from culture systems, e.g., large scale dry and wet culture and
     fermentation systems.
 15           In other embodiments, the biomass materials, such as cellulosic, starchy and
     lignocellulosic feedstock materials, can be obtained from transgenic microorganisms and
     plants that have been modified with respect to a wild type variety. Such modifications
     may be, for example, through the iterative steps of selection and breeding to obtain
     desired traits in a plant. Furthermore, the plants can have had genetic material removed,
 20  modified, silenced and/or added with respect to the wild type variety. For example,
     genetically modified plants can be produced by recombinant DNA methods, where
     genetic modifications include introducing or modifying specific genes from parental
     varieties, or, for example, by using transgenic breeding wherein a specific gene or genes
     are introduced to a plant from a different species of plant and/or bacteria. Another way
 25  to create genetic variation is through mutation breeding wherein new alleles are
     artificially created from endogenous genes. The artificial genes can be created by a
     variety of ways including treating the plant or seeds with, for example, chemical
     mutagens (e.g., using alkylating agents, epoxides, alkaloids, peroxides, formaldehyde),
     irradiation (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, beta particles, alpha particles, protons,
 30  deuterons, UV radiation) and temperature shocking or other external stressing and
     subsequent selection techniques. Other methods of providing modified genes is through
     error prone PCR and DNA shuffling followed by insertion of the desired modified DNA
     into the desired plant or seed. Methods of introducing the desired genetic variation in the
     seed or plant include, for example, the use of a bacterial carrier, biolistics, calcium
 35  phosphate precipitation, electroporation, gene splicing, gene silencing, lipofection,
                                                    27

 20  amines, polycarboxylic acids, polylactic acids, polyvinyl alcohols, polyanhydrides, poly
     fluoro carbons (e.g., TEFLONTM), silicons (e.g., silicone rubber), polysilanes, poly ethers

     polymerization, metathesis polymerization, ring opening polymerization, graft
     polymerization, addition polymerization. In some cases the treatments disclosed herein
     can be used, for example, for radically initiated graft polymerization and cross linking.
 30  Composites of polymers, for example with glass, metals, biomass (e.g., fibers, particles),

         BIOMASS MATERIAL PREPARATION - MECHANICAL TREATMENTS
 10
             The biomass can be in a dry form, for example, with less than about 35%
     moisture content (e.g., less than about 20 %,less than about 15 %,less than about 10 %
     less than about 5 %, less than about 4%, less than about 3 %,less than about 2 % or
     even less than about 1 %). The biomass can also be delivered in a wet state, for example,
 15  as a wet solid, a slurry or a suspension with at least about 10 wt.% solids (e.g., at least
     about 20 wt.%, at least about 30 wt. %, at least about 40 wt.%, at least about 50 wt.%, at
     least about 60 wt.%, at least about 70 wt.%).
             The processes disclosed herein can utilize low bulk density materials, for
     example cellulosic or lignocellulosic feedstocks that have been physically pretreated to
 20  have a bulk density of less than about 0.75 g/cm 3, e.g., less than about 0.7, 0.65, 0.60,
     0.50, 0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05 or less, e.g., less than about 0.025 g/cm 3. Bulk
     density is determined using ASTM D1895B. Briefly, the method involves filling a
     measuring cylinder of known volume with a sample and obtaining a weight of the
     sample. The bulk density is calculated by dividing the weight of the sample in grams by
 25  the known volume of the cylinder in cubic centimeters. If desired, low bulk density
     materials can be densified, for example, by methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,971,809
     published July 5, 2011, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by
     reference.
             In some cases, the pre-treatment processing includes screening of the biomass
 30  material. Screening can be through a mesh or perforated plate with a desired opening
     size, for example, less than about 6.35 mm (1/4 inch, 0.25 inch), (e.g., less than about
     3.18 mm (1/8 inch, 0.125 inch), less than about 1.59 mm (1/16 inch, 0.0625 inch), is less
     than about 0.79 mm (1/32 inch, 0.03125 inch), e.g., less than about 0.51 mm (1/50 inch,
     0.02000 inch), less than about 0.40 mm (1/64 inch, 0.015625 inch), less than about 0.23
 35  mm (0.009 inch), less than about 0.20 mm (1/128 inch, 0.0078125 inch), less than about
                                                    29

WO 2014/138543                                                              PCT/US2014/021609
     0.18 mm (0.007 inch), less than about 0.13 mm (0.005 inch), or even less than about 0.10
     mm (1/256 inch, 0.00390625 inch)). In one configuration the desired biomass falls
     through the perforations or screen and thus biomass larger than the perforations or screen
     are not irradiated. These larger materials can be re-processed, for example by
  5  comminuting, or they can simply be removed from processing. In another configuration
     material that is larger than the perforations is irradiated and the smaller material is
     removed by the screening process or recycled. In this kind of a configuration, the
     conveyor, such as a vibratory conveyor, itself (for example, a part of the conveyor) can
     be perforated or made with a mesh. For example, in one particular embodiment the
 10  biomass material may be wet and the perforations or mesh allow water to drain away
     from the biomass before irradiation.
              Screening of material can also be by a manual method, for example by an
     operator or mechanoid (e.g., a robot equipped with a color, reflectivity or other sensor)
     that removes unwanted material. Screening can also be by magnetic screening wherein a
 15  magnet is disposed near the conveyed material and the magnetic material is removed
     magnetically.
              Optional pre-treatment processing can include heating the material. For example,
     a portion of a conveyor conveying the biomass or other material can be sent through a
     heated zone. The heated zone can be created, for example, by IR radiation, microwaves,
 20  combustion (e.g., gas, coal, oil, biomass), resistive heating and/or inductive coils. The
     heat can be applied from at least one side or more than one side, can be continuous or
     periodic and can be for only a portion of the material or all the material. For example, a
     portion of the conveying trough can be heated by use of a heating jacket. Heating can
     be, for example, for the purpose of drying the material. In the case of drying the
 25  material, this can also be facilitated, with or without heating, by the movement of a gas
     (e.g., air, oxygen, nitrogen, He, C0 2 , Argon) over and/or through the biomass as it is
     being conveyed.
              Optionally, pre-treatment processing can include cooling the material. Cooling
     material is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,900,857 published March 8, 2011, the disclosure
 30  of which in incorporated herein by reference. For example, cooling can be by supplying
     a cooling fluid, for example water (e.g., with glycerol), or nitrogen (e.g., liquid nitrogen)
     to the bottom of the conveying trough. Alternatively, a cooling gas, for example, chilled
     nitrogen can be blown over the biomass materials or under the conveying system.
              Another optional pre-treatment processing method can include adding a material
 35  to the biomass or other feedstocks. The additional material can be added by, for

     example, by showering, sprinkling and/or pouring the material onto the biomass as it is
     conveyed. Materials that can be added include, for example, metals, ceramics and/or
     ions as described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0105119 Al (filed October 26, 2009) and
     U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0159569 Al (filed December 16, 2009), the entire disclosures
  5  of which are incorporated herein by reference. Optional materials that can be added
     include acids and bases. Other materials that can be added are oxidants (e.g., peroxides,
     chlorates), polymers, polymerizable monomers (e.g., containing unsaturated bonds),
     water, catalysts, enzymes and/or organisms. Materials can be added, for example, in
     pure form, as a solution in a solvent (e.g., water or an organic solvent) and/or as a
 10  solution. In some cases the solvent is volatile and can be made to evaporate e.g., by
     heating and/or blowing gas as previously described. The added material may form a
     uniform coating on the biomass or be a homogeneous mixture of different components
     (e.g., biomass and additional material). The added material can modulate the subsequent
     irradiation step by increasing the efficiency of the irradiation, damping the irradiation or
 15  changing the effect of the irradiation (e.g., from electron beams to X-rays or heat). The
     method may have no impact on the irradiation but may be useful for further downstream
     processing. The added material may help in conveying the material, for example, by
     lowering dust levels.
              Biomass can be delivered to conveyor (e.g., vibratory conveyors that can be used
 20  in the vaults herein described) by a belt conveyor, a pneumatic conveyor, a screw
     conveyor, a hopper, a pipe, manually or by a combination of these. The biomass can, for
     example, be dropped, poured and/or placed onto the conveyor by any of these methods.
     In some embodiments the material is delivered to the conveyor using an enclosed
     material distribution system to help maintain a low oxygen atmosphere and/or control
 25  dust and fines. Lofted or air suspended biomass fines and dust are undesirable because
     these can form an explosion hazard or damage the window foils of an electron gun (if
     such a device is used for treating the material).
              The material can be leveled to form a uniform thickness between about 0.0312
     and 5 inches (e.g., between about 0.0625 and 2.000 inches, between about 0.125 and 1
 30  inches, between about 0.125 and 0.5 inches, between about 0.3 and 0.9 inches, between
     about 0.2 and 0.5 inches between about 0.25 and 1.0 inches, between about 0.25 and 0.5

              Generally, it is preferred to convey the material as quickly as possible through the
     electron beam to maximize throughput. For example, the material can be conveyed at
  5  rates of at least 1 ft/min, e.g., at least 2 ft/min, at least 3 ft/min, at least 4 ft/min, at least 5
     ft/min, at least 10 ft/min, at least 15 ft/min, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 ft/min. The rate of
     conveying is related to the beam current, for example, for a          inch thick biomass and
     100 mA, the conveyor can move at about 20 ft/min to provide a useful irradiation
     dosage, at 50 mA the conveyor can move at about 10 ft/min to provide approximately the
 10  same irradiation dosage.
              After the biomass material has been conveyed through the radiation zone,
     optional post-treatment processing can be done. The optional post-treatment processing
     can, for example, be a process described with respect to the pre-irradiation processing.
     For example, the biomass can be screened, heated, cooled, and/or combined with
 15  additives. Uniquely to post-irradiation, quenching of the radicals can occur, for example,
     quenching of radicals by the addition of fluids or gases (e.g., oxygen, nitrous oxide,
     ammonia, liquids), using pressure, heat, and/or the addition of radical scavengers. For
     example, the biomass can be conveyed out of the enclosed conveyor and exposed to a
     gas (e.g., oxygen) where it is quenched, forming carboxylated groups. In one
 20  embodiment the biomass is exposed during irradiation to the reactive gas or fluid.
     Quenching of biomass that has been irradiated is described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,083,906
     published Dec. 27, 2011, the entire disclosure of which is incorporate herein by
     reference.
              If desired, one or more mechanical treatments can be used in addition to
 25  irradiation to further reduce the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing material.
     These processes can be applied before, during and or after irradiation.
              In some cases, the mechanical treatment may include an initial preparation of the
     feedstock as received, e.g., size reduction of materials, such as by comminution, e.g.,
     cutting, grinding, shearing, pulverizing or chopping. For example, in some cases, loose
 30  feedstock (e.g., recycled paper, starchy materials, or switchgrass) is prepared by shearing
     or shredding. Mechanical treatment may reduce the bulk density of the carbohydrate
     containing material, increase the surface area of the carbohydrate-containing material
     and/or decrease one or more dimensions of the carbohydrate-containing material.
              Alternatively, or in addition, the feedstock material can be treated with another
 35  treatment, for example chemical treatments, such as with an acid (HCl, H 2SO 4 , H 3PO 4 ), a
                                                      32

WO 2014/138543                                                              PCT/US2014/021609
     base (e.g., KOH and NaOH), a chemical oxidant (e.g., peroxides, chlorates, ozone),
     irradiation, steam explosion, pyrolysis, sonication, oxidation, chemical treatment. The
     treatments can be in any order and in any sequence and combinations. For example, the
     feedstock material can first be physically treated by one or more treatment methods, e.g.,
  5  chemical treatment including and in combination with acid hydrolysis (e.g., utilizing
     HCl, H 2SO 4, H 3PO4), radiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion, and
     then mechanically treated. This sequence can be advantageous since materials treated by
     one or more of the other treatments, e.g., irradiation or pyrolysis, tend to be more brittle
     and, therefore, it may be easier to further change the structure of the material by
 10  mechanical treatment. As another example, a feedstock material can be conveyed
     through ionizing radiation using a conveyor as described herein and then mechanically
     treated. Chemical treatment can remove some or all of the lignin (for example chemical
     pulping) and can partially or completely hydrolyze the material. The methods also can
     be used with pre-hydrolyzed material. The methods also can be used with material that
 15  has not been pre hydrolyzed. The methods can be used with mixtures of hydrolyzed and
     non-hydrolyzed materials, for example with about 50% or more non-hydrolyzed
     material, with about 60% or more non- hydrolyzed material, with about 70% or more
     non-hydrolyzed material, with about 80% or more non-hydrolyzed material or even with
     90% or more non-hydrolyzed material.
 20           In addition to size reduction, which can be performed initially and/or later in
     processing, mechanical treatment can also be advantageous for "opening up,"
     "stressing," breaking or shattering the carbohydrate-containing materials, making the
     cellulose of the materials more susceptible to chain scission and/or disruption of
     crystalline structure during the physical treatment.
 25           Methods of mechanically treating the carbohydrate-containing material include,
     for example, milling or grinding. Milling may be performed using, for example, a
     hammer mill, ball mill, colloid mill, conical or cone mill, disk mill, edge mill, Wiley
     mill, grist mill or other mill. Grinding may be performed using, for example, a
     cutting/impact type grinder. Some exemplary grinders include stone grinders, pin
 30  grinders, coffee grinders, and burr grinders. Grinding or milling may be provided, for
     example, by a reciprocating pin or other element, as is the case in a pin mill. Other
     mechanical treatment methods include mechanical ripping or tearing, other methods that
     apply pressure to the fibers, and air attrition milling. Suitable mechanical treatments
                                                    33

WO 2014/138543                                                                PCT/US2014/021609
     further include any other technique that continues the disruption of the internal structure
     of the material that was initiated by the previous processing steps.
              Mechanical feed preparation systems can be configured to produce streams with
     specific characteristics such as, for example, specific maximum sizes, specific length-to
  5  width, or specific surface areas ratios. Physical preparation can increase the rate of
     reactions, improve the movement of material on a conveyor, improve the irradiation
     profile of the material, improve the radiation uniformity of the material, or reduce the
     processing time required by opening up the materials and making them more accessible
     to processes and/or reagents, such as reagents in a solution.
 10           The bulk density of feedstocks can be controlled (e.g., increased). In some
     situations, it can be desirable to prepare a low bulk density material, e.g., by densifying
     the material (e.g., densification can make it easier and less costly to transport to another
     site) and then reverting the material to a lower bulk density state (e.g., after transport).
     The material can be densified, for example from less than about 0.2 g/cc to more than
 15  about 0.9 g/cc (e.g., less than about 0.3 to more than about 0.5 g/cc, less than about 0.3 to
     more than about 0.9 g/cc, less than about 0.5 to more than about 0.9 g/cc, less than about
     0.3 to more than about 0.8 g/cc, less than about 0.2 to more than about 0.5 g/cc). For
     example, the material can be densified by the methods and equipment disclosed in U.S.
     Pat. No. 7,932,065 to Medoff and International Publication No. WO 2008/073186
 20  (which was filed October 26, 2007, was published in English, and which designated the
     United States), the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
     Densified materials can be processed by any of the methods described herein, or any
     material processed by any of the methods described herein can be subsequently
     densified.
 25           In some embodiments, the material to be processed is in the form of a fibrous
     material that includes fibers provided by shearing a fiber source. For example, the
     shearing can be performed with a rotary knife cutter.
              For example, a fiber source, e.g., that is recalcitrant or that has had its
     recalcitrance level reduced, can be sheared, e.g., in a rotary knife cutter, to provide a first
 30  fibrous material. The first fibrous material is passed through a first screen, e.g., having
     an average opening size of 1.59 mm or less (1/16 inch, 0.0625 inch), provide a second
     fibrous material. If desired, the fiber source can be cut prior to the shearing, e.g., with a
     shredder. For example, when a paper is used as the fiber source, the paper can be first
     cut into strips that are, e.g., 1/4- to 1/2-inch wide, using a shredder, e.g., a counter
 35  rotating screw shredder, such as those manufactured by Munson (Utica, N.Y.). As an
                                                      34

     alternative to shredding, the paper can be reduced in size by cutting to a desired size
     using a guillotine cutter. For example, the guillotine cutter can be used to cut the paper
     into sheets that are, e.g., 10 inches wide by 12 inches long.
              In some embodiments, the shearing of the fiber source and the passing of the
  5  resulting first fibrous material through a first screen are performed concurrently. The
     shearing and the passing can also be performed in a batch-type process.
              For example, a rotary knife cutter can be used to concurrently shear the fiber
     source and screen the first fibrous material. A rotary knife cutter includes a hopper that
     can be loaded with a shredded fiber source prepared by shredding a fiber source.
 10           In some implementations, the feedstock is physically treated prior to
     saccharification and/or fermentation. Physical treatment processes can include one or
     more of any of those described herein, such as mechanical treatment, chemical treatment,
     irradiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion. Treatment methods can
     be used in combinations of two, three, four, or even all of these technologies (in any
 15  order). When more than one treatment method is used, the methods can be applied at the
     same time or at different times. Other processes that change a molecular structure of a
     biomass feedstock may also be used, alone or in combination with the processes
     disclosed herein.
              Mechanical treatments that may be used, and the characteristics of the
 20  mechanically treated carbohydrate-containing materials, are described in further detail in

 25
              If desired, one or more sonication, pyrolysis, oxidative, or steam explosion
     processes can be used instead of or in addition to irradiation to reduce or further reduce
     the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing material. For example, these processes
     can be applied before, during and or after irradiation. These processes are described in
 30  detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,932,065 to Medoff, the full disclosure of which is incorporated

                                INTERMEDIATES AND PRODUCTS
              Using the processes described herein, the biomass material can be converted to
  5  one or more products, such as energy, fuels, foods and materials. For example,
     intermediates and products such as organic acids, salts of organic acids, anhydrides,
     esters of organic acids and fuels, e.g., fuels for internal combustion engines or feedstocks
     for fuel cells can be produced. Systems and processes are described herein that can use
     as feedstock cellulosic and/or lignocellulosic materials that are readily available, but
 10  often can be difficult to process, e.g., municipal waste streams and waste paper streams,
     such as streams that include newspaper, Kraft paper, corrugated paper or mixtures of
     these.
              Specific examples of products include, but are not limited to, hydrogen, sugars
     (e.g., glucose, xylose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, fructose, disaccharides,
 15  oligosaccharides and polysaccharides), alcohols (e.g., monohydric alcohols or dihydric
     alcohols, such as ethanol, n-propanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol or n-butanol),
     hydrated or hydrous alcohols (e.g., containing greater than 10%, 20%, 30% or even
     greater than 40% water), biodiesel, organic acids, hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane,
     propane, isobutene, pentane, n-hexane, biodiesel, bio-gasoline and mixtures thereof), co
 20  products (e.g., proteins, such as cellulolytic proteins (enzymes) or single cell proteins),
     and mixtures of any of these in any combination or relative concentration, and optionally
     in combination with any additives (e.g., fuel additives). Other examples include
     carboxylic acids, salts of a carboxylic acid, a mixture of carboxylic acids and salts of
     carboxylic acids and esters of carboxylic acids (e.g., methyl, ethyl and n-propyl esters),
 25  ketones (e.g., acetone), aldehydes (e.g., acetaldehyde), alpha and beta unsaturated acids
     (e.g., acrylic acid) and olefins (e.g., ethylene). Other alcohols and alcohol derivatives
     include propanol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-propanediol, sugar alcohols (e.g.,
     erythritol, glycol, glycerol, sorbitol threitol, arabitol, ribitol, mannitol, dulcitol, fucitol,
     iditol, isomalt, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol and other polyols), and methyl or ethyl esters of
 30  any of these alcohols. Other products include methyl acrylate, methylmethacrylate, D
     lactic acid, L-lactic acid, pyruvic acid, poly lactic acid, citric acid, formic acid, acetic
     acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, succinic acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, 3
     hydroxypropionic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, glutaric
     acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, glycolic acid, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, and mixtures
 35  thereof, salts of any of these acids, mixtures of any of the acids and their respective salts.

             Any combination of the above products with each other, and/or of the above
     products with other products, which other products may be made by the processes
     described herein or otherwise, may be packaged together and sold as products. The
     products may be combined, e.g., mixed, blended or co-dissolved, or may simply be
  5  packaged or sold together.
             Any of the products or combinations of products described herein may be
     sanitized or sterilized prior to selling the products, e.g., after purification or isolation or
     even after packaging, to neutralize one or more potentially undesirable contaminants that
     could be present in the product(s). Such sanitation can be done with electron
 10  bombardment, for example, by at a dosage of less than about 20 Mrad, e.g., from about
     0.1 to 15 Mrad, from about 0.5 to 7 Mrad, or from about 1 to 3 Mrad.
             The processes described herein can produce various by-product streams useful
     for generating steam and electricity to be used in other parts of the plant (co-generation)
     or sold on the open market. For example, steam generated from burning by-product
 15  streams can be used in a distillation process. As another example, electricity generated
     from burning by-product streams can be used to power electron beam generators used in
     pretreatment.
             The by-products used to generate steam and electricity are derived from a number
     of sources throughout the process. For example, anaerobic digestion of wastewater can
 20  produce a biogas high in methane and a small amount of waste biomass (sludge). As
     another example, post-saccharification and/or post-distillate solids (e.g., unconverted
     lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose remaining from the pretreatment and primary
     processes) can be used, e.g., burned, as a fuel.
             Other intermediates and products, including food and pharmaceutical products,
 25  are described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0124583 Al, published May 20, 2010, to

                                   LIGNIN DERIVED PRODUCTS
 30          The spent biomass (e.g., spent lignocellulosic material) from lignocellulosic
     processing by the methods described are expected to have a high lignin content and in
     addition to being useful for producing energy through combustion in a Co-Generation
     plant, may have uses as other valuable products. For example, the lignin can be used as
     captured as a plastic, or it can be synthetically upgraded to other plastics. In some
                                                     37

WO 2014/138543                                                              PCT/US2014/021609
     instances, it can also be converted to lignosulfonates, which can be utilized as binders,
     dispersants, emulsifiers or as sequestrants.
              When used as a binder, the lignin or a lignosulfonate can, e.g., be utilized in coal
     briquettes, in ceramics, for binding carbon black, for binding fertilizers and herbicides,
  5  as a dust suppressant, in the making of plywood and particle board, for binding animal
     feeds, as a binder for fiberglass, as a binder in linoleum paste and as a soil stabilizer.
              When used as a dispersant, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g.,
     concrete mixes, clay and ceramics, dyes and pigments, leather tanning and in gypsum
     board.
 10           When used as an emulsifier, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g., in
     asphalt, pigments and dyes, pesticides and wax emulsions.
              When used as a sequestrant, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g., in
     micro-nutrient systems, cleaning compounds and water treatment systems, e.g., for boiler
     and cooling systems.
 15           For energy production lignin generally has a higher energy content than
     holocellulose (cellulose and hemicellulose) since it contains more carbon than
     homocellulose. For example, dry lignin can have an energy content of between about
     11,000 and 12,500 BTU per pound, compared to 7,000 an 8,000 BTU per pound of
     holocellulose. As such, lignin can be densified and converted into briquettes and pellets
 20  for burning. For example, the lignin can be converted into pellets by any method
     described herein. For a slower burning pellet or briquette, the lignin can be crosslinked,
     such as applying a radiation dose of between about 0.5 Mrad and 5 Mrad. Crosslinking
     can make a slower burning form factor. The form factor, such as a pellet or briquette,
     can be converted to a "synthetic coal" or charcoal by pyrolyzing in the absence of air,
 25  e.g., at between 400 and 950 'C. Prior to pyrolyzing, it can be desirable to crosslink the
     lignin to maintain structural integrity.
                                       SACCHARIFICATION
 30           In order to convert the feedstock to a form that can be readily processed the
     glucan- or xylan-containing cellulose in the feedstock can be hydrolyzed to low
     molecular weight carbohydrates, such as sugars, by a saccharifying agent, e.g., an
     enzyme or acid, a process referred to as saccharification. The low molecular weight
     carbohydrates can then be used, for example, in an existing manufacturing plant, such as
                                                   38

WO 2014/138543                                                              PCT/US2014/021609
     a single cell protein plant, an enzyme manufacturing plant, or a fuel plant, e.g., an
     ethanol manufacturing facility.
              The feedstock can be hydrolyzed using an enzyme, e.g., by combining the
     materials and the enzyme in a solvent, e.g., in an aqueous solution.
  5           Alternatively, the enzymes can be supplied by organisms that break down
     biomass, such as the cellulose and/or the lignin portions of the biomass, contain or
     manufacture various cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases), ligninases or various small
     molecule biomass-degrading metabolites. These enzymes may be a complex of enzymes
     that act synergistically to degrade crystalline cellulose or the lignin portions of biomass.
 10  Examples of cellulolytic enzymes include: endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and
     cellobiases (beta-glucosidases).
              During saccharification a cellulosic substrate can be initially hydrolyzed by
     endoglucanases at random locations producing oligomeric intermediates. These
     intermediates are then substrates for exo-splitting glucanases such as cellobiohydrolase
 15  to produce cellobiose from the ends of the cellulose polymer. Cellobiose is a water
     soluble 1,4-linked dimer of glucose. Finally, cellobiase cleaves cellobiose to yield
     glucose. The efficiency (e.g., time to hydrolyze and/or completeness of hydrolysis) of
     this process depends on the recalcitrance of the cellulosic material.
              Therefore, the treated biomass materials can be saccharified, by combining the
 20  material and a cellulase enzyme in a fluid medium, e.g., an aqueous solution. In some
     cases, the material is boiled, steeped, or cooked in hot water prior to saccharification, as
     described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2012/0100577 Al by Medoff and Masterman, published
     on April 26, 2012, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein.
              The saccharification process can be partially or completely performed in a tank
 25  (e.g., a tank having a volume of at least 4000, 40,000, or 500,000 L) in a manufacturing
     plant, and/or can be partially or completely performed in transit, e.g., in a rail car, tanker
     truck, or in a supertanker or the hold of a ship. The time required for complete
     saccharification will depend on the process conditions and the carbohydrate-containing
     material and enzyme used. If saccharification is performed in a manufacturing plant
 30  under controlled conditions, the cellulose may be substantially entirely converted to
     sugar, e.g., glucose in about 12-96 hours. If saccharification is performed partially or
     completely in transit, saccharification may take longer.
              It is generally preferred that the tank contents be mixed during saccharification,
     e.g., using jet mixing as described in International App. No. PCT/US2010/035331, filed
                                                     39

     United States, the full disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.
             The addition of surfactants can enhance the rate of saccharification. Examples of
     surfactants include non-ionic surfactants, such as a Tween@ 20 or Tween 80
  5  polyethylene glycol surfactants, ionic surfactants, or amphoteric surfactants.
             It is generally preferred that the concentration of the sugar solution resulting from
     saccharification be relatively high, e.g., greater than 40%, or greater than 50, 60, 70, 80,
     90 or even greater than 95% by weight. Water may be removed, e.g., by evaporation, to
     increase the concentration of the sugar solution. This reduces the volume to be shipped,
 10  and also inhibits microbial growth in the solution.
             Alternatively, sugar solutions of lower concentrations may be used, in which case
     it may be desirable to add an antimicrobial additive, e.g., a broad spectrum antibiotic, in
     a low concentration, e.g., 50 to 150 ppm. Other suitable antibiotics include amphotericin
     B, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, hygromycin B, kanamycin,
 15  neomycin, penicillin, puromycin, streptomycin. Antibiotics will inhibit growth of
     microorganisms during transport and storage, and can be used at appropriate
     concentrations, e.g., between 15 and 1000 ppm by weight, e.g., between 25 and 500 ppm,
     or between 50 and 150 ppm. If desired, an antibiotic can be included even if the sugar
     concentration is relatively high. Alternatively, other additives with anti-microbial of
 20  preservative properties may be used. Preferably the antimicrobial additive(s) are food
     grade.
             A relatively high concentration solution can be obtained by limiting the amount
     of water added to the carbohydrate-containing material with the enzyme. The
     concentration can be controlled, e.g., by controlling how much saccharification takes
 25  place. For example, concentration can be increased by adding more carbohydrate
     containing material to the solution. In order to keep the sugar that is being produced in
     solution, a surfactant can be added, e.g., one of those discussed above. Solubility can
     also be increased by increasing the temperature of the solution. For example, the
     solution can be maintained at a temperature of 40-50'C, 60-80'C, or even higher.

                                          FERMENTATION
 15
              Yeast and Zymomonas bacteria, for example, can be used for fermentation or
     conversion of sugar(s) to alcohol(s). Other microorganisms are discussed below. The
     optimum pH for fermentations is about pH 4 to 7. For example, the optimum pH for
     yeast is from about pH 4 to 5, while the optimum pH for Zymomonas is from about pH 5
 20  to 6. Typical fermentation times are about 24 to 168 hours (e.g., 24 to 96 hrs) with
     temperatures in the range of 20'C to 40'C (e.g., 260 C to 40'C); however thermophilic
     microorganisms prefer higher temperatures.
              In some embodiments, e.g., when anaerobic organisms are used, at least a portion
     of the fermentation is conducted in the absence of oxygen, e.g., under a blanket of an
 25  inert gas such as N 2, Ar, He, CO 2 or mixtures thereof. Additionally, the mixture may
     have a constant purge of an inert gas flowing through the tank during part of or all of the
     fermentation. In some cases, anaerobic conditions can be achieved or maintained by
     carbon dioxide production during the fermentation and no additional inert gas is needed.
              In some embodiments, all or a portion of the fermentation process can be
 30  interrupted before the low molecular weight sugar is completely converted to a product
     (e.g., ethanol). The intermediate fermentation products include sugar and carbohydrates
     in high concentrations. The sugars and carbohydrates can be isolated via any means
     known in the art. These intermediate fermentation products can be used in preparation of
     food for human or animal consumption. Additionally or alternatively, the intermediate
 35  fermentation products can be ground to a fine particle size in a stainless-steel laboratory

 15
              After fermentation, the resulting fluids can be distilled using, for example, a
     "beer column" to separate ethanol and other alcohols from the majority of water and
     residual solids. The vapor exiting the beer column can be, e.g., 35% by weight ethanol
     and can be fed to a rectification column. A mixture of nearly azeotropic (92.5%) ethanol
 20  and water from the rectification column can be purified to pure (99.5%) ethanol using
     vapor-phase molecular sieves. The beer column bottoms can be sent to the first effect of
     a three-effect evaporator. The rectification column reflux condenser can provide heat for
     this first effect. After the first effect, solids can be separated using a centrifuge and dried
     in a rotary dryer. A portion (25%) of the centrifuge effluent can be recycled to
 25  fermentation and the rest sent to the second and third evaporator effects. Most of the
     evaporator condensate can be returned to the process as fairly clean condensate with a
     small portion split off to waste water treatment to prevent build-up of low-boiling
     compounds.

 15
              Various conveying systems can be used to convey the biomass material, for
     example, as discussed, to a vault, and under an electron beam in a vault. Exemplary
     conveyors are belt conveyors, pneumatic conveyors, screw conveyors, carts, trains, trains
     or carts on rails, elevators, front loaders, backhoes, cranes, various scrapers and shovels,
 20  trucks, and throwing devices can be used. For example, vibratory conveyors can be used
     in various processes described herein. Vibratory conveyors are described in
     PCT/US2013/64289 filed October 10, 2013 the full disclosure of which is incorporated
     by reference herein.
              Vibratory conveyors are particularly useful for spreading the material and
 25  producing a uniform layer on the conveyor trough surface. For example the initial
     feedstock can form a pile of material that can be at least four feet high (e.g., at least
     about 3 feet, at least about 2 feet, at least about 1 foot, at least about 6 inches, at least
     about 5 inches, at least about, 4 inches, at least about 3 inches, at least about 2 inches, at
     least about 1 inch, at least about     inch) and spans less than the width of the conveyor
 30  (e.g., less than about 10%, less than about 20%, less than about 30%, less than about
     40%, less than about 50%, less than about 60%, less than about 70%, less than about
     80%, less than about 90%, less than about 95%, less than about 99%). The vibratory
     conveyor can spread the material to span the entire width of the conveyor trough and
     have a uniform thickness, preferably as discussed above. In some cases, an additional
 35  spreading method can be useful. For example, a spreader such as a broadcast spreader, a
                                                     46

WO 2014/138543                                                                   PCT/US2014/021609
     drop spreader (e.g., a CHRISTY SPREADERT M) or combinations thereof can be used to
     drop (e.g., place, pour, spill and/or sprinkle) the feedstock over a wide area. Optionally,
     the spreader can deliver the biomass as a wide shower or curtain onto the vibratory
     conveyor. Additionally, a second conveyor, upstream from the first conveyor (e.g., the
  5  first conveyor is used in the irradiation of the feedstock), can drop biomass onto the first
     conveyor, where the second conveyor can have a width transverse to the direction of
     conveying smaller than the first conveyor. In particular, when the second conveyor is a
     vibratory conveyor, the feedstock is spread by the action of the second and first
     conveyor. In some optional embodiments, the second conveyor ends in a bias cross cut
 10  discharge (e.g., a bias cut with a ratio of 4:1) so that the material can be dropped as a
     wide curtain (e.g., wider than the width of the second conveyor) onto the first conveyor.
     The initial drop area of the biomass by the spreader (e.g., broadcast spreader, drop
     spreader, conveyor, or cross cut vibratory conveyor) can span the entire width of the first
     vibratory conveyor, or it can span part of this width. Once dropped onto the conveyor,
 15  the material is spread even more uniformly by the vibrations of the conveyor so that,
     preferably, the entire width of the conveyor is covered with a uniform layer of biomass.
     In some embodiments combinations of spreaders can be used. Some methods of
     spreading a feed stock are described in U.S. Patent No. 7,153,533, filed July 23, 2002
     and published December 26, 2006, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein
 20  by reference.
              Generally, it is preferred to convey the material as quickly as possible through an
     electron beam to maximize throughput. For example, the material can be conveyed at
     rates of at least 1 ft/min, e.g., at least 2 ft/min, at least 3 ft/min, at least 4 ft/min, at least 5
     ft/min, at least 10 ft/min, at least 15 ft/min, at least 20 ft/min, at least 25 ft/min, at least
 25  30 ft/min, at least 40 ft/min, at least 50 ft/min, at least 60 ft/min, at least 70 ft/min, at
     least 80 ft/min, at least 90 ft/min. The rate of conveying is related to the beam current
     and targeted irradiation dose, for example, for a         inch thick biomass spread over a 5.5
     foot wide conveyor and 100 mA, the conveyor can move at about 20 ft/min to provide a
     useful irradiation dosage (e.g. about 10 Mrad for a single pass), at 50 mA the conveyor
 30  can move at about 10 ft/min to provide approximately the same irradiation dosage.
              The rate at which material can be conveyed depends on the shape and mass of the
     material being conveyed, and the desired amount. Flowing materials e.g., particulate
     materials, are particularly amenable to conveying with vibratory conveyors. Conveying
     speeds can, for example be, at least 100 lb/hr (e.g., at least 500 lb/hr, at least 1000 lb/hr,
 35  at least 2000 lb/hr, at least 3000 lb/hr, at least 4000 lb/hr, at least 5000 lb/hr, at least
                                                      47

WO 2014/138543                                                              PCT/US2014/021609
     10,000 lb/hr, at least 15, 000 lb/hr, or even at least 25,000 lb/hr). Some typical conveying
     speeds can be between about 1000 and 10,000 lb/hr, (e.g., between about 1000 lb/hr and
     8000 lb/hr, between about 2000 and 7000 lb/hr, between about 2000 and 6000 lb/hr,
     between about 2000 and 50001b/hr, between about 2000 and 4500 lb/hr, between about
  5  1500 and 5000 lb/hr, between about 3000 and 7000 lb/hr, between about 3000 and 6000
     lb/hr, between about 4000 and 6000 lb/hr and between about 4000 and 5000 lb/hr).
     Typical conveying speeds depend on the density of the material. For example, for a
     biomass with a density of about 35 lb/ft 3, and a conveying speed of about 5000 lb/hr, the
     material is conveyed at a rate of about 143 ft3/hr, if the material is  " thick and is in a
 10  trough 5.5 ft wide, the material is conveyed at a rate of about 1250 ft/hr (about 21
     ft/min). Rates of conveying the material can therefore vary greatly. Preferably, for
     example, a     " thick layer of biomass, is conveyed at speeds of between about 5 and 100
     ft/min (e.g. between about 5 and 100 ft/min, between about 6 and 100 ft/min, between
     about 7 and 100 ft/min, between about 8 and 100 ft/min, between about 9 and 100 ft/min,
 15  between about 10 and 100 ft/min, between about 11 and 100 ft/min, between about 12
     and 100 ft/min, between about 13 and 100 ft/min, between about 14 and 100 ft/min,
     between about 15 and 100 ft/min, between about 20 and 100 ft/min, between about 30
     and 100 ft/min, between about 40 and 100 ft/min, between about 2 and 60 ft/min,
     between about 3 and 60 ft/min, between about 5 and 60 ft/min, between about 6 and 60
 20  ft/min, between about 7 and 60 ft/min, between about 8 and 60 ft/min, between about 9
     and 60 ft/min, between about 10 and 60 ft/min, between about 15 and 60 ft/min, between
     about 20 and 60 ft/min, between about 30 and 60 ft/min, between about 40 and 60 ft/min,
     between about 2 and 50 ft/min, between about 3 and 50 ft/min, between about 5 and 50
     ft/min, between about 6 and 50 ft/min, between about 7 and 50 ft/min, between about 8
 25  and 50 ft/min, between about 9 and 50 ft/min, between about 10 and 50 ft/min, between
     about 15 and 50 ft/min, between about 20 and 50 ft/min, between about 30 and 50 ft/min,
     between about 40 and 50 ft/min). It is preferable that the material be conveyed at a
     constant rate, for example, to help maintain a constant irradiation of the material as it
     passes under the electron beam (e.g., shower, field).
 30          The vibratory conveyors described can include screens used for sieving and
     sorting materials. Port openings on the side or bottom of the troughs can be used for
     sorting, selecting or removing specific materials, for example, by size or shape. Some
     conveyors have counterbalances to reduce the dynamic forces on the support structure.
     Some vibratory conveyors are configured as spiral elevators, are designed to curve
 35  around surfaces and/or are designed to drop material from one conveyor to another (e.g.,
                                                   48

WO 2014/138543                                                                PCT/US2014/021609
     in a step, cascade or as a series of steps or a stair). Along with conveying materials
     conveyors can be used, by themselves or coupled with other equipment or systems, for
     screening, separating, sorting, classifying, distributing, sizing, inspection, picking, metal
     removing, freezing, blending, mixing, orienting, heating, cooking, drying, dewatering,
  5  cleaning, washing, leaching, quenching, coating, de-dusting and/or feeding. The
     conveyors can also include covers (e.g., dust-tight covers), side discharge gates, bottom
     discharge gates, special liners (e.g., anti-stick, stainless steel, rubber, custom steal, and or
     grooved), divided troughs, quench pools, screens, perforated plates, detectors (e.g., metal
     detectors), high temperature designs, food grade designs, heaters, dryers and or coolers.
 10  In addition, the trough can be of various shapes, for example, flat bottomed, vee shaped
     bottom, flanged at the top, curved bottom, flat with ridges in any direction, tubular, half
     pipe, covered or any combinations of these. In particular, the conveyors can be coupled
     with an irradiation systems and/or equipment.
             The conveyors (e.g., vibratory conveyor) can be made of corrosion resistant
 15  materials. The conveyors can utilize structural materials that include stainless steel (e.g.,
     304, 316 stainless steel, HASTELLOY@ ALLOYS and INCONEL@ Alloys). For
     example, HASTELLOY@ Corrosion-Resistant alloys from Hynes (Kokomo, Indiana,
     USA) such as HASTELLOY@ B-3@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ HYBRID-BC1@
     ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ C-4 ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ C-22@ ALLOY,
 20  HASTELLOY@ C-22HS@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ C-276 ALLOY, HASTELLOY@
     C-2000@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ G-30@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ G-35@ ALLOY,
     HASTELLOY@ N ALLOY and HASTELLOY@ ULTIMET@ alloy.
             The vibratory conveyors can include non-stick release coatings, for example,
     TUFFLONTM (Dupont, Delaware, USA). The vibratory conveyors can also include
 25  corrosion resistant coatings. For example, coatings that can be supplied from Metal
     Coatings Corp (Houston, Texas, USA) and others such as Fluoropolymer, XYLAN@,
     Molybdenum Disulfide, Epoxy Phenolic, Phosphate- ferrous metal coating,
     Polyurethane- high gloss topcoat for epoxy, inorganic zinc, Poly Tetrafluoro ethylene,
     PPS/RYTON@, fluorinated ethylene propylene, PVDF/DYKOR@, ECTFE/HALAR@
 30  and Ceramic Epoxy Coating. The coatings can improve resistance to process gases (e.g.,
     ozone), chemical corrosion, pitting corrosion, galling corrosion and oxidation.
             Optionally, in addition to the conveying systems described herein, one or more
     other conveying systems can be enclosed. When using an enclosure, the enclosed
     conveyor can also be purged with an inert gas so as to maintain an atmosphere at a
 35  reduced oxygen level. Keeping oxygen levels low avoids the formation of ozone which
                                                     49

WO 2014/138543                                                               PCT/US2014/021609
     in some instances is undesirable due to its reactive and toxic nature. For example, the
     oxygen can be less than about 20% (e.g., less than about 10%, less than about 1%, less
     than about 0.1%, less than about 0.01%, or even less than about 0.001% oxygen).
     Purging can be done with an inert gas including, but not limited to, nitrogen, argon,
  5  helium or carbon dioxide. This can be supplied, for example, from a boil off of a liquid
     source (e.g., liquid nitrogen or helium), generated or separated from air in situ, or
     supplied from tanks. The inert gas can be recirculated and any residual oxygen can be
     removed using a catalyst, such as a copper catalyst bed. Alternatively, combinations of
     purging, recirculating and oxygen removal can be done to keep the oxygen levels low.
 10           The enclosed conveyor can also be purged with a reactive gas that can react with
     the biomass. This can be done before, during or after the irradiation process. The
     reactive gas can be, but is not limited to, nitrous oxide, ammonia, oxygen, ozone,
     hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds, amides, peroxides, azides, halides, oxyhalides,
     phosphides, phosphines, arsines, sulfides, thiols, boranes and/or hydrides. The reactive
 15  gas can be activated in the enclosure, e.g., by irradiation (e.g., electron beam, UV
     irradiation, microwave irradiation, heating, IR radiation), so that it reacts with the
     biomass. The biomass itself can be activated, for example by irradiation. Preferably the
     biomass is activated by the electron beam, to produce radicals which then react with the
     activated or unactivated reactive gas, e.g., by radical coupling or quenching.
 20           Purging gases supplied to an enclosed conveyor can also be cooled, for example
     below about 25'C, below about 00 C, below about -40'C, below about -80'C, below
     about -120'C. For example, the gas can be boiled off from a compressed gas such as
     liquid nitrogen or sublimed from solid carbon dioxide. As an alternative example, the
     gas can be cooled by a chiller or part of or the entire conveyor can be cooled.

                                      OTHER EMBODIMENTS
              Any material, processes or processed materials discussed herein can be used to
     make products and/or intermediates such as composites, fillers, binders, plastic additives,
 30  adsorbents and controlled release agents. The methods can include densification, for
     example, by applying pressure and heat to the materials. For example, composites can be
     made by combining fibrous materials with a resin or polymer. For example, radiation
     cross-linkable resin, e.g., a thermoplastic resin can be combined with a fibrous material
     to provide a fibrous material/cross-linkable resin combination. Such materials can be, for
 35  example, useful as building materials, protective sheets, containers and other structural
                                                    50

     materials (e.g., molded and/or extruded products). Absorbents can be, for example, in the
     form of pellets, chips, fibers and/or sheets. Adsorbents can be used, for example, as pet
     bedding, packaging material or in pollution control systems. Controlled release matrices
     can also be the form of, for example, pellets, chips, fibers and or sheets. The controlled
  5  release matrices can, for example, be used to release drugs, biocides, fragrances. For
     example, composites, absorbents and control release agents and their uses are described
     in International Serial No. PCT/US2006/010648, filed March 23, 2006, and U.S. Patent
     No. 8,074,910 filed November 22, 2011, the entire disclosures of which are herein
     incorporated by reference.
 10           In some instances the biomass material is treated at a first level to reduce
     recalcitrance, e.g., utilizing accelerated electrons, to selectively release one or more
     sugars (e.g., xylose). The biomass can then be treated to a second level to release one or
     more other sugars (e.g., glucose). Optionally, the biomass can be dried between
     treatments. The treatments can include applying chemical and biochemical treatments to
 15  release the sugars. For example, a biomass material can be treated to a level of less than
     about 20 Mrad (e.g., less than about 15 Mrad, less than about 10 Mrad, less than about 5
     Mrad, less than about 2 Mrad) and then treated with a solution of sulfuric acid,
     containing less than 10% sulfuric acid (e.g., less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less
     than about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than
 20  about 3%, less than about 2%, less than about 1%, less than about 0.75%, less than about
     0.50 %, less than about 0.25%) to release xylose. Xylose, for example, that is released
     into solution, can be separated from solids and optionally the solids washed with a
     solvent/solution (e.g., with water and/or acidified water). Optionally, the solids can be
     dried, for example in air and/or under vacuum optionally with heating (e.g., below about
 25  150 deg C, below about 120 deg C) to a water content below about 25 wt.% (below
     about 20 wt.%, below about 15 wt.%, below about 10 wt.% and even below about 5
     wt.%). The solids can then be treated with a level of less than about 30 Mrad (e.g., less
     than about 25 Mrad, less than about 20 Mrad, less than about 15 Mrad, less than about 10
     Mrad, less than about 5 Mrad, less than about 1 Mrad or even not at all) and then treated
 30  with an enzyme (e.g., a cellulase) to release glucose. The glucose (e.g., glucose in
     solution) can be separated from the remaining solids. The solids can then be further
     processed, for example, utilized to make energy or other products (e.g., lignin derived
     products).

              Any of the products and/or intermediates described herein, for example, produced
     by the processes, systems and/or equipment described herein, can be combined with
     flavors, fragrances, colorants and/or mixtures of these. For example, any one or more of
  5  (optionally along with flavors, fragrances and/or colorants) sugars, organic acids, fuels,
     polyols, such as sugar alcohols, biomass, fibers and composites can be combined with
     (e.g., formulated, mixed or reacted) or used to make other products. For example, one or
     more such product can be used to make soaps, detergents, candies, drinks (e.g., cola,
     wine, beer, liquors such as gin or vodka, sports drinks, coffees, teas), syrups,
 10  pharmaceuticals, adhesives, sheets (e.g., woven, none woven, filters, tissues) and/or
     composites (e.g., boards). For example, one or more such product can be combined with
     herbs, flowers, petals, spices, vitamins, potpourri, or candles. For example, the
     formulated, mixed or reacted combinations can have flavors/fragrances of grapefruit,
     orange, apple, raspberry, banana, lettuce, celery, cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla,
 15  peppermint, mint, onion, garlic, pepper, saffron, ginger, milk, wine, beer, tea, lean beef,
     fish, clams, olive oil, coconut fat, pork fat, butter fat, beef bouillon, legume, potatoes,
     marmalade, ham, coffee and cheeses.
              Flavors, fragrances and colorants can be added in any amount, such as between
     about 0.001 wt.% to about 30 wt.%, e.g., between about 0.01 to about 20, between about
 20  0.05 to about 10, or between about 0.1 wt.% to about 5 wt.%. These can be formulated,
     mixed and or reacted (e.g., with any one of more product or intermediate described
     herein) by any means and in any order or sequence (e.g., agitated, mixed, emulsified,
     gelled, infused, heated, sonicated, and/or suspended). Fillers, binders, emulsifier,
     antioxidants can also be utilized, for example protein gels, starches and silica.
 25           In one embodiment the flavors, fragrances and colorants can be added to the
     biomass immediately after the biomass is irradiated such that the reactive sites created by
     the irradiation may react with reactive compatible sites of the flavors, fragrances, and
     colorants.
              The flavors, fragrances and colorants can be natural and/or synthetic materials.
 30  These materials can be one or more of a compound, a composition or mixtures of these
     (e.g., a formulated or natural composition of several compounds). Optionally, the flavors,
     fragrances, antioxidants and colorants can be derived biologically, for example, from a
     fermentation process (e.g., fermentation of saccharified materials as described herein).
     Alternatively, or additionally these flavors, fragrances and colorants can be harvested

     organism. The organism can be collected and or extracted to provide color, flavors,
     fragrances and/or antioxidant by any means including utilizing the methods, systems and
     equipment described herein, hot water extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, chemical
     extraction (e.g., solvent or reactive extraction including acids and bases), mechanical
  5  extraction (e.g., pressing, comminuting, filtering), utilizing an enzyme, utilizing a
     bacteria such as to break down a starting material, and combinations of these methods.
     The compounds can be derived by a chemical reaction, for example, the combination of
     a sugar (e.g., as produced as described herein) with an amino acid (Maillard reaction).
     The flavor, fragrance, antioxidant and/or colorant can be an intermediate and or product
 10  produced by the methods, equipment or systems described herein, for example and ester
     and a lignin derived product.
             Some examples of flavor, fragrances or colorants are polyphenols. Polyphenols
     are pigments responsible for the red, purple and blue colorants of many fruits,
     vegetables, cereal grains, and flowers. Polyphenols also can have antioxidant properties
 15  and often have a bitter taste. The antioxidant properties make these important
     preservatives. On class of polyphenols are the flavonoids, such as Anthocyanidines,
     flavanonols, flavan-3-ols, s, flavanones and flavanonols. Other phenolic compounds that
     can be used include phenolic acids and their esters, such as chlorogenic acid and
     polymeric tannins.
 20          Among the colorants inorganic compounds, minerals or organic compounds can
     be used, for example titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, aluminum oxide, cadmium yellow
     (E.g., CdS), cadmium orange (e.g., CdS with some Se), alizarin crimson (e.g., synthetic
     or non-synthetic rose madder), ultramarine (e.g., synthetic ultramarine, natural
     ultramarine, synthetic ultramarine violet ), cobalt blue, cobalt yellow, cobalt green,
 25  viridian (e.g., hydrated chromium(III)oxide), chalcophylite, conichalcite, cornubite,
     cornwallite and liroconite. Black pigments such as carbon black and self-dispersed
     blacks may be used.

             Other than in the examples herein, or unless otherwise expressly specified, all of
     the numerical ranges, amounts, values and percentages, such as those for amounts of
     materials, elemental contents, times and temperatures of reaction, ratios of amounts, and
     others, in the following portion of the specification and attached claims may be read as if
  5  prefaced by the word "about" even though the term "about" may not expressly appear
     with the value, amount, or range. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the
     numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are
     approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be
     obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the
 10  application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical
     parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant
     digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.
             Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad
     scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific
 15  examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however,
     inherently contains error necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in its
     underlying respective testing measurements. Furthermore, when numerical ranges are
     set forth herein, these ranges are inclusive of the recited range end points (i.e., end points
     may be used). When percentages by weight are used herein, the numerical values
 20  reported are relative to the total weight.
             Also, it should be understood that any numerical range recited herein is intended
     to include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of "1 to 10" is
     intended to include all sub-ranges between (and including) the recited minimum value of
     1 and the recited maximum value of 10, that is, having a minimum value equal to or
 25  greater than 1 and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10. The terms "one," "a," or
     "an" as used herein are intended to include "at least one" or "one or more," unless
     otherwise indicated.
             Any patent, publication, or other disclosure material, in whole or in part, that is
     said to be incorporated by reference herein is incorporated herein only to the extent that
 30  the incorporated material does not conflict with existing definitions, statements, or other
     disclosure material set forth in this disclosure. As such, and to the extent necessary, the
     disclosure as explicitly set forth herein supersedes any conflicting material incorporated
     herein by reference. Any material, or portion thereof, that is said to be incorporated by
     reference herein, but which conflicts with existing definitions, statements, or other
                                                    59

     disclosure material set forth herein will only be incorporated to the extent that no conflict
     arises between that incorporated material and the existing disclosure material.
             While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to
     preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that
