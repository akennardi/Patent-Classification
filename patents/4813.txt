(57) Abstract
The invention pertains to energy production by capturing simultaneously water poten
tial (surface height differences due to waves) and kinetic (flow of water due to e.g.
waves, tide or streams) energy. The plant can have tidal compensation to avoid en
ergy flux streaming over the plant in high tide, and directional stabilizing arrangement
to turn it automatically parallel to wave crests. Surfaces capturing energy from flow
have optimized movements to follow speed of water in different depths. Also energy
conservation to filter output ripple can be arranged with twin-phase fluid accumula
tors.

   HYBRID ENERGY PLANT
   Field of invention
 5 This invention pertains to energy production by capturing simultaneously water po
   tential energy and water kinetic energy. The potential energy relates to surface
   height differences due to waves, and kinetic energy relates to flow of water due to
   e.g. waves, tide or streams.
10
   Background technology
   Energy in ocean waves exists in two forms: potential energy generating water sur
   face height differences which we see as waves and kinetic energy which moves the
15 water particles back and forth. The energy is split equally between these two forms.
   More detailed description can be found from Dominic Reeve, Andrew Chadwick and
   Chris Fleming's book "Coastal Engineering, Processes, Theory and Design Practice",
   second edition, 2012, Spoon Press, London and New York, ISBN 978-0-415-58352

   Prior art technology includes capturing energy from wave potential energy with dif
   ferent floating objects like buoys. Prior art technology also includes capturing energy
   from water kinetic energy with various stagnation pressure flap constructions. Prior
   art technology does not capture both energy types simultaneously in an efficient
25 manner.
   Most energy plants are not optimized for capturing energy of both types simultane
   ously. Since half of wave energy exists in potential form and other half in kinematic
   form, a lot of energy flux is bypassing current power plants. This makes them ineffi
30 cient and increases unit cost of produced energy. Also movements opposite to water
   flow in some areas of the moving objects cause very high internal loads to the struc
   tures and unnecessary reaction forces to the supporting structures, requiring uneco
   nomical over-sizing of the structures.
35 Patent document US8253263B2 discloses an energy plant, which captures both en
   ergy types. However, certain problems are related to this prior art structure. The
   structure includes flaps that are fixed with parallel arms, causing the flaps to

                                              2
   have permanently fixed orientation. Not following the velocity profile of water in dif
   ferent depths causes excessive forces to the structures when flap motion reaches ei
   ther end position and stops. Another problem relates to a rigid float of the structure.
   Wave crests have arbitrary lengths, and a rigid float causes extreme loads to the
 5 proposed support tower when one end is on the wave crest and the other on
   through.
   The prior art solution disclosed in US8253263B2 also relies on extreme conditions
   survival turning the plant along the wave advancing direction. This orientation is
10 known to produce extreme high loads to a floating object, known in shipbuilding as
   sagging and hogging, depending on the wave crest and through positions along the
   floating object, and also pitching movement which causes extreme loads to supports
   limiting the movement. Incorrectly dimensioned ships without any penetrations break
   in these circumstances and a ship size object forced to follow a stationary column
15 penetrating through it has severe structural problems on the penetration area and in
   the column.
   There is a further problem which relates to prior art energy plants which are an
   chored permanently to the sea bed. Tidal changes in water depth reduce radically
20 the energy output of any flap construction in such energy plants because wave flow
   speed is highest on the surface, going deeper the friction reduce flow speed. Per
   manent bottom anchoring of a solid flap or wing does not allow the plant to reach the
   best surface energy flux in high tide. Any fixed anchoring also introduces another
   power reduction factor, being the angle of incidence between wave crests and plant
25 orientation in waves coming in from arbitrary directions.
   Current technology level of wave power plants is still in the testing phase of innova
   tions, and therefore routine maintenance and plant life time economics has not been
   an important driver. This shows up in the complication of required maintenance: dry
30 docking, diving, towing on shore etc. has to be performed within narrow, calm
   enough weather windows. Underwater maintenance is impossible in harsh weather
   due to rapid flows and violent plant movements. The productivity of an energy plant
   is thus reduced further even due to minor technical problems.
35 A further problem with prior art wave energy plants relates to currently used gas
   pressurized accumulators. The storage capacity available for filtering power ripple is

                                               3
   inadequate, causing the output power to alter according to the waves. This makes
   the wave power difficult to utilize in common grid without additional arrangements.
   As a consequence, the prior art wave energy plants do not have optimal efficiency,
 5 they are easily damaged in the harsh weather, and they are difficult to maintain.
   Summary of the invention
   The object of the invention is to provide new solutions for providing an energy plant,
10 with which the problems of the prior art energy plants can be avoided or reduced.
   The object of the invention is specifically to provide a plant with better than prior art
   efficiency by capturing simultaneously energy from both potential and kinetic sources
   of the waves and possible currents in a more effective manner. Kinetic energy cap
15 ture is optimized by moving surfaces having velocity profiles matching to the flow
   speed of water particles in different distances from water surface. The plant may also
   provide means to follow tidal surface level changes thus keeping the flow capturing
   devices in the highest flow speed zone having highest energy density. Further the
   plant can be self orienting against incoming waves' direction. The plant may have a
20 capability to limit excessive waves' loads in survival condition.
   A hybrid energy plant according to the invention for capturing energy from waves, is
   characterized in that it has a support structure and one or more wave floats, wherein
   at least one of the floats is arranged to capture wave potential energy, and wings or
25 flaps attached to at least one of the floats arranged to capture simultaneously wave
   kinetic energy, wherein the wave float(s) and wings/flaps have a connection to the
   support structure which connection allows the vertical position and/or orientation of
   float(s) and/or wings/flaps to accommodate to changes in water surface height and
   wave direction.
30
   Some preferable embodiments of the invention are described in dependent claims.
   According to one embodiment of the invention the energy plant consists of one or
   more floating objects and different combinations of wings and/or flaps. Potential en
35 ergy is captured with the floating object(s) buoyancy and mass forces running energy
   capturing devices, and kinetic energy is captured with wings or flaps running also
   energy capture devices, either separate or common. The wings' angle of attack and

                                               4
   flaps' movement are adjusted to match water speed profile in different depths. The
   technology of applying and controlling wings in a wave power plant is described in
   more detail in non-public patent application PCT/F12013/050046 of the same appli
   cant, included herein as reference.
 5
   According to another embodiment the floating object is split to two or more parts.
   One or more of the floating parts have small enough waterline area not to follow rap
   id surface changes of waves but keeping constant surface level during tidal water
   surface level variations. Some floating parts provide counter mass to the movement,
10 and one or more floating parts provide additional buoyancy for protection against ex
   treme waves. The remaining floating parts follow the waves capturing potential ener
   gy.
   According to a further embodiment the wave follower floating objects are attached to
15 the slowly moving floating objects with hinged or sliding mechanisms.
   According to a further embodiment the wave floats can have individual vertical and
   rolling movements to prevent excessive loads on the foundation and support mecha
   nisms.
20
   According to a further embodiment the wings or flaps are attached to the floating ob
   jects following the wave surface changes. The floating object and wing or flap sup
   ports can be shaped to enhance the flow.
25 According to a further embodiment the wings or flaps are also attached to the slowly
   moving floating object following the tidal surface level changes.
   According to a further embodiment the floating objects are arranged in balanced ori
   entation causing the plant to turn automatically parallel to wave crests.
30
   According to a further embodiment the wings angle of incidence are adjustable.
   According to a further embodiment the wings are arranged to counter oriented adja
   cent rows balancing each other's reaction lift forces.
35
   According to a further embodiment the wings are collected to a single or multiple ar
   rays or groups of arrays having common or individual energy capturing devices.

                                                5
   According to a further embodiment the wings or flaps are attached to the system with
   either bar mechanisms, rollers tracks, hinges, sliders or a combination of these,
   providing optimum movement in different depths related to the water flow thus pre
 5 venting internal forces on them caused by unmatched flow and movement speeds.
   According to a further embodiment the wings or flaps movement in different depths is
   adjusted to optimize energy capture within varying wave conditions.
10 According to a further embodiment the plant is supported to the bottom with either a
   pile/column, arms or gravitational weight. A pile can be either a dedicated structure
   for the plant only or a existing support structure for another purpose like wind energy
   plant. The support structure preferably allows the wave floats and wings/flaps to turn
   according to the waves' incoming direction. The support structure may also comprise
15 anchoring.
   According to a further embodiment the plant has a floating and anchored foundation
   with submerged structures shaped to maximize added water mass for counter action.
   The floating foundation may have separate water tanks and an arrangement for
20 pumping water/air between the tanks. This way it is possible to compensate the ten
   dency of the support structure to decline due to external forces.
   According to a further embodiment the plant is fixed to sea bed with hinged arm
   mechanism allowing it to follow tidal surface height and to turn according to the
25 waves' incoming direction.
   According to a further embodiment the plant has floats with limited buoyancy to pre
   vent overloading in exceptional high waves.
30 According to a further embodiment the wings has adjustable angle of attack to pre
   vent overloads in extreme conditions.
   According to a further embodiment the flaps has mechanism or hinges to allow them
   to turn along the flow in extreme conditions. It is also possible to have flaps equipped
35 with lids that open in an over-pressure condition.

                                                6
   According to a further embodiment power take off is arranged with hydraulic cylin
   ders or pumps connected to the wings, wing panels or flaps and hinge.
   According to a further embodiment the plant has hydraulic transmission using twin
 5 phase pressure accumulators with or without intermediate fluid.
   According to a further embodiment the plant has stepped or stepless adjustment
   cam and rod mechanism to change the transmission ratio between the wings or flaps
   and cylinders or pumps.
10
   According to a further embodiment the plant with wings have angle of attack adjust
   ment in continuously flowing water to make the wings to move back and forth contin
   uously.
15 According to a further embodiment the energy is conserved in twin-phase accumula
   tors, where the pressurizing fluid is partly gas, partly liquid boiling to gas when the
   pressurizing volume expands, thus keeping the pressure constant independent of
   hydraulic fluid level. Typical pressurizing fluid is carbon dioxide. The arrangement
   can use third intermediate fluid to prevent known corrosion problems under certain
20 conditions and to increase the working pressure of hydraulic system.

 5 Detailed description of exemplary embodiments
   The presented figures are not to scale, and component dimensions naturally vary
   according to requirements in different applications.
10 Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a energy plant according to the in
   vention. The plant captures potential energy from waves with wave floats 5, which
   follow the water surface height changes caused by waves. Connected to the floats,
   the plant has wing arrays 6 and 7 for capturing kinetic energy from waves, tidal or
   other streams or from combination of them.
15
   The plant has a supporting column 1 around which the tidal compensation float
   slides and rotates. The tidal compensation float consists of partly or totally sub
   merged part 2, connecting part 3, and upper part 22. The connecting part 3 has
   small waterline area to minimize buoyancy changes due to waves thus keeping the
20 compensation float on steady height. Arms 4 hold the floats 5 and wing arrays 6 and
   7. Wings are connected to the floats with wing hubs 8. The supporting column can
   be either a dedicated pile or have other functions like wind turbine tower.
   Tidal compensation float has also a protection function against too high waves.
25 When a wave crest reaches the upper part of compensation float, it will generate ad
   ditional buoyancy to the float thus raising the entire float system to prevent the wave
   floats 5 to turn the arms 4 into unwanted position and flowing water to hit the arms.
   Tidal compensation float can have shape to enhance flow field by forcing flow to the
   wings or flaps thus adding their flow speed, increasing their power and reducing un
30 wanted drag forces to the support column. Shaping the float to produce additional lift
   forces upwards and downwards, depending on the direction of water flow, increases
   the power capture of plant with counter movement to the wave floats. Compensation
   float can also have active heave stabilizer tanks or protruding profiles 23 with possi
   ble active control.
35
   Each of the wave floats 5, two in this example, on the opposite sides of the support
   structure can move independently to conform to uneven wave crests around the

                                                9
   plant. The wave floats can also roll sideways in case of an incoming wave having
   unequal crest height on their length.
   The arms 4 can also be used as lifting devices for maintenance purposes of the
 5 wave floats. For the same purpose, the tidal compensation float can also be pumped
   empty or filled to go deeper, depending on the tide height and local water depth.
   Wing arrays 6 and 7 have opposite moving directions so that they balance the hy
   drodynamic lifting forces of each others. In the example there are two arrays, mount
10 ed to the wave floats. The number of adjacent wing arrays can vary according to the
   expected wave conditions on installation site. In some applications the wings or flaps
   can be mounted on their own arms, independently of wave floats.
   The wing for wave plant may have twist, and profile can change along the wings to
15 keep optimum angle of attack with varying flow speed in different depths. The entire
   wing can also have adjustable angle of attack to adapt to varying flow speeds in dif
   ferent wave conditions.
   The wing may preferably has a form where water flow causes forces according to re
20 action principle, as known from e.g. reaction turbines. Such a wing has a profile in
   which a flowing water causes reaction forces that are larger than action forces, which
   are known from e.g. impulse turbines. More particularly, wing profiles of the plant
   preferably have such forms and are in such positions that the force component
   caused by the water flow on the wing profile is smaller in the direction of the of the
25 water flow than the force component in the direction which is orthogonal to the direc
   tion of the water flow. In other words, lift force caused by the water flow is higher
   than force caused by stagnating pressure. The form and position of the wing is pref
   erably optimized so that the lift force provides maximum energy from the water flow
   with minimum drag. In another embodiment of the invention the surface angle of at
30 tack of the wing is adjustable by turning it around support axis. The profile form of the
   underwater wing may be symmetric or asymmetric. The asymmetric wing profile has
   two leading edges mirrored as this structure is preferably used in wave energy plants
   where the flow has reciprocating direction. A symmetric wing profile is preferably
   used in tide or river streams where the flow direction is constant for a long time and
35 the reciprocal movement of the wing is achieved by adjusting the angle of attack by
   turning the wings around their support axis, for example.

                                                10
   Wave float power is taken off with e.g. hydraulic cylinders, pumps or rotators (not
   shown in figure) located at the joint between the arms and tidal float. Wing arrays
   have hydraulic power take offs of their own with cam and rod mechanism and ratio
   adjustment, for example (not shown in figure). An example of a suitable hydraulic
 5 pressure accumulator system is illustrated in figure 15.
   Figure 2 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of energy plant according to the inven
   tion. The plant has wings with extended support arms 9 to eliminate the low perfor
   mance wing hubs. All other aspects can be as in the embodiment of figure 1.
10
   Figure 3 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of energy plant according to the inven
   tion. The wings are collected to an array 10 moving with a mechanism 11. All other
   aspects can be as in figure 1. with this embodiment it is possible to achieve an even
   supply of energy from the whole area of a wing. The profile of the wing may be con
15 stant along the wing in this embodiment. The array of the wings can also have a dif
   ferent orientation than the vertical orientation shown in the figure. The wing orienta
   tion may be horizontal, for example, whereby the wing array moves in vertical direc
   tion.
20 Figure 4 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of energy plant according to the inven
   tion. The wings are collected to an array moving with a slide 12. All other aspects can
   be as in figure 3.
   Figure 5 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of energy plant according to the inven
25 tion. The stagnation pressure flaps 13 are hinged vertically to the floats. Flaps can
   have opposite rotation directions to balance forces caused to supporting structures.
   All other aspects can be as in figure 1.
   Figure 6 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of energy plant according to the inven
30 tion. The flaps 14 are supported to the floats with a mechanism 15 causing them to
   follow water velocity profile in different depths. The flaps can also be supported with
   roller or sliding mechanism causing similar movement related to depth.
   Figure 7 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of energy plant according to the inven
35 tion, without tidal compensation float. This embodiment has four wave floats, which
   are fixed to each other, and the combined float structure moves vertically in relation

                                               11
   to the column. The potential energy of the waves is thus collected with suitable
   means from this relative movement.
   Figure 8 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of energy plant according to the inven
 5 tion with tidal compensation float but without wave floats. The wings can be either
   pointing upwards, downwards or both. The example shows both alternatives.
   Figure 9 illustrates water horizontal flow speed of a wave in shallow water. In the still
   water level 16 there is no horizontal movement. In crest 17 the water flows towards
10 the shore, in through 18 it flows back to open waters. The flow speed has its maxi
   mum at the surface and reduces linearly with increasing depth.
   Figure 10 illustrates the optimum flap movement speed 19, having equal speed dif
   ference to the flow speed in all depths. This flap speed distribution generates uniform
15 stagnation pressure on the entire flap surface, without internal loads caused by une
   qual pressure.
   Figure 11 illustrates flap 21 turning parallel to flow under extreme wave conditions.
   Water flow 20 can go below and above the flap, not causing excessive loads to the
20 structures.
   Figure 12 illustrates an exemplary power plant with horizontally oriented wings.
   Figure 13 illustrates floating foundation having submerged volumes 24 on depth hav
25 ing reduced water movements. The volumes are shaped to capture added water
   mass from surrounding water to increase counter weight action. This support struc
   ture can also be used when a wind power plant is integrated with the wave power
   plant.
30 The structure of Figure 13 solves an important problem with floating foundations of
   wave power plants, wind power plants and their combinations. Such foundations
   tend to turn due to decline due to forces caused by waves, sea streams, reaction
   forces of the wave power plant or a wind turbine installed on the foundation. These
   forces can be compensated by one or several submerged water tanks 24 by dividing
35 them in separated parts and pumping air and/or water between the parts thus con
   trolling the distribution of the mass between the parts. This causes a momentum in

                                                12
   the floating foundation and can be used for compensating the decline of the structure
   caused by external forces.
   Figure 14 illustrates an alternative plant with a jack-up body part 26 standing on legs
 5 27. This structure does not turn with the direction of a wave crest, but the structure
   may be advantageous in installations where the water movement has a relatively
   constant direction.
   A wave power installation may include one or several wave power plants combined
10 from presented concepts. If the installation includes two or more wave power plants
   they may be installed in parallel positions at a suitable distance from each other. It
   may be preferable to have a slight difference in their distance from the shore line in
   order to efficiently utilize waves with different directions. When the floats can turn in
   relation to the columns they will set into the optimized position in each power plant. If
15 a power plant with legs (Figure 14) is used it is possible to use the same legs in the
   middle of the installation for supporting floats in both sides of a leg. In this case the
   installation has legs at the ends of the installation and intermediate legs between the
   end legs.
20 Figure 15 illustrates an exemplary pressure accumulator system, which can be used
   in implementing the invention. Wave energy converters create transient cyclic hy
   draulic oil flow according to momentary power available in wave. These transients
   create power ripple and difficulties in power grid. Some sort of power regulation is
   always needed.
25
   Current state of art hydraulic pressure accumulators require huge gas volumes to re
   tain usefully stabile pressure. Pressure is never constant but changes due to gas
   volume change caused by accumulator charging and discharging. Getting pressure
   usefully close to constant require gas volume being an order of magnitude larger
30 than liquid volume, thus being very impractical. Trying to use such accumulators as
   energy reservoirs is almost impossible.
   This problem can be solved with twin-phase pressure accumulator system where
   propellant changes phase between gas and liquid, depending on the required vol
35 ume. Pressure remains constant and required propellant volume in liquid form is only
   a small fraction of gaseous propellant, making entire system much smaller and prac
   tical.

                                                13
   Twin-phase hydraulic energy reservoir system consists of a high pressure accumula
   tor 51 using twin-phase propellant fluid existing both in gas 52 and liquid 53 phase,
   depending on filling stage of the accumulator. Propellant fluid keeps hydraulic oil
 5 pressure 54 constant, by expanding due to vaporization or condensing to liquid, ac
   cording to volume change. One such useful propellant is carbon dioxide (C02).
   Low pressure accumulator 55 has also twin-phase propellant which exists both in
   gas phase 56 and liquid phase 57, depending on the accumulator filling stage 58.
10 Low pressure accumulator propellant has lower boiling pressure, adequate to avoid
   hydraulic cavitation in low pressure lines 59. One such propellant family are freons
   and other refrigerants.
   Pressure accumulators can be of a bladder type 64 or a piston type 65. A piston type
15 accumulator with unequal piston diameters 66 can act as pressure enhancer, allow
   ing operation with pressures higher than propellant boiling pressure.
   While operating, the pumping cylinders 60, hydraulic pumps 61 and other pressuriza
   tion components suck low pressure hydraulic fluid 58 from low pressure accumulator,
20 and pressurize the fluid to high pressure, feeding it to high pressure accumulator.
   Energy production machinery, for example hydraulic motors 62 or turbines 63, re
   ceive constant pressure feed.
   The kinetic energy of waves can be captured with wings or flaps, the wings being a
25 preferable alternative to implement the invention. To understand the difference be
   tween "a wing" and "a flap" it is essential to define their function. This is next ex
   plained referring to figures 16 and 17.
   A flap 70 is a surface, usually flat or close to it, transversal to flow 71. Good example
30 is a paddle wheel of a historical boat. Propulsion force 72 is generated by impulse of
   when a flap travels through water, or flow attacks a flap. A small suction is also gen
   erated behind the flap, with remarkable turbulence 73 creating lots of energy loss.
   Propulsion force is parallel to the flow/movement direction. In flow, fluid particles lose
   their kinetic energy when hitting the surface, causing pressure increase called stag
35 nation pressure 74.

                                              14
   A wing is a streamlined profile 75, having an angle of attack 76 between profile cen
   ter axis and flow. Good example is a propeller blade. Propulsion force 77 is generat
   ed by reaction to pressure differences 78 on each side of the profile. Propulsion
   force is transversal to the flow/movement direction. In flow, fluid particles continue
 5 movement along the profile and pressure differences are generated by local in
   crease/decrease of flow speed.
   A flap can't be easily adapted to changing flow conditions. The only method is to re
   duce its area projected to flow by turning it around an axes. On contrary, a wing pro
10 file angle of attack adjustment has radical effect on the propulsion force called lift.
   With turning a wing profile along flow, the entire propulsion force can be eliminated.
   Due to streamlined shape, only a small drag force remains.
   It must be noted that above only some embodiments of the solution according to the
15 invention have been described. The principle of the invention can naturally be modi
   fied within the scope of protection determined by the patent claims, e.g. in details of
   implementation and areas of use.
   It should further be noted that the energy plant according to the invention preferably
20 utilizes water movements caused waves, but it may alternatively or additionally utilize
   water movements caused by tide, river stream etc.
