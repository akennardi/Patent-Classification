                                       INK FILM CONSTRUCTIONS
    This is a divisional application of Australian standard patent applications 2013229142,
    2013229140, 2013229137, and all the disclosures in those applications as filed and as amended
    are herein incorporated by reference.
 5  FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
           The present invention relates to ink film constructions and, more particularly, to ink dots
    adhered to printing substrates. In particular, the ink film constructions comprise continuous ink
    dots, which may by way of example be obtained by ink jetting technology.
           Currently, lithographic printing is the process in most common use for producing
 0  newspapers and magazines. Lithographic printing involves the preparation of plates bearing the
    image to be printed, which plates are mounted on a plate cylinder. An ink image produced on the
    plate cylinder is transferred to an offset cylinder that carries a rubber blanket. From the blanket,
    the image is applied to paper, card or another printing medium, termed the substrate, which is fed
    between the offset cylinder and an impression cylinder. For a wide variety of well-known
 5  reasons, offset litho printing is suitable, and economically viable, only for long print runs.
          More recently, digital printing techniques have been developed that allow a printing device
    to receive instructions directly from a computer without the need to prepare printing plates.
    Amongst these are color laser printers that use the xerographic process. Color laser printers using
    dry toners are suitable for certain applications, but they do not produce images of a quality
!0  acceptable for publications such as magazines.
          A process that is better suited for short run high quality digital printing is used in the HP
    Indigo digital printing press. In this process, an electrostatic image is produced on an electrically
    charged image-bearing cylinder by exposure to laser light. The electrostatic charge attracts oil
    based inks to form a color ink image on the image-bearing cylinder. The ink image is then
 5  transferred by way of a blanket cylinder onto the substrate.
          Various printing devices have also previously been proposed that use an indirect inkjet
    printing process, this being a process in which an inkjet print head is used to print an image onto
    the surface an intermediate transfer member, which is then used to transfer the image onto a
    substrate. The intermediate transfer member may be a rigid drum or a flexible belt, also herein
 0O termed a blanket, guided over rollers.

         Using an indirect printing technique overcomes many problems associated with inkjet
  printing directly onto the substrate. For example, inkjet printing directly onto porous paper, or
  other fibrous material, results in poor image quality because of variation of the distance between
  the print head and the surface of the substrate, and because of the substrate acting as a wick.
5 Fibrous substrates, such as paper, generally require specific coatings engineered to absorb the
  liquid ink in a controlled fashion or to prevent its penetration below the surface of the substrate.
  Using specially coated substrates is, however, a costly option that is unsuitable for certain
  printing applications. Furthermore, the use of coated substrates creates its own problems in that
  the surface of the substrate remains wet and additional costly steps are needed to dry the ink so
0 that it is not later smeared as the substrate is being handled, for example stacked or wound into a
  roll. Furthermore, excessive wetting of the substrate causes cockling and makes printing on both
  sides of the substrate (also termed perfecting or duplex printing) difficult, if not impossible.
         The use of an indirect technique, on the other hand, allows the distance between the image
  transfer surface and the inkjet print head to be maintained constant, reduces wetting of the
5 substrate as the ink can be dried on the image transfer surface before being applied to the
  substrate. Consequently, the final image quality of the ink film on the substrate is less affected
  by the physical properties of the substrate.
         Various quality ink film constructions notwithstanding, it is believed that there is a need
  for further improvements in ink film constructions, such as ink-jet printing constructions.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS
          The ink film constructions according to the present invention may be better understood
   with reference to the drawings and the accompanying description.
         Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood
30 that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the

   arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the
   drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in
   various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein
   is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.
5  Description of the Printing Process and System
          The present invention is concerned with ink film constructions that may be obtained in
   particular by the following printing process or using any printing system implementing such
   process. A printing process suitable for the preparation of the ink films according to the
   invention includes directing droplets of an ink onto an intermediate transfer member to form an
0  ink image, the ink including an organic polymeric resin and a colorant (e.g., a pigment or dye) in
   an aqueous carrier, and the transfer member having a hydrophobic outer surface, each ink droplet
   in the ink image spreading on impinging upon the intermediate transfer member to form an ink
   film (e.g., a thin film preserving a major part of the flattening and horizontal extension of the
   droplet present on impact or covering an area dependent upon the mass of ink in the droplet).
5  The ink is dried while the ink image is being transported by the intermediate transfer member by
   evaporating the aqueous carrier from the ink image to leave a residue film of resin and colorant.
   The residue film is then transferred to a substrate (e.g., by pressing the intermediate transfer
   member against the substrate to impress the residue film thereupon). The chemical compositions
   of the ink and of the surface of the intermediate transfer member are selected such that attractive
0  intermolecular forces between molecules in the outer skin of each droplet and on the surface of
   the intermediate transfer member counteract the tendency of the ink film produced by each
   droplet to bead under the action of the surface tension of the aqueous carrier, without causing
   each droplet to spread by wetting the surface of the intermediate transfer member.
          The printing process sets out to preserve, or freeze, the thin pancake shape of each aqueous
5  ink droplet, that is caused by the flattening of the ink droplet on impacting the surface of the
   intermediate transfer member (also termed the release layer), despite the hydrophobicity of such
   layer. To achieve this objective, this novel process relies on electrostatic interactions between
   molecules in the ink and in the outer surface of the transfer member, the molecules being either
   charged in their respective medium or being mutually chargeable, becoming oppositely charged
0O upon interaction between the ink and the release layer. Further details on the printing processes,
   and related systems, suitable for the preparation of ink constructions according to the present
   invention are disclosed in PCT Application Nos. PCT/IB2013/051716; PCT/IB2013/051717; and
   PCT/IB2013/051718.

          For illustration, a conventional hydrophobic surface, such as a silicone coated surface, will
   yield electrons readily and is regarded as negatively charged. Polymeric resins in an aqueous
   carrier are likewise generally negatively charged. Therefore, in the absence of additional steps
   being taken the net intermolecular forces will cause the intermediate transfer member to repel the
 5 ink and the droplets will tend to bead into spherical globules.
          In the novel printing process suitable for the preparation of ink film constructions
   according to the invention, the chemical composition of the surface of the intermediate transfer
   member is modified to provide a positive charge. This may be achieved, for example, by
   including in the surface of the intermediate transfer member (e.g., embedded in the release layer)
 0 molecules having one or more Bronsted base functional groups and in particular nitrogen
   comprising molecules. Suitable positively charged or chargeable groups include primary amines,
   secondary amines, and tertiary amines. Such groups can be covalently bound to polymeric
   backbones and, for example, the outer surface of the intermediate transfer member may include
   amino silicones. Further details on intermediate transfer members including in their release layer
 5 Bronsted base functional groups, suitable for the preparation of ink film constructions according
   to the present invention are disclosed in PCT Application No. PCT/1B2013/051751.
          Such positively chargeable functional groups of the molecules of the release layer may
   interact with Bronsted acid functional groups of molecules of the ink. Suitable negatively
   charged or chargeable groups include carboxylated acids such as having carboxylic acid groups
 0 (-COOH), acrylic acid groups (-CH 2=CH-COOH), methacrylic acid groups (-CH 2=C(CH 3)
   COOH) and sulfonates such as having sulfonic acid groups (-S0             3 H). Such groups can be
   covalently bound to polymeric backbones and preferably be water soluble or dispersible.
   Suitable ink molecules may for example comprise acrylic-based resins such as an acrylic
   polymer and an acrylic-styrene copolymer having carboxylic acid functional groups. Further
25 details on ink compositions that may be used to achieve the ink film constructions according to
   the present invention are disclosed in PCT Application No. PCT/IB2013/051755.
          An alternative for negating the repelling of the ink droplets by the negatively charged
   hydrophobic surface of the intermediate transfer member is to apply a conditioning or pre
   treatment solution to the surface of the intermediate transfer member to reverse its polarity to
30 positive. One can look upon such treatment of the transfer member as applying a very thin layer
   of a positive charge that is itself adsorbed onto the surface of the release layer but presents on its
   opposite side a net positive charge with which the negatively charged molecules in the ink may
   interact. Intermediate transfer members amenable to such treatment may, for example, comprise
   in their release layer silanol-, sylyl- or silane- modified or terminated polydialkyl-siloxane

   silicones and further details on suitable ITMs are disclosed in PCT Application No.
   PCT/IB2013/051743.
          Chemical agents suitable for the preparation of such conditioning solutions, if required,
   have relatively high charge density and can be polymers containing amine nitrogen atoms in a
 5 plurality of functional groups, which need not be the same and can be combined (e.g. primary,
   secondary, tertiary amines or quaternary ammonium salts). Though macromolecules having a
   molecular weight from a few hundred to a few thousand can be suitable conditioning agents, it is
   believed that polymers having a high molecular weight of 10,000 g/mole or more are preferable.
   Suitable conditioning agents include guar hydroxylpropyltrimonium chloride, hydroxypropyl
 0 guar hydroxypropyl-trimonium chloride, linear or branched polyethylene imine, modified
   polyethylene imine, vinyl pyrrolidone dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamide copolymer, vinyl
   caprolactam dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamide hydroxyethyl methacrylate, quaternized vinyl
   pyrrolidone    dimethylaminoethyl      methacrylate    copolymer,   poly(diallyldimethyl-ammonium
   chloride), poly(4-vinylpyridine) and polyallylamine. Further details on elective conditioning
 5 solutions suitable for the preparation of ink film constructions according to the present invention
   are disclosed in PCT Application No. PCT/IB2013/ 000757.
         The disclosure of the afore-mentioned applications of the same Applicant, incorporated by
   reference in their entirety as if fully set forth herein, may overlap with current disclosure, but it
   should be made clear that the present invention is not restricted to such a process, using the
 0 intermediate    transfer  members,     elective   conditioning  solutions,  and    ink compositions
   exemplified therein. Relevant parts of the disclosure of these applications are included herein for
   the convenience of the reader.
   Description of the Ink
         The inventors have found that that the inventive ink film constructions, if for instance
Z5 obtained by the above-described printing system and process, may require an ink or an inkjet ink
   having particular chemical and physical properties. These physical properties may include one or
   more thermo-rheological properties.
         According to one embodiment of the invention, there is provided an exemplary inkjet ink
   formulation (Example 1) containing:
30 Pigment: Jet Magenta DMQ (BASF)                                 2%
   Joncryl HPD 296 (35.5 % water solution) (BASF)                 30 %
   Glycerol (Aldrich)                                             20 %
   BYK 345 (BYK) polyether modified polydimethylsiloxane 0.5 %
                                                      ,in

  Water (distilled)                                 Balance to 100 %
        Nominally, the resin solution may be, or include, an acrylic styrene co-polymer (or
  co(ethylacrylate metacrylic acid) solution. The average molecular weight may be less than
  20,000 g/mole.
5 Preparation procedure:
        A pigment concentrate, containing pigment (10%), distilled water (70%) and resin, in the
  present case, Joncryl HPD 296 (20%), was made from the above-described components. The
  pigment, water and resin were mixed and milled using a homemade milling machine.
  Alternatively, the milling may be performed using any one of many commercially available
0 milling machines deemed suitable by one of ordinary skill in the art. The progress of milling was
  controlled by particle size measurement (Malvern, Nanosizer). The milling was stopped when
  the average particle size (d5 o) reached about 70 nanometers (nm). The rest of the components
  were then added to the pigment concentrate to produce the above-described exemplary inkjet ink
  formulation. After mixing, the ink was filtered through a 0.5-micrometer (pm) filter.
5        The viscosity of the solution was about 9 cP at 25'C. Surface tension at 25'C was
  approximately 25 mN/m.
        Various other milling procedures and milling apparatus will be apparent to those of
  ordinary skill in the art. Various commercially available nano-pigments may be used in the
  inventive ink formulations. These include pigment preparations such as Hostajet Magenta E5B
0 PT and Hostajet Black O-PT, both by Clariant as well as pigments demanding post-dispersion
  processes, such as Cromophtal Jet Magenta DMQ and Irgalite Blue GLO, both by BASF.
         One of ordinary skill in the art may readily recognize that various known colorants and
  colorant formulations may be used in the inventive ink or inkjet ink formulations. In one
  embodiment, such pigments and pigment formulations may include, or consist essentially of,
5 inkjet colorants and inkjet colorant formulations.
        Alternatively or additionally, the colorant may be a dye. Examples of dyes suitable for use
  in the ink formulations of the present invention include: Duasyn Yellow 3GF-SF liquid, Duasyn
  Acid Yellow XX-SF, Duasyn Red 3B-SF liquid, Duasynjet Cyan FRL-SF liquid (all
  manufactured by Clariant); Basovit Yellow 133, Fastusol Yellow 30 L, Basacid Red 495,
0 Basacid Red 510 Liquid, Basacid Blue 762 Liquid, Basacid Black X34 Liquid, Basacid Black
  X38 Liquid, Basacid Black X40 Liquid (all manufactured by BASF).
          The following examples         illustrate some ink compositions     in accordance    with
  embodiments of the invention. Printing tests employing such ink compositions in the method

   described in PCT application No. PCT/IB2013/051716 show good transfer to various paper and
   plastic substrates.

0 Ink Film Constructions
        Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1A is a magnified image of a plurality of inkjet ink
  drops disposed near a top surface of a fibrous (paper) substrate, according to a prior-art
  technology. In this prior art ink and substrate construction, the inkjet ink drops have penetrated
  the surface of the paper. Such a construction may be typical of various types of paper, including
5 uncoated paper, in which the paper may draw ink carrier solvent and pigment within the matrix
  of the paper fibers.
        Figure 1B is a magnified image of a plurality of exemplary ink film constructions, such as
  inkjet ink film constructions, according to one embodiment of the present invention. In contrast
  to the prior art ink and substrate construction provided in Figure 1A, the inventive inkjet ink film
0 construction may be characterized by well-defined individual ink films, disposed generally
  above, and adhering to, the fibrous substrate. The single-drop inkjet films shown in Figure 1B
  exhibit superior optical density. These characteristics are particularly notable when compared
  with the characteristics of the prior art ink and substrate construction, which exhibits poorly
  formed inkjet ink drops or splotches having a low optical density.
        A laser-microscope was used to produce comparative, highly magnified images of prior-art
  ink splotches disposed under a top surface of a sheet of paper. Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C are
  respective three-dimensional magnified images of a lithographic offset ink splotch (Figure 2A), a
  liquid electro-photography (LEP) of HP-Indigo ink splotch (Figure 2B), and an inkjet single
  drop ink film (Figure 2C) produced according to an embodiment of the present invention.
         The inkjet single-drop ink film (or individual ink dot) was produced using the inventive
  system and apparatus described herein, using the inventive ink formulation provided herein.

           The above-referenced ink splotches of the prior art are commercially available. The offset
   sample was produced by a Ryobi 755 press, using BestACK process ink by Roller Tiger (Toka
    Shikiso Chemical Industry). The LEP sample was produced by a HP Indigo 7500 digital press,
   using HP Indigo ink. With reference to the substrates, the uncoated substrates were Mondy 170
 5 gsm paper; the coated substrates were APP 170 gsm paper.
           Laser microscopy imaging was performed using an Olympus LEXT 3D measuring laser
   microscope, model OLS4000. The film (dot, drop, or splotch) height above each substrate and
   the surface roughness of each film or splotch analyzed were calculated by the microscope system
   in a semi-automatic fashion.
 0         The perimeter of the offset ink splotch and the perimeter of the LEP ink splotch have a
   plurality of protrusions or rivulets, and a plurality of inlets or recesses. These ink forms may be
   irregular, and/or discontinuous. By contrast, the inkjet ink dot (Figure 2C) produced according to
   the present invention has a manifestly rounded, convex, shape. The perimeter of the ink film is
   relatively smooth, regular, continuous and well defined.
 5         More particularly, projections of the ink film of the invention against the substrate surface
   (i.e., projections from a top view) tend to be rounded, convex projections that form a convex set,
   i.e., for every pair of points within the projection, every point on the straight line segment that
   joins them is also within the projection. Such a convex set is shown in Figure 2D. By sharp
   contrast, the rivulets and inlets in the projections of various prior-art define those projections as a
 0 non-convex sets, i.e., for at least one straight line segment within a particular projection, a
   portion of that straight line segment is disposed outside the projection, as illustrated in Figure 2E.
           It must be emphasized that ink images may contain an extremely large plurality of
   individual or single ink films. For example, a 5mm by 5mm ink image, at 600 dpi, may contain
   more than 10,000 of such single ink films. Therefore, it may be appropriate to statistically define
25 the ink film constructions of the present invention: at least 10%, at least 20%, or at least 30%,
   and more typically, at least 50%, at least 70%, or at least 90%, of the single ink dots, or
   projections thereof, may be convex sets. These ink dots are preferably selected at random.
           It must be further emphasized that ink images may not have crisp boundaries, particularly
   when those boundaries are viewed at high magnification. Therefore, it may be appropriate to
30 relax the definition of the convex set whereby non-convexities (rivulets or inlets) having a radial
   length Lr (as shown in Figure 2F) of up to 3,000nm, up to 1,500nm, up to 1,000nm, up to
    700nm, up to 500nm, up to 300nn, or up to 200nm, are ignored, excluded, or are "smoothed",
   whereby the ink film or ink film projection is considered to be a convex set. The radial length Lr

  is measured by drawing a radial line L from the center point C of the ink film image, through a
  particular rivulet or inlet. The radial length Lr is the distance between the actual edge of the
  rivulet or inlet, and a smoothed projection P, of the ink image, devoid of that rivulet or inlet, and
  matching the contour of the ink film image.
5        In relative terms, it may be appropriate to relax the definition of the convex set whereby
  non-convexities (rivulets or inlets) having a radial length of up to 15% of the film/drop/splotch
  diameter or average diameter, up to 10%, and more typically, up to 5%, up to 3%, up to 2%, or
  up to 1%, are ignored, excluded, or are "smoothed", as above, whereby the ink film or ink film
  projection is considered to be a convex set.
0       Figures 3A, 3B, and 3C show surface roughness and surface height measurements for the
  offset ink splotch, the LEP ink splotch, and the inkjet ink film provided in Figures 2A-2C. The
  instrumentally measured heights (H) or thicknesses of the three samples were 762 nm for the
  offset ink drop and 1104 nm for the LEP ink drop. By sharp contrast, the instrumentally
  measured height of the inventive inkjet ink film (Hilm) is 355 nm.
5       Repeating the above-described comparative study several times, using additional ink film
  specimens, appears to confirm these results for the prior art ink films. The LEP specimens
  typically had a height or thickness within a range of 900-1150 nm, while the lithographic offset
  specimens typically had a height or thickness within a range of 750-1200 nm.
        With regard to ink dots or films produced from jetted ink drops, we have found that the
0 maximum average supra-substrate thickness of the ink dot may be calculated from the following
  equation:
                              TAVG(MAX)  = VDROP /[AFILM *  RVOL]         (1)
  wherein:
  TAVG(MAX)        is the maximum average supra-substrate thickness;
5 VDROP            is the volume of the jetted drop, or a nominal or characteristic volume of a jetted
                   drop (e.g., a nominal volume provided by the inkjet head manufacturer or
                   supplier);
  AFILM            is the measured or calculated area of the ink dot; and
  RVOL             is a dimensionless ratio of the volume of the original ink to the volume of the
                   dried ink residue produced from that ink.
        By way of example, an ink dot disposed on a plastic printing substrate has an area of 1075
  square micrometers. The nominal size of the jetted drop is 10.0 ± 0.3 picoliters. RVOL was
  determined experimentally: a vessel containing 20.Oml of the ink was heated at 130'C until a dry

   residue was obtained. The residue had a volume of 1.8ml. Plugging into Equation (I), TAVG(MAX)
   =  10picoliters /[1075pm 2 * (20.0/1.8)]     = 837 nanometers.
         For generally round ink dots, the area of the ink dot may be calculated from the ink dot
   diameter. Moreover, we have found that the dimensionless ratio RVOL is generally about 10 for a
 5 wide variety of inkjet inks.
         While for inks that penetrate into the substrate, the actual average thickness may be
   somewhat less than TAVG(MAX), this calculation may reliably serve as an upper bound for the
   average thickness. Moreover, in the case of various plastic substrates, and in the case of various
   premium coated substrates, the maximum average supra-substrate thickness may substantially
 0 equal the average supra-substrate thickness. In the case of various commodity-coated substrates,
   the maximum average supra-substrate thickness may approach the average supra-substrate
   thickness, often within 100 nanometers, 200 nanometers, or 300 nanometers.
         With regard to ink dots or films produced from jetted ink drops, we have found that the
   maximum average supra-substrate thickness of the ink dot may be calculated from the following
 5 equation:
                  TAVG(MAX) =    [VDROP   *  PINK * FnRESIDUE ] / [AFILM * FILM]          (11)
   wherein:
   PINK             is the specific gravity of the ink;
   FnRESIDUE        is the weight of the dried ink residue divided by the weight of the original ink;
 0                  and
   PFILM            is the specific gravity of the ink.
          Typically, the ratio of PINK to PFILM is approximately 1, such that Equation (II) may be
   simplified to:
                            TAVG(MAX)  =   [VDROP  * FnRESIDUE]  / AFILM         (III)
25       For a wide variety of aqueous ink jet inks,      FnRESIDUE   roughly equals the weight fraction of
   solids in the ink jet ink.
         Using the above-described Olympus LEXT 3D measuring laser microscope, the height of
   above the substrate surface was measured for various ink dot constructions.
         Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is another, highly accurate measurement technique for
30 measuring height and determining ink dot thickness on a substrate. AFM measurements may be
   performed using commercially available apparatus, such as a Park Scientific Instruments Model
   Autoprobe CP, Scanning Probe Microscopy equipped with Proscan version 1.3 software (or

   later). The use of AFM is described in depth in the literature, for example, by Renmei Xu, et al.,
   "The Effect of Ink Jet Papers Roughness on Print Gloss and Ink Film Thickness" [Department of
   Paper Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Imaging Center for Ink and Printability, Western
   Michigan University (Kalamazoo, MI)].
 5        With regard to the ink film constructions of the present invention, the inventors have found
   that the thickness of the dry ink film on the substrate may be adjusted by modifying the inkjet
   ink formulation. To obtain a lower dot thickness, such modifying may entail at least one of the
   following:
               " reducing the resin to pigment ratio;
 0             *   selecting a resin or resins enabling adequate film transfer, even with a reduced
                   resin to pigment ratio;
               e   utilizing finer pigment particles;
               e   reducing the absolute quantity of pigment.
          To obtain thicker dots, at least one of the opposite modifications (e.g., increasing the resin
 5 to pigment ratio) may be made.
          Such changes in the formulation may necessitate, or make advantageous, various
   modifications in the process operating conditions. The inventors have found that lower resin to
   pigment ratios may require a relatively high transfer temperature.
          For a given inkjet ink formulation, an elevated transfer temperature may reduce ink film
 0 thickness. Increased pressure of the pressure roller or cylinder toward the impression cylinder
   during the transfer of the residue film to a substrate at the impression station may also reduce ink
   film thickness. Also, ink film thickness may be reduced by increasing the time of contact
   between the substrate and the intermediate transfer member, interchangeably termed herein an
   "image transfer member" and both abbreviated ITM.
25        All this notwithstanding, a practical minimum characteristic (i.e., median) thickness or
   average thickness for ink films produced according to the present invention may be about
   100nm. More typically, such ink films may have a thickness of at least 125nm, at least 150nm, at
   least 175nm, at least 200nm, at least 250nm, at least 300nm, at least 350nm, at least 400nm, at
   least 450nm, or at least 500nm.
30        Using the above-provided film thickness guidelines, the inventors are able to obtain
   inventive film constructions having a characteristic thickness or average thickness of at least
   600nm, at least 700nm, at least 800nm, at least 1,000nm, at least 1,200nm, or at least 1,500nm.
   The characteristic thickness or average thickness of a single drop film (or an individual ink dot)

   may be at most about 2,000nm, at most 1,800nm, at most 1,500nm, at most 1,200nm, at most
   1,000nm, or at most 900nm. More typically, the characteristic thickness or average thickness of a
   single drop film may be at most 800nm, at most 700nm, at most 650nm, at most 600nm, at most
   500nm, at most 450nm, at most 400nm, or at most 350nm.
 5          Using the film thickness guidelines delineated hereinabove, the inventors are able to obtain
   inventive film constructions in which a characteristic thickness or average thickness of the ink
   film may be within a range of 100nm, 125nm or 150nm up to 1,800nm, 1,500nm, 1,200nm,
   1,000nm, 800nm, 700nm, 600nm, 550nm, 500nm, 450nm, 400nm, or 350nm. More typically, the
   characteristic thickness or average thickness of the ink film may be within a range of 175nm,
 0 200nm, 225nm or 250nm up to 800nm, 700nm, 650nm, 600nm, 550nm, 500nm, 450nm, or
   400nm. Suitable optical density and optical uniformity may be obtained, using the system,
   process, and ink formulations of the present invention.
   Aspect Ratio
            The inventors have found that the diameter of an individual ink dot in the ink film
 5 constructions of the present invention may be adjusted, inter alia, by selection of a suitable ink
   delivery system for applying the ink (e.g., jetting) onto the ITM, and by adjusting the ink
   formulation properties (e.g., surface tension) to the requirements of the particular ink head.
            This ink film diameter,      Ddot,  or the average dot diameter on the substrate surface,         Ddot
   average,  may be at least 10 micrometers, at least 15 p.m, or at least 20 im, and more typically, at
 0 least 30 tm, at least 40 pum, at least 50 pm, at least 60 pm, or at least 75 pm.            Ddot or Ddot average
   may be at most 300 micrometers, at most 250 pm, or at most 200 pm, and more typically, at
   most 175 tm, at most 150 tm, at most 120 ptm, or at most 100 ptm.
            Generally   Ddot or Ddot average may be in the range of 10-300 micrometers, 10-250 prm, 15
   250 pim, 15-200 [Lm, 15-150 pm, 15-120 pm, or 15-100 pim. More typically, with the currently
!5 used ink formulations, and a particular ink head,         Ddot  or Ddot average may be in the range of 20-120
   ptm, 25-120 ptm, 30-120 pm, 30-100 tm, 40-120 pm, 40-100 tm, or 40-80 pm.
            Each single-drop ink film or individual ink dot is characterized by a dimensionless aspect
   ratio defined by:
                                                   Raspect = Ddot/Hdot
30 wherein    Raspect is the aspect ratio; Ddot  is a diameter, characteristic diameter, average diameter, or
   longest diameter of the dot; and       Hdot is a thickness, characteristic thickness, or average thickness
   of the dot, or the height of the top surface of dot with respect to the substrate.

           The aspect ratio may be at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, or at least 30, and more
  typically, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 75. In many cases, the aspect ratio may be at
  least at least 95, at least 110, or at least 120. The aspect ratio is typically below 200 or below
  175.
5 Penetration
         In the ink film constructions of the present invention, the ink dot may essentially be
  laminated onto a top surface of the printing substrate. As described herein, the form of the dot
  may be determined or largely determined prior to the transfer operation, and the dot is
  transferred as an integral unit to the substrate. This integral unit may be substantially devoid of
0 solvent, such that there may be no penetration of any kind of material from the blanket transfer
  member into, or between, substrate fibers. The continuous dot, which may largely contain
  organic polymeric resin and colorant, adheres to, or forms a laminated layer on, the top surface
  of the fibrous printing substrate.
         Such continuous dots are typically produced by various inkjetting technologies, such as
5 drop-on-demand and continuous jetting technologies.
         The organic polymeric resins used in conjunction with the present invention are typically
  water soluble or water dispersible.
         Figures 3D and 3E provide schematic cross-sectional views of an inventive ink film
  construction 300 and an inkjet ink splotch or film construction 370 of the prior art, respectively.
0 Referring now to Figure 3E, inkjet ink film construction 370 includes a single-drop ink splotch
  305 adhering to, or laminated to, a plurality of substrate fibers 320 in a particular continuous area
  of a fibrous printing substrate 350. Fibrous printing substrate 350 may be, by way of example, an
  uncoated paper such as bond, copy, or offset paper. Fibrous printing substrate 350 may also be
  one of various commodity coated fibrous printing substrates, such as a coated offset paper.
         A portion of ink splotch 305 is disposed below the top surface of substrate 350, between
  fibers 320. Various components of the ink, including a portion of the colorant, may penetrate the
  top surface along with the ink carrier solvent, to at least partially fill a volume 380 disposed
  between fibers 320. As shown, a portion of the colorant may diffuse or migrate underneath fibers
  320, to a volume 390 disposed beneath fibers 320. In some cases (not shown), some of the
0 colorant may permeate into the fibers.
         By sharp contrast, inventive ink film construction 300 (in Figure 3D) includes an integral
  continuous ink dot such as individual ink dot 310, disposed on, and fixedly adhering (or

   laminated) to, a top surface of a plurality of substrate fibers 320, in a particular continuous area
   of fibrous printing substrate 350. The adhesion or lamination may be, primarily or substantially,
   a physical bond. The adhesion or lamination may have little, or substantially no, chemical
   bonding character or more specifically, no ionic bonding character.
5         Ink dot 310 contains at least one colorant dispersed in an organic polymeric resin. Within
   the particular continuous area of fibrous substrate 350, there exists at least one direction (as
   shown by arrows 360 -- several directions) perpendicular to the top surface of printing substrate
   350. With respect to all the directions normal to this top surface over all of the dot area, ink dot
   310 is disposed entirely above the area. The volume 380 between fibers 320 and the volume 390
0  underneath fibers 320 are devoid, or substantially devoid, of colorant, resin, and any and all
   components of the ink.
          The thickness  (Hdot) of single-drop ink film or individual ink dot 310 may be at most
   1,800nm, at most 1,500nm, at most 1,200nm, at most 1,000nm, or at most 800nm, and more
   typically, at most 650nm, at most 600nm, at most 550nm, at most 500nm, at most 450nm, or at
5  most 400nm. The thickness      (Hdot) of single-drop ink dot 310 may be at least 50nm, at least
   100nm, or at least 125nm, and more typically, at least 150nm, at least 175nm, at least 200nm, or
   at least 250nm.The extent of penetration of an ink into a printing substrate may be quantitatively
   determined using various analytical techniques, many of which will be known to those of
   ordinary skill in the art. Various commercial analytical laboratories may perform such
0  quantitative determination of the extent of penetration.
          These analytical techniques include the use of various staining techniques such as osmium
   tetroxide staining (see Patrick Echlin, "Handbook of Sample Preparation for Scanning Electron
   Microscopy and X-Ray Microanalysis" (Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009, pp.140
   143).
5         One alternative to staining techniques may be particularly suitable to inks containing
   metals such as copper. Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) was
   performed using a TOF-SIMS V Spectrometer [Ion-ToF (Miinster, Germany)]. This apparatus
   provides elemental and molecular information with regard to the uppermost layer of organic and
   inorganic surfaces, and also provides depth profiling and imaging having depth resolution on the
0O nanometric scale, submicron lateral resolution and chemical sensitivity on the order of 1 ppm.
          Translation of the raw data of the TOF-SIMS into concentration may be performed by
   normalizing the signals obtained to the carbon (C+) concentration measured by X-ray
   Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), in the sample. The XPS data was obtained using a Thermo

   VG Scientific Sigma Probe (England). Small area chemical analysis of solid surfaces with
   chemical bonding information was obtained by using a microfocused (from 15 to 400 prm)
   monochromated x-ray source. Angle resolved information is obtained with and without tilting
   the sample. This enables depth profiling with good depth resolution.
 5       As a baseline, the atomic concentration of copper within a fibrous paper substrate was
   measured, as a function of depth. The atomic concentration of copper was found to be
   substantially zero at the surface, down to a depth of several micrometers. This procedure was
   repeated for two cyan-colored inkjet ink film constructions of the prior art, and for a cyan
   colored ink film construction of the present invention.
 0       Figure 3F provides a graph plotting the atomic concentration of copper [Cu] within the ink
   dot and within the fibrous paper substrate, as a function of the approximate depth, within a first
   cyan-colored inkjet ink film construction of the prior art. The initial [Cu], measured near the top
   surface of the cyan-containing ink film construction, was approximately 0.8 atomic %. Within a
   depth of about 100nm, [Cu] dropped steadily to about 0.1 atomic %. Over a depth range of about
 5 100nm - 1,000nm, [Cu] dropped from about 0.1 atomic % to about zero. Thus, it is evident that
   the inkjet ink pigment has penetrated into the fibrous paper substrate, possibly attaining a
   penetration depth of at least 700nm, at least 800nm, or at least 900nm.
         Figure 3G provides a graph plotting the atomic concentration of copper within the ink dot
   construction, as a function of the approximate depth, within a second cyan-colored inkjet ink
 0 film construction of the prior art. The initial atomic concentration of copper [Cu] within the ink
   dot construction, measured near the top surface, was approximately 0.02 atomic %. This
   concentration was generally maintained over a depth of about 3,000nm. Over a depth range of
   about 3,000nm to almost 6,000nm, [Cu] dropped very gradually to about 0.01 atomic %. It
   would appear that this prior-art construction has little or no ink film on the surface of the
!5 substrate, and that penetration of the pigment into the substrate was pronounced (at least 5-6
   micrometers).
         Figure 3H provides graphs plotting the atomic concentration of copper within the ink dot
   and within the fibrous paper substrate, as a function of the approximate depth, within a cyan
   colored ink film construction of the present invention. The two graphs represent measurements
30 made at two different positions ("Sample 1" and "Sample 2") on the inventive ink dot
   construction. The initial atomic concentration of copper [Cu], measured near the top surface, was
   approximately 0.2 or 0.4 atomic % for Sample 1 and Sample 2, respectively. Over a depth of
   about 75 to about 100nm, [Cu] steadily increased to about 0.5 or 0.7 atomic % for the respective

  Samples. At a depth of about 100nm to about 175nm, [Cu] began to drop sharply, attaining a
  copper concentration of substantially zero at a depth of 200-250nm, for both Samples. It would
  appear that the inventive construction is solely disposed on the surface of the substrate, and that
  pigment penetration into the substrate was negligible or substantially negligible, both in terms of
5 penetration depth and in terms of the penetration quantity or fraction.
        Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors believe that the initial rise in [Cu]
  over the depth of 75-100nm may be attributed to the orientation of the ink dot due to micro
  contours of the substrate, and to surface roughness of the ink dot itself. Similarly, the drop in
  [Cu] to substantially zero at a depth of 200-250nm may be attributed to the micro-contours of the
0 substrate: for a given cross-section within, and generally parallel to the face or top surface of the
  substrate, some of the ink dot may be present (see dashed line in Figure 3D).                   This
  notwithstanding, the ink dot being is entirely disposed above the substrate, with respect to a
  direction perpendicular to the substrate surface.
  Surface Roughness
5       Using laser microscopy imaging and other techniques, the inventors have observed that the
  top surface of the ink dots in the ink film constructions of the present invention may be
  characterized by a low surface roughness, particularly when the substrates of those constructions
  have a high paper (or substrate) gloss.
        Without wishing to be limited by theory, the inventors believe that the relative flatness or
0 smoothness of the ink film constructions of the present invention may largely be attributed to the
  smoothness of the release layer on the surface of the ITM, and to the inventive system and
  process in which the emerging ink film surface substantially complements that of that surface
  layer, and in which the developing ink film image may substantially retain or completely retain
  that complementary topography through the transfer onto the printing substrate.
        Referring now to Figure 4A, Figure 4A is an image of the surface of a release layer of an
  ITM or blanket used in accordance with the present invention. While the surface may be
  nominally flat, various pockmarks (recesses) and protuberances, typically of the order of 1-5 pim,
  may be observed. Many of these marks have sharp, irregular features. An image of an ink dot
  surface produced using this blanket, provided in Figure 4B, displays topographical features that
  are strikingly similar in nature to those shown in Figure 4A. The dot surface is peppered with a
  large plurality of marks having sharp, irregular features, which strongly resemble (and are within
  the same size range as) the irregular marks in the blanket surface.

          A smoother blanket was installed; Figure 4C provides an image of the release layer of this
   blanket. The irregular pockmarks of Figure 4A are conspicuously absent. Dispersed on the
   highly smooth surface are highly circular surface blemishes, perhaps made by air bubbles,
   typically having a diameter of about 1-2 pim. An image of an ink dot surface produced using this
 5 blanket, provided in Figure 4D, displays topographical features that are strikingly similar in
   nature to those shown in Figure 4C. This image has virtually no distinctive pockmarks, but has a
   number of highly circular surface blemishes that are strikingly similar in size and form to those
   shown of the blanket surface.
   Dot Perimeter Characterization
 0        The perimeter of various ink dots or films of the prior art may characteristically have a
   plurality of protrusions or rivulets, and a plurality of inlets or recesses. These ink forms may be
   irregular, and/or discontinuous. By sharp contrast, the inkjet ink dot produced according to the
   present invention characteristically has a manifestly rounded, convex, circular shape. The
   perimeter of the ink dot of the invention may be relatively smooth, regular, continuous and well
 5 defined. Ink dot roundness, convexity, and edge raggedness are structural parameters used to
   evaluate or characterize shapes, or optical representations thereof.
          It can readily be observed, by comparing the magnified images of the prior-art ink forms of
   Figure 1A with the inventive ink dots of Figure IB, or by comparing the magnified images of the
   prior-art ink forms of Figures 2A and 2B with the inventive ink dots of Figure 2C, that the
 0 appearance of the ink dots of the present invention is manifestly distinct from these prior-art ink
   forms. That which is readily observed by the human eye may be quantified using image
   processing techniques. Various characterizations of the ink forms are described hereinbelow,
   after a description of the image acquisition method.
   Acquisition Method
 5     (1) For each of the known printing technologies to be compared in the study, single dots,
   splotches, or film images printed on coated paper and on uncoated paper were used. In the initial
   tests, the coated paper used was Condat Gloss® 135 gsm, or similar; the uncoated paper used
   was Multi Fine Uncoated, 130 gsm, or similar. Subsequently, a wide variety of substrates were
   used, including numerous coated and uncoated fibrous substrates, and various plastic printing
30 substrates.
       (2) Regarding the inventive printing technology of the Applicant, single drop dot images
   were printed on coated paper and on uncoated paper. Care was taken to select substrates having
   similar characteristics to the substrates of the known ink-dot constructions used in (1).

     (3)   The acquisition of the dot images was performed using an OLS4000 (Olympus)
  microscope. Those of ordinary skill in the art know how to adjust the microscope to achieve the
  requisite focus, brightness and contrast, so that the image details will be highly visible. These
  image details include the dot contour, the color variance within the dot area, and the fibrous
5 structure of the substrate surface.
     (4) The images were taken with an X100 optical zoom lens having a resolution of
  129micrometersX129micrometers. This high resolution may be essential in obtaining fine details
  of the dot and of the fibrous structure of the substrate surface.
     (5) The images were saved in uncompressed format (Tiff) having a resolution of 1024x1024
0 pixels. Compression formats may lose image data.
     (6) Generally, a single dot or splotch was evaluated for each printing technology. From a
  statistical point of view, however, it may be advantageous to obtain 15 dot images (at least) for
  each type of hard-copy print being analyzed, and to manually select the 10 (at least) most
  representative dot images for image processing. The selected dot images should be representative
5 in terms of dot shape, contour and color variation within the dot area. Another approach to print
  dot sampling, termed "field of view", is described hereinbelow.
  Dot Contour Computation
          The dot images were loaded to the image-processing software (ImageXpert). Each image
0 was loaded in each of the Red, Green and Blue channels. The processing channel was selected
  based on a highest visibility criterion. For example, for cyan dots, the Red channel typically
  yielded the best dot feature visibility, and was thus selected for the image processing step; the
  Green channel was typically most suitable for a magenta dot. The dot edge contour was detected
  (automatically computed), based on a single threshold. Using a "full screen view" mode on a
5 21.5" display, this threshold was chosen manually for each image, such that the computed edge
  contour would best match the real and visible dot edge. Since a single image-channel was
  processed, the threshold was a gray value (from 0 to 255, the gray value being a non color
  value).
         A computed perimeter value was obtained from the image-processing software (e.g.,
O ImageXpert), the perimeter value being the sum of all distances between the adjacent, connected
  pixels at the edge of the dot or splotch. If, for example, the XY coordinates for adjacent pixels
  are (x1, yl) and (x2, y2), the distance is 9[(x2-x1)2      +  (y2-yl) 2 ], while the perimeter equals

                  2
   1{(\[(xi+1-x)    + (yiI-yi) 2 ]}
          In various embodiments of the invention, it is desired to measure the length of the
   perimeter of an ink dot. An alternative method for measuring the perimeter length will now be
5  described. As a first step, an image comprising an ink dot is used as input for an algorithm that
   outputs perimeter length. The pixel dimension MxN of the image may be stored in a two-element
   array or an ordered pair imagepixel size. An example of the value of the image-pixel size is
   1280,760 - in this example M= 1280 and N=760. This corresponds to an image 1280 pixels in the
   horizontal axis and 760 pixels in the vertical axis. Subsequently, the image magnification ratio or
0  scale is obtained and stored in variable image magnification. One example of variable
   image magnfication is 500. When comparing perimeters between ink dots in first and second
   images it is mandatory that the variables imagepixelsize and image magnification of the two
   images are equal. It is now possible to calculate the corresponding length of one square pixel
   i.e. the side length in a real-world length units (e.g. microns) or a pixel. This value is stored in a
5  variable pixelpitch. One example of the variable pixelpitch is 0.05 pim. The image is now
   converted to grayscale by methods known to the skilled artisan. One proposed method is
   converting the input image, the image typically in an sRGB color space, to the L*a*b* color
   space. Once the image is in the Lab color space, the values for the variables a and b are changed
   to zero. It is now possible to apply an edge detection operator to the image. The preferred
0  operator is a Canny edge detection operator. However, any operator known in the art may be
   applied. The operators are not limited to first order derivatives, such as the canny operator, but
   rather open to second derivatives as well. Furthermore, a combination of operators may be used
   in order to obtain results that may be compared between operators and subsequently remove
   "unwanted" edges. It may be favorable to apply a smoothing operator such as a Gaussian blur
5  prior to applying the edge detection operator. The threshold level applied when applying the
   edge detection operator is such that an edge that forms an endless loop is first obtaining in the
   area between the formerly described minimal circumference Ink dot engulfing circle and the
   maximal circumference ink dot enclosed circle. A thinning operator is now implemented to
   render the endless loop edge substantially one pixel wide. Any pixel that is not a part of the
0O endless loop edge has its L* value change to zero, while any pixel that is part of the endless loop
   edge has its L* value change to 100. The endless loop edge is defined as the perimeter of the ink
   dot. A pixel link is defined as a straight line connecting to pixels. Each pixel along the perimeter
   incorporates two pixel links, a first pixel link and a second pixel link. These two pixel links
   define a pixel link path within a single pixel. In this method of computing perimeter length, each

   pixel is a square pixel. Therefore, each pixel link may form a line from the center of the pixel to
   one of eight possible nodes. The possible nodes being the corners of the pixel or a midpoint
   between two neighboring corners of the pixel. Nodes at the comers of the pixels are of the type
   node_1 one nodes at the midpoint between two corners are of type node_2. As such, there are
 5 six possibilities of pixel link paths within a pixel. These can be categorized into three groups.
   Group A, B, and C. Each group has its own corresponding coefficient, namely, coefficientA,
   coefficient _B, and coefficient C. The value of coefficientA is 1, the value of coefficient B is
   the sqrt(2), and the value of coefficientC is (1+sqrt(2))/2. Group A contains pixels whose pixel
   link path coincides with nodes of type node_2. Group B contains pixels whose pixel link path
 0 coincides with nodes of type node_1. Group C contains pixels whose pixel link path coincides
   with nodes of type node_1 and type node_2. It is now possible to calculate the pixel length of the
   perimeter. The pixel length of the perimeter is calculated by summing all of the pixels in the
   perimeter multiplied by their corresponding coefficient. This value is stored in variable
   perimeterpixel length. It is now possible to calculate the actual length of the ink dot perimeter.
 5 This is done by multiplying perimeterpixel length by pixelpitch.
   Roundness
          A dimensionless roundness factor (ER), may be defined by:
                                              ER   = P 2 /(47t-A)
 0 wherein P is the measured or calculated perimeter, and A is the measured or computed area
   within the ink film, dot or splotch. For a perfectly smooth and circular ink dot, ER equals 1.
          The deviation from a round, smooth shape may be represented by the expression (ER - 1).
   For a perfectly circular, idealized ink dot, this expression equals zero.
          The R-square of the roundness factor may be computed for each of the 10 most
25 representative dot images selected for each type of printing technology, and averaged into a
   single value.
          For ink film constructions in which the fibrous substrate (e.g., paper) is uncoated, or for
   ink film constructions in which the fibrous substrate is coated with a coating such as the
   commodity coating in coated offset paper (or such as coatings which enable the carrier from
 0 traditional water-based inkjet ink to reach the paper fibers), the deviation from a round, smooth
   round shape [(ER - 1), henceforth, "deviation"] for the ink dots of the present invention is not
   ideal, and will exceed 0.

          Exemplary ink film images disposed on coated (Figure 5A) and uncoated (Figure 5B)
   substrates are provided for the following printers: HP DeskJet 9000 (1); Digital press: HP Indigo
   7500 (2); Lithographic Offset: Ryobi 755 (3); and Xerox DC8000 (4), and for the inventive
   digital printing technology (5). These ink film images were obtained generally according to the
5  image acquisition method detailed hereinabove. Next to each original image is provided a
   corresponding processed, black and white image in which the image-processor computed
   contour of the ink dot, film, or splotch is highlighted, and in which the computed contours are
   manifestly similar to the contours of the original images.
          For all tested coated fibrous (paper) substrates, the typical, individual inventive ink dots
0  exhibited a deviation from a round, smooth shape (ER - 1) of 0.16 to 0.27. By sharp contrast, the
   deviation from roundness of the coated prints of the various prior-art technologies ranged from
   1.65 to 7.13.
          For all tested uncoated fibrous (paper) substrates, the typical, individual inventive ink dots
   exhibited a deviation (ER - 1) of 0.28 to 0.89. On each of these substrates, some of the inventive
5  ink dots exhibited a deviation (ER - 1) of at most 0.7, at most 0.6, at most 0.5, at most 0.4, at
   most 0.35, at most 0.3, at most 0.25, or at most 0.20.
          By sharp contrast, the deviation from roundness of ink films in the uncoated prints of the
   various prior-art technologies ranged from 2.93 to 14.87.
          An additional study was performed on 19 fibrous substrates of varying physical and
0  chemical properties. The substrates included coated and uncoated substrates, and wood-free and
   mechanical substrates. The substrates are characterized by differences in thickness, density,
   roughness (e.g., Bendtsen number) or smoothness (gloss), etc. These substrates are identified
   and partially characterized in Table 1.
          In the case of several substrates, the deviation from roundness of the inventive ink dot
5  constructions is compared with ink images produced by a commercial inkjet printer (using
   compatible ink cartridges provided by the manufacturer) in the bar graphs provided in Figure 5C.
          It must be emphasized that in this additional study, the ink-film constructions of the
   present invention were produced on an inventive pilot, semi-automatic digital printing press, in
   which the transfer of the ink dots from the ITM to the printing substrate is performed manually,
0O and consequently, with an impression pressure that may be somewhat lower, and more variable,
   than the previously described commercial prototype of a fully-automatic digital printing press of
   the present invention.

          For example, substrate number 6, Condat Gloss 135, is the same substrate used above for
   the inventive ink dot shown in Figure 5A. However, the deviation from roundness achieved by a
   typical ink dot was 0.362, which represents a larger deviation than the deviations (0.16 to 0.27)
   of all of the inventive ink dots printed by the commercial prototype of the inventive digital press
5  printer. However, a portion (albeit lower) of the inventive ink dots produced on the pilot, semi
   automatic digital printing press attained deviations as low or lower than the lowest typical
   deviation (0.16) achieved on the commercial prototype digital press printer.

10
          Considering coated and uncoated fibrous (paper) substrates together, the deviation from
   roundness of the inventive ink dots is greater than zero, and may be at least 0.01, at least 0.02, or

   at least 0.03. For each of the 19 tested fibrous substrates provided in Table 1, at least some of
   the inventive ink dots exhibited a deviation from roundness (on both uncoated and coated fibrous
   substrates) of at most 0.30, at most 0.25, at most 0.20, at most 0.15, or at most 0.12.
          The inventive ink dots, when adhering to coated (or commodity-coated) fibrous substrates,
 5 may typically exhibit a deviation of at most 0.20, at most 0.18, at most 0.16, at most 0.14, at
   most 0.12, or at most 0.10. For each of the coated substrates provided in Table 1, at least some of
   the inventive ink dots exhibited a deviation from roundness of at most 0.25, at most 0.20, at most
   0.15, at most 0.12, at most 0.10, at most 0.09, at most 0.08, at most 0.07, or at most 0.06.
           Because, as noted above, ink images may contain an extremely large plurality of
 0 individual ink dots or single drop ink films, it may be meaningful to statistically define the
   inventive ink film constructions wherein at least 20% or at least 30%, and in some cases, at least
   50%, at least 70%, or at least 90%, of the inventive ink dots (or inventive single-drop ink dots),
   disposed on any uncoated or coated (or commodity-coated) fibrous substrate, and randomly
   selected, may exhibit a deviation from roundness that is at least 0.01 or at least 0.02, and may be
 5 at most 0.8, at most 0.65, at most 0.5, at most 0.35, at most 0.3, at most 0.25, at most 0.2, at most
   0.15, at most 0.12, or at most 0.10.
         As with a single ink dot or an individual single-drop ink dot, at least 20% or at least 30%,
   and more typically, at least 50%, at least   7 0%,  or at least 90%, of the inventive ink dots (or the
   inventive single-drop ink dots), disposed on any coated (or commodity-coated) fibrous substrate,
 0 and randomly selected, may exhibit a deviation from roundness that is at least 0.01 or at least
   0.02, and may be at most 0.8, at most 0.65, at most 0.5, at most 0.35, or at most 0.3, and more
   typically, at most 0.25, at most 0.2, at most 0.15, at most 0.12, at most 0.10, at most 0.08, at most
   0.07, or at most 0.06.
         Additional characterizations pertaining to deviation from roundness are provided
25 hereinbelow.
   Convexity
         As described hereinabove, the ink dots or films of the prior art may characteristically have
   a plurality of protrusions or rivulets, and a plurality of inlets or recesses. These ink forms may be
   irregular, and/or discontinuous. By sharp contrast, the inkjet ink film produced according to the
30 present invention characteristically has a manifestly rounded, convex, circular shape. Dot
   convexity, or deviation therefrom, is a structural parameter that may be used to evaluate or
   characterize shapes, or optical representations thereof.

         The image acquisition method may be substantially identical to that described hereinabove.
   Convexity Measurement
         The dot images were loaded to the image-processing software (ImageXpert). Each image
   was loaded in each of the Red, Green and Blue channels. The processing channel was selected
5  based on a highest visibility criterion. For example, for cyan dots, the Red channel typically
   yielded the best dot feature visibility, and was thus selected for the image processing step; the
   Green channel was typically most suitable for a magenta dot. The dot edge contour was detected
   (automatically computed), based on a single threshold. Using a "full screen view" mode on a
   21.5" display, this threshold was chosen manually for each image, such that the computed edge
0  contour would best match the real and visible dot edge. Since a single image-channel was
   processed, the threshold was a gray value (from 0 to 255, the gray value being a non color
   value).
         A MATLAB script was created to compute the ratio between the area of the minimal
   convex shape that bounds the dot contour and the actual area of the dot. For each ink dot image,
5  the (X,Y) set of points of the dot edge contour, created by ImageXpert, was loaded to MATLAB.
         In order to reduce the sensitivity of measurement to noise, the dot edge was passed through
   a Savitzky-Golay filter (image-processing low-pass filter) to slightly smooth the edge contour,
   but without appreciably modifying the raggedness characteristic thereof. A window frame size of
   5 pixels was found to be generally suitable.
0        Subsequently, a minimal-area convex shape was produced to bound the smoothed edge
   contour. The convexity ratio between the convex shape area (CSA) and the actual (calculated)
   dot or film area (AA) was then computed as follows:
                                              CX  = AA/CSA
   The deviation from this convexity ratio, or "non-convexity", is represented by 1-CX, or DCdt.
         For the above-described exemplary ink dot images disposed on coated (Figure 5A) and
   uncoated (Figure 5B) substrates, the convex shape area (CSA) is shown surrounding the actual
   dot area (AA), and the convexity ratio is provided in percentage form.
         In the ink film images of Figure 5A, disposed on coated substrates, the convexity of the
   print images of the various prior-art technologies ranged from 87.91% to 94.97% (~0.879 to
0O 0.950 in fractional form), corresponding to a deviation from convexity of 0.050 to 0.121. By
   sharp contrast, the inventive ink dot exhibited a convexity of 99.48% (~0.995), corresponding to
   a deviation from convexity of about 0.005. This deviation is about 1/10 to 1/25 of the deviation

   exhibited by the various prior-art technologies. In absolute terms, the deviation is at least 0.04
   less than the deviation exhibited by the various prior-art technologies.
           The difference between the inventive dot images and those of the various prior-art
   technologies may be more striking on uncoated substrates. In the ink film images of Figure 5B,
 5 disposed on uncoated substrates, the convexity of the print images of the various prior-art
   technologies ranged from 65.58% to 90.19% (~0.656 to 0.902 in fractional form), corresponding
   to a deviation from convexity of 0.344 to 0.098. By sharp contrast, the inventive ink dot
   exhibited a convexity of 98.45% (~0.985), corresponding to a deviation from convexity of about
   0.015. This deviation is at least 1/6 to 1/20 of the deviation exhibited by the various prior-art
 0 technologies. In absolute terms, the deviation is at least 0.08 less than the deviation exhibited by
   the various prior-art technologies.
          Another study, described hereinabove, was performed, in which the ink-film constructions
   of the present invention were produced on 19 different fibrous substrates. In Table 1, the non
   convexity of typical inventive dots is provided. The non-convexity of the ink dots in the ink-film
 5 constructions is graphically presented in the bar graphs provided in Figure 5D.
          As in the deviation from roundness study, the printed dots of the present invention exhibit
   superior convexity with respect to the prior art images, for any given substrate, coated or
   uncoated.
          For all 19 tested fibrous substrates, typical inventive ink dots exhibited a non-convexity of
 0 0.004 to 0.021. For each of the 19 tested fibrous substrates, at least some of the inventive ink
   dots exhibited a non-convexity of at most 0.018, at most 0.016, at most 0.015, at most 0.014, or

25 Reference Ink
          The ink dots in the ink dot constructions of the present invention may exhibit consistently
   good shape properties (e.g., convexity, roundness, edge raggedness, and the like), irrespective, to
   a large degree, of the particular, local topographical features of the substrate, and irrespective, to
   some degree, of the type of printing substrate (e.g., commodity-coated or uncoated printing
30 substrates).   However, the shape properties of the ink dots in the ink dot constructions of the
   present invention are not completely independent of the type of printing substrate, as evidenced
   by the bottom frames of Figures 5A (coated fibrous substrate) vs. the bottom frames of Figures

   5B (uncoated fibrous substrate). The quality of ink dots in various known printing technologies,
   and in direct aqueous inkjetting technologies in particular, may vary more substantially with the
   type of printing substrate.
         A reference inkjet ink, along with a reference printing method therefor, may be used to
 5 structurally define the various optical properties of ink dot constructions on a substrate to
   substrate basis, by normalizing those properties to the printing substrate.
          The reference ink contained 15% Basacid Black X34 liquid (BASF), 60% propylene
   glycol, and 25% distilled water. The dye was added to a mixture of water and propylene glycol.
   After 5 minutes of stirring, the ink was passed through a 0.2 micrometer filter. The reference ink
 0 composition is simple, and the components are generic, or at least commercially available. In the
   event that Basacid Black X34 liquid (BASF) is not available, a similar black inkjet colorant may
   be substituted therefor. In any event, a supply of the reference ink may be obtained from Landa
   Corporation, POB 2418, Rehovot 7612301, Israel.
          The reference ink was printed using a FUJIFILM Dimatix Materials Printer, DMP-2800,
 5 equipped with a 10 pL print head, DMC-1 1610. The printing parameters were set as follows:
   Ink Temperature: 25'C
   Substrate Temperature: 25' C
   Firing Voltage: 25 V
   Meniscus Setpoint: 2.0 (inches of water)
 0 Distance from the print head to the substrate: 1 mm.
          The printing apparatus is commercially available. If unavailable, a functionally equivalent
   (or substantially functionally equivalent) printer may be used. Alternatively, such printing
   apparatus may be available courtesy of Landa Corporation, POB 2418, Rehovot 7612301, Israel.
          The reference inkjet ink was prepared and printed onto various printing substrates, as
25 described hereinabove. The printed dots were subjected to image processing for characterization
   of roundness and convexity.
         Figure 5E-1 provides comparative bar graphs of the deviation from roundness for ink dots
   produced according to some embodiments of the present invention, vs. ink dots produced using
   the above-described reference ink formulation and printing method. The comparative study was
30 conducted using 10 fibrous substrates of varying physical and chemical properties; these
   included both coated and uncoated substrates. The substrates are identified and partially
   characterized in Table 2, which further provides the deviation from roundness results of the

   comparative study, for each of the 10 fibrous substrates.
          It is manifest that for all fibrous substrates, (commodity) coated and uncoated, the
   inventive dot constructions exhibit lower deviations from roundness (ER-1               or DRdot).   The
   highest value of DRdot, 0.19, obtained for an uncoated substrate (Hadar Top), is still less than 1/5
 5 of the lowest roundness deviation value of the reference ink dots (RDR), 1.16, obtained for a
   coated "silk" substrate (Sappi Magno Satin).

 5 (Arjowiggins Gloss), 0.026.

   Field of View
          The ink dots in the ink dot constructions of the present invention may exhibit consistently
   good shape properties (e.g., convexity, roundness, edge raggedness, and the like), irrespective, to
 5 a large degree, of the particular, local topographical features of the substrate, and irrespective, to
   some degree, of the type of printing substrate (coated or uncoated printing substrates, plastic
   printing substrates, etc.). The quality of ink dots in various known printing technologies, and in
   direct aqueous inkjetting technologies in particular, may vary appreciably with the type of
   printing substrate, and with the particular, local topographical features of the substrate. It will be
 0 readily appreciated that, by way of example, when an ink drop is jetted onto a particularly flat
   local contour having a relatively homogeneous substrate surface (such as a broad fiber), the ink
   dot obtained may display significantly better shape properties, with respect to the other, or
   average ink dots disposed elsewhere on the substrate.
          Using a more statistical approach, however, may better distinguish between the inventive
25 ink dot constructions with respect to ink dot constructions of the art. Thus, in some embodiments
   of the present invention, the ink dot constructions may be characterized as a plurality of ink dots
   disposed on the substrate, within a representative field of view. Assuming the characterization of
   the dot is obtained through image processing, a field of view contains a plurality of dot images,
   of which at least 10 dot images are suitable for image processing. Both the field of view and the
30 dot images selected for analysis are preferably representative of the total population of ink dots
   on the substrate (e.g., in terms of dot shape).
          As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, the term
   "geometric projection" refers to an imaginary geometric construct that is projected onto a printed

   face of a printing substrate.
           As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, the term "distinct
   ink dot" refers to any ink dot or ink dot image, at least partially disposed within the "geometric
   projection", that is neither a "satellite", nor an overlapping dot or dot image.
 5         As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, the term "mean
   deviation", with respect to the roundness, convexity, and the like, of a plurality of "distinct ink
   dots", refers to the sum of the individual distinct ink dot deviations divided by the number of
   individual distinct ink dots.
   Procedure
 0         A printed sample, preferably containing a high incidence of single ink dots, is scanned
   manually on the LEXT microscope, using a X20 magnification to obtain a field that includes at
   least 10 single dots in a single frame. Care should be taken to select a field whose ink dot quality
   is fairly representative of the overall ink dot quality of the printed sample.
           Each dot within the selected frame is analyzed separately. Dots that are "cleaved" by the
 5 frame margins (which may be considered a square geometric projection) are considered to be
   part of the frame, and are analyzed. Any satellites and overlapping dots are excluded from the
   analysis. A "satellite" is defined as an ink dot whose area is less than 25% of the average dot
   area of the dots within the frame, for frames having a generally homogeneous dot size, or as an
   ink dot whose area is less than 25% of the nearest adjacent dot, for non-homogeneous frames.
 0         Each distinct ink dot is subsequently magnified with a X100 zoom, and image processing
   may be effected according to the procedure provided hereinabove with respect to the convexity
   and roundness procedures.
   Results
           Figure 5F-i provides a magnified view of a small field of ink dots on a commodity-coated
25 fibrous substrate (Arjowiggins coated recycled gloss, 170gsm), the field produced using a
   commercially available aqueous, direct inkjet printer. Ink image A is a satellite, and is excluded
   from the analysis. Dot B is cleaved by the frame margin, and is included in the analysis (i.e., the
   full ink dot is analyzed). Tail or projection C is considered to be part of the ink dot disposed to
   its left. Thus, the field contains only 6 ink dots for image processing.
30         Figure 5F-2 provides a magnified view of a field of an ink dot construction according to
   the present invention, in which the commodity-coated substrate is identical to that of Figure 5F
   1. Ink image D, by way of example, is a satellite, and is excluded from the analysis. Thus, the

  field contains 12 ink dots for image processing.
         It is manifest from a comparison of the figures that the field of ink dots displayed in Figure
  5F-I exhibits superior dot shape and average dot shape, with respect to the field of ink dots
  displayed in Figure 5F-2.
5        Figure 5G-1 provides a magnified view of a field of ink dots or splotches on an uncoated
  fibrous substrate (Hadar Top uncoated-offset 170gsm), the field produced using a commercially
  available aqueous, direct inkjet printer. At higher magnification, it became evident that dots E
  and F are distinct individual dots. While several splotches are reasonably round and well-formed,
  most of the splotches display poor roundness and convexity, have poorly-defined edges, and
0 appear to contain multiple ink centers that are associated or weakly associated.
         By sharp contrast, Figure 5G-2 provides a magnified view of a field of an ink dot
  construction according to the present invention, in which the uncoated substrate is identical to
  that of Figure 5G-1. Each ink dot exhibits good roundness and convexity, and has well-defined
  edges. Moreover, each ink dot is disposed on top of the coarse, uncoated fibrous substrate.
5        Deviation from roundness and non-convexity data for each of the fields is provided in
  Tables 4A-4D.
         The fields of the ink dot construction according to the present invention exhibited
  (average) non-convexities of 0.003 for the Arjowiggins coated substrate, and 0.013 for the Hadar
  Top uncoated substrate. These average values are highly similar to the non-convexities exhibited
0 by individual ink dots of the present invention on these substrates (0.004 and 0.010,
  respectively). Similarly, the fields of the ink dot construction according to the present invention
  exhibited (average) deviations from roundness of 0.059 for the Arjowiggins coated substrate, and
  0.273 for the Hadar Top uncoated substrate. These average values are higher than, but fairly
  similar to, the deviations from roundness exhibited by individual ink dots of the present
5 invention on these substrates (0.026 and 0.239, respectively). As articulated hereinabove, and as
  is manifest to the eye from Figures 5F-2 and 5G-2, ink dots in the ink dot constructions of the
  present invention tend to exhibit consistently good shape properties (such as convexity and
  roundness), largely irrespective of the particular, local topographical features of the substrate.
         These exemplary results have been confirmed on several additional fibrous substrates, both
o commodity-coated and uncoated.
         For all tested commodity-coated fibrous substrates, fields of the ink dot construction
  according to the present invention exhibited a mean non-convexity of at most 0.05, at most 0.04,

  at most 0.03, at most 0.025, at most 0.020, at most 0.015, at most 0.012, at most 0.010, at most
  0.009, or at most 0.008.
         For all tested uncoated fibrous substrates, fields of the ink dot construction according to the
  present invention exhibited a mean non-convexity of at most 0.085, at most 0.07, at most 0.06, at
5 most 0.05, at most 0.04, at most 0.03, at most 0.025, at most 0.020, at most 0.018, or at most

 5 Plastic Substrates
          Figures 5H-1 - 5H-3 provide magnified top views of ink dot constructions according to the
   present invention, in which an ink dot is printed on each of various exemplary plastic printing
   substrates, including biaxially oriented polypropylene -- BOPP (Figure 5H-1); anti-static
   polyester (Figure 5H-2); and atactic polypropylene (Figure 5H-3).
 0        On all of the various plastic printing substrates used, and as shown in exemplary fashion in
   Figures 5H-1 - 5H-3, the ink dots of the present invention exhibited superior optical and shape
   properties, including roundness, convexity, edge raggedness, and surface roughness.
          Figure 5H-4 provides a magnified top view of an ink dot printed on a polyester substrate,
   in accordance with the present invention. Figure 5H-4 further provides a cross-sectional
 5 representation showing the surface roughness of the ink dot and substrate. The ink dot has a
   height of about 600nm. The deviation in height is less than ±50nm over the middle 80% of the
   dot diameter, and less than ±25nm over the middle 60% of the dot diameter.
          Exemplary deviations from roundness and non-convexities are provided in Table 5.

          The non-convexity, or deviation from convexity for ink dots printed on a wide variety of
   plastic printing substrates, was at most 0.020, at most 0.018, at most 0.016, at most 0.014, at
   most 0.012, or at most 0.010. At least some of the ink dots, on all these substrates, including
   BOPP, exhibited non-convexities of at most 0.008, at most 0.006, at most 0.005, at most 0.004,
25 at most 0.0035, at most 0.0030, at most 0.0025, or at most 0.0020. On the polyester and the
   atactic polypropylene substrates, typical ink dots exhibited non-convexities of at most 0.006, at
   most 0.004, at most 0.0035, and even more typically, at most 0.0030, at most 0.0025, or at most
   0.0020.

          On all plastic substrates tested, individual ink dots in the ink dot constructions according to
   the present invention exhibited a typical deviation from roundness of at most 0.8, at most 0.7, at
   most 0.6, at most 0.5, at most 0.4, at most 0.35, at most 0.3, at most 0.25, at most 0.20, at most
   0.18, or at most 0.15. On various smooth plastics, such as atactic polypropylene and various
5  polyesters, individual ink dots exhibited a typical deviation from roundness of at most 0.35, at
   most 0.3, at most 0.25, at most 0.20, at most 0.18, at most 0.15, at most 0.12, at most 0.10, at
   most 0.08, at most 0.06, at most 0.05, at most 0.04, or at most 0.035.
          Figures 5H-5 - 5H-7 each provide a magnified view of a field having an ink dot
   construction according to the present invention, each field containing ink dots printed onto a
0  respective plastic substrate. In Figure 5H-5, the substrate is anti-static polyester; in Figure 5H-6,
   the substrate is polypropylene (BOPP WBI 35 micron (Dor, Israel)); in Figure 5H-7, the printing
   substrate is atactic polypropylene. In all of these fields, each ink dot exhibits good roundness and
   convexity, has well-defined edges, and is disposed on top of the particular plastic substrate. The
   ink dots of inventive ink dots-on-plastic constructions may closely resemble the ink dots on
5  commodity-coated substrates, particularly with regard to the roundness, convexity, edge
   raggedness, and other optical shape properties. For a wide variety of plastic substrates, the
   inventive ink dots-on-plastic constructions display optical shape properties (e.g., deviation from
   roundness, non-convexity) that equal, or surpass, those of the commodity-coated substrates.
   Optical Uniformity
0         The original ink film images provided in Figures 5A and 5B are not optically uniform.
   Generally, the ink film images disposed on uncoated paper are less optically uniform than the
   corresponding ink film images disposed on coated paper.
          Furthermore, it can be observed that the inventive ink dots exhibit superior optical
   uniformity in comparison with the various prior-art ink forms. This appears to hold for both
5  uncoated and coated printed substrates. That which is readily observed by the human eye may be
   quantified using image-processing techniques. The method of measuring ink dot uniformity is
   provided below.
   Optical Uniformity Measurement
          The dot images are loaded to the ImageXpert Software, preferably using the statistical
0O rules provided hereinabove. Each image is loaded in each of the Red, Green and Blue channels.
   The channel selected for the image processing is the channel exhibiting the highest visible
   details, which include the dot contour and color variance within the dot area, and the substrate

   surface fibrous structure. For example, the Red channel is typically most suitable for a cyan dot,
   while the Green channel is typically most suitable for a magenta dot.
         For each of the selected dots, a line profile (preferably 3 line profiles for each of the at
   least 10 most representative dots) is measured across the dot area, crossing through the center of
 5 the dot. Since the line profile is measured on a single channel, gray values (0-255, non color
   values) are measured. The line profiles are taken across the center of the dot and cover only the
   inner two thirds of the dot diameter, to avoid edge effects. The standard for sampling frequency
   is about 8 optical measurements along the line profile (8 measured gray values evenly spaced
   along each micrometer, or 125 nanometers +/- 25 nanometers per measurement along the line
 0 profile), which was the automatic frequency of the ImageXpert Software, and which was found
   to be suitable and robust for the task at hand.
          The standard deviation (STD) of each of the line profiles is computed, and multiple line
   profile STDs for each type of printed image are averaged into a single value.
         Figures 6A-1 to 6J-2 provide images of ink splotches or dots obtained using various
 5 printing technologies, and optical uniformity profiles therefor. More specifically, Figures 6A-1
   to 6E-1 provide ink dot images disposed on uncoated paper, for the following printing
   technologies: HP DeskJet 9000 (Figure 6A-1); Digital press: HP Indigo 7500 (Figure 6A-2);
   Offset: Ryobi 755 (Figure 6A-3); Xerox DC8000 (Figure 6A-4); and for an embodiment of the
   inventive printing technology (Figure 6A-5). Similarly, Figures 6F-1 to 6J-1 provide ink dot
 0 images disposed on commodity coated paper, for those printing technologies.
         Figures 6A-2 to 6J-2 respectively provide a graph plotting the (non-color) gray relative
   value as a function of the position on the line passing through the center of the ink dot image, for
   each of the ink dot images provided by Figures 6A-1 to 6E-1 (on uncoated paper), and by
   Figures 6F-1 to 6J-1 (on coated paper). A relatively flat linear profile for a particular ink dot
25 image indicates high optical uniformity along the line.
          The STD of each of the line profiles of each type of printed image is provided in Table 6,
   for both uncoated and coated substrates. The results would appear to confirm that the ink dots
   disposed on the uncoated fibrous printing substrates exhibit poorer uniformity with respect to the
   corresponding ink dots disposed on the coated fibrous printing substrates.
30       Moreover, for uncoated substrates, the line profile of the inventive ink film produced by
   the inventive system and process had an STD of 4.7, which compares favorably to the STDs
   achieved using the various prior art technologies (13.7 to 19.1). For coated substrates, the line
   profile of the inventive ink dot produced by the inventive system and process had an STD of 2.5,

   which compares favorably, though less strikingly so, to the STDs achieved using the various
   prior art technologies (4 to 11.6).
         When comparing between films or dots on coated papers, the average of each of the
   standard deviations (STD) of the dot profiles of the present invention was always below 3. More
5  generally, the STD of the dot profiles of the present invention is less than 4.5, less than 4, less
   than 3.5, less than 3, or less than 2.7.

0        By sharp contrast, the STD of the offset Dot Uniformity profile was 5.75, and the STD of
   the LEP (Indigo) Dot Uniformity profile was 11.6.
          Thus, the STD values for the dots of the present invention are manifestly differentiated
   from the STD values of the exemplary printed dots of the prior art, both on coated and uncoated
   papers.
5        In comparing between films or dots on uncoated papers, the standard deviation (STD) of
   the dot profiles of the present invention was always below 5. More generally, the STD of the dot
   profiles of the present invention is less than 10, less than 8, less than 7, or less than 6.
         Because, as noted above, ink images may contain an extremely large plurality of individual
   or single ink dots (at least 20, at least 100, at least 1,000, at least 10,000, or at least 100,000), it
0O may be meaningful to statistically define the inventive ink dot constructions wherein at least
   10%, at least 20%, or at least 30%, and in some cases, at least 50%, at least 7 0%, or at least 90%,
   of the inventive ink dots (or inventive single-drop ink dots), disposed on any uncoated or coated
   (or commodity-coated) fibrous substrate, exhibit the above-mentioned standard deviations for
   uncoated papers and for commodity-coated papers.

   Optical Density
          Ink formulations containing a 1:3 ratio of pigment (Clariant Hostajet Black O-PT nano
   dispersion) to resin were prepared, according to Example 6. The formulations were applied to
   Condat Gloss® coated paper (135 gsm) using various coating rods yielding wet layers having a
5  characteristic thickness of 4-50 micrometers.
          The above-provided formulation contains approximately 9.6% ink solids, of which 25% is
   pigment, and about 75% is resin, by weight. In all of the tests, the ratio of resin to pigment was
   maintained at 3:1. The ink solids fraction in the ink formulations varied between 0.05 and 0.12,
   by weight (5% to 12%). Drawdown was performed in standard fashion, directly onto the paper.
0  The thickness of each ink film obtained was calculated.
          Optical density was measured with an X-Rite@ 528 Spectro-densitometer, using status "T"
   mode, absolute. The results are provided in Table 7. Figure 12 provides the optical density points
   obtained, along with a fitted curve (the lowermost curve) of the optical density achieved as a
   function of film thickness. Although we do not know the formulation to be a prior-art
5  formulation, the fitted curve may represent the optical density capabilities of the prior art.

0  Color Gamut Volume
          The color gamut of a particular printing technology may be defined as the sum total of all
   colors that the printing technology can reproduce. While color gamuts may be represented in
   various ways, a full color gamut is generally represented in a three-dimensional color space.
          ICC (International Color Consortium) profiles are often utilized by commercially available
5  software to evaluate color gamut volume.
          ISO Standard 12647-2 ('Amended Standard' version), which is incorporated by reference
   for all purposes as if fully set forth herein, relates to various printing parameters for offset
   lithographic processes, including CIELAB coordinates, gloss, and ISO brightness for five typical
   offset substrates.
0         ISO Amended Standard 12647-2 defines CIELAB coordinates of colors for the printing
   sequence black-cyan-magenta-yellow, for each of the five typical offset substrates, and based
   thereupon, defines, for each of these substrates, a resulting color gamut of offset lithographic
   printing.
          In practice, the color gamut volume capabilities of the prior art may be, at most, about 400
5  kilo(AE)3 for coated wood free paper (e.g., Type 1 and possibly Type 2 of ISO Amended
   Standard 12647-2) utilized as a substrate in offset lithographic printing.
          The color gamut volume capabilities of the prior art may be somewhat lower for Type 3
   substrates (at most about 380 kilo(AE) 3) and for other types of offset lithographic printing
   substrates such as uncoated papers, e.g., various uncoated offset papers such as Type 4 and Type
0O 5 of ISO Amended Standard 12647-2. The color gamut volume capabilities of the prior art may
   be, at most, about 350 kilo(AE) 3 for such uncoated offset papers.
          It is assumed that the print image thickness (single dot or film) associated with these color

   gamut volumes is at least 0.9-1.1 micrometers.
          By sharp contrast, the color gamut volume of the ink film constructions of the present
   invention, as determined, for example, by ICC profiles, may exceed or appreciably exceed the
   above-provided color gamut volumes. For each particular substrate type, the color gamut volume
5  of the inventive ink film constructions may exceed the respective, existing color gamut volume
   capability by at least 7%, at least 10%, at least 12%, at least 15%, at least 18%, at least 20%, at
   least 25%, at least 30%, or at least 35%.
          The color gamut volume of the inventive ink film constructions may exceed the provided,
   respective, color gamut volume capabilities by at least 25 kilo(AE) 3, at least 40 kilo(AE) 3, at least
0  60 kilo(AE) 3 , at least 80 kilo(AE) 3, at least 100 kilo(AE) 3 , at least 120 kilo(AE) 3, at least 140
   kilo(AE) 3, or at least 160 kilo(AE) 3.
          In absolute terms, the color gamut volume of the inventive ink film constructions may be
   characterized by color gamut volumes of at least 425 kilo(AE) 3 , at least 440 kilo(AE) 3, at least
   460 kilo(AE) 3, at least 480 kilo(AE) 3, or at least 500 kilo(AE) 3 . For Type 1 and Type 2 substrates
5  and the like, the inventive ink film constructions may be further characterized by color gamut
   volumes of at least 520 kilo(AE) 3, at least 540 kilo(AE) 3, at least 560 kilo(AE) 3 , or at least 580
   kilo(AE) 3.
          Without wishing to be limited by theory, the inventors believe that the enhanced color
   gamut volume, as well as the enhanced optical density described hereinabove, may be at least
0  partially, or largely, attributable to the lamination of the inventive ink film onto a top surface of
   the printing substrate. Because the form of the film may be largely determined prior to the
   transfer to the substrate, the film may be integrally transferred from the ITM to the substrate.
   This integral continuous unit may be substantially devoid of solvent, such that there may be no
   penetration of any kind of material from the blanket into, or between, substrate fibers. The
5  integral film may form a laminated layer disposed entirely above the top surface of the fibrous
   printing substrate.
          The inventive ink film constructions may achieve the various stated color gamut volumes,
   not only within the 0.9-1.1 micrometer film thickness range, but, surprisingly, at average film
   thicknesses or heights that are lower or appreciably lower than the 0.9-1.1 micrometer range. The
0O inventive ink film constructions may be characterized by these color gamut volumes for ink film
   thicknesses of less than 0.8 pLm, less than 0.7 tm, less than 0.65 ptm, less than 0.6 tm, less than
   0.55 pm, less than 0.5 pm, less than 0.45 pm, or less than 0.4 pm.
          The inventive ink film constructions may also achieve the various stated color gamut

  volumes at average film thicknesses that are at most 4 micrometers, at most 3.5 pm, at most 3
  pm, at most 2.6 pm, at most 2.3 pm, at most 2 pm, at most 1.7 pLm, at most 1.5 prm, at most 1.3
  pm, or at most 1.2 pm.
        Furthermore, the inventive ink film constructions may also achieve full coverage of the
5 color gamuts defined by the above-referenced ISO Standard, within any of the film thickness
  ranges described hereinabove.

0       Color gamut prints were made using Dimatix SAMBA single pass inkjet print heads
  having a nominal resolution of 1200dpi and providing an average drop volume of 9pL.
        Ink in the print head was maintained 22'C, the blanket was maintained at 70'C. Manual
  drying was effected at about 450'C at a volume flow of 16CFM. The transfer temperature was
  about 130'C. Ink formulations were prepared substantially as described above with respect to
5 Examples 2, 5, 8 and 9.
        For each run, 170 patches of different color combinations were printed and measured using
  a spectrophotometer, to create the color gamut. Each color separation was printed sequentially on
  a heated blanket and dried manually for approximately 2 seconds. The order of the separations
  was yellow, magenta, cyan and black. After all the separations were printed, the image was

   transferred to the paper by applying pressure using a cylindrical weight.
          Each individual color separation had a thickness of up to 600, up to 650, or up to 700nm.
   The total thickness was at most 2,000nm, and on average, about 1,700nm, 1,800nm or 1900nm.
   In some runs, each individual color separation had a thickness of up to 450, up to 500, or up to
 5 550nm, and the corresponding average total thickness was about 1,300nm, 1,400nm or 1,500nm.
          All comparisons were done with normalized white, as though printed on the same media.
          The software used to create a color profile from the prints was an ilProfiler, version 1.4.2
   (X-Rite@ Inc., Grand Rapids, MI). Measurements were done using an ilPro2 spectrophotometer
   (X-Rite@ Inc.), and standard techniques (similar to those of the ilProfiler) were used to plot the
 0 charts and to calculate the color gamut volume.
   Abrasion Resistance
          One important characteristic of printed ink films is abrasion resistance. Abrasion resistance
   is a property of printed ink describing the degree to which the printed image can maintain its
   surface and structural integrity under prolonged rubbing, scratching and scuffing. During
 5 shipping and handling, the exposed surface of printed ink films may be appreciably abraded,
   thereby detracting from print quality. Consequently, a wide variety of printed products (e.g.,
   magazines and brochures) may require ink film constructions having superior abrasion
   resistance.
          Abrasion resistance may typically be enhanced by using suitable formulations comprising
 0 resins having good abrasion resistance properties. Alternatively or additionally, special
   components such as waxes and/or hard-drying oils, may be introduced to the formulation.
          The introduction of waxes or oils to the ink formulation may affect the overall attributes of
   the ink and may also lead to other process-related or print-related problems. Thus, providing the
   requisite abrasion resistance solely by means of abrasion resistant resins may be advantageous in
!5 at least this respect.
          The inventors have discovered that in the ink formulations and in the ink film constructions
   of the present invention, various resins, having relatively poor mechanical or "bulk" abrasion
   resistance properties, may advantageously contribute to the thermo-rheological behavior of those
   ink formulations, whereby at least one of: the development of the ink film, the transfer from the
30 intermediate transfer member or blanket, and the adhesion to the printing substrate, may be
   appreciably enhanced. The poor mechanical properties of the resins may include a low hardness
   value.

          The inventors have discovered that the abrasion resistance of print images printed with
   inventive ink formulations containing such resins is surprisingly high with respect to the "bulk"
   abrasion resistance properties of those resins.
          Abrasion resistance was measured by sweeping an abrasive block on top of each sample a
 5 number of times, and measuring the optical density of the samples as compared to baseline
   values established for those samples prior to the abrasive testing. The samples were placed into a
   TMI (Testing Machines Incorporated) ink rub tester (model #10-18-01) and a dry ink rub test
   was performed using a 1.8 kg test block having a piece of Condat Gloss® paper (135 gsm)
   disposed thereon. Optical densities of the samples were measured before the test and after 100
 0 abrasion cycles. This abrasion resistance measurement procedure is recommended by the TMI
   Instruction Manual, and is based on ASTM procedure D5264.
          By way of example: the high molecular weight polymer in Joncryl® 2178 film-forming
   emulsion was tested for abrasion resistance, and was found to have excellent abrasion resistance
   properties. An ink formulation containing the Joncryl® 2178 was prepared, and applied on
 5 Condat Gloss® paper (135 gsm) using a 12 micrometer coating rod. With this ink formulation, a
   12 pm wet thickness approximately corresponds to a dry film having a film thickness of 1.2 ptm.
   Drawdown was performed in standard fashion. The dry ink film sample was then tested for
   abrasion resistance. The optical density loss was only 18% after 100 abrasion cycles, which is
   considered an excellent result for various printing applications.
 0        The Joncryl® 2178 film-forming emulsion was further tested for thermo-rheological
   compatibility with the inventive process, and was found to have poor transfer properties.
          A second, lower molecular weight resin (Neocryl® BT-26) was tested for abrasion
   resistance, and was found to have relatively poor abrasion resistance properties. As with the first
   resin, a second ink formulation containing the above-referenced resin was prepared, and applied
 5 on Condat Gloss® paper (135 gsm) using the 12 pum coating rod. The dry film obtained, having a
   film thickness of about 1.2 pm, was subjected to the above-described abrasion resistance test.
   The optical density loss was 53% after 100 abrasion cycles, nearly three times the loss borne by
   sample 1.
          The inventive ink formulation was further tested for thermo-rheological compatibility with
30 the inventive process, and was found to have adequate transfer properties.
          The inventors then tested this second ink formulation containing the resin having relatively
   poor abrasion resistance properties, in a printing system and processing method of the present
   invention. Again, Condat Gloss® paper (135 gsm) was used as the printing substrate. Some of

   the ink film constructions produced were evaluated to assess various print and ink film
   construction properties, including abrasion resistance.
          The printed substrate obtained using the second ink formulation was subjected to an
   abrasion resistance test identical to that performed for the drawdown samples. Surprisingly, the
 5 optical density loss was 16.6%, which is comparable to the abrasion resistance of the first, highly
   abrasion-resistant dry ink film sample, and which is a sufficiently good result for a wide range of
   printing applications.
          In another exemplary abrasion resistance test, an ink formulation was prepared, according
   to the composition provided in Example 8. The ink was applied on Condat Gloss® paper (135
 0 gsm) using the 12 tm coating rod. Then the ink was dried by hot air and the abrasion resistance
   was tested, as described above. The optical density loss was 30% after 100 abrasion cycles.
            In another exemplary abrasion resistance test, the above-described ink formulation was
   used to produce a dry film by means of the inventive process. The dry film, having a thickness of
   about 1 micrometer, was obtained by applying the wet ink (12 pm, as above) on a hot (130'C)
 5 [silanol-terminated polydimethyl-siloxane] silicone blanket, drying the film, and transferring the
   dried film to Condat Gloss® paper (135 gsm). The optical density loss was 19% after 100
   abrasion cycles.
   Adhesive Failure
          The adhesive properties of the inventive ink film constructions (inter alia, Example 4) were
 0 evaluated and compared against the adhesive properties of ink dot or ink film constructions of
   the prior art. A standard testing procedure used: quantitative ink adhesion test FTM 21 of
   FINAT       (Federation  Intemationale    des   Fabricants  et   Transformateurs      d'Adhesifs et
   Thermocollants sur Papiers et Autres Supports), provided below.
 5                                            FINAT FTM 21
   Ink Adhesion - basic
   Scope This method allows rapid assessment of the degree of adhesion of a printing ink or
   lacquer to a labelstock.
   Definition The printing ink or lacquer is applied to the substrate and cured on the printing press
30 or using a standard method appropriate for the type of ink. The ink adhesion is then estimated by
   the amount of ink that can be removed when adhesive tape is applied and peeled off. The
   resistance of the ink to mechanical removal is also measured by scratching the ink and by

   deformation under pressure.
   Test Equipment A means of applying and curing the ink. Adhesive tape of high peel adhesion
   ('aggressive'), for example Tesa 7475 (acrylic based), Tesa 7476 (rubber based), or 3M Scotch
   810. FINAT roller to smooth the tape over the test piece. Metal spatula. Gloves.
 5 Test Pieces If the required ink has not already been applied to the substrate as part of the
   printing process, prepare samples for testing by coating the ink to a uniform thickness (for
   example, with a Meyer bar for low-viscosity inks) and curing the coating as recommended by the
   supplier. A-4 sheets are a conveniently-sized sample for this test. Test condition 23'C ± 2'C and
   50 % relative humidity (RH) ± 5% RH. If practical, the test pieces should be conditioned for at
 0 least four hours prior to testing.
   Tape test Lay the specimen on a smooth, flat, hard surface and apply the adhesive tape, leaving
   a small part of the tape unfixed to the test piece, ensuring that no air bubbles are trapped under
   the tape. Using the FINAT roller, press down the tape by passing the roller twice in each
   direction over the specimen, and then bend the unattached part of the tape back on itself at an
 5 angle of 1800. Within 20 minutes after rolling down the tape, mount the specimen in a frame or
   use one hand to hold the specimen firmly, then pull the free piece of tape towards you using the
   other hand: at first slowly under constant speed, then very rapidly and accelerating. (The faster
   speed is the more aggressive test). FINAT Technical Handbook 6th edition, 2001 53
   The performance of the specimen is recorded by comparison with control samples which have
 0 been previously measured, or by reference to the following grading:
   Grade 1 No removal of ink
   Grade 2 Slight removal of ink (< 10%)
   Grade 3 Moderate removal of ink (10 - 30%)
   Grade 4 Severe removal of ink (30 - 60%)
25 Grade 5 Almost complete removal of ink (> 60%)
   Exemplary results are provided in Table 9.
          The direct (drop-on-demand) inkjet technologies displayed poor ink adhesion to the
   various plastic substrates. The solid ink technology exemplified by the XEROX Phaser 8560 and
30 the latex printing technology exemplified by the HP Designjet Z6200 also displayed poor ink
   adhesion to various plastic substrates. Lithographic offset printing, gravure, and some LEP and
   DEP technologies displayed strong adhesive properties on the plastic substrates tested.
          With respect to various plastic substrates, including polypropylene sheets (e.g., biaxially
   oriented polypropylene -- BOPP), polyethylene sheets, and polyethylene terephthalate sheets, the

  ink-film constructions of the present invention exhibited strong adhesive properties.
         In some embodiments of the invention, the ink dots-on-plastic ink constructions exhibited
  an adhesive failure of at most 10%, and more typically, at most 5%, when subjected to a standard
  tape test (FINAT FTM 21, basic ink adhesion test). In most cases, the ink dots-on-plastic ink
5 constructions were free or substantially free of adhesive failure when subjected to this tape test.

   Glass Transition Temperature of the Resin
         The inventors have found that in selecting resins for use within the formulations supporting
   the ink film constructions of the present invention, the softening temperature (or glass transition
 5 temperature for at least partially amorphous resins) may be a useful indicator of resin suitability.
   Specifically, the resins used in the ink formulations (and disposed in the ink films of the present
   invention) may have a Tg below 47 0 C or below 45'C, and more typically, below 43'C, below
   40'C, below 35'C, below 30'C, below 25'C, or below 20'C.
         More generally, from a process standpoint, the ink formulations disposed on the ITM, after
 0 becoming devoid or substantially devoid of water, any co-solvent, and any other vaporizable
   material that would be vaporized under process conditions, e.g., pH adjusting agents, (producing
   "ink solids" an "ink residue", or the like), and/or the resins thereof, may have a Tg below 47 0 C or
   below 45'C, and more typically, below 43'C, below 40'C, below 35'C, below 30'C, below
   25'C, or below 20'C.
 5 Thermo-Rheological Properties
         The inventive process may include the heating of the ink film or image, during transport on
   the surface of the image transfer member, to evaporate the aqueous carrier from the ink image.
   The heating may also facilitate the reduction of the ink viscosity to enable the transfer conditions
   from the ITM to the substrate. The ink image may be heated to a temperature at which the
2O residue film of organic polymeric resin and colorant that remains after evaporation of the
   aqueous carrier is rendered tacky (e.g,, by softening of the resin).
         The residue film on the surface of the image transfer member may be dry or substantially
   dry. The film includes the resin and the colorant from the ink formulation. The residue film may
   further include small amounts of one or more surfactants or dispersants, which are typically
25 water soluble at the pH of the ink (i.e., prior to jetting). The residue film may further include one
   or more plasticizers.
         The ink residue film may be rendered tacky before it reaches the impression cylinder. In
   this case, the film may cool at the impression station, by its contact with the substrate and
   exposure to the environment. The already tacky ink film may adhere immediately to the substrate
30 onto which it is impressed under pressure, and the cooling of the film may be sufficient to reduce

   film adhesion to the image transfer surface to the point that the film peels away neatly from the
   image transfer member, without compromising adhesion to the substrate.
          Tack (or tackiness) may be defined as the property of a material that enables it to bond
   with a surface on immediate contact under light pressure. Tack performance may be highly
5  related to various viscoelastic properties of the material (polymeric resin, or ink solids). Both the
   viscous and the elastic properties would appear to be of importance: the viscous properties at
   least partially characterize the ability of a material to spread over a surface and form intimate
   contact, while the elastic properties at least partially characterize the bond strength of the
   material. These and other thermo-rheological properties are rate and temperature dependent.
0         By suitable selection of the thermo-rheological characteristics of the residue film, the
   effect of the cooling may be to increase the cohesion of the residue film, whereby its cohesion
   exceeds its adhesion to the transfer member so that all or substantially all of the residue film is
   separated from the image transfer member and impressed as a film onto the substrate. In this
   way, it is possible to ensure that the residue film is impressed on the substrate without significant
5  modification to the area covered by the film nor to its thickness.
          Viscosity temperature sweeps -- ramp and step -- were performed using a Thermo
   Scientific HAAKE RheoStress@ 6000 rheometer having a TM-PE-P Peltier plate temperature
   module and a P20 Ti L measuring geometry (spindle).
          Samples of dried ink residue having a 1mm depth in a 2cm diameter module were tested.
0  The samples were dried overnight in an oven at an operating temperature of 100 0 C. A volume of
   sample (pellet) was inserted into the 2cm diameter module and softened by gentle heating. The
   sample volume was then reduced to the desired size by lowering the spindle to reduce the sample
   volume to the desired depth of 1mm.
          In temperature ramp mode, the sample temperature was allowed to stabilize at low
5  temperature (typically 250 C to 40'C) before being ramped up to a high temperature (typically
   160'C to 190'C) at a rate of approximately 0.33 0 C per second. Viscosity measurements were
   taken at intervals of approximately 10 seconds. The sample temperature was then allowed to
   stabilize at high temperature for 120 seconds before being ramped down to low temperature, at a
   rate of approximately 0.33 0 C per second. Again, viscosity measurements were taken at intervals
0O of approximately 10 seconds. Oscillation temperature sweeps were performed at a gamma of
   0.001 and at a frequency of 0.1 Hz.
          In the specification and in the claims section that follows, values for dynamic viscosity are
   quantitatively determined solely by the temperature ramp-up and ramp-down method described

   hereinabove.
         Figure 7 provides ramped-down temperature sweep plots of dynamic viscosity as a
   function of temperature, for several dried ink formulations suitable for the ink film construction
   of the present invention. After reaching a maximum temperature of approximately 160'C, and
 5 waiting 120 seconds, the temperature was ramped down as described.
          The lowest viscosity curve is that of a dried residue of an inventive yellow ink formulation,
   containing about 2% pigment solids, and produced according to the procedure described
   hereinabove. At about 160'C, the rheometer measured a viscosity of about 6.7-106 cP. As the
   temperature was ramped down, the viscosity steadily and monotonically increased to about 6 -107
 0 cP at 95'C, and to about 48-107 cP at 58'C.
          The intermediate viscosity curve is that of a dried residue of an inventive cyan ink
   formulation, containing about 2% pigment solids, and produced according to the procedure
   described hereinabove. At about 157 0 C, the rheometer measured a viscosity of about 86-106 cP.
   As the temperature was ramped down, the viscosity increased to about 187- 106 cP at 94'C, and
 5 to about 8-108 cP at 570 C.
          The highest viscosity curve is that of a dried residue of an inventive black ink formulation,
   containing about 2% pigment solids, and produced according to the procedure described
   hereinabove. At about 160'C, the rheometer measured a viscosity of about 196-106 cP. As the
   temperature was ramped down, the viscosity steadily and monotonically increased to about
 0 763-106 cP at 95'C, and to about 302-107 cP at 59'C.
         Figure 8 is a ramped-down temperature sweep plot of dynamic viscosity as a function of
   temperature, for several dried ink formulations of the present invention, vs. several ink residues
   of prior art ink formulations. The viscosity curves of the prior art formulations are labeled I to 5,
   and are represented by dashed lines; the viscosity curves of the inventive formulations are
!5 labeled A to E, and are represented by solid lines. The ink formulations of the present invention
   include the three previously described in conjunction with Figure 7 (A     = black; C= cyan; and E =
   yellow), and two ink formulations ("B"; "D") containing about 2%, by weight of solids, of a
   magenta aqueous pigment preparation [Hostajet Magenta E5B-PT (Clariant)], along with about
   6% of various styrene-acrylic emulsions. The residues of the prior art inks were prepared from
30 various commercially available inkjet inks, of different colors.
         A magnified view of the plot of Figure 8, for viscosities of less than 36-108, is provided in
   Figure 9. Only the viscosity curves of the inventive formulations A to E, and that of prior-art
   formulation 5, may be seen in Figure 9.

          It is evident from the plots, and from the magnitude of the viscosities, that the dried ink
   residues of the various prior art ink formulations exhibit no or substantially no flow behavior
   over the entire measured range of temperatures, up to at least 160'C. The peaks observed at
   extremely high viscosities in some plots of the prior-art formulations would appear to have no
 5 physical meaning. The lowest measured viscosity for each of the prior art residue films was
   within a range of at least 135-107 cP to at least 33-108 cP. The lowest value within this range,
   135-107 cP, is well over 6 times the highest viscosity value of any of the residues of the inventive
   ink formulations, at about 160'C.
          Moreover, during the ramp-down phase of the experiment, Samples 1 to 5 of the prior art
 0 exhibited viscosity values that exceeded the viscosity measured at about 160'C, and/or appear
   sufficiently high so as to preclude transfer of the film. In practice, the inventors of the present
   invention successfully transferred all five of the inventive ink films to a printing substrate, but
   failed to transfer any of the five prior-art ink films to a printing substrate, even after heating to
   over 160'C.
 5        The inventors have calculated the ratio of a "cold" dynamic viscosity, at least one
   temperature within a range of 50'C to 85'C, to the "hot" dynamic viscosity, at least one
   temperature within a range of 125'C to 160'C. The inventors believe that this ratio may be
   important in distinguishing between ink formulations that meet the multiple requirements of the
   inventive process, and ink formulations that fail to meet the multiple requirements of the
 0 inventive process.
   Analysis of Ink Film on Printed Substrates
   Basic Procedure:
          Three sheets of Condat Gloss® paper (135 g/cm 2 , B2, 750x530 mm) were printed on a
   digital press according to PCT Application No. PCT/IB2013/051716, using ink formulations of
!5 the present invention (magenta, yellow, cyan and black). After 1 week, the sheets were cut into
   3x3 cm pieces and introduced into 300 grams of a solution containing 1%2-amino-2-methyl-1
   propanol dissolved in water able to sufficiently dissolve ink images printed using various water
   soluble inks. In this de-inking procedure, the solution was stirred for 10 minutes at room
   temperature (e.g., circa 23 0C), after which the mixture was filtered through a 10 micron filter.
30 The filtrate, mainly containing the dissolved ink and the pigment particles, was dried using a
   rotary evaporator. The filtrate residue was then dissolved in 5 grams of dimethyl sulfoxide
   (DMSO) and was then dried in an oven at 110 C for 12 hours to yield the "recovered residue".

          The thermo-rheological behavior of the recovered residue obtained from the de-inking
   process was characterized by viscosity measurements in a ramp-up and ramp-down temperature
   sweep (as described hereinabove). The results obtained are plotted in Figure 10.
          From Figure 10 it appears manifest that the thermo-rheological behavior of the ink solids
 5 extracted from the printed images is similar to the thermo-rheological behavior characteristic of
   the dried ink residues produced by directly drying ink formulations of the present invention. It
   further appears manifest that the thermo-rheological behavior of the recovered residue is
   markedly different from the thermo-rheological behavior of the dried residues of various water
   based ink-jet formulations such as samples 1 to 5 (as shown in Figure 8).
 0        In another test, HP black inkjet ink (as supplied for use in HP DeskJet 9803) from the
   cartridge was dried to form a residue. The residue was dissolved in 5 grams of dimethyl
   sulfoxide (DMSO) and was then dried in an oven at 110 C for 12 hours. 100 mg of the dry
   sample was dissolved/dispersed in 0.5 ml of distilled water (or a suitable solvent such as
   DMSO). After stirring, the liquid material was introduced into a silicon rubber mold. Afterwards
 5 the mold was placed on a plate (heated to 250'C) for 10 minutes. The dry tablet obtained was
   allowed to cool to room temperature, and was then subjected to a dynamic viscosity
   measurement at high temperature (-190'C). The viscosity, in cP, is plotted in Figure 11.
          The identical black inkjet ink was also printed onto several sheets of Condat Gloss® paper
   using the afore-mentioned HP inkjet printer. After 1 week, the sheets were cut into small pieces
 0 and introduced into a 1% solution of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol               in distilled water,
   substantially as described hereinabove. The flask was stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature,
   after which the mixture was filtered through a 10 micron filter. The filtrate was dried using a
   rotary evaporator. The residue was dissolved in 5 grams of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and was
   then dried in an oven at 110 C for 12 hours. 100 mg of the dry sample was dissolved in 0.5 ml of
25 distilled water (or a suitable solvent such as DMSO). After stirring the liquid material was
   introduced into the silicon rubber mold. Afterwards the mold was placed on a plate (heated to
   250'C) for 10 minutes. The dry tablet obtained from de-inking of the HP inkjet printed samples
   was allowed to cool to room temperature, and was then subjected to a dynamic viscosity
   measurement at high temperature (-190'C). The viscosity, in cP, is plotted in Figure 11.
30        The inkjet ink residue obtained by de-inking of the HP samples exhibited a dynamic
   viscosity that was similar to the dynamic viscosity exhibited by the dried residue of the identical
   HP inkjet ink.
          A similar test was performed for a black ink formulation of the present invention. Dynamic

   viscosity measurements were conducted at high temperature (~190'C) for both the dried ink
   residue and the ink residue recovered according to the above-described procedure. The viscosity
   of each sample, in cP, is plotted in Figure 11.
         Again, the recovered inkjet ink residue, obtained by de-inking of the inventive ink film
 5 constructions, exhibited a dynamic viscosity that was similar to the dynamic viscosity exhibited
   by the dried residue of the identical inventive inkjet ink.
         In a more advanced procedure, 3 sheets of Condat paper (135 g/cm2, B2, 750x530 mm)
   were printed on printed on a printing system as described in PCT application No.
   PCT/IB2013/051716, using inks as herein described, and further detailed in PCT application No.
 0 PCT/1B2013/051755 using the inventive inks, and subjected to the following procedure: after 1
   week, the sheets are cut into 3x3 cm pieces and introduced into 300 grams of a solution
   containing 1% 2-amino-2-methyl- 1-propanol dissolved in water, which is able to sufficiently
   dissolve ink images printed using various water-soluble inks. If, however, the solution remains
   colorless, the water is separated off and an identical weight of a less polar solvent, ethanol, is
 5 introduced. Again, if the solution remains colorless, the solvent is separated off, and an identical
   weight of a less polar solvent, methyl ethyl ketone, is introduced. The procedure continues with
   successfully less polar solvents: ethyl acetate, toluene, and IsoparTM (synthetic mixture of
   isoparaffins). After 5 hours stirring at room temperature with the most appropriate solvent, the
   mixture is filtered through a 5 micrometer filter. The filtrate or filtrates containing the dissolved
 0 ink is dried using a rotary evaporator. The residues are then dissolved in 5 grams of DMSO (or
   one of the above-listed solvents) and dried in an oven at 110 C for 12 hours to yield the
   "recovered residue". Thermo-rheological behavior of the recovered residue is characterized and
   compared with a dried sample of the original ink, when available.
          The inventors attribute the improved thermo-rheological results of this procedure (i.e.,
25 appreciably closer to the results obtained by direct drying of inkjet ink) to the increased
   dissolution of the printed ink, due to both the increased residence time and the use of additional
   solvents. Thus, this advanced procedure may advantageously be used to determine the thermo
   rheological properties of the dried ink from ink residue recovered from printed matter such as
   magazines and brochures.
30        The absolute dynamic viscosity values of the prior-art inkjet ink residues exceed the
   dynamic viscosity values of the inventive inkjet ink residues by a factor of more than 30-40.
         It is manifest that the absolute dynamic viscosity values of the prior-art and inventive
   inkjet ink residues may be substantially reproduced by measuring the absolute dynamic viscosity

   values of the corresponding inkjet ink residues recovered from printed images. It is further
   manifest that this method may be utilized to characterize an inkjet ink residue by reconstituting
   the ink from printed substrates.
          One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that other, potentially superior,
 5 procedures may be used to de-ink a printed substrate and produce the recovered ink residue for
   rheological, thermo-rheological and/or chemical analysis.
   Ink Formulations and Ink Film Compositions
         Among other things, the present inkjet inks are aqueous inks, in that they contain water,
   usually at least 30 wt.% and more commonly around 50 wt.% or more; optionally, one or more
 0 water-miscible co-solvents; at least one colorant dispersed or at least partly dissolved in the
   water and optional co-solvent; and an organic polymeric resin binder, dispersed or at least partly
   dissolved in the water and optional co-solvent.
         It will be appreciated that acrylic-based polymers may be negatively charged at alkaline
   pH. Consequently, in some embodiments, the resin binder has a negative charge at pH 8 or
 5 higher; in some embodiments the resin binder has a negative charge at pH 9 or higher.
   Furthermore, the solubility or the dispersability of the resin binder in water may be affected by
   pH. Thus in some embodiments, the formulation includes a pH-raising compound, non-limiting
   examples of which include diethyl amine, monoethanol amine, and 2-amino-2-methyl propanol.
   Such compounds, when included in the ink, are generally included in small amounts, e.g., about
 0 1 wt.% of the formulation and usually not more than about 2 wt.% of the formulation.
         It will also be appreciated that acrylic-based polymers having free carboxylic acid groups
   may be characterized in terms of their charge density or, equivalently, the acid number, i.e., the
   number of milligrams of KOH needed to neutralize one gram of dry polymer. Thus, in some
   embodiments, the acrylic-based polymer has an acid number in the range of 70-144.
25        The ink film of the inventive ink film construction contains at least one colorant. The
   concentration of the at least one colorant within the ink film may be at least 2%, at least 3%, at
   least 4%, at least 6%, at least 8%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, or at least 22%, by
   weight of the complete ink formulation. Typically, the concentration of the at least one colorant
   within the ink film is at most 40%, at most 35%, at most 30%, or at most 25%.
30       More typically, the ink film may contain 2-30%, 3-25%, or 4-25% of the at least one
   colorant.
          The colorant may be a pigment or a dye. The particle size of the pigments may depend on

  the type of pigment and on the size reduction methods used in the preparation of the pigments.
  Generally, the d50 of the pigment particles may be within a range of 10nm to 300nm. Pigments of
  various particle sizes, utilized to give different colors, may be used for the same print.
         The ink film contains at least one resin or resin binder, typically an organic polymeric
5 resin. The concentration of the at least one resin within the ink film may be at least 10%, at least
  15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least
  70%, or at least 80%, by weight.
         The total concentration of the colorant and the resin within the ink film may be at least
  10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 30%, or at least 40%, by weight. More typically,
0 however, the total concentration of the colorant and the resin within the ink film may be at least
  50%, at least 60%, at least        7 0%,   at least 80%, or at least 85%. In many cases, the total
  concentration of the colorant and the resin within the ink film may be at least 90%, at least 95%,
  or at least 97% of the ink film weight.
         Within the ink film, the weight ratio of the resin to the colorant may be at least 1:1, at least
5 2:1, at least 2.5:1, at least 3:1, at least 4:1, at least 5:1, or at least 7:1.
         The weight ratio of the resin to the colorant within the ink film constructions of the
  invention may be at most 15:1, at most 12:1, or at most 10:1. In some applications, particularly
  when it is desirable to have an ultra-thin ink film laminated onto the printing substrate, the
  weight ratio of the resin to the colorant may be at most 7:1, at most 5:1, at most 3:1, at most
0 2.5:1, at most 2:1, at most 1.7:1, at most 1.5:1 at most 1.2:1, at most 1:1, at most 0.75:1, or at
  most 0.5:1.
         Specific resins that may be suitable for use in the inventive ink formulation, system, and
  process of the present invention include water-soluble acrylic styrene copolymers within a
  particular range of molecular weights and a low glass transition temperature (Tg). Commercial
5 examples of such copolymers may include Joncryl@ HPD 296, Joncryl@ 142E, Joncryl@ 637,
  Joncryl@ 638, and Joncryl® 8004; Neocryl® BT-100, Neocryl® BT-26, Neocryl® BT-9, and
  Neocryl® BT-102.
         Nominally, the resin solution or dispersion may be, or include, an acrylic styrene co
  polymer (or co(ethylacrylate metacrylic acid) solution or dispersion. The acrylic styrene co
o polymer from the ink formulation ultimately remains in the ink film adhering to the printing
  substrate.
         The average molecular weight of the acrylic styrene co-polymer (or co(ethylacrylate

  metacrylic acid) may be less than 100,000, less than 80,000, less than 70,000, less than 60,000,
  less than 40,000, or less than 20,000 g/mole.
         The average molecular weight of the acrylic styrene co-polymer may be at least 10,000, at
  least 12,000, at least 13,000, or at least 14,000, and in some cases, at least 16,000, or at least
5 18,000 g/mole.
         In one embodiment, the ink film in the ink film constructions according to the present
  invention is devoid or substantially devoid of wax. Typically, the ink film according to the
  present invention contains less than 30% wax, less than 20% wax, less than 15% wax, less than
  10% wax, less than 7% wax, less than 5% wax, less than 3% wax, less than 2% wax, or less than
0 1%wax.
         In one embodiment, the ink film according to the present invention is devoid or

  oil), or various oils used in offset ink formulations. Typically, the ink film according to the
  present invention contains at most 20%, at most 12%, at most 8%, at most 5%, at most          3 %, at
5 most 1%, at most 0.5%, or at most 0. 1%, by weight, of one or more oils, cross-linked fatty acids,
  or fatty acid derivatives produced upon air-drying.
         In one embodiment, the ink film according to the present invention is devoid or
  substantially devoid of one or more salts, including salts used to coagulate or precipitate ink on a
  transfer member or on a substrate (e.g., calcium chloride). Typically, the ink film according to
0 the present invention contains at most 8 %, at most 5%, at most 4 %, at most 3%, at most 1%, at
  most 0.5%, at most 0. 3 %, or at most 0. 1% of one or more salts.
         In one embodiment, the ink film according to the present invention is devoid or
  substantially devoid of one or more photoinitiators. Typically, the ink film according to the
  present invention contains at most 2 %, at most 1%, at most 0.5%, at most 0. 3 %, at most 0. 2 %, or
5 at most 0.l1% of one or more photoinitiators.
         In one embodiment, the printing substrate of the inventive ink film construction is devoid
  or substantially devoid of one or more soluble salts, including salts used for, or suitable for
  coagulating or precipitating ink, or components thereof, on the substrate (e.g., calcium chloride).
  In one embodiment, the printing substrate of the inventive ink film construction contains, per 1
0 m 2 of paper, at most 100 mg of soluble salts, at most 50 mg of soluble salts, or at most 30 mg of

   temperature within a temperature range of 20'C to 60'C, at a pH within a range of 8 to 10 or
   within a range of 8 to 11.
         In one embodiment, the recovered ink film of the invention may have a solubility of at
   least 3%, at least 5%, or at least 10% in water, at at least one particular temperature within a
 0 temperature range of 20'C to 60'C, at a pH within a range of 8 to 10 or within a range of 8 to 11.
   Waterfastness of Print Images
         ASTM Standard F2292 - 03 (2008), "Standard Practice for Determining the Waterfastness
   of Images Produced by Ink Jet Printers Utilizing Four Different Test Methods-Drip, Spray,
   Submersion and Rub", may be used to assess the waterfastness of ink dots and films printed on
 5 various substrates. The inventors used three of these test methods: drip, spray, and submersion,
   to evaluate waterfastness.
         In all three tests, the inventive ink film constructions exhibited complete waterfastness; no
   ink bleeding, smearing or transfer was observed.
   Identification of nitrogen-based conditioners in a printed image on a substrate
 0       When, prior to printing, the outer surface of the ITM is pre-treated or conditioned with a
   chemical agent that is, or contains, at least one nitrogen-based conditioning agent such as a
   polyethylene imine (PEI), transfer of the printed image to a substrate may typically result in at
   least some of the nitrogen-based conditioner being transferred as well. This conditioner may be
   detected using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) or by other means that will be known to
25 those of ordinary skill in the art of polymer analysis or chemical analysis of polymers or organic
   nitrogen-containing species.
         In one exemplary demonstration, two printed paper substrates were prepared under
   substantially identical conditions (including: inkjetting aqueous inkjet ink having nanopigment
   particles onto a transfer member; drying the ink on the transfer member; and transferring the ink
30 film produced to the particular substrate), except that the first substrate was printed without
   preconditioning of the transfer member, while for the second substrate the ITM was conditioned
   with a polyethylene imine.       XPS analysis of the printed images was conducted using a VG

   Scientific Sigma Probe and monochromatic Al Ka x-rays at 1486.6eV having a beam size of 400
   pim. Survey spectra were recorded with a pass energy of 150eV. For chemical state identification
   of nitrogen, high energy resolution measurements of Nis were performed with a pass energy of
   50eV. The core level binding energies of the different peaks were normalized by setting the
 5 binding energy for the Cls at 285.0eV. Deconvolution of the observed peaks revealed that the
   PEI pre-treated sample contained a unique peak at about 402 eV, which corresponds to a C
   NH2-C group.
          Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, there is provided a printed ink image having
   an XPS peak at 402.0 ± 0.4 eV, 402.0 ± 0.3 eV, or 402.0 ± 0.2 eV.
 0        Inventors have found that at the top or upper surface of the film, distal to the top surface of
   the substrate, the surface concentration of nitrogen may appreciably exceed the concentration of
   nitrogen within the bulk of the film. The concentration of nitrogen within the bulk of the film
   may be measured at a depth of at least 30 nanometers, at least 50 nanometers, at least 100
   nanometers, at least 200 nanometers, or at least 300 nanometers below the upper film surface.
 5          In some embodiments, the ratio of the surface nitrogen concentration to a nitrogen
   concentration within the bulk of the film is at least 1.1:1, at least 1.2:1, at least 1.3:1, at least
   1.5:1, at least 1.75:1, at least 2:1, at least 3:1, or at least 5:1.
            In some embodiments, the ratio of nitrogen to carbon (N/C) at the upper film surface to a
   ratio of nitrogen to carbon (N/C) within the bulk of the film is at least 1.1:1, at least 1.2:1, at
 0 least 1.3:1, at least 1.5:1, at least 1.75:1, or at least 2:1.
            In some embodiments, the concentration of a secondary amine group at the upper film
   surface exceeds a concentration of a secondary amine group within the bulk of the film.
            In some embodiments, the concentration of a tertiary amine group at the upper film
   surface exceeds a concentration of a tertiary amine group within the bulk of the film.
25          In some embodiments, the concentration of secondary and tertiary amine groups at the
   upper film surface exceeds a concentration of secondary and tertiary amine groups within the
   bulk of the film.
            In some embodiments, the upper film surface contains at least one PEI.
            In some embodiments, the upper film surface contains at least one poly quaternium
30 cationic guar, such as a guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, and a hydroxypropyl guar
   hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride.
            In some embodiments, the upper film surface contains a polymer having quaternary

   amine groups, such as an HCl salt of various primary amines.
          As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, the term
   "colorant" refers to a substance that is considered, or would be considered to be, a colorant in the
   art of printing.
 5        As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, the term
   "pigment" refers to a finely divided solid colorant having an average particle size (D 50 ) of at
   most 300nm. Typically, the average particle size is within a range of 10nm to 300nm. The
   pigment may have an organic and/or inorganic composition. Typically, pigments are insoluble
   in, and essentially physically and chemically unaffected by, the vehicle or medium in which they
 0 are incorporated. Pigments may be colored, fluorescent, metallic, magnetic, transparent or
   opaque.
          Pigments may alter appearance by selective absorption, interference and/or scattering of
   light. They are usually incorporated by dispersion in a variety of systems and may retain their
   crystal or particulate nature throughout the pigmentation process.
 5        As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, the term "dye"
   refers to at least one colored substance that is soluble or goes into solution during the application
   process and imparts color by selective absorption of light.
          As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, the term "average
   particle size", or "d50 ", with reference to the particle size of pigments, refers to an average
 0 particle size, by volume, as determined by a laser diffraction particle size analyzer (e.g.,
   MastersizerM 2000 of Malvern Instruments, England), using standard practice.
          With regard to fibrous printing substrates, persons skilled in the printing arts will
   appreciate that coated papers used for printing may be generally classified, functionally and/or
   chemically, into two groups, coated papers designed for use with non-inkjet printing methods
25 (e.g., offset printing) and coated papers designed specifically for use with inkjet printing
   methods employing aqueous inks. As is known in the art, the former type of coated papers utilize
   mineral fillers not only to replace some of the paper fibers in order to reduce costs, but to impart
   specific properties to paper, such as improved printability, brightness, opacity, and smoothness.
   In paper coating, minerals are used as white pigments to conceal the fiber, thereby improving
30 brightness, whiteness, opacity, and smoothness. Minerals commonly used to this end are kaolin,
   calcined clay, ground calcium carbonate, precipitated calcium carbonate, talc, gypsum, alumina,
   satin white, blanc fixe, zinc sulfide, zinc oxide, and plastic pigment (polystyrene).

          Coated papers designed for use in non-inkjet printing methods have hitherto been
   unsuitable for use with aqueous inkjet inks, or produce print dots or splotches that may be
   manifestly different from the printed ink film constructions of the present invention.
         In contrast, specialty coated papers designed for use with inkjet inks, which in some cases
 5 may have layer of filler pigment as with other types of coated papers, may also include a layer of
   highly porous mineral, usually silica, in combination with a water-soluble polymer such as
   polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), which acts as a binder, upon which the
   ink is printed. Such coated inkjet papers are designed to quickly remove the water from the
   printed ink, facilitating the printing of ink droplets with good uniformity and edge roughness.
 0 The present invention encompasses ink droplets printed on uncoated paper as well as coated
   paper not designed for inkjet use, but some embodiments of the present invention are not
   intended to encompass ink droplets printed on special coated inkjet paper.
          Thus, in some embodiments, the substrate is an uncoated paper. In other embodiments, the
   substrate is a coated paper that does not contain a water-soluble polymer binder in a layer upon
 5 which the ink is printed.
         As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, the term
   "commodity coated fibrous printing substrate" is meant to exclude specialty and high-end coated
   papers, including photographic paper and coated inkjet papers.
         In a typical paper coating of a commodity coated fibrous printing substrate, the coating
 0 formulation may be prepared by dispersing pigments, such as kaolin clay and calcium carbonate
   into water, then adding in binder, such as polystyrene butadiene copolymer and/or an aqueous
   solution of cooked starch. Other paper coating ingredients, such as rheological modifiers,
   biocides, lubricants, antifoaming compounds, crosslinkers, and pH adjusting additives may also
   be present in small amounts in the coating.
25       Examples of pigments that can be used in coating formulations are kaolin, calcium
   carbonate (chalk), China clay, amorphous silica, silicates, barium sulfate, satin white, aluminum
   trihydrate, talcum, titanium dioxide and mixtures thereof. Examples of binders are starch, casein,
   soy protein, polyvinylacetate, styrene butadiene latex, acrylate latex, vinylacrylic latex, and
   mixtures thereof. Other ingredients that may be present in the paper coating are, for example,
30 dispersants such as polyacrylates, lubricants such as stearic acid salts, preservatives, antifoam
   agents that can be either oil based, such as dispersed silica in hydrocarbon oil, or water-based
   such as hexalene glycol, pH adjusting agents such as sodium hydroxide, rheology modifiers such
   as    sodium      alginates,    carboxymethylcellulose,     starch,   protein,    high    viscosity

   hydroxyethylcellulose, and alkali-soluble lattices.
         As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, the term "fibrous
   printing substrate" of the present invention is specifically meant to include:
             *     Newsprint papers including standard newsprint, telephone directory paper,
 5    machine-finished paper, and super-calendered paper;
             *     Coated mechanical papers including light-weight coated paper, medium-weight
      coated paper, high-weight coated paper, machine finished coated papers, film coated offset;
             *     Woodfree uncoated papers including offset papers, lightweight papers;
             *     Woodfree coated papers including standard coated fine papers, low coat weight
 0    papers, art papers;
             *     Special fine papers including copy papers, digital printing papers, continuous
      stationery;
             *     Paperboards and Cartonboards; and
             *     Containerboards.
 5       As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, the term "fibrous
   printing substrate" of the present invention is specifically meant to include all five types of
   fibrous offset substrates described in ISO 12647-2.
         It will be appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described
   in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single
 0 embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention, which are, for brevity, described in
   the context of a single embodiment, may also be provided separately or in any suitable sub
   combination.
         Although the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments
   thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to
!5 those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications
   and variations that fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims. All publications,
   patents and patent applications mentioned in this specification, including the appendices, are
   hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference into the specification, to the same extent as if
   each individual publication, patent or patent application was specifically and individually
30 indicated to be incorporated herein by reference. In addition, citation or identification of any
   reference in this application shall not be construed as an admission that such reference is
   available as prior art to the present invention.

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
        1.       An ink film construction comprising:
