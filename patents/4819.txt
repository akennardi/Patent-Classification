         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates to a method for preparing a pharmaceutical
 5 intermediate which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates
   to chloramphenicol drug intermediates p-nitroacetophenone synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         P-nitroacetophenone    is mainly used as a pharmaceutical chloramphenicol
10 intermediate and dye intermediates. Chloramphenicol antibiotics can act on the 50S
   subunit of the bacterial ribosomal protein, and inhibit the synthesis of protein, it is a
   bacteriostatic broad-spectrum antibiotics. The bacterial cell 70S ribosome is the major
   cellular component of the synthetic protein, which includes both 50S and 30S subunits.
   Chloramphenicol binds to 50S subunits, blocking the action of transpeptidase,
15 interfering amino acid tRNA terminals bind with 50S subunit, so that the formation of
   new peptide chain is blocked, inhibit protein synthesis. Because chloramphenicol can
   also be combined with human mitochondrial 70S, which can also inhibit the human
   mitochondrial protein synthesis,       it is the human body toxicity. Because           of
   chloramphenicol binding to 70S ribosomes is reversible, it is considered to be a
20 bacteriostatic antibiotic, but it can also produce bactericidal effect on the bacteria at
   some high concentrations,        it can produce bactericidal effect even at lower
   concentrations of influenza. P-nitroacetophenone as a pharmaceutical intermediates of
   chloramphenicol, its synthesis method is of great significance. However, most of the
   existing synthetic methods are using p-nitro-ethylbenzene aldehydes as the reactant, it
25 is complicated and the final yield is not very high. Therefore, it is necessary to propose
   a new synthetic method for further improving the quality and yield of the product and
   reducing the byproduct content.
