   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to a composition for protecting liver from alcoholic liver
 5 disease.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Drinking alcoholic drinks is an ancient activity that constantly evolves with the
   civilization and culture of human beings. Moderate drinking can help to relieve
10 emotions    and have functions      of promoting    interpersonal communication and
   transferring family affection and friendship in the social process. Ethanol is the main
   chemical component in all kinds of alcoholic drinks. Moderate ethanol is not toxic to
   the human body. However, the metabolic rate of ethanol in human body is limited. Only
   a small part of alcohol ingested into the mouth is excreted out of body through lungs
15 respiration or sweat gland, and is absorbed by human body mainly in the jejunal section
   of small intestine. About 90% of the alcohol absorbed will enter the liver for
   metabolism. Alcohol in the liver undergoes three fermentation systems of alcohol
   dehydrogenase, microsomal ethanol oxidizing system and catalase to be oxidized into
   acetaldehyde. The resulting acetaldehyde will be subjected to aldehyde dehydrogenase
20 (ALDH) action to be converted into acetic acid. The acetic acid then in the form of
   acetyl-CoA undergoes tricarboxylic cycle to generate heat.
   However, long-term or excessive alcohol intake can easily lead to alcoholic liver
   disease (ALD). At the outset, steatosis and alcoholic fatty liver appear, developing into
25 alcoholic hepatitis, liver fibrosis, and even leading to cirrhosis. The main clinical
   symptoms of ALD include nausea, vomiting, jaundice and possibly liver enlargement
   and tenderness, and may be complicated by liver failure and upper gastrointestinal
                                               1

   bleeding. The pathological mechanism of alcoholic liver disease is very complicated,
   and generally believed that it is mainly a result of interaction of various factors such as
   oxidative stress, inflammatory response and nutritional imbalance induced directly or
   indirectly by the metabolic process of ethanol and its derivatives. First of all,
 5 acetaldehyde derived from the metabolic process of alcohol will damage the structures
   and functions of various organelles and enzymes in the liver cells, causing direct
   damage to the liver. Further, aldehydes can be combined with a number of proteins in
   the body to form highly immunogenic acetaldehyde adducts, which may stimulate the
   body's immune system to induce immunoreactive liver damage. Acetaldehyde may also
10 impair p-oxidation of mitochondrial fatty acids, induce lipid peroxidation reaction,
   inhibit biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH), and diminish the antioxidant function of
   peroxidase. In particular, when alcohol is taken in large quantities over a short period of
   time, the alcohol concentration in blood is so high as to activate the metabolism of
   alcohol in the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system, which will produce a large amount
15 of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the process to attack the hepatocytes. ROS
   may cause liver damage through many ways, mainly by mitochondrial DNA depletion
   and lipid peroxidation so as to initiate hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis and lead to
   depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) to reduce the protective function of the liver
   against peroxidative damage. In addition, in the process of acetaldehyde metabolism
20 into acetic acid, increased ratio of NADH/NAD+          in the hepatocytes results in the
   reduction of oxidative capacity of hepatocytes to fatty acids and the consequent
   reduction of the tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, causing the accumulation of fat in the
   liver and the occurrence of fatty liver, and also causing the number of mitochondria to
   increase to consume too much oxygen, resulting in liver cells to be prone to necrosis
25 and fibrosis owing to hypoxia.
   In China, the proportion of alcoholic liver disease patients over the overall liver disease
                                                2

   inpatients has been on the rise in recent years, from 4.2% in 1991 to 21.3% in 1996,
   while the proportion of alcoholic cirrhosis to total liver cirrhosis has risen from 10.8 %
   in 1999 to 24.0% in 2003.
 5 Therefore, there is a strong need for compositions and medical uses that can protect the
   liver against alcoholic liver disease.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   Now, the inventor of the present application have found that the whole blood collection
10 from a mammal, especially the whole blood collection from a Suidae animal, such as
   the whole blood collection from domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica), can improve
   alcoholic liver disease. To assess the effects of the whole blood collection on alcoholic
   liver disease, the inventor refer to the standard method proposed by Lieber et al. (de la,

   rodents: a critical evaluation. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 25, 254S-261S) to establish a
   mouse model in which alcoholic liver disease is induced by long-term feeding of
   alcoholic diet. This application evaluated the liver condition of the animal model in
   terms of biochemical indices of liver function, antioxidative enzyme activity and tissue
20 pathology, thereby confirming that said whole blood collection is effective in treating
   alcoholic liver disease and capable of being used as a complementary or alternative
   medicine for treating alcoholic liver disease.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   The term "whole blood collection" as used herein may refer to blood collected from an
   animal body and not subjected to a substantial separation process, including plasma,
   hemocytes with plasma as the carrier, as well as substances such as carbohydrates,
15 proteins, minerals and hormones dissolved or suspended in the plasma. The term "whole
   blood collection" as used herein encompasses the newly collected fresh blood, the
   degraded products and derivatives thereof, as well as the whole blood samples that have
   been diluted with an appropriate buffer, and subjected to appropriate concentration to
   remove water and/or add additives such as anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, EDTA,
20 ACD-A), protease inhibitors, antibiotics and preservatives. According to the invention,
   under the premise of essentially reserving the main ingredients of the whole blood
   collection, the whole blood collection can undergo additional processing steps such as
   heating, filtration or chromatography to remove or deactivate the unwanted ingredients.
   These unwanted ingredients include, but are not limited to, toxic chemicals, allergens
25 and pathogens. In a preferred embodiment, the collected blood is further subjected to a
   conventional lyophilization process such that the whole blood collection is in the form
   of a lyophilized powder.
                                               4

   According to the invention, the "whole blood collection" is obtained from a mammal,
   preferably from a non-human mammal, including but not limited to horses, cattle, pigs,
   goats, dogs, cats, mice , rats, guinea pigs, gerbils, hamsters, rabbits, chimpanzees, and
 5 rhesus monkeys. In a preferred embodiment, the "whole blood collection" is from pigs.
   The physical structures and functions of pigs in physiology, biochemistry, anatomy,
   metabolism, bone development, cardiovascular system, immune system and digestive
   system are similar to those of human and, thus, it has been regarded as the best donor
   for medical research and human xenotransplantation. As will be described below, the
10 term "pig" as used herein is meant any animal belonging to the Suidae family, including
   but not limited to the wild boar (Sus scrofa), domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica), mini
   swine (Sus Scrofa domestica var. mino guizhounensis Yu.), warthog (Phacochoerus
   africanus) and peccary (Pecari tajacu). In a more preferred embodiment, the "pig" is
   selected from an animal of genus Sus, preferably a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica),
15 including but not limited to the domestic pig breeds such as Landrace, Yorkshire, Duroc
   Kanto, Hampshire and Berkshire, as well as the domestic pig breeds interbred from the
   above domestic pig, such as the LYD white pigs raised on a large scale in Taiwan area
   which are interbred from Landrace, Yorkshire and Duroc Kanto. The collection process
   of the whole blood collection includes any method that can collect the whole blood of a
20 mammal without substantially destroying the ingredients of the whole blood collection.
   With domestic pig as an example, methods for collecting a small amount of blood
   include, but are not limited to, ear vein blood collection and precaval vein blood
   sampling, and a large scale whole blood collection can be made by sacrificing animals.
25 The term "alcoholic liver disease" used herein may refer to a series of liver damage
   conditions caused by sustained intake of alcoholic beverages or foods. Preferably, one
   or more of these conditions are selected from the group consisting of alcoholic steatosis,
                                                5

   alcoholic fatty liver, alcoholic steatohepatitis, hepatocellular ballooning, alcoholic
   hepatic fibrosis and alcoholic hepatic cirrhosis. The "alcoholic liver disease" can
   generally be diagnosed by a medical specialist, veterinarian or other clinical medical
   personnel. In a more preferred embodiment, the "alcoholic liver disease" is selected
 5 from the group consisting of alcoholic steatosis and alcoholic fatty liver.
   As will be described below, the application simulated alcoholic liver disease by the
   conventional mouse model proposed by Lieber-DeCarli. This conventional animal
   model involves the long-term feeding of experimental animals with alcohol-containing
10 fluid feed, in which 36% of the carbohydrate contents based on the total energy required
   by the animals are replaced with ethanol, which is used for the analog of liver damage
   caused by long-term intake of alcohol. Compared to the large amount of acute alcohol
   intake, this experimental animal model of chronic alcohol intake is considered more
   similar to human alcohol intake behavior.
15
   As shown in the examples below, this animal model successfully induced alcoholic fatty
   liver. Fatty liver is mainly caused by the abnormal accumulation of triglyceride droplets
   in hepatocytes and is an early pathological symptom of alcoholic liver disease. The
   alcoholic fatty liver is also considered to be a result of abnormality of the lipid
20 metabolism in the body. As shown in Example 5 below, feeding mice with fluid
   alcoholic feed led to a rise of liver function damage indices: serum AST and ALT. In
   addition, Example 7 below shows that the alcohol treatment may cause fatty infiltration
   and histopathological changes in the liver. Administration of the composition disclosed
   herein effectively improved the liver function indices and reversed liver pathological
25 changes and hepatomegaly phenomena. These results indicate that the composition
   disclosed herein has a hepatoprotective activity for protecting liver from the damage
   caused by alcohol.
                                                6

   Long-term intake of alcohol can lead to lipid metabolism imbalance in the body,
   including decreased lipid oxidation and increased triglyceride (TG) synthesis, thereby
   resulting in increased blood lipids and fatty liver. As shown in Example 4 below,
 5 feeding mice with fluid alcoholic feed led to a significant increase in the liver TG
   content. Administration of the composition disclosed herein, with a low, medium or
   high dose, significantly reduced the liver TG content. The composition disclosed herein
   effectively   ameliorated    the   liver  TG    accumulation,   indicating   that  it   has
   hepatoprotective function for protecting liver from the damage caused by alcohol.
10
   During the metabolic process of alcohol in the liver, a large amount of free radicals are
   generated, resulting in an oxidative stress. The oxidative stress may interfere with and
   destroy the body's antioxidative defense system, leading to imbalance between free
   radical generation and antioxidative capability and mass production of lipid peroxides,
15 eventually causing alcoholic liver disease. As shown in Example 6 below, feeding mice
   with fluid alcoholic feed led to a significant decrease in the total glutathione (GSH)
   content in the liver and a significant increase in catalase (CAT) activity. The significant
   increase in CAT activity may be due to the production of a large amount of hydrogen
   peroxide during the metabolism of alcohol, which is a compensatory response requiring
20 CAT enzyme to remove hydrogen peroxide. GSH is one of the main antioxidant
   substances in the cells. The total GSH decrease indicates that alcohol does cause an
   increase in oxidative stress in the liver cells. In general, long-term intake of alcohol
   caused disturbances in the antioxidative defense system of mice and led to an increase
   in oxidative stress, which in turn resulted in liver damage. Administration of the
25 composition disclosed herein reduced oxidative stress, and protected liver from
   oxidative damage.
                                                 7

   Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention is to provide a hepatoprotective composition,
   comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a whole blood collection from a
   mammal, and a pharmaceutically or dietarily acceptable excipient.        In another aspect
   of the invention is to provide use of the aforementioned composition for manufacturing
 5 a medicament for preventing or treating alcoholic liver disease in a subject.
   The term "hepatoprotective" as used herein means that the composition described herein
   is capable of maintaining the viability and vitality of liver cells, maintaining or even
   regaining the liver function, or alleviating or improving the liver damage caused by
10 long-term alcohol ingestion. The term "hepatoprotective"           encompass preventing
   alcoholic liver disease from occurring in a subject and/or treating alcoholic liver disease
   after its emergence in the subject. In this regard, the term "preventing" includes
   reducing the severity/intensity of, or initiation of, alcoholic liver disease.   The term
   "treating" includes alleviation or relief of at least one clinical symptom of alcoholic
15 liver disease after its emergence.   However, the term "hepatoprotective" should not be
   interpreted as always having 100% protection against alcoholic liver disease, but rather
   meaning that it can substantially alleviate or relieve at least one clinical symptom of
   alcoholic liver disease that has occurred or may occur in a subject.
20 The whole blood collection may be formulated in combination with a pharmaceutically
   or dietarily acceptable excipient to produce a hepatoprotective composition. The term
   "pharmaceutically or dietary acceptable excipient" as used herein means an inert
   substance used as a carrier for the whole blood collection, which is not toxic, irritating,
   pyrogenic, antigenic and hemolytic to the applied subject and free from substantial
25 pharmacological activity without reducing the beneficial effects caused by the whole
   blood collection. These excipients include, but are not limited to, solvents, surfactants,
   disintegrants, binders, diluents, lubricants, stabilizers, antioxidants, flavoring agents,
                                                8

   sweeteners, coloring agents, absorption enhancers, plasticizers, pH adjusting agents,
   osmotic pressure adjusting agents and thickeners. The "pharmaceutically or dietarily
   acceptable excipients" as used herein may refer to those known by the persons with
   ordinary skill in the art (please refer to Remington: The Science and Practice of
 5 Pharmacy, Nineteenth Ed (Easton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Company, 1995); Hoover,
   John E., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co.,                  Easton,
   Pennsylvania 1975; Liberman, H.A. and Lachman, L., Eds., PharmaceuticalDosage
   Forms, Marcel Decker, New York, N.Y., 1980; and PharmaceuticalDosage Forms and
   Drug Delivery Systems, Seventh Ed. (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 1999)).
10
   The hepatoprotective composition disclosed herein can be administrated to a subject via
   any suitable route to allow the composition to contact a target cell or tissue. The routes
   of administration include, but are not limited to, a topical, enteral or parenteral route,
   such as an oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intratumoral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal,
15 transdermal, intrathecal, or intracerebral route.     Administration can be either rapid as
   by injection, or over a period of time as by slow infusion or administration of a slow
   release formulation. The term "subject" as used herein is intended to cover human and
   non-human mammals. Non-human mammals include livestock, companion animals,
   laboratory animals, and non-human primates. Non-human subjects include, but are not
20 limited to, horses, cattle, pigs, goats, dogs, cats, mice, rats, guinea pigs, gerbils,
   hamsters, minks, rabbits, chimpanzees, and rhesus monkeys. In a preferred embodiment,
   the subject is human, especially a human patient with alcoholic liver disease or at risk of
   alcoholic liver disease, e.g., a patient suffering from alcoholic fatty liver.
25 In a preferred embodiment, the hepatoprotective composition is prepared for oral
   administration. The whole blood collection may be co-formulated with a suitable
   excipient, and pressed into tablets, pills, or encapsulated into solid capsule or soft
                                                   9

   capsule. For example, the excipient may be selected from maltodextrins, starches, syrup,
   lactose, mannitol, sorbitol, sucrose, dextrose, gum acacia, gelatin, calcium phosphate,
   hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium sulfate dehydrate,
   calcium lactate trihydrate, glycine, kaolin, calcium hydroxide, talc, alginates, stearates,
 5 sodium stearyl fumarate, hydrogenated vegetable oil, higher fatty acids and alkali and
   alkaline earth salts thereof, glycerol, wax, boric acid, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate,
   sodium     chloride,  leucine,  polyethylene    glycols,  polyvinylpyrrolidone,   methoxy
   polyethylene glycols, sodium oleate, glyceryl behenate, sodium lauryl sulfate and
   colloidal silica and the like.
10
   The whole blood collection in the hepatoprotective composition is administered to a
   subject in a therapeutically effective amount to elicit the a beneficial biological or
   medicinal response that is being sought in a cell, tissue, system, animal or human by a
   researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician and preferably to stabilize,
15 ameliorate, alleviate or relieve a condition or symptom in the subject, such as improving
   liver function indices, reducing hepatomegaly, reducing accumulation of triglycerides in
   the liver, and improving liver steatosis. Although the therapeutically effective amount is
   generally determined by the observed effect that it has, in comparison with the effect
   which is observed on the similar patients who are administrated with compositions that
20 do not include the whole blood collection disclosed herein (i.e., the control group), the
   actual dosage is calculated on the basis of the selected particular administration route.
   Further refinement of the calculations necessary to determine the appropriate dosage for
   administration is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art. When formulated
   into an oral dosage form administrable to a human patient, the whole blood collection is
25 preferably administered daily, weekly or twice a week, at an amount ranging from 0.1
   mg/kg body weight to 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably from 1 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg
   body weight, such as 10 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg body weight.
                                                 10

   In one embodiment, the hepatoprotective composition may further contain other active
   ingredients that are beneficial to the liver so as to be formulated into healthy foods and
   pharmaceuticals that are suitable for individual ingestion and can ensure both safety and
 5 efficacy. In another embodiment, the hepatoprotective composition consists essentially
   of the whole blood collection and the acceptable excipients described above. The phrase
   "consist essentially of' or "consisting essentially of', with respect to the constitutive
   elements of the hepatoprotective composition defined in the claims, means that the
   composition contains the indicated elements and may contain additional elements only
10 if the additional elements do not materially alter the basic and novel characteristics of
   the invention.   In still another embodiment, the hepatoprotective composition consists
   of and, therefore, contains only the whole blood collection in combination with the
   pharmaceutically or dietarily acceptable excipient described above.

   the invention. The experimental results shown in each example are expressed as mean
   value ± standard deviation.

   500 ml of whole blood was taken from LDY pigs raised by Taiwan Sugar Corporation
   and loaded in an empty bottle containing 75 ml of anticoagulant acid citrate dextrose
   solution-A (ACD-A) and 3 ml gentamicin and stored at a low temperature. The pig
   whole blood was aliquoted into glass vials (125 ml/vial) for lyophilization and frozen at
25 -80'C for 24 hours, followed by lyophilization to obtain lyophilized powder of whole
   blood collection.

   Example 1: Animal Model of Alcoholic Liver Disease
   Six-week-old male C57BL/6J (B6) mice (BioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd.) were fed with a
   general chew diet to 10 weeks of age. Ambient temperature of the mice feeding
   environment was controlled at 22 ± 2 0 C; light and dark cycle times are 12 hours,
 5 respectively; free access to drinking water and feed, and the body weight was recorded
   once a week. Then, experimental model was conducted using fluid alcohol feed to
   induce alcoholic fatty liver damage. Prior to the experiment, the C57BL/6J (B6) mice
   were randomly divided into five groups. The alcohol content in the fluid alcohol feed
   was gradually increased one week before the experiment to adapt the experimental
10 animals to the fluid alcohol feed. The experimental groups were as shown in Table 1
   below:

   The fluid alcohol feed was Lieber-DeCarli Regular Liquid Diet Ethanol (product
                                                12

   number 710260, containing 5.11% ethanol), purchased from Dytes Inc., Philadelphia,
   USA, and the normal fluid feed was Lieber-DeCarli Regular Liquid Diet Contrl
   (product number 710027), purchased from Dytes Inc., Philadelphia, USA, both with a
   caloric density of 1.0 kcal/mL. The feed supply was based on free ingestion. When
 5 experiment began, all animals were fed through oral tube with deionized water or the
   whole blood lyophilized powder prepared in Preparative Example 1, at 10 am in the
   morning in each day for 4 weeks, and fresh fluid feed was replaced at 4 pm daily and
   the intake amount was recorded. The body weight of the mice was monitored every two
   days.
10
   After 4 weeks of feeding, the mice were weighted, and sacrificed to take blood from
   orbital or heart for separating serum to test for following biochemical indicators of
   blood lipid and liver function: triglycerides, cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
   and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Liver samples were taken by laparotomy, and
15 weighted to calculate the liver weight/body weight ratio. A tissue block of about 1 cm
   was cut from each right liver lobe and fixed in 10% neutral formalin solution.
   Paraffin-embedded sections were stained with H&E for histopathological observation.
   The remaining liver was divided into six parts according to the anatomical locations for
   measuring the GSH content and catalase enzyme activity, as well as the changes in liver
20 triglyceride and cholesterol contents, respectively.
   Example 2: Body Weight Changes in Mice
   The average initial body weight of ten week old mice was about 25 grams. After a week
   of adaptation, the weights of the respective groups of mice increased by about 1-2
25 grams, and the average weight was about 26-27 grams. In the experiments, because the
   alcohol concentration of the fluid alcohol feed was as high as 5.1%, mice began to
   ingest food less. Therefore, the control group is changed to adopt pair-feeding mode for
                                                 13

    feeding. A week later, the body weights of the respective mouse group were reduced by
    about 2-3 grams with average body weight of about 23-24 grams. The body weights in
    the second and third weeks thereafter and final body weights maintained at the same
    level in all groups. There was no significant difference between the groups (p> 0.05).

    The absolute weights and relative weights of heart, spleen, lung, kidney and epididymal
    white adipose tissue (EWAT) were not significantly different among all groups (p>
10  0.05), but it was found that the absolute weight and relative weight of the liver in
    alcohol treatment group (TO group) were significantly greater than the control group (C
    group); namely, the mice of alcohol treatment group (TO group) showed hepatomegaly
    phenomenon (p> 0.05). Significant improvement in hepatomegaly was evident in mice
    group treated with different doses, especially in the mice group treated with the high
15  dose of the whole blood lyophilized powder prepared in preparative Example 1 (T12.5
    group) (p> 0.05).

 5 Example 4: Triglyceride and Cholesterol Contents in Serum and Liver
   (1) Determination of serum triglyceride (TG) content
   Commercially available detection kit was adopted (Randox Laboratories Ltd., UK, kit
   number TR418). Serially diluted reference solutions (12.5-200 mg/dL) and the serum
   samples obtained in Example 1 after appropriate dilution were added at 10 pl/well in a
10 96-well microtiter plate, and 200 pl of reaction reagent was added for reaction at room
   temperature for 10 minutes and then the absorbance at 500 nm was measured. A
   standard curve was plotted based on the absorbance values of the serially diluted
   reference solutions, and the serum TG contents were obtained by interpolating the
                                               15

   absorbance values of the serum samples onto the standard curve.
   (2) Determination of serum cholesterol
   Commercially available detection kit was adopted (Randox Laboratories Ltd., UK, kit
 5 number CH280). Serially diluted reference solutions (12.5-200 mg/dL) and the serum
   samples obtained in Example 1 after appropriate dilution were added at 10 pI/well in a
   96-well microtiter plate, and 200 pl of reaction reagent was added for reaction at room
   temperature for 10 minutes and then the absorbance at 500 nm was measured. A
   standard curve was plotted based on the absorbance values of the serially diluted
10 reference solutions, and the serum cholesterol contents were obtained by interpolating
   the absorbance values of the serum samples onto the standard curve.
   (3) Preparation of liver lipid extract
   The lipid extract method proposed by Folch et al. (Folch et al. J Biol. Chem. 226:, 497,
15 509 (1957)) was adopted. 0.1 grams liver obtained in Example 1 was placed in a glass
   vial with a small amount of extraction solution (CHCl 3 :MeOH        =  2:1) added to be
   pulverized by a homogenizer, followed by filtration with a filter paper and using
   volumetric flask to quantitatively extract solution to 10 ml.
20 (4) Determination of liver triglyceride content
   50 pl of liver extract was placed in a glass test tube and stood in a laminar-flow hood,
   allowing the solvent to completely evaporate. Then, a commercially available detection
   kit (Randox Laboratories Ltd., UK, kit number TR418) was used according to the same
   protocol for measuring the serum TG content.

      to allow the solvent to completely evaporate, followed by addition of 10tl of Triton
      X-100. Then, a commercially available detection kit (Randox Laboratories Ltd., UK, kit
      number CH280) was used according to the same protocol for measuring the serum
      cholesterol content.

      Table 5 shows that the alcohol treatment (TO group) resulted in an increase of TG level
      in mouse serum, whereas medium and high doses of the whole blood collection
10    obtained in Preparative Example 1 (T6.25 and T12.5 groups) could reduce the degree of
      lipid increase caused by alcohol intake. In addition, the alcohol treatment (TO group)
      significantly resulted in accumulation of TG in mouse liver (p <0.05), indicating that the
      alcohol treatment caused fatty liver in mice. Administration of different doses of the
      whole blood collection obtained in Preparative Example 1 significantly improved the
15    hepatic TG (p <0.05), indicating that the whole blood collection obtained in Preparative
      Example 1 has the potential to improve fatty liver. As for the mice serum and liver
      cholesterol levels in the respective groups, there was no significant difference between
                                                  17

   the groups (p> 0.05).
   Example 5: Serum AST and ALT Enzyme Activity
   In this Example, AST and ALT enzyme activities in the serum samples obtained in
 5 Example 1 were used as indices of liver damage to evaluate the effects of the whole
   blood collection obtained in Preparative Example 1 on the improvement of hepatic
   damage induced by alcohol in mice. Commercially available detection kits (Randox
   Laboratories Ltd., UK, kit numbers AL1268 and AS1267) were used to detect
   biochemical indices AST (or GOT) and ALT (or GPT). The detection was based on the
10 method proposed by Reitman and Frankel (Reitman, S, and Frankel, A., 1957, Am J
   Clin Pathol. 28 (1): 56-63) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry

   Table 6 shows that alcohol treatment (TO group) resulted in an increase in AST and
   ALT activities in mouse serum (p <0.05). After administration of the whole blood
   lyophilized powder obtained in Preparative Example 1, ALT enzyme activity was
20 significantly reduced, especially in the T6.25 group. The results indicate that the whole
                                                18

   blood collection obtained in Preparative Example 1 has the potential to maintain liver
   function in the case of alcohol-induced chronic liver damage.
   Example 6: Assessment of Liver Antioxidative Enzyme Activity
 5 Approximately 0.1 grams fresh liver sample obtained in Example 1 was taken to add
   into an ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4,
   1.15% KCl) and a tissue homogenizer was used to grind the liver sample into a
   homogenate, which was in turn filtered with gauze and adjusted to 10% (w/v) with the
   buffer. Centrifugal separation was done at 1000xg at 4'C for 30 minutes to obtain a
10 homogeneous suspension of liver tissue. After appropriate dilution, 10 p.l of the diluted
   samples and serially diluted bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri,
   USA) reference solutions were taken into a 96-well microtiter plates for enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then, 200 pl of Bio-Rad protein assay reagent
   (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was added in each well for reaction for 5
15 minutes at room temperature, and an ELISA reader was employed to measure the
   absorbance at 595 nm. The protein concentrations of the respective hepatic homogenate
   samples were calculated based on the standard curve plotted.
   Commercially available kits (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, kit numbers 703002
20 and 707002) were used to measure total glutathione (GSH) content and catalase (CAT)
   enzyme activity in liver. The results are shown in Table 7 and Table 8 below.

   The total GSH content shown in Table 7 included both reduced GSH and oxidized GSH.
   Alcohol treatment (TO group) resulted in a significant decrease in total GSH (p <0.05)
   in mouse liver. GSH is the main antioxidant in cells. Alcohol treatment led to a decrease
 5 in the total amount of GSH, indicating that alcohol led to increased oxidative stress in
   liver cells. Administration of medium and high doses of the whole blood collection
   obtained in Preparative Example 1 resulted in an increase in total GSH. This indicates
   that the whole blood collection obtained in Preparative Example 1 has the potential to
   diminish the oxidative stress and protect the liver against oxidative damage.

   CAT is one of the major antioxidative enzymes in cells, and its main function is to
   convert intracellular hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Table 8 shows that
   alcohol treatment (TO group) led to a significant increase in CAT activity in mouse liver
15 (p <0.05). During alcohol metabolism, a large amount of hydrogen peroxide is
   generated, which needs to be removed by CAT. CAT activity is the highest in
                                               20

   alcohol-treated mice, which may be a compensatory response of hepatocytes to
   oxidative stress to promote CAT gene expression to remove hydrogen peroxide.
   Administration of medium and high doses of the whole blood collection obtained in
   Preparative Example 1 (T6.25 and T12.5 groups) resulted in a decline in CAT activity,
 5 indicating that the whole blood collection obtained in Preparative Example 1 has the
   potential to inhibit the liver's capability of generating hydrogen peroxide, thereby
   reducing the CAT expression due to the compensatory response.
   Example 7: Liver Histopathological Examination
10 The liver tissue obtained in Example 1 was dehydrated and cleared with various
   concentrations of ethanol (30, 50, 70, 95, 99.5%) and xylene. Then, xylene was replaced
   by hot paraffin solution, and finally the tissue was embedded with paraffin. The finished
   paraffin specimens were sectioned in 5 pLm thickness using a microtome, and the
   sections were placed into clean glass slides and dried at 37 0 C for further pathological
15 staining.
   In order to observe the extent of hepatic cell damage, fat accumulation, necrosis and the
   like, H&E staining was performed on the liver tissue in order to evaluate the hepatic fat
   accumulation. The tissue sections were placed in xylene for 30 minutes for dewaxing,
20 and then sequentially reconstituted in 99.5, 95, 70, 50, and 30% ethanol for 30 minutes,
   respectively, followed by soaking in distilled water for 10 minutes for the subsequent
   staining. The tissue sections were soaked in hematoxylin for 30 seconds for staining cell
   nuclei, and rinsed with distilled water for several minutes. Then, the tissue sections
   were stained by eosin for 2 to 5 minutes, and rinsed with distilled water for several
25 minutes. The completed staining process was followed by a dehydration process by
   sequentially placing in 50, 70, 95 and 100% ethanol twice, each for 30 seconds, and
   then proceeding with hyalinization twice with xylene and sealing with sealing glue. The
                                                 21

   images of the stained sections are shown in Fig.1.
   Figure 1 shows that the liver tissue of the Control group was intact, in which the
   boundary between cells can be easily observed, and the internal structure of the cells
 5 was clean and free of impurity or vacuoles. The liver cells of the alcohol treatment (TO
   group) exhibited considerable pathological changes, such as ballooning degeneration
   and fatty droplet accumulation presenting a bright droplet-like form, and the boundary
   between the cells became blurring. After administration with the whole blood collection
   obtained in Preparative Example 1, it can be observed that the liver pathological change
10 has significantly improved, especially the number and size of the fatty droplets
   significantly reduced (T2.5 group, T6.25 group and T12.5 group). The results show that
   the whole blood collection obtained in Preparative Example 1 has the potential to
   improve hepatic steatosis.
15 While the invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments
   above, it should be recognized that the preferred embodiments are given for the purpose
   of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention and
   that various modifications and changes, which will be apparent to those skilled in the
   relevant art, may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
