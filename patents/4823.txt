                  SYSTEM FOR SECURING A MOTORCYCLE OR BICYCLE
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      The present invention relates to systems for securing a motorcycle or bicycle,
especially to a vehicle for transportation.    The present invention also relates to methods of
fastening the system to the vehicle.
BACKGROUND ART
[0002]      It will be clearly understood that, if a prior art publication is referred to herein, this
reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms part of the common general
knowledge in the art in Australia or in any other country.
[0003]      An increasing number of people are riding motorcycles for recreation or racing in
competition. Many such motorcycles are ridden primarily for off-road recreation or racing and
are not licensed or licensable for highway use. Typical areas suitable for off-road motorcycling
are generally remote from cities or towns, as local town planning and zoning will typically
allocate and approve motocross tracks in low population areas on the outskirts of town. As such,
the use of motorcycles for off-road recreation or racing purposes generally requires the transport
of the motorcycle from where it is stored.
[0004]      Similarly, bicycle riders frequently need to transport their bicycles to a destination
before use. Mountain bicycle riders, for example, often wish to use mountain bicycle trails
which are typically located remote to, or on the outskirts of population centres.
[0005]      While bicycles can be transported on the roof of a vehicle, or on a bicycle rack
positioned at the rear of a vehicle, motorcycles cannot be transported in such ways. As a result,
the use of a utility or van to transport a motorcycle or motorcycles is the most popular option.
When the motorcycle(s) are positioned in such vehicles it is desirable to position them in an
upright position to minimise the space occupied by the motorcycle(s) and to minimise damage to
the motorcycle(s) during transport.
[0006]      Various apparatuses have been developed to transport such motorcycle(s) in an
upright position. For example, the Bed Buddy (sold by CCR Sport, California USA) includes a
rack for positioning three motorcycles. The rack is intended to be positioned on the front wall of
a utility or pick-up tray, directly beneath the rear window of the cabin, and includes three
channels for positioning three front motorcycle tires.

[0007]       A similar arrangement         is described in US2008/0050212,        which describes   a
motorcycle hauling stabiliser which receives and secures the front wheel of a motorcycle. The
stabiliser has a flange to wrap over the front truck bed wall, and includes a horizontally arranged
series of hooks to provide anchors for tie down straps. The stabiliser also includes vertical wheel
stabilisers which extend into a pickup truck's bed from the front vertical face of the tray. The
front motorcycle tire is located between the wheel stabilisers when the motorcycle hauling
stabiliser is in use.
[0008]        However, the arrangements described above (the Bed Buddy and US2008/0050212)
rely upon strapping applied between the rack and the motorcycle(s) to hold the motorcycle(s) in
position.    These arrangements may also permit lateral movement of the rear wheel of the
motorcycle(s) which may destabilise the weight in the tray during transport.
[0009]       US2011/0284603 describes an apparatus for securing a plurality of motorbikes in a
truck bed without the need for straps. The apparatus includes a frame positioned on the front
wall of a truck bed (the headwall). The frame includes an anchoring device slidably attached to
the frame, which is pivotally attached to the frame for adjusting its height. The anchoring device
may comprise a clamping mechanism for securing the forks of the motorbike to the frame.
However, this arrangement may permit lateral movement of the rear wheel of the motorcycle(s)
which may destabilise the weight in the tray during transport.
[0010]       US5,259,711 describes a tie-down apparatus having an elongated track which is
positioned on a supporting structure, such as the top of the side wall of a truck bed. A car is
slideably positioned on the track. The car includes an elongated shank which terminates in a
ring.   Strapping may be tied to the ring to secure cargo within the truck bed, such as a
motorcycle. However, this apparatus may allow lateral movement of the front and rear wheels of
the motorcycle during transport.

[0011]        The present invention is directed to a system for securing a motorcycle or bicycle
which may at least partially overcome at least one of the abovementioned disadvantages or
provide the consumer with a useful or commercial choice.
[0012]        With the foregoing in view, the present invention in one form, resides broadly in a
system for securing a motorcycle or bicycle, especially to a vehicle for transportation.
[0013]        In a first aspect, the present invention provides a system for securing a motorcycle or

bicycle having a front tire and a rear tire, the system comprising:
             A rack for the front tire comprising a tire positioner for positioning the front tire, and
             at least one fastener attachment for attaching a fastener to hold the motorcycle or
             bicycle in position; and

             relative to the tire positioner; and
                 at least one fastener attachment for attaching a fastener to hold the motorcycle or
             bicycle in position.
[0016]        In one embodiment of the second aspect, the motorcycle or bicycle has a rear tire and
the system further comprises a rack for the rear tire comprising a tire positioner for positioning
the rear tire. In a further embodiment of the second aspect, when two of said racks for the front
tire abut each other they form a tire positioner for positioning the front tire of a further
motorcycle or bicycle. In another embodiment of the second aspect, when two of said racks for
the rear tire abut each other they form a tire positioner for positioning the rear tire of a further
motorcycle or bicycle.
[0017]        In a third aspect, the present invention provides a system for securing a motorcycle
or bicycle having two tires, the system comprising:
             A rack for one of said tires comprising:

                                                      -r
                  a tire positioner for positioning the front tire; and
                  at least one fastener attachment for attaching a fastener to hold the motorcycle or
             bicycle in position;
         wherein when two of said racks abut each other they form a tire positioner for positioning
         the tire of a further motorcycle or bicycle.
[0018]        The system may be for securing a motorcycle or a bicycle having a front and/or a
rear tire. The rack may be for the front or the rear tire. In one embodiment of the third aspect,
the rack is for the front tire and comprises a tire engager for engaging the front tire, wherein the
tire engager is located relative to the tire positioner. In one embodiment of the third aspect, the
rack is for the rear tire and further comprises a tire positioner for positioning the rear tire. In
another embodiment of the third aspect, the rack is for the front tire, and the system further
comprises a rack for the rear tire comprising a tire positioner for positioning the rear tire.
[0019]        In a fourth aspect, the present invention provides a system for securing a motorcycle
or bicycle having a rear tire, the system comprising a rack for the rear tire comprising a tire
positioner for positioning the rear tire.
[0020]        The system may be for securing a motorcycle or a bicycle having a front and a rear
tire. In one embodiment of the fourth aspect, the system further comprises a rack for the front tire
comprising a tire positioner for positioning the front tire, and at least one fastener attachment for
attaching a fastener to hold the motorcycle or bicycle in position. Features of the fourth aspect
of the present invention may be as described for the first aspect.
[0021]        Features of the first to fourth aspects of the present invention may be as described
below.
[0022]        The rack for the front tire or front rack may comprise at least one tire positioner for
positioning the front tire. In some embodiments, the front rack comprises one, two or three tire
positioners for positioning the front tire of one, two or three bicycles or motorcycles.         Said
bicycles or motorcycles may be positioned parallel or substantially parallel to each other.
[0023]        In one embodiment when two of said front racks abut each other they form a tire
positioner for positioning the tire of a further motorcycle or bicycle. Therefore, a front rack may
comprise one and a half tire positioners (or one tire positioner and a portion of a second tire
positioner). The half tire positioner (or portion of a tire positioner) may be positioned at an end
side wall of the front rack. The tire positioners may be positioned in a straight line. The tire
positioners may be from 200 mm to 400 mm apart, especially from 300 mm to 350 mm apart,

more especially about 325 mm apart.
[0024]       Advantageously, a front rack which comprises one and a half tire positioners (or one
and a portion of a tire positioner) allows a user to install one or two racks, depending upon their
requirements. If only one tire positioner is needed, then it is not necessary for a user to install
two racks and space in the tray of a vehicle can be conserved. Also, two front racks which each
comprises one and a half tire positioners (or one and a portion of a tire positioner) would be less
expensive to produce and easier to ship and package than a single front rack which comprises
three tire positioners. However, two front racks may be sold together as a pair.
[0025]       In one embodiment, the tire positioner (especially the sidewalls of the tire positioner)
is configured to extend along the lateral side walls of the motorcycle or bicycle tire when the
motorcycle or bicycle tire is in position. In one embodiment the tire positioner defines a channel
or trough configured to accommodate the front tire. The tire positioner may be substantially "U"
shaped. The tire positioner may be configured to be positioned beneath or to the front of the
front tire when a motorcycle or bicycle is secured to the rack.            Advantageously, the tire
positioner may position the front tire in the correct orientation for transport.
[0026]       The tire positioner may comprise a base, a mouth opposite the base and two side
walls extending from the base to the mouth. The tire positioner may be of suitable dimensions
for accommodating a motorcycle or bicycle tire. The side walls of the tire positioner may extend
outwardly from the base. The base may be from 100 to 130 mm wide, especially from 110 to
120 mm wide, more especially about 114.5 mm or 115 mm wide.                   The mouth of the tire
positioner may be from 110 mm to 140 mm wide, especially from 120 mm to 130 mm wide,
more especially about 125 mm wide. The side walls may extend vertically from 45 mm to 75
mm, especially from 55 mm to 65 mm, more especially about 60 mm.                 The base of the tire
positioner may be positioned about 15 mm from the base of the front rack.
[0027]       The front rack may further comprise a tire engager for engaging the front tire. The
tire engager may be located relative to the tire positioner. The tire engager may be located
within the tire positioner. The tire engager may be a projection within the tire positioner for
holding the front tire in position, especially by friction. The tire engager may be located on both
side walls of the tire positioner. Advantageously once the front tire is engaged, the tire engager
may be able to hold a motorcycle in an upright position before strapping is used to secure the
motorcycle.
[0028]       The tire engager may comprise a tire engaging member, especially two opposed tire
engaging members. The or each tire engaging member may extend from the base of the tire
positioner along a side wall of the tire positioner. The or each tire engaging member may be

substantially "L" shaped. The or each tire engaging member may comprise an extended portion,
which especially extends from the base to the mouth of the tire positioner. The or each tire
engaging member may comprise a shoulder portion which extends from the base to a position
intermediate the base and the mouth of the tire positioner.        The shoulder portion and the
extended portion may abut each other.
[0029]        The distance between two opposed tire engaging members may be from 30 mm to 70
mm at the base of the tire positioner (especially at the base of the shoulder portion), especially
from 40 mm to 60 mm, more especially about 50 mm. The shoulder portion may extend from 15
mm to 35 mm from the base of the tire positioner (toward the mouth), especially from 20 mm to
30 mm from the base of the tire positioner, more especially about 25 mm from the base of the
tire positioner.
[0030]        The shoulder portion may comprise a corner, especially a substantially perpendicular
corner. The corner may be beveled. The distance between two opposed tire engaging members
may be from 30 mm to 75 mm at the base of the comer (the portion of the corner proximal to the
base of the tire positioner), especially from 40 mm to 65 mm, more especially from 45 mm to 60
mm or about 53 mm at the base of the corner. The distance between two opposed tire engaging
members may be from 50 mm to 90 mm at the top of the corner (the portion of the comer distal
to the base of the tire positioner), especially from 60 mm to 80 mm, more especially about 70
mm at the top of the corner. The shoulder portion may extend laterally from the corner to the
extended portion.
[0031]        The distance between two opposed tire engaging members may be from 65 mm to
105 mm apart at the extended portion, where the extended portion abuts the shoulder portion,
especially from 75 mm to 95 mm apart, more especially about 86mm apart.               The distance
between two opposed tire engaging members may be from 70 mm to 115 mm apart at the mouth
of the tire positioner, especially from 80 mm to 105 mm apart, more especially from 90 to 95
mm apart at the mouth of the tire positioner. The extended portion may extend substantially
parallel to a tire positioner side wall.
[0032]        The or each tire engaging member may be from 10 mm to 35 mm wide, especially
from 15 mm to 30 mm wide, more especially from 17 mm to 24 mm wide. The or each tire
engaging member may be wider at the base of the tire positioner than towards the mouth.
[0033]        Advantageously, the tire engager may assist to hold the front tire in position and to
prevent rotational movement of the front tire. The tire engager may be configured to hold the
front tire in position by virtue of friction.

[0034]       The front rack may further comprise at least one fastener attachment for attaching a
fastener to hold the motorcycle or bicycle in position. The fastener attachment may be of any
suitable shape for securing a portion of a fastener, such as the end of a fastener. The fastener
may be strapping, ratchet straps or the like (especially for securing to the handlebars or forks of a
motorcycle or bicycle).     The fastener attachment may be a substantially circular projection
extending from the front rack. The fastener attachment may be substantially recessed into the
front rack.   The fastener attachment may comprise a bar portion, especially which extends
between two side walls of the front rack, and a recess.        The recess may be in the form of a
trough. The recess may be to allow the fastener to be attached to the bar portion. The bar
portion may be located on the same side of the front rack as the mouth of the tire positioner.
[0035]       The bar portion may define a cylinder. The cylinder may be from 15 to 25 mm in
diameter, especially about 20 mm.
[0036]       The front rack may comprise any number of fastener attachments.                 In one
embodiment, the front rack comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 fastener attachments, especially from 1
to 6, or from 2 to 5, or from 3 to 5 fastener attachments. The front rack may comprise 4 fastener
attachments. The front rack may comprise two fastener attachments positioned either side of the
tire positioner.
[0037]       The front rack may be integrally molded with the tray floor or side wall of a utility
vehicle or pickup truck. However, in one embodiment the front rack preferably may be fixable
to the tray or side wall of a utility vehicle, pickup truck, van or trailer. The front rack may be a
bracket.
[0038]       The front rack may comprise at least one vehicular attachment point, especially two
vehicular attachment points. Each vehicular attachment point may provide a site at which the
front rack may be fixable to a vehicle.        In one embodiment each vehicular attachment point
comprises a channel through the front rack. The channel may comprise a ledge for the head of a
bolt. The channel may be wider at the mouth of the channel than at the base (the mouth of the
channel may be on the same side of the front rack as the mouth of the tire positioner).          The
channel may be for accommodating a fastener (such as a bolt) for attaching the front rack to the
vehicle. The vehicular attachment point may be for accommodating a bolt, such as an X-nut or a
Plusnut (which allows fastening to the vehicle without requiring access to both sides of a vehicle
tray for example).
[0039]       The front rack may be from 55 mm to 95 mm wide, especially from 65 mm to 85 mm
wide, more especially about 75 mm wide. The front rack may be from 55 mm to 95 mm high,
especially from 65 mm to 85 mm high, more especially about 75 mm high. The front rack may

                                                     0
be from 700 mm to 800 mm long, especially about 750 mm long.
[0040]        The front rack may be made of any suitable material and be made in any suitable
way. In one embodiment, the front rack is made from one or more of plastics (such as nylon),
composites, fiberglass, glass and Teflon. In another embodiment, the front rack is made from a
composite of glass and Teflon, or from a composite of glass and nylon. The front rack may be
injection molded.
[0041]        The front rack may be substantially hollow. The front rack may comprise internal
ribbing to reinforce the front rack.
[0042]        A user may position the front rack in any suitable location.        For example, if the
system is to be installed in the tray of a utility vehicle or pickup truck, then the front rack may be
positioned towards the front of the tray, closest to the cabin. Similarly, if the front rack is to be
installed in a van, then it may be positioned towards the front of the van. Alternatively, if the
system is to be installed in a trailer, then the front rack may be installed towards the front or
towards the drawbar of the trailer. The front rack may be positioned on the floor or on a side
wall (especially the front side wall) of, for example, the tray of a utility vehicle or pickup truck,
or a trailer or a van.
[0043]        In some embodiments, the system further comprises a rack for a rear tire of a
motorcycle or bicycle, the rack comprising a tire positioner for positioning the rear tire. The
rack comprising a tire positioner for positioning the rear tire may be referred to as a rear rack.
[0044]        Advantageously, the use of a rack for the rear tire comprising a tire positioner for
positioning the rear tire may prevent lateral movement of the rear tire during transport, which
may assist in keeping the front and rear wheels in a straight line to thereby maintain a stable load
and restrict movement of the motorcycle or bicycle.
[0045]        The rear rack may comprise at least one tire positioner for positioning the rear tire.
In some embodiments, the rear rack comprises two or three tire positioners for positioning the
rear tire of two or three bicycles or motorcycles. Said bicycles or motorcycles may be positioned
parallel or substantially parallel to each other.
[0046]        In one embodiment when two of said rear racks abut each other they form a tire
positioner for positioning the tire of a further motorcycle or bicycle. Therefore, a rear rack may
comprise one and a half tire positioners (or one tire positioner and a portion of a second tire
positioner). The half tire positioner (or portion of a tire positioner) may be positioned at an end
side wall of the rear rack. The tire positioners may be positioned in a straight line. The tire
positioners may be from 200 mm to 400 mm apart, especially from 300 mm to 350 mm apart,

more especially about 310 mm apart.
[0047]       Advantageously, a rear rack which comprises one and a half tire positioners (or one
and a portion of a tire positioner) allows a user to install one or two racks, depending upon their
requirements. If only one tire positioner is needed, then it is not necessary for a user to install
two rear racks and space in the tray of a vehicle can be conserved. Also, two rear racks which
each comprises one and a half tire positioners (or one and a portion of a tire positioner) would be
less expensive to produce and easier to ship and package than a single rear rack which comprises
three tire positioners. However, two rear racks may be sold together as a pair.
[0048]        In one embodiment, the tire positioner (especially the sidewalls of the tire positioner)
is configured to extend along the lateral side walls of the motorcycle or bicycle tire when the
motorcycle or bicycle tire is in position. In one embodiment the tire positioner defines a channel
or trough configured to accommodate the rear tire. The tire positioner may be substantially "U"
shaped. The tire positioner may be configured to be positioned beneath the rear tire when a
motorcycle or bicycle is secured to the rack. Advantageously, the tire positioner may position
the rear tire in the correct orientation for transport.
[0049]        The rear rack tire positioner may comprise a base, a mouth opposite the base and two
side walls extending from the base to the mouth.           The tire positioner may be of suitable
dimensions for accommodating a motorcycle or bicycle tire. The side walls of the tire positioner
may extend outwardly from the base. The base of the rear rack tire positioner may be wider than
the base of the front rack tire positioner. This may be advantageous, as it may be intended to be
possible to wheel the motorcycle or bicycle through the rear rack tire positioner.
[0050]        The base may be from 80 to 120 mm wide, especially from 90 to 110 mm wide, more
especially about 102 mm wide. The mouth of the tire positioner may be from 120 mm to 160
mm wide, especially from 130 mm to 150 mm wide, more especially about 140 mm wide. The
side walls may extend vertically from 45 mm to 75 mm, especially from 55 mm to 65 mm, more
especially about 60 mm. The base of the tire positioner may be positioned about 15 mm from
the base of the rear rack.
[0051]        The rear rack may further comprise a tire engager for engaging the rear tire. The tire
engager of the rear rack may be as described for the front rack.           However, in a preferred
embodiment the rear rack may not comprise a tire engager.
[0052]        The rear rack may further comprise at least one fastener attachment for attaching a
fastener to hold the motorcycle or bicycle in position. The fastener attachment may be of any
suitable shape for securing a portion of a fastener, such as the end of a fastener. The fastener

                                                  IV
may be strapping, ratchet straps or the like (especially for securing for example, over or near to
the seat of the motorcycle or bicycle). The fastener attachment may be a substantially circular
projection extending from the rear rack. The fastener attachment may be substantially recessed
into the rear rack. The fastener attachment may comprise a bar portion, especially which extends
between two side walls of the rear rack, and a recess. The recess may be in the form of a trough.
The recess may be to allow the fastener to be attached to the bar portion. The bar portion may be
located on the same side of the rear rack as the mouth of the tire positioner.
[0053]       The bar portion may define a cylinder. The cylinder may be from 15 to 25 mm in
diameter, especially about 20 mm.
[0054]       The rear rack may comprise any number of fastener attachments.                  In one
embodiment, the rear rack comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 fastener attachments, especially from 1
to 6, or from 1 to 4, or from 2 to 3 fastener attachments. The rear rack may comprise 3 fastener
attachments. The rear rack may comprise at least one fastener attachment positioned either side
of the tire positioner.
[0055]       The rear rack may be integrally molded with the tray floor of a utility vehicle or
pickup truck. However, in one embodiment the rear rack preferably may be fixable to the tray of
a utility vehicle or pickup truck. The rear rack may be a bracket.      In one embodiment, the rear
rack may be integrally molded with the interior of the tailgate of a utility vehicle or pickup truck.
In this embodiment, a user may need to position the tailgate down to secure a motorcycle or
bicycle.
[0056]       When the rear rack is fixable to a utility vehicle or pickup truck (for example via the
tray or the tailgate), the rear rack may comprise at least one vehicular attachment point,
especially two vehicular attachment points. Each vehicular attachment point may provide a site
at which the rear rack may be fixable to a vehicle. In one embodiment each vehicular attachment
point comprises a channel through the rear rack. The channel may be wider at the mouth of the
channel than at the base (the mouth of the channel may be on the same side of the rear rack as
the mouth of the tire positioner).     The channel may be for accommodating a fastener for
attaching the rear rack to the vehicle, such as bolts. The vehicular attachment point may be for
accommodating a bolt, such as an X-nut or a Plusnut (which allows fastening to the vehicle
without requiring access to both sides of a vehicle tray for example).
[0057]       The rear rack may be from 55 mm to 95 mm wide, especially from 65 mm to 85 mm
wide, more especially about 75 mm wide. The rear rack may be from 55 mm to 95 mm high,
especially from 65 mm to 85 mm high, more especially about 75 mm high. The rear rack may be
from 600 mm to 700 mm long, especially about 650 mm long.

                                                    1[ 1
[0058]       The rear rack may be made of any suitable material and be made in any suitable way.
In one embodiment, the rear rack is made from one or more of plastics (such as nylon),
composites, fiberglass, glass and Teflon. In another embodiment, the rear rack is made from a
composite of glass and Teflon, or from a composite of glass and nylon. The rear rack may be
injection molded.
[0059]       The rear rack may be substantially hollow.        The rear rack may comprise internal
ribbing to reinforce the rear rack.
[0060]       A user may position the rear rack in any suitable location.          For example, if the
system is to be installed in the tray of a utility vehicle or pickup truck, then the rear rack may be
positioned on the tailgate of the vehicle. Similarly, if the rear rack is to be installed in a van,
then it may be positioned towards the rear of the van.          Alternatively, if the system is to be
installed in a trailer, then the rear rack may be installed towards the rear or away the drawbar of
the trailer.
[0061]       The rear rack may comprise a number plate attachment for attaching a number plate
to the rear bracket. In some jurisdictions the rear number plate of a vehicle cannot legally be
obscured, so being able to mount (especially releasably mount) a number plate to the rear bracket
may be advantageous.
[0062]       The front and/or rear racks may have a substantially flat or in line profile. With the
exception of the tire positioner, the upper surface (or the surface which includes the mouth of the
tire positioner) of the front and/or rear racks may be substantially flat. This arrangement may be
very advantageous, as the racks may not compromise the use of the vehicle when bicycles or
motorcycles are not transported.       Other items (such as general cargo) may be transported and
secured to the vehicle without being encumbered by, or damaged by the racks (and the racks may
additionally provide additional tie down points).           Furthermore, when the racks have a
substantially flat profile the racks may blend in with the tray of the utility vehicle.
[0063]       In a fifth aspect, the present invention provides a method of fastening the system of
any one of the first to fourth aspects of the invention to a vehicle, the method comprising
fastening said rack or said racks to the vehicle.
[0064]       Features of the fifth aspect may be as described for one or more of the first to fourth
aspects of the present invention. In one embodiment, the step of fastening said rack or said racks
to the vehicle may comprise using nuts and bolts or use of a bolt that will form a head after being
inserted through a hole in the vehicle, such as through a hole in the vehicle tray (e.g. X-nuts or
Plusnuts).

[0065]        In a sixth aspect the present invention provides a method of securing a motorcycle or
a bicycle to the system of any one of the first to fourth aspects of the invention. The method may
comprise the step of wheeling the bicycle or motorcycle through the rear rack. The method may
comprise the step of positioning the front tire in the front rack tire positioner. The method may
comprise the step of positioning the rear tire in the rear rack tire positioner. The method may
comprise the step of engaging the front tire in the front rack tire engager. The step of engaging
the front tire may comprise the step of pushing the front tire into the front rack tire engager. The
method may comprise the step of securing at least one fastener (such as strapping) to the
motorcycle or bicycle and to at least one fastener attachment. Advantageously, use of two cam
buckle tie down straps attached to each side of the handle bars and fastener attachments may be
sufficient to secure the motorcycle or bicycle for transporting. Use of the system may allow a
motorcycle or bicycle to be transported in a substantially upright position.
[0066]       Advantageously, general cargo may also be secured using the system of the present
invention, for example by using one or more fastener attachments.
[0067]        The front rack may be fixed to the front of the truck bed behind the cabin via 4/ M8
SS bolts fitted to the vehicle body work. The front rack may have tapered stepped recesses which
dock the front wheel / tyre to a snug fit. There may be three such recesses to accommodate one
bike in the central location of the truck bed and one each side to accommodate two bikes.
[0068]        The same may apply to the rear rack which may be located under the rear tyre of the
motorcycle or bicycle. The rear rack may be fixed to the bed or dropped tailgate of a vehicle with
4/ M8 SS bolts. The rear wheel may be wedged in the recess of the rack with the option of fixing
via a rubber strap to anchor points on the rack. The front and rear racks may provide a flush
finish which does not restrict the carrying and fixing of general cargo.
[0069]       Any of the features described herein can be combined in any combination with any
one or more of the other features described herein within the scope of the invention.
[0070]        The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as
an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of the common
general knowledge.

comprises a shoulder portion 36 which extend from the base 14 to a position intermediate the
base 14 and the mouth of the tire positioner 10. The shoulder portion 36 abuts the extended
portion 34.
[0098]       The distance between two opposed tire engaging members 32 is 50 mm at the base of
the shoulder portion 36. The shoulder portion 36 extends about 25 mm from the base 14 of the
tire positioner 10 towards the mouth. The shoulder portion 36 comprises a beveled corner 38.
The distance between two opposed tire engaging members 36 is 52.9 mm at the base of corner
38 (the portion of the corner 38 proximal to the base 14 of the tire positioner).        The distance
between two opposed shoulder portions 36 is about 70 mm at the top of the corner 38 (the
portion of the comer 38 distal to the base 14 of the tire positioner). The shoulder portion 36
extends laterally from the corner 38 to the extended portion 32.
[0099]       The distance between two opposed extended portions 34 is 86 mm where the
extended portion 34 abuts the shoulder portion 36. The distance between two opposed extended
portions 36 (or tire engaging members 32) is 92.1 mm at the mouth of the tire positioner 10.
[00100]      Each tire engaging member 32 is from 17 mm to 24 mm wide, being wider at the
base 14 of the tire positioner 10 than at the mouth.
[00101]      The front rack 2 comprises four fastener attachments 20 for attaching a fastener to
hold the motorcycle or bicycle in position. Each fastener attachment includes a substantially
cylindrical portion 22 (about 20 mm in diameter) which extends between two side walls of the
front rack 2, and a recess 24 in the form of a trough. The fastener attachment 20 is for attaching

attaching tie-down straps, especially over or near to the seat of a bicycle or motorcycle. One
fastener attachment 120 is positioned either side of the tire positioner 110.
[00109]      The rear rack 102 is fixable to the tray, tailgate or side wall of a utility vehicle, van
or trailer and includes two vehicular attachment points 140. Each vehicular attachment point 140
comprises a channel 142 through the rear rack 102. The channel 142 comprises a ledge 144 for
accommodating the head of a bolt (for example).          Exemplary bolts used with the vehicular
attachment points 140 may include X-nuts and Plusnuts.
[00110]      The rear rack 102 is 75 mm wide, 75 mm high and 650 mm long. The rear rack 102

                                                   I /
may be made from a composite of glass and Teflon, or from a composite of glass and nylon, and
may be injection molded. The rear rack 102 may be made of 25% glass filled nylon. The rear
rack 102 is substantially hollow and comprises internal ribbing 150 to reinforce the front rack.
In Figures 15 and 16, the rear rack 102 is positioned on the tailgate of the utility vehicle.
[00111]      Figures 17 and 18 show two front racks 2 fastened to the front side wall of the tray of
a utility vehicle, and two rear racks 102 fastened to the tailgate of a utility vehicle. Figures 15
and 16 show two motorcycles secured in the racks 2, 102.
[00112]      To secure a motorcycle to the system shown in Figures 1 to 16, a motorcycle is
wheeled into the tray of the utility vehicle, guiding the front and rear wheels through the tire
positioner 110 of the rear rack 102 as the motorcycle is positioned. When in position, the front
tire of the motorcycle is positioned in the tire positioner 10 of the front rack 2, and the rear tire is
positioned in the tire positioner 102 of the rear rack 102. The motorcycle is pushed into the front
rack 2 so that the tire engager 30 on the front rack 2 engages the front tire. Tie down straps are
then attached to fastener attachments 20, 120 and are used to secure the motorcycle in position.
[00113]      To fasten the front and rear racks 2, 102 to a vehicle holes are first drilled through
the metal of, for example, the tray or tailgate of a utility vehicle. Plusnuts (or similar fasteners)
are then used to secure the front and rear racks 2, 102 in place. A suitable fastener may be an
M8      socket   cap    screw    1.25   x   20     (for  example     as    sold   by   James     Glen,
http://www.iamesglen.com.au/) and a steel M8 pre-bulbed Plus Nut (75 mm long, for example as
sold by Profast, http://www.profast.com.au/).
