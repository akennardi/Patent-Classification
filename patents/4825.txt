20                                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0012]       Hereinafter, this disclosure will be described in detail in combination with the
   embodiments and drawings for better understanding the objective, technical solutions and
   advantages of the present disclosure.
   [0013]       Refer to Figs. 1-3, in the embodiment, a wireless charging lighting device 10 is
25 provided. The wireless charging lighting device 10 comprises a charging transmitter 100 for
   providing power and a charging receiver 200 for receiving power.
   [0014]       The charging transmitter 100 includes a transmitter coil 100 for transmitting power,
   and a transmitter base 120 for loading the transmitter coil 110. The transmitter base 120

   comprises two first positioning magnets 130 arranged thereon. The two first positioning
   magnets 130 are separately arranged on both sides of the transmitter coil 110.
   [0015]       The charging receiver 200 is the electric equipment to be charged. The charging
   receiver 200 includes a receiver coil 210, a lighting device 240 electrically connected to the
 s receiver coil 210, and a housing 220 for packaging the receiver coil 210 and the lighting device
   240. Both sides of the receiver coil 210 are provided with a second positioning magnet 230,
   respectively.
   [0016]       During charging, the charging transmitter 100 may be electrically connected to an
   external power source or an internal power source to energize the transmitter coil 110. When a
10 current flows through the transmitter coil 110, a magnetic field is generated. Once the
   uncharged transmitter coil 210 approaches said magnetic field, a current will be generated to
   charge the lighting device 240.
   [0017]       In this embodiment, the transmitter base 120 comprises a case 121, wherein the
   transmitter coil 110 is disposed within the case 121. The transmitter base 120 further comprises
15 an current input interface 122, configured for the external power source to load current onto the
   transmitter coil 110. In this embodiment, the input interface 122 may be a Micro input interface
   located on a side wall of the transmitter base 120.
   [0018]       In an alternative embodiment, internal power source, such as battery or the like,
   may be arranged within the transmitter base 120 to supply current to the transmitter coil 110, so
20 as to further improve the flexibility and convenience of the charging operation.
   [0019]       When the charging receiver 200 is placed on the charging transmitter 100, the
   charging operation can be realized. Both the lighting device 240 and the receiver coil 210 can
   be packaged within the housing 220 of the charging receiver 200, which facilitates the design
   with waterproof and dirt proof, increasing the IP level of products. The housing 220 protects the
25 lighting device 240 and the transmitter coil 210 from being influenced by the surroundings,
   which prolongs the work life of the products.
   [0020]       In this embodiment, the lighting device 240 is electrically connected to the receiver
   coil 210. More specifically, it could be the receiver coil 210 being electrically connected to an
   illuminating unit of the lighting device 240, for example, a LED. Alternatively, the receiver coil

   210 may be connected to the charging battery within the lighting device 240 and the charging
   power can be stored in the battery.
   [0021]       In this embodiment, the first positioning magnets 130 are arranged at both sides of
   the transmitter coil 110, respectively, and the second positioning magnets 230 are arranged at
 5 both sides of the receiver coil 210. When the charging receiver 200 is placed on the charging
   transmitter 100 for charging, the first positioning magnets 130 are attracted to the second
   positioning magnets 230 so that the charging transmitter 100 can automatically correct its
   location attached to the charging receiver 200, and making the transmitter coil 110 and the
   receiver coil 210 be conform to each other. Refer to Fig. 4, when the two coils are conform to
10 each other in horizontal direction, the projections of the two coils in horizontal plane are
   substantially overlapping. The magnetic lines of the transmitter coil 110 and the receiver coil
   210 are aligned and the coupling area is maximized, which can effectively ensure the charging
   power. The first positioning magnet 130 and the second positioning magnet 230 can also ensure
   that the charging transmitter 100 and the charging receiver 200 are attached well and avoid
15 relative movement therebetween caused by shocks, accidental touch or the like.
   [0022]       In this embodiment, both the first positioning magnet 130 and the second
   positioning magnet 230 are neodymium-iron-boron magnets.
   [0023]       In alternative embodiments of the disclosure, the first positioning magnet 130 and
   the second positioning magnet 230 only need to have the function of magnetically attaching to
20 each other. For example, the first positioning magnet 130 may be an electromagnet while the
   second positioning magnet 230 may be a magnetically attractable member made of iron, cobalt,
   nickel or the like. When a current is applied to the transmitter coil 110, the current at the same
   time is applied to the first positioning magnet 130 and therefore attracts the second positioning
   magnet 230.
25 [0024]       In addition, precise positioning of the transmitter coil 110 and the receiver coil 210
   can be achieved by two-point positioning, that is, through mutual attraction between the two
   positioning magnet 130 and the second positioning magnet 230. The magnetic field of the
   magnet itself may affect the process of the electromagnetic induction charging, but the
   two-point positioning may reduce the use of magnets and thereby increasing the charging

   efficiency.
   [0025]       In order to avoid the magnetic property of the first positioning magnet 130 affects
   the process of the electromagnetic induction charging, a distance Sl between the first
   positioning magnet 130 and the transmitter coil 130 in the horizontal direction may at least be
 5 8mm. Similarly, a distance S2 between the second positioning magnet 130 and the transmitter
   coil 130 in the horizontal direction may at least be arranged to be 8mm. More preferably, Sl
   and S2 is selected from a range of 8-20mm, for example, 9mm, 10mm, 15mm and etc.
   [0026]       Refer to Fig. 4, when the charging receiver 200 is placed on the charging transmitter
   100, a distance HI between the transmitter coil I 10 and the receiver coil 210 in the longitudinal
10 direction may be in the range of 3-8mm. All the stated distances can ensure that the transmitter
   coil 110 emits the maximum magmatic field energy to the receiver coil 210 and the magnetic
   flux is maximized. By being so, the energy conversion effect can be improved, reducing the
   energy waste and get rid of low efficient charging. More specifically, the receiver coil 210 and
   the second positioning magnets 230 are arranged on the inner surface of the housing 220 of the
15 charging receiver 200, decreasing the distance between the receiver 210 and the transmitter coil
   110. Similarly, the receiver coil 110 and the first positioning magnet 130 may be arranged on
   the inner surface of the case 121 of the transmitter base 120.
   [0027]       In this embodiment, the transmitter coil 110 and the receiver coil 210 are both
   circular coils made of magnetic alloy winded by wires. The transmitter coil 110 and the receiver
20 210 are quite similar in shape and size so as to maximum the energy conversion efficiency.
   Preferably, the transmitter coil 110 and the receiver 210 are circular.
   [0028]       In alternative embodiments, the transmitter coil 110 and the receiver coil 210 may
   be, but not limited to, rectangular or the like.
   [0029]       The charging receiver 200 comprises a long side 201 and a short side 202, wherein
25 the receiver coil 210 is extended along the short side 202 to the edge of the charging receiver
   200. The two second positioning magnets 230 are arranged on both sides of the receiver coil
   210 along the direction of the long side 201, which means that the radial length of the receiver
   coil 210 is substantially equal to the length of the short side 202. Accordingly, when the size of
   charging receiver 200 is constant, the bigger the coil number of the receiver coil 210 is, the

   larger the magnetic flux will be and the more effective the charging will be.
   [0030]      The receiver coil 210 comprises a first surface 211 and a second surface 212
   opposite to the first surface 211, wherein the first surface 211 is a surface facing the charging
   transmitter 100, and the second surface 212 is a surface away from the charging transmitter 100.
 5 The magnet plate 250 is located adjacent to the first surface 211. The magnet plate 250
   completely covers one side of the receiver coil 210.
   [0031]      When a current flows through the transmitter coil 110, an interacting magnetic field
   will be generated. In order to apply the magnetic energy emitted by the transmitter coil 110 to
   the receiver coil 210 by its maximum, the magnet property of the transmitter coil 110 can be
10 properly guided. Refer to Fig. 5, in which A shows the magnetic induction line of the
   transmitter coil and the receiver coil without magnetic plate, and B shows the magnetic
   induction line of the transmitter coil and the receiver coil with magnetic plates 250. After a
   magnet plate 250 is installed, the magnetic lines gather and concentrate obviously. The
   magnetic plate 250 provides a magnetic line loop for the magnetic field and gathers the
15 magnetic field so that the magnetic field can be applied to the receiver coil 210 at its maximum.
   By doing so, the best power performance can be reached.
   [0032]      The magnetic plate 250 not only can effectively be magnetic conductive, but also
   can be served as magnetic shield. When the changing magnetic field comes across a metal
   conductor, a current may be generated if the metal is closed. If the metal is open, especially a
20 whole piece metal, the eddy current effect could be incurred. The eddy current effect can
   generate mounts of heat. The electromagnetic signal could be easily decreased by the influence
   of the metal conductor, which leads to energy waste. Providing a metal plate 250 on the second
   surface 212 of the receiver coil 210 could protect the magnetic field from being influenced by
   the metal conductor, improving the charging efficiency. Similarly, the magnetic plate 250 may
25 be arranged on one side of the receiver coil 210 away from the charging receiver 200 to further
   improve the charging efficiency.
   [0033]      In order to avoid the charging transmitter 100 from generating magnetic field when
   it is not charged, the transmitter base 120 comprises a switch controller (not shown) for
   controlling the on/off of the transmitter coil 110. When the charging receiver 200 is placed on

   the charging transmitter 100, the switch controller turns on the power supply to the transmitter
   coil 110. When the charging receiver 200 leaves away the charging transmitter 100, the switch
   control turns off the power supply to the transmitter coil 110.
   [0034]       In other embodiments of this disclosure, the transmitter 120 may comprises a
 5 detection sensor, configured for detect whether the charging receiver 200 is placed on the
   charging transmitter 100 or not, and for generating a detection signal. The switch controller
   may turn on or turn off the power supply to the transmitter coil 110 according to the detection
   signal. In some other embodiments, the transmitter base 120 may comprise a press button on
   the surface contacting the charging receiver 200, configured for controlling the power supply to
10 the transmitter coil 110. When the charging receiver 200 is placed on the transmitter base 120,
   the press button will be pressed and therefore turning on the power supply to the transmitter coil
   110. When the charging receiver 200 leaves away from the transmitter base 120, the press
   button is reset and therefore turning off the power supply to the transmitter coil 110.
   [0035]       In this embodiment, in order to facilitate the charging operation, fixture member
15 123 is arranged on the transmitter base 120 so that the charging transmitter 100 can be attached
   to the desk, wall or the like. In the embodiment, the fixture member 123 is screw holes arranged
   on the four corners of the transmitter base 120. Screw fasteners may be used to anchor the
   transmitter base 120.
   [0036]       Additionally, a fixed magnet 124 may be arranged on one surface of the transmitter
20 base 120 away from the charging receiver 200, so that the charging transmitter 100 can be
   easily attached to a metal object.
   [0037]       In other embodiments of this disclosure, buckles or clamping members may be used
   to attach the charging transmitter 100.
   [0038]       The charging surface where the charging transmitter 100 contacts the charging
25 receiver 200 comprises a silicon rubber. The silicon rubber can be located on the charging
   transmitter 100 and/or the charging receiver 200. When the charging transmitter 100 is not
   placed horizontally during charging, the use of the silicon rubber, in one hand, may increase the
   friction between the charging receiver 200 and the charging transmitter 100, thereby avoiding
   the charging receiver 200 from detaching. In another hand, the silicon rubber can effectively

   dissipate the heat generated by the coils.
   [0039]       In this embodiment, the transmitter coil 110 and the receiver coil 210 are both
   assembled inside the device, so the transmitter coil 110 and the receiver coil 210 cannot be
   rapidly aligned with each other. In order to address this problem, the outer surface where the
 5 charging transmitter 100 contacts the charging receiver 200 is further provided with a display
   layer (not shown) for displaying the position of the coils. The display layer facilitates the
   operator to realize the position of the transmitter coil 110 and the receiver 210 so that the
   transmitter coil 110 and the receiver 210 can be substantially aligned. Additionally, with the
   help of the first positioning magnets 130 and the second positioning magnets 230, only slight
10 correction would be needed to precisely align the transmitter coil 110 and the receiver coil 210.
   [0040]       In the embodiments of this disclosure, the display layer may be graphic. That is, a
   substantial position of the transmitter coil 110 and the receiver coil 210 may be drawn on the
   contact surface. In other embodiments, the display layer may be, but not limited to, a convex
   formed on the contact surface showing the position of the transmitter coil 110 and the receiver
15 coil210.
