DEVICE FOR POSTURAL CORRECTION AND RETRAINING
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]    This is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2013218756, the
contents of which are incorporated in this divisional application by reference in their entirety.
FIELD OF INVENTION
[0002]    This invention generally relates to wearable devices for correction and retraining of a
user's posture, and more particularly relates to devices that are dynamic and transition between
stretching, strengthening and stabilization modes.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]    When people are at the computer, driving, or sitting for an extended period of time,
they begin to develop a forward rolling shoulder complex which is known as "protracted
shoulder girdle," or more commonly, "poor posture".
[0004]    It has been recognized that poor shoulder and upper body posture without effective
counter measures such as exercise or stretching induces shortening of the muscle groups in the
chest forward segments of the shoulder, and lengthening and weakness in the muscle of the
neck, shoulders and upper back. These structural anomalies lead to stiffness, pain, fatigue and
other ailments. Good posture, on the other hand, is associated with greater energy, and
improved mood and enhanced confidence. Individuals with good posture are also perceived as
more authoritative and better looking.
[0005]    There have been various attempts to provide postural braces for a user to wear to
passively correct posture. Such posture systems are not optimal because they cannot be easily
put on or removed (they may involve difficult closures, or require difficult reaching to properly
position) and may be uncomfortable to wear (overly binding or "creeping," hot, or sweaty). In
addition, such devices can be obtrusive and unsightly, which lessens a user's enthusiasm for
wearing them (or for wearing them frequently, as may be needed for a consistent effect).

                                                    2
[0006]   Such devices are also single dimensional (in that they do not serve any purpose other
than to passively counteract a user's poor posture). The user does not actively engage with the
device, and therefore only experiences some passive relief from or bracing to correct the poor
posture, and would not typically achieve a lasting stretching or strengthening of muscles needed
to independently maintain good posture. Further, such devices, when unintegrated with a
separate exercise protocol for retraining muscles related to poor posture, typically provide
minimal results. Such prior art devices also require or enforce lengthy wear-times for postural
reinforcement.
[0007]   Therefore, it can be appreciated that there exists a need for a device which can be used
both actively and passively to correct and retrain poor posture.
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
[0008]   It is an object of the present invention to at least substantially satisfy the above need.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

pectoral or underarm region in a stabilization mode; the loops being sized to fit snugly on the
user and provide passive resistance against forward shoulder curvature in the stabilization mode.

                                                     3
[0010]    In accordance with another aspect, the present invention provides a method of using a
posture-improvement and training device, the method comprising:
          providing a device comprising:
                 a central member;
                 a resistance tube first loop on a first side of the central member and a resistance
tube second loop on a second side of the central member; and
                 a flexible handle disposed on each loop;
          positioning each of the loops over one of the user's arms so that the central member is
positioned in a region of the user's back and the handles are positioned to cushion where the
loop engages the user's pectoral or underarm region in a stabilization mode; the loops being
sized to fit snugly on the user and provide passive resistance against forward shoulder curvature
in the stabilization mode,
          removing the device from the stabilization mode to a stretching/strengthening mode by
gripping the handles, extending the handles laterally outward from the user's body to stretch and
elastically enlarge the loops, and removing the loops from the user's arms while the loops are
enlarged, and
          using the device in a stretching/strengthening mode.
[0011]    There is also disclosed herein a dynamic stretching, strengthening and stabilization
device is provided for postural correction and retraining in a user. The device has a central
harness member and a pair of closed loop resistance tubes. The central harness member has a
middle panel and two side sleeves. Each resistance tube is slidable within a side sleeve of the
central harness member. A flexible handle is disposed on each loop and is slidable along the
loop. The user can grip the handles and pull in opposing directions to actively engage the
resistance tubes in a stretching/strengthening mode. The user can also position each loop over
one of the user's arms so that the central harness member is positioned flat against the user's
back and the handles are positioned to cushion where the loop engages the user's pectoral or
underarm region in a stabilization mode. The loops are sized to fit snugly on the user and
provide passive resistance against forward shoulder curvature in the stabilization mode.
[0012]    The device may further include a rigid anti-torsion member disposed within the middle
panel of the central harness member.

                                                  4
[0013]    The central harness member is preferably of a durable fabric. In certain embodiments,
the central harness member may have a slide-resistant surface. Preferably, the central harness
member is sized to sit between the user's shoulder blades and avoid creeping upward.
[0014]    The loops are preferably disposed in the central harness member such that they do not
touch or interfere with each other.
[0015]    Various dimensions are possible, however, in a preferred embodiment, each handle is
between about 3 inches to 12 inches in length and each closed loop resistance tube is between
about 12 to 36 inches in circumference. For larger or smaller individuals (including children), it
will be appreciated that other larger or smaller sizes may be provided (and the device may be
custom-fit for particular individuals).
[0016]    Length (or tension) adjustment may also be provided for the closed loop resistance
tubes.
[0017]    In one embodiment, the device may be packaged with instructions for carrying out
stretching or exercising movements in the stretching/strengthening mode.
[0018]    There is also disclosed herein a method of using a dynamic stretching, strengthening
and stabilization device is provided for postural correction and retraining in a user. The device
is as set out above. The method comprises the user selectively:
          gripping the handles and pulling in opposing directions to actively engage the
resistance tubes in a stretching/strengthening mode; or
          positioning each loop over one of the user's arms so that the central harness member is
positioned flat against the user's back and the handles are positioned to cushion where the loop
engages the user's pectoral or underarm region in a stabilization mode; the loops being sized to
fit snugly on the user and provide passive resistance against forward shoulder curvature in the
stabilization mode.
[0019]    To remove the device from the stabilization mode, the user may further grip the
handles, extend the handles outward from the user's body to stretch and elastically enlarge the
loops, and remove the loops from the user's arms while the loops are enlarged.

                                                  5
[0020]    To smoothly transition from the stabilization mode to the stretching/strengthening
mode, the user may further grip the handles, extend the handles outward from the user's body to
stretch and elastically enlarge the loops, and remove the loops from the user's arms while the
loops are enlarged, thereby freeing the device to permit exercising or stretching with the device
in front of or behind the user (or above the user's head).
[0021]    Various movements are possible in the stretching/strengthening mode. In one example,
the user may extend the arms outward with the device disposed over the user's head in a lat
stretch motion. This may also include leaning to alternate sides while the arms are extended
outward. In another example, the user may extend the arms outward with the device disposed
behind the user's body in a shoulder stretch motion. In a further example, the user may extend
the arms outward with the device disposed in front of the user's body in a first chest stretch
motion. In a second chest motion, the user may extend the arms outward with the device
disposed behind the user's head.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0030]   A device is provided to promote proper posture of a user and correct and retrain poor
posture. The device works dynamically - it transitions smoothly between (i)
stretching/strengthening and (ii) stabilization (worn) modes. These modes work synergistically
to improve the user's posture and to build the user's awareness of posture while strengthening
the associated muscle groups that enable good posture.
[0031]   The device is designed and engineered for both utilization within a pre-defined
program of stretching and strengthening exercises that may be typically prescribed as a protocol
for correction of protracted shoulder girdle (a term used to describe poor upper body posture);
and to be worn post-exercise as a dynamic, non-restrictive, wearable postural retraining device.
When being worn according to the protocol, the device continuously exhibits a mild dynamic
force on the wearer, effectively training the body to reposition into a bio-mechanically-correct
posture via neurological reinforcement against the physical restraint. This allows for a normal
range of motion by the wearer, with feedback increasing as the wearer moves further out of their
correct bio-mechanical position and decreasing as the wearer moves towards the correct bio
mechanical position.
[0032]   Combined, the exercise protocol and the neurological reinforcement aspects of the
device and use methodology retrain the user, providing them the mobility, muscular strength and
cuing within the afflicted muscle groups typical to poor posture to increasingly self-maintain
correct postural position.
[0033]   When used in worn mode, the device stabilizes the shoulder girdle. The muscles in the
shoulder and thoracic spine area are stretched and strengthened when the device is used in
stretching/strengthening mode.
[0034]   Figure 3 is a basic view of the device according to one embodiment of the present
invention. The device has a pair of closed loop resistance tubes 1 and a central harness member
3.

                                                   7
[0035]    As shown in Fig. 7, the central harness member 3 preferably has a middle panel 5 and
two side sleeves 6, separated by stitching lines 7 defining the side sleeves and separating them
from the middle panel (where an anti-torsion member 4 may be contained, as described below).
The harness 3 is preferably made with a soft or solid durable material, and may be provided in
any shape (e.g. rectangle, triangle, polygon, square, circle or other shape). One function of the
harness 3 is to serve as a spacer preventing interference between the loops 1. The central
harness member 3 preferably is a sewn fabric sleeve for comfort (e.g. nylon, canvas, or any
other durable fabric or fabric blend) but other embodiments are possible. A fabric harness may
be particularly preferred for its light weight, and non-irritating construction. Unlike plastic
components, the fabric harness does not create a sweaty or sticking area on the user's back, but
may be capable of breathing and/or wicking moisture. In certain embodiments, the harness 3
may also be constructed so as to allow the user to open a front or back panel (or one or both side
sleeves separately) to allow removal or swapping of resistance tubes (e.g. to insert tubes of a
different size or resistance or multiple tubes). In this construction (not shown), the closure may
be fastened by hook and loop strips, snaps or other fastening devices known in the art. The
harness may also be provided with frictional surfacing/texturing/coating to prevent creep, and/or
may be provided with additional padding for comfort.
[0036]    Each of the closed loop resistance tubes 1 is slidably received in a side sleeve 6 of the
central harness member 3, which positions the two closed loop resistance tubes 1 roughly in the
form of a figure "8". The closed loop resistance tubes 1 may be formed by attaching a length of
rubber cord to itself to form a loop or "0". Alternatively, each loop may be a continuous circle
of cord. The closed loop resistance tubes 1 may be natural or synthetic rubber cords (or any
elastic material capable of easily expanding and contracting while providing progressive
resistance as the material is stretched). Although the loops are described here as "tubes", it will
be appreciated that these may also be of solid material, and may have any suitable cross
sectional shape.
[0037]    The closed loop resistance tubes 1 may vary in length according to size and tension
needed. They may be as short as 12 inches or as long as 36 inches. The device may further
comprise an adjustment for the length and tension of the bands.
[0038]    A handle 2 may be mounted to each closed loop resistance tube 1. When the device is
used as in stabilization mode, the handles function as shoulder/underarm cushions or pads.
When the device is used in stretching/exercise mode, the handles can be gripped by the user.

                                                   8
The handle 2 may be comprised of foam, rubber, or other comfortable material and may vary
from 3 inches in length to 12 inches in length (other dimensions being possible). It may also be
desirable in certain embodiments to provide a fixed (non-sliding) handle or another form of
hand-grip (not necessarily tube- or sleeve-shaped) or cushioning member/pad.
[0039]    A rigid anti-torsion member 4 (shown in Fig. 7) may be disposed within the middle
panel 5 of the central harness member 3 to provide support for the user's back and resist
twisting/creeping when being put on or worn. The rigid anti-torsion member 4 may be
comprised of a durable plastic material in a rod shape, or another solid material that keeps the
central harness from distorting or folding and keeps the device centred on the user's back when
worn.
[0040]    Figure 1 illustrates the device worn by a user. The device can be worn at any time a
user would like to have proper posture. The user simply grasps each handle 2 in each hand,
stretches the closed loop resistance tubes 1, inserts each arm in each tube, slides the tubes over
the user's elbows and positions the handles 2 comfortably into place on the front of the user's
shoulders and/or under the arms. The handles 2 provide a comfortable fit of the tubes 1 and
prevent the resistance tubes from tugging on or bunching up the user's clothing or skin. In
combination, the pair of closed loop resistance tubes 1 and central harness member 3 function to
help the user keep their shoulders back and prevent forward rolling of the shoulders. Among
other aspects, the rigid anti-torsion member 4 also functions to provide support to the upper
vertebrae.
[0041]    It will be appreciated that the device in the stabilization mode has a low profile and low
degree of interference with user movements. It can be worn substantially "invisibly" under a
user's jacket for an extended period while doing desk work, for example. In the stabilization
mode, the device is worn and put on like a vest. Once demonstrated or illustrated (e.g. from
package instructions), the function is simple for users to understand and does not require
elaborate reaching or closures to put on or take off. Further, the user does not experience a
feeling of being confined or bound, although the device provides an awareness of the user's
posture and a gentle resistance against forward slump of the shoulders. Gradually with use, this
awareness retrains the user, making him/her aware of posture even when not wearing or using
the device.

                                                   9
[0042]    Figure 2 illustrates the device in use by a user in stretching/strengthening mode. For
use as a stretching device, in general, a user grasps the handles and moves the device into a
position as to be desired as to stretch each individual muscle group. A stretching program will
typically include stretches for the pecs, shoulders, biceps, triceps or back. For use as an exercise
device, a user grasps a handle in each hand and moves the handles as to make each individual
muscle group to work in the form of exercise. A user will typically perform exercises for the
chest, triceps, biceps, shoulders, or back.
[0043]    This device assists to promote good posture and improves poor posture by retraining
the shoulder complex how to maintain a neutral posture; lengthening overly tight muscles;
strengthening overly weak muscles; and providing a support and stabilizer for the shoulder
complex.
[0044]    Some examples of the possible stretches/exercises are shown in Figures 4A-6B. In
Figures 4A-4B, two forms of chest stretch are shown. In Figure 5A, an overhead lat stretch is
shown. As shown in Figures 5B, 5C, the device may be held overhead in extended form, and
the user may lean side-to-side to lengthen and stretch lat and side muscles. In Figs. 6A-6B, a
shoulder stretch is illustrated. Since having strong and limber chest, lat and shoulder muscles is
key for posture, the device's stretching/strengthening mode also serves the posture
correction/therapeutic end. When tired, the device can be worn to prolong the effect of the
stretching/strengthening and maintain good posture.
[0045]    In stabilization mode, the user may also perform stretches on a smaller scale (e.g. by
shrugging the shoulders, or rolling them forward against resistance). It will also be appreciated
that the movements may be coupled with other body actions and may be part of a larger program
of aerobic-type, core-strengthening type, or yoga type activity (just to take a few examples).
The device may also be worn while exercising (e.g. to obtain a better stance while doing weight
training or running).
[0046]    The scope of the claims should not be limited by the preferred embodiments set forth in
the examples, but should be given the broadest purposive construction consistent with the
description as a whole.
