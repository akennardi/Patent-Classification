   Description of Invention
   Conventional threaded fasteners are known. Mechanical fastening with helically
                                             1

   threaded components is typically achieved with bolts, studs, screws, nuts and
   washers. Washers are thin members that can be placed between the fastener
   and the fastened component. Washers are typically used to prevent frictional
   damage to assembled components. Washers are also commonly used to
 5 distribute stresses evenly and to control friction losses. Nuts are internally
   threaded fastening members commonly used to retain and or deliver load to an
   externally threaded fastener. Nuts typically have an external geometry that will
   allow rotational coupling with a torque input device or machine.
10 Self-reacting nuts are typically comprised of an inner sleeve, outer sleeve and
   washer. Self-reacting fasteners such as the HYTORC Nut use the washer as a
   reaction point for the application of input torque to the outer sleeve. In a self
   reacting fastener the outer sleeve functions as the nut while the inner sleeve
   becomes an extension of the stud and is rotationally coupled with the washer.
15 This rotational coupling prevents sliding motion between the inner sleeve and
   stud threads during the application of torque to the outer sleeve. Self-reacting
   nuts with the same external geometry as conventional nuts suffer from higher
   bearing surface stresses. The bearing surface stresses are higher because the
   outer sleeve inside diameter is increased to allow space for the inner sleeve
20 causing a thinner wall thickness than standard nuts.
   In contrast    to conventional threaded       fasteners, self-reacting three-piece
   mechanical tensioner fasteners such as the HYTORC NUT, include an outer
   sleeve, inner sleeve and washer. Self-reacting fasteners such as the HYTORC
25 Nut use the washer as a reaction point for the application of input torque to the
   outer sleeve. In a self-reacting fastener the outer sleeve functions as the nut
   while the inner sleeve becomes an extension of the stud and is rotationally
   coupled with the washer. This rotational coupling prevents sliding motion
   between the inner sleeve and stud threads during the application of torque to the
30 outer sleeve. Self-reacting nuts with the same external geometry as conventional
   nuts suffer from higher bearing surface stresses. The bearing surface stresses
   are higher because the outer sleeve inside diameter is increased to allow space
                                             2

   for the inner sleeve causing a thinner wall thickness than standard nuts.
   Additionally devices of coupling or mating a reaction or an output shaft of a
   torque output device to fasteners used in bolting also are known. Self-reacting
 5 three-piece mechanical tensioner fasteners typically have spline, hex or square
   features to allow torsion coupling with the reaction member of the torque input
   device. This is achieved with machined rotational interferences between two
   parts. The interference is typically created with a male and female engagement
   between any two mating features that prevent rotation between the two parts.
10
   Three-piece mechanical tensioning stud devices are also known. They consist of
   a stud, nut and washer. The stud has external threads on both ends. Under the
   upper thread the stud will also have a spline or other geometry to create a
   rotational coupling with the inner diameter of the washer. The topside of the stud
15 will also have a spline or other geometry to allow rotational coupling with the
   reaction shaft of the torque input device. The nut is internally threaded to mate
   with the threads on the topside of stud. The nut will have a spline or other
   geometry to allow the introduction of torque from torque input device. The washer
   has an internal geometry that will mate rotationally with the spline or other
20 geometry under the top thread of the stud.
   In bolting applications stresses are typically near the elastic limits of the
   materials. The     reaction feature that couples the three-piece mechanical
   tensioning stud to the torque of the torque input device typically has to be
25 oversized to prevent elastic material failures. Therefore it is not possible with
   known coupling features to carry the high magnitude of torque with an internal
   feature such as a square, hexagon or internal spline hole in the top surface of the
   stud. Consequently prior art applications that are subject to high bolting stress
   must have an external feature on the topside of the stud that will allow the
30 coupling of a sufficiently sized reaction shaft from the torque input device.
   Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like which
                                              3

   has been included in the present specification is not to be taken as an admission
   that any or all of these matters form part of the prior art base or were common
   general knowledge in the field relevant to the present disclosure as it existed
   before the priority date of each claim of this application.

   Disclosed herein is an apparatus for coupling a threaded fastener and a torque
   input device, including:
          a first coupling member having a tapered external surface; and
          a second coupling member having an inversely tapered internal surface
10 non-rotatably engagable with the tapered external surface of the first coupling
   member,
          wherein the tapered external surface of the first coupling member and the
   inversely tapered surface of the second coupling member are shaped as
   frustums of an angled stepped cone and wherein a load bearing surface area
15 between the first and the second coupling members is increased without
   increasing the diameter of the apparatus.
   Also disclosed herein is an apparatus for use with a threaded fastener including:

20 with the fastener and a tapered external surface; and
          an outer sleeve member having an inversely tapered internal surface
   rotatably engagable with the tapered external surface of the inner sleeve
   member.
25 Advantageously, embodiments disclosed herein allow for an increased load
   bearing surface area between the inner sleeve member, which is clamped, and
   the outer sleeve members without increasing the overall diameter of the
   apparatus; a three dimensional load bearing surface area rather than a
   conventional two dimensional plane; more efficiently and evenly distributed load
30 stress distribution over the load bearing surface area; higher torsion strength; and
   apparatus with lower mass, dimensions and volume.

10 Referring to FIGs. 1-4 by way of example, this shows an apparatus 1 - a stepped
   conical fastener    assembly     - in  accordance with      a   presently disclosed
   embodiment. Apparatus 1 has an inner sleeve member 100 and an outer sleeve
   member 200 and is used with, by way of example, a threaded stud 300. Inner
   sleeve member 100 is rotatably and threadedly engagable with stud 300;
15 rotatably and taperedly engagable with outer sleeve member 200; and non
   rotatably engagable with an action portion of a torque input device. Outer sleeve
   member 200 is non-rotatably engagable with a reaction portion of the torque
   input device; and rotatably and taperedly engagable with inner sleeve member
   100. Inner sleeve member 100, when rotated by the action portion of the torque
20 input device, applies a load to stud 300 to close a joint (not shown).
   Inner sleeve member 100 is an annular body and, as shown in FIGs. 1 and 2,
   formed as a sleeve. It has an inner surface 110 with an inner helical thread
   means 120 engagable with an outer surface 310 with an outer helical thread
25 means 320 of stud 300. It has an outer surface 111 with a cylindrical formation
   121 which is rotatably engagable with an inner surface 210 with a cylindrical
   formation 220 of outer sleeve member 200. It further has a lower surface 113
   which is rotatably engagable with inner surface 210.
30 Cylindrical formation 121 is shaped as an inverted frustum of a stepped cone
   which has a tapered or conical appearance from the bottom up. Each step on
   outer surface 111 is progressively smaller from top to bottom. An external hollow
                                             6

   cylindrical feature is removed from the outside of inner sleeve member 100 at a
   shallow depth. Successive external hollow cylindrical features are removed at
   regular length and width intervals. Each successive feature starts where the
   preceding feature stops. The geometric pattern of removed external cylindrical
 5 features continues until space restricts the addition of another internal cylindrical
   feature.
   Inner sleeve member 100 further has an upper surface 112 with a coupling
   means 130 which may be formed by a plurality of bores extending in an axial
10 direction and spaced from one another in a circumferential direction. Coupling
   means 130 non-rotatably engages with the action portion of the torque input
   device.
   Outer sleeve member 200 is an annular body and, as shown in FIG. 3, formed as
15 a sleeve. It has inner surface 210 with cylindrical formation 220 which is rotatably
   engagable with an outer surface 111 with cylindrical formation 121 of inner
   sleeve member 100. Outer sleeve member 200 has an outer surface 211 with a
   coupling means 230. Coupling means 230 is formed by a plurality of outer spines
   extending in an axial direction and spaced from one another in a circumferential
20 direction. Coupling means 230 non-rotatably engages with inner spines of a
   reaction portion of the torque input device.
   Cylindrical formation 220 is shaped as a frustum of a stepped cone which has a
   tapered or conical appearance from the top down. Each step on inner surface
25 210 is progressively smaller from top to bottom. An internal cylindrical feature is
   removed from the inside of outer sleeve member 200 at a shallow depth.
   Successive internal cylindrical features are removed at regular length and width
   intervals. Each successive feature starts where the preceding feature stops. The
   geometric pattern of removed internal cylindrical features continues until space
30 restricts the addition of another internal cylindrical feature.
                                               7

   Stud 300 has a cylindrical shape with outer helical thread means 320 for mating
   with inner helical thread means 120 of inner sleeve 100. An end 312 of stud 300
   has a coupling means 314 which may be formed by a polygonal formation 330,
   which in this case is a hexagon shape. Polygonal formation 330 allows for
 5 rotational coupling with the torque input device.
   Second coupling member 150 further has a lower surface 163 which rests on an
   upper surface of the joint. Lower surface 163 may be substantially rough and
   may be made in many different ways, for example by a plurality of ridges, ripples
10 or teeth.
   The stepped conical fastener geometry of apparatus 1 creates tensile load in
   stud 300 by the mechanical sliding action through the helical inclined plane
   between stud threads 320 and inner sleeve member threads 120. The sliding
15 helical thread action is created by using the torque input device to apply rotation
   under torque to inner sleeve member coupling means 130 while reacting the
   torque on outer sleeve member external splines 230. As outer surface 111 and
   inner surface 210 are substantially smooth, outer sleeve member 200 remains
   static while inner sleeve member 200 rotates. The reaction element of the torque
20 input device is rotationally coupled with end 312 of stud 300 by coupling means
   314. This prevents rotation of stud 300 and allows the relative sliding action
   between inner sleeve member threads 120 and studs threads 320.                Stud
   translation occurs in proportion to the resistance against such translation as the
   torque input device continually applies torque to inner sleeve member 100 while
25 reacting on outer sleeve member external splines 230 and being rotationally
   coupled with stud 300 by coupling means 314.
   Inner sleeve member coupling means 130 may be formed by any suitable
   geometry or used with other means or features for rotationally coupling with the
30 torque input device such as gear teeth, hex, double hex, castellation or any other
   common geometry that allows rotational coupling. One possible alternative is hex
   geometry shown in FIG. 5 as 530.
                                             8

   Outer sleeve member coupling means 221 may be formed by any suitable
   geometry or used with other means or features for rotationally coupling with the
   torque input device such as gear teeth, hex, double hex, castellation or any other
 5 common geometry that allows rotational coupling. One possible alternative is hex
   geometry shown in FIG. 6 as 621.
   Note that the quantity, dimensions, geometries and intervals of removed external
   (inner sleeve member 100) and internal (outer sleeve member 200) cylindrical
10 features may vary to optimize characteristics of apparatus 1, such as, for
   example, stress biasing, depending on the application.
   FIG. 2 shows inner sleeve member 100 with four external cylindrical features
   removed at regular length and width intervals. FIG. 3 shows outer sleeve
15 member 200 with four internal cylindrical features removed at regular length and
   width intervals. As shown in FIG. 7, varying the quantity, dimensions, geometries
   and intervals from one removed external and internal cylindrical feature to the
   next varies the nominal angles, step heights and step widths of an outer surface
   711 with a cylindrical formation 721 and an inner surface 710 with a cylindrical
20 formation 720. Alternatively, the step length may be sized infinitely small to
   create a nearly smooth taper. External portions of inner sleeve member 100 and
   internal portion of outer sleeve member 200 may be removed in one step to form
   smooth conical surfaces, respectively.
25 FIG. 8 shows an outer surface 811 with a cylindrical formation 821 and an inner
   surface 810 with a cylindrical formation 820 with mating faces of varying vertical
   spacing, or step heights. This allows movement on selective steps only as other
   steps are loaded. Plastic deformation allows vertical movement therefore
   strategically biasing stress distribution across each stepped face. In other words,
30 increased clearance or spacing between mating faces of inner and outer sleeve
   members 100 and 200 allow for radial expansion during loading.
                                              9

   FIG. 9 shows an outer surface 911 with a cylindrical formation 921 and an inner
   surface 910 with a cylindrical formation 920 with mating faces of varying step
   face angles. This promotes more evenly and controlled biasing stress distribution
   across the steps. In other words, either or both inner and outer sleeve members
 5 100 and 200 may have stepped vertical surfaces with varying pitch angles to bias
   stress to selective horizontal stepped surfaces.
   FIG. 10 shows outer sleeve member 200 having internal features at bottom that
   couple with similar mating external features added to stud 300. These may
10 include splines, knurls, hex, slots, double hex or other geometry. They allow axial
   translation of stud 300 but couple rotational movement of outer sleeve member
   200 and stud 300. Both coupling means 314 formed of polygonal formation 330
   and the necessity to couple this hex with the reaction member of the torque input
   device are no longer necessary. Internal spline 1040 and mating external spline
15 1041 form a spline interface between outer sleeve member 200 and stud 300,
   respectively.
   In standard bolting industry terms, apparatus 1 includes a nut (inner sleeve
   member 100) and a washer (outer sleeve member 200). The standard bolting flat
   surface nut and washer interface is changed. The torque reaction point is moved
20 upwards, as compared to conventional three-piece fasteners. Presently disclosed
   apparatus embodiments utilize the concept of conventional three-piece fasteners,
   which allows for surface conditioning of the outer sleeve to prevent galling,
   leveraged with a conventional nut and washer arrangement, which retains radial
   strain such that the inner sleeve may be surface conditioned with minimal risk of
25 fracture.
   Advantageously, presently disclosed apparatus embodiments allow for an
   increased load bearing surface area between the inner sleeve member, which is
   clamped, and the outer sleeve members without increasing the overall diameter
30 of the apparatus; a three dimensional load bearing surface area rather than a
   conventional two dimensional plane; more efficiently and evenly distributed load
                                             10

   stress distribution over the load bearing surface area; higher torsion strength; and
   apparatus with lower mass, dimensions and volume.
   Referring to FIGs. 11-14 by way of example, this shows an apparatus 1101 for
 5 torsionally coupling a threaded fastener 1110 and a torque input device 1102 in
   accordance with a presently disclosed embodiment. Apparatus 1101 has a first
   coupling member 1103 with a tapered external surface 1104 and a polygonal
   formation 1105; and a second coupling member 1113 having an inversely
   tapered internal surface 1114 and a polygonal formation 1115 non-rotatably
10 engagable with tapered external surface 1104 of first coupling member 1103.
   In other words, apparatus 1101 torsionally couples torque input device 1102 and
   threaded fastener 1110 of the kind having a shank 1111 with a tapered axial bore
   1112 at one end. Apparatus 1101 includes coupling member 1103 having
15 inversely tapered external surface 1104 non-rotatably engagable with tapered
   axial bore 1112.
   Discussion related to quantity, dimensions, geometries and intervals of removed
   external (inner sleeve member 100) and internal (outer sleeve member 200)
20 cylindrical features of FIGs. 1-10 generally applies to the quantity, dimensions,
   geometries and intervals of removed external (first coupling member 1103) and
   internal (second sleeve member 1113) polygonal features of FIGs. 11-14. Note
   that the interface between inner and outer sleeve members 100 and 200 is
   cylindrical and smooth thus allowing relative rotation. Note, however, that the
25 interface between first and second coupling members is polygonal and angled
   thus no relative rotation is possible.
   A conical geometry for torsional coupling of a threaded fastener and a torque
   output device yields a better load stress distribution. The embodiment of FIGs.
30 11-14 introduces a low profile coupling geometry that will allow a torsion-coupling
   feature on the top of a stud to be formed internally. This distributes stresses more
   evenly and therefore allows for a more efficient packaging of the coupling
                                             11

   features.
   Generally, a stepped 12-point hole in the top surface of the stud is used for
   torsion coupling with a three-piece mechanical stud-tensioning device and/or an
 5 apparatus for use with the stud. An internal 12-point feature is placed in the top of
   the stud at a shallow depth. Successive 12-point features are progressively
   added at smaller 12-point sizes each at shallow depths and each starting where
   the preceding 12-point stopped. The pattern of decreasing 12-point geometry will
   decrease until space restricts the addition of another 12 point. Advantageously, a
10 shaft of the torque input device with external matching features for each of the
   steps will allow for evenly distributed stress distribution and high torsion strength
   while decreasing the mass and volume of the studs.
   As shown in FIGs. 16 and 17, varying the depth and size change from one 12
15 point feature to the next will increase or decrease the nominal angle of the
   conical shape these features form. The 12-point feature can be substituted with
   any geometry that will prevent rotation between the two parts, such as the hex in
   FIG. 15. Additionally, the step depth can be sized infinitely small to create a
   smooth taper. Mixed step sizes and geometries can be used to optimize
20 production of such a coupling.

   of the presently disclosed apparatus may be used, including: fastener categories,
