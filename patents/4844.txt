Abstract
A method and apparatus for blending liquids and granular materials in which an impeller
assembly (27) is mounted for rotation within a housing (20) at a lower end (13) of a
particles inlet (12) and characterized in particular by circumferentially spaced impeller
vanes (28) in outer concentric relation to a series of expeller vanes (29, 29') surrounding
the particles inlet and which together propel the solid particles outwardly to intermix
with the liquid introduced into the annulus surrounding the impeller assembly, and
different selected vane configurations (52, 61) are provided with circumferential portions
protruding into the path of counterflow of the slurry from the annulus in order to keep
the eye or central area of the impeller assembly dry.

                    BLENDER APPARATUS  AND METHOD
                  BACKGROUND AND FIELD OF      INVENTION
      The disclosure of the complete specification of Australian
Patent Application  No. 2012389829 as originally      filed    is
incorporated herein by reference.
      The following relates to a novel and improved method and
apparatus for controlling the introduction of solids into a
chamber containing a pressurized fluid, such as,          for example,
blenders  for intermixing and pumping large volumes         of liquid/sand
slurries  in downhole fracking operations.
      Previously I have devised different blade or vane designs for
a given ratio of impeller diameters.   In the past, the vanes were
designed to balance the point at which the solids and liquids were
intermixed between the outer space surrounding the impeller vanes
and the center of the impeller assembly in order to allow the
introduction of dry sand through the center of the impeller. Among
other considerations in determining the design of the impeller
vanes  is the mass flow rate or capacity of flow of the solid
particles as well as their density for a given speed of rotation
of the impeller vanes;   and to multiply the RPMs or speed by the
number of vanes which in turn will aid in establishing the spacing
between the vanes as well as their depth.
      Still another variable to be taken into consideration is the
rate at which the sand is ejected from the center to the impeller
region and which may be influenced
                                   1

 WO 2014/042655                                      PCT/US2012/055731
both by the utilization of expeller blades and a generally
conical or raised center.     Further, once the diameter of the
expeller and its number of vanes is established based on the
desired flow rate of sand particles, the diameter of the
impeller and shape of its vanes can be determined in order to
achieve optimum rate of flow of the sand particles through the
impeller region.     Conversely, it is important to compute the
rate of counterflow of liquids through the spaces between the
impeller vanes toward the center of the impeller assembly.
From that, one is able to determine the optimum balance point
or size and position of vanes necessary to reverse the inward
flow and force the slurry to return to the outer annular space
surrounding the impeller assembly.
             In accordance with my U.S. Letters Patent No.
7,967,500, there is disclosed an arrangement or configuration
of vanes in which the liquid would follow a path between the
primary vanes toward the center of the impeller, until it
reached the next vane which would cause it to reverse and flow
away from the center.     Nevertheless, there is a need for
utilizing blocking vanes in the spaces between the primary
vanes in order to keep the eye of the impeller dry and to
regulate the balance point between the solids and slurry in a
region radially outwardly of the eye while pumping the slurry
over a wide range of mass flow rates.     Further, there is a
continuing need for impeller vane designs which not only
                                  2

 WO 2014/042655                                      PCT/US2012/055731
achieve the foregoing but minimize the energy expended and
reduce wear over long-term use while further simplifying the
construction and minimizing the number of parts required in
preventing liquid or slurry leakage back into the eye or
central area of the assembly.
                               SUMMARY
             Is therefore an object to provide for a novel and
improved method and apparatus for blending liquid and solid
particles with a simplified impeller assembly which minimizes
wear, expenditure of energy and replacement of parts while
maintaining optimum blending conditions and preventing the
counterflow of liquid or slurry back into the eye of the
impeller.
             Another object is to provide for a method of
designing an impeller which takes into consideration a number
of variables including flow rates, density and size of
particles for a given number and speed of rotation of the
impeller vanes as well as their spacing.
             Another object is to provide for an impeller
assembly having blocking vane surfaces incorporated into the
primary vanes and so spaced and arranged as to maintain
optimum balance and deflection of slurry away from the eye of
the impeller.
                                  3

 WO 2014/042655                                      PCT/US2012/055731
             It is another object to minimize energy consumption
resulting from the counterflow of the liquid between the vanes
by blocking the counterflow as close to its origin as possible
and causing it to be redirected back into the annular space
surrounding the impeller assembly.
             In one aspect, an impeller assembly is characterized
in particular by having generally three-sided vanes extending
upwardly from a base plate which is in surrounding relation to
an eye of the impeller and which in turn is surrounded by an
annular housing, each vane having opposite sides converging
outwardly from an end surface at or adjacent to an inner
radial edge of the base plate and terminating in an apex at or
near an outer circumferential edge of the base plate.
             In another aspect, an apparatus has been devised for
fracking operations which will maintain the delivery of sand
through an upper particles inlet in a fluidic state by the
selective removal of air from the sand as it approaches the
impeller region as well as spreading the sand away from the
eye of the impeller to maintain uniform delivery while
minimizing blockage and to maintain uniform high speed mass
rates of flow of the sand as it intermixes with the water in
the formation of a slurry to be used for downhole fracking
operations.
             In still another aspect, a novel and improved
expeller is interposed between the inlet and the impeller
                                  4

 WO 2014/042655                                       PCT/US2012/055731
assembly to accelerate the delivery of sand from the inlet for
intermixture with the water in the impeller region.      The inner
circumferential end surfaces of the impeller vanes are aligned
with the expeller vanes extending radially outwardly from the
solid inlet.      The impeller vanes are increased in thickness
towards their outer radial ends and are much closer to the
leading end of the next vane in blocking return flow of the
slurry formed between the water flowing under pressure into
the impeller assembly from the annular housing and solid
particles driven outwardly by the expeller vanes.
              In another aspect, the impeller vanes may contain
blocking ledges toward their inner ends which are closer to
and in facing relation to the outer radial ends of each
adjacent vane to redirect and prevent the counterflow of
slurry toward the center of the impeller.
                   Further aspects and embodiments will become
apparent by reference to the following drawings when taken
together with the detailed description and it is intended that
the embodiments disclosed herein are to be considered
illustrative rather than limiting.

                DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF FIRST EMBODIMENT
             Referring in detail to the drawings, apparatus 10
takes the form of a hydraulically driven mixer shown in FIG. 1
and which may be mounted on a truck, not shown, but shown and
described in detail in my U.S. Letters Patent No. 7,967,500.
As illustrated in FIGs. 1 and 2 of that patent, a booster pump
communicates with an intake port, such as, intake port 24
illustrated in FIG. 1 herein.       As shown in more detail in
FIGs. 1 and 2 of my hereinbefore referred to patent, in oil
and gas operations, such as, fracturing or cementing wells,
the pump 10 is mounted on a truck bed along with an engine
with a drive mechanism to impart rotation via a speed reducer
mechanism to a central drive shaft.       The solid granular
matter, such as, sand is delivered from a storage area by
means of an auger to the upper end of a hopper and advanced by
gravity into the impeller area.       The sand is mixed with a
liquid which is introduced through the port 24, and the
resultant slurry is discharged via an outlet port 26 through a
                                   7

 WO 2014/042655                                       PCT/US2012/055731
delivery tube under sufficient pressure to be delivered to a
well head.      The booster pump regulates the pressure in the
annulus of the impeller assembly housing and can be closely
controlled to maintain a constant pressure level from the
outlet of the pump to the inlet port 24 as well as to increase
the pressure as desired.
             As a setting for the first embodiment, there is
illustrated in FIG. 1 an apparatus 10 having a generally
funnel-shaped hopper 12 converging downwardly and terminating
in a lower end 13 mounted by circumferentially spaced struts
14 in closely spaced relation to and above the inner wall 16
of a suspension mount for an impeller assembly 27 in the
housing 20.      The housing 20 is supported on a base mount 22
and includes the intake port 24 and outlet port 26 which are
in open communication with an annulus in the housing 20
surrounding impeller assembly 27.
             A drive shaft 30 is mounted centrally of the hopper
10 with the lower end journaled in a hub 32 at the center of
the base plate 34 of the impeller assembly 27, and its upper
end 36 is mounted in bearings 38 beneath a drive motor 11.         In
the first embodiment, the sand and other dry chemicals mixed
with the sand are advanced by gravity into the central blender
area and driven outwardly in a manner to be described to form
a slurry with liquids, mainly comprising water, which are

base plate 34              between the outer edges of the expeller vanes 29
andm    cuter circular           ede   of the base plate 34.                      Each of the
impeller vanes 2? has                 Opposite side-s-39               and 40 converging

direction from an inner radial edge 42'.      One of the sides 39
is of generally convex configuration and the opposite side 40
is of generally concave configuration and taper or converge
outwardly toward one another with the convex surface 39
terminating in a curved surface portion 39' which
substantially conforms to the curvature of the outer
peripheral edge of the base plate 34.      In this way, the wider
end of each vane 28 toward the center is closest to the
leading end of the next adjacent vane 28 and tends to restrict
the inward radial counterflow designated at arrow A of the
slurry and deflect it back into the annular space between the
impeller vanes 28 and outer housing wall 20.
              In addition, FIGs. 4 and 6 illustrate in more detail
the expeller vane assembly in which a series of expeller vanes
are made up of a combination of alternating longer, curved
radial vanes 29 extending from the shaft 30 and substantially
shorter but taller vanes 29' extending radially inwardly from
the outer edge of the base plate 34.      Each vane 29, 29'
undergoes an arcuate curvature from the central area in a
radially outward direction so that its convex side is the
leading surface as the vanes undergo rotation in a clockwise
direction.      Further, each vane 29, 29' has its outer edge
aligned with one of the inner radial edges of the impeller
vanes 28 so that the solid particles are directed uniformally
in an outward radial direction between the impeller vanes 28.
                                  10

 WO 2014/042655                                       PCT/US2012/055731
The expeller vanes 39 and 40 have similar configurations, each
having an upright generally rectangular support block 42 and
an upper right-angled blade portion 44 in order to channel the
outward passage of the solid particles into the spaces between
the impeller vanes 39, and their slight curvatures will enable
smooth transition of the solid particles in an outward radial
direction.      Also, the upper blade portions 44 are of
increasing width toward their outer peripheries and disposed
at right angles to the upright portions 42.      In operation, the
shorter vanes 29' will contact the sand along the outer region
of the expeller and tend to drive the sand sideways and
outwardly without contacting the longer vanes; and the longer
vanes 29 will contact sand along the inner region of the
expeller and force the sand in a circumferential and radially
outward direction with little or no contact with the shorter
vanes.    Again, the shorter vanes 29' are of greater height
than the longer vanes 29 and cover substantially the same area
as the longer but lower profile vanes and in this way equalize
the amount of sand engaged by each set of vanes 29 and 29'
respectively, in order to avoid imbalance.
             The first embodiment herein described lends itself
particularly well to use in low profile impeller assemblies of
the type illustrated in FIG. 1 and known in the trade as an
open inlet blender of the type shown and described in my U.S.
Letters Patent Nos. 4,239,396 and 4,460,276 in which the

 WO 2014/042655                                       PCT/US2012/055731
impeller assembly is capable of developing an angular velocity
which will prevent reverse flow of intermixed materials
through the impeller into the solids inlet.      In units of this
type, it is essential that not only are balanced pressure
conditions maintained throughout the system while achieving
continuous high volume mixing of the materials, but to avoid
pressure build-up of air in the solids inlet and blockage of
the sand and other granular material.      This is achieved in
part by utilization of an expeller arrangement in surrounding
relation to an enlarged center shaft and by permitting the
escape of air at a point directly adjacent to the solids
inlet.     In FIG. 1, for example, air is permitted to escape at
the juncture of the lower end of the funnel by air relief
passages or vents 17 between the wall 16 and lower edge of the
funnel 12 and which is in communication with the circular
opening leading into the central impeller area above the
housing 20 surrounding the impeller assembly 28.
              FIGs. 2 and 3 illustrate other applications of the
blender of FIGs. 4 to 6 to mixing pumps, FIG. 2 being a
hydraulically driven mixing pump 10' with a hydraulic motor
designated at 11 at the upper end of a drive shaft 30' and
once again provided with relief vents or openings 17' between
the funnel 12' and upper end of the central opening leading
into the central impeller area within the housing 20'.       In
FIG. 2 the blender or impeller assembly 27'     is modified by the

addition of lower impeller blades 28' to deliver water under
pressure into the annulus or housing 20' surrounding the
impeller assembly 27'.
             A similar application of the impeller assembly 27 of
FIGs. 4 to 6 is illustrated in FIG. 3 of a mechanically driven
mixing pump 10" in which gearing M is located beneath the
blender for a drive shaft 30" extending upwardly into the
blender assembly 27" with lower impeller blades 28" and
affixed by a lower conical end nut 80.      A perforated tube 82
extends upwardly through a funnel-shaped solids inlet 12".
The solids inlet 12" is of two piece construction to permit
the escape of air from the solids materials and through spaced
openings in the perforated tube 82 to prevent packing and
jamming of the sand and pressure build-up of air at the inlet
area.

              There is illustrated in FIGs. 8-10 a second
embodiment in which like or similar parts to those of FIGs. 4
6 are correspondingly enumerated.      Thus, the expeller vanes
29, 29' correspond to those of FIGs. 4-6 and are mounted
within a modified impeller assembly 27' in which a series of
impeller vanes 52 are arranged in equally spaced
circumferential relation to one another in the same manner as
                                   13

 WO 2014/042655                                        PCT/US2012/055731
the vanes 28 in FIGs. 4-6.       However, each of the impeller
vanes 52 is curved along its entire length from its inner
radial edge 54, which is in abutting relation to one of the
expeller vanes 29, 29', to its outer radial edge 56 at the
outer circumferential edge of the base plate 34.       Each vane 52
is of uniform width or thickness along its length and of a
height corresponding to the height of the shorter expeller
vanes 29'; however at its inner radial end, each vane 52
includes a V-shaped lateral extension or deflector 54 which
juts into the path of counterflow designated by arrow A' of
any slurry attempting to return to the center or eye of the
blender 2.       FIGs. 8 to 10 illustrate a modified form of cover
plate 35' having a raised surface 36' with U-shaped grooves
36' at uniformly spaced intervals around the cover plate with
the open ends of the grooves extending radially outwardly.
The cover plate is mounted against the undersurface of the top
wall of the housing 20 and spaced above the impeller assembly
27'.   The assembly 27' is a unitary part of and extends
downwardly from the cover plate 35'.
                DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THIRD EMBODIMENT
             Another embodiment is illustrated in FIGs. 11 to 13
and in which a modified form of impeller assembly is
illustrated in place of the impeller assembly 27 in the
embodiment shown in FIGs. 4-6.       Once again, a circular base
                                   14

 WO 2014/042655                                   PCT/US2012/055731
plate 34 has a central opening 62 which is mounted for
rotation on a central drive shaft as in the other embodiments.
A central expeller vane assembly is made up of generally
triangular blades 64 of uniform thickness and diverging
upwardly and outwardly from the center 62 to an outer vertical
edge 65 in closely spaced facing relation to an inner surface
of each of the impeller vanes 61 to be hereinafter described.
Upper inclined edge 63 of each expeller blade 64 is curved
laterally in the direction of rotation of the vanes 61.    In
turn, each of the impeller vanes 61 has an arcuate blade 66
curving radially and outwardly from an elbow-shaped portion
made up of an inner radial end 68 and a short, radially
extending return portion 70.  The blade elements 66, 68 and 70
are of uniform thickness and the major blade element 66 curves
in an outward radial direction from its inner radial edge to
an outer radial edge 72 which is flush with the outer circular
edge of base plate 34.  Accordingly, one side surface 73 is
concave and the opposite side 74 is convex, and each return
portion 70 extends radially outwardly in a direction toward an
outer edge 72 of each next blade 62 in succession so as to
define a limited space or gap between the adjacent vanes.     In
a manner to be described, the spacing between adjacent vanes
is regulated to limit the counterflow of slurry toward the
center of the impeller/expeller assembly.
                               15

 WO 2014/042655                                        PCT/US2012/055731
             Although not shown, it will be evident that either
one of the cover plates and the expeller assemblies of the
three embodiments are interchangeable.       For the purpose of
illustration but not limitation, the assembly 27" of FIGs. 11
to 13 are shown as part of the blender assembly in FIG. 3 but
the base plate 34 serves as a divider plate for a lower
impeller assembly designated at 28".       In a similar manner, the
first and second embodiments are interchangeable and may be
mounted as illustrated in FIGs. 1 and 2 with or without a
lower impeller arrangement.
              In the design of the impeller vanes, a number of
factors must be taken into consideration as noted earlier and
including but not limited to the velocity of the liquid toward
the center of the impeller after each vane passes by a given
point on the impeller.       Referring to FIG. 5, for example, the
arrow A represents the direction of return flow of slurry
entering the space between vanes 28.       In this respect, the
widened end of each impeller vane will act as a deflector and
can be moved outwardly to meet the fluid path as close to its
origin as possible to the outer periphery of the impeller
assembly.       In other words, the sooner the fluid is blocked and
redirected back toward the annulus the less energy will be
consumed.
              FIG. 9 represents an alternative approach by the
utilization of the ledges or blocking vanes 54 opposite to the
                                    16

 WO 2014/042655                                        PCT/US2012/055731
point of entry of the liquid from the annulus into the space
between the vanes 52.       This approach reduces the overall size
of each vane but does require greater energy in that the
deflector is located closer to the center of the impeller
assembly before it is deflected back toward the annulus.         Here
the liquid or fluid path is represented by the arrow A'.
              FIG. 13 illustrates still another approach in which
the blocking vane is mounted more toward the bottom of the
vane with its return end 70 being positioned in the path of
slurry to prevent it from invading the center of the impeller,
but requires greater energy consumption by virtue of the
greater spacing between the outer end or edge 72 of each
impeller and the inner end 68 of each next successive
impeller.       Thus, the fluid path is represented by the arrow A"
which is much longer and, while the fluid is blocked from
reaching the center of the impeller, must be pumped back into
the annulus thereby reducing the efficiency of the system.           In
this regard, the amount of pressure generated by the mixing
pump in relation to the mass rate of flow of the sand or other
granular material must be taken into consideration in
determining the most efficient impeller assembly to utilize.
              It is therefore to be understood that while
preferred methods and apparatus have been herein set forth and
described, various modifications and changes may be made to
the construction and arrangement of parts, and their
