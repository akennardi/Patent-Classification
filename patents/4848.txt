25 Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller arranged to implement a method of
   gaming wherein an award, for example an award of a feature
30 game, is made as part of a play of the game when a trigger
   condition is met.  The gaming system is arranged to
   control the probability of the trigger condition being met
   based on related prior plays of the game.
35 General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
                                           10112585_1 (GHMatters) P81471.AU.4 28/03/2018

                               - 6
    a first form, a stand-alone gaming machine is provided
    wherein all or most components required for implementing
    the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
  5 In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
    wherein some of the components required for implementing
    the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
    and some of the components required for implementing the
    game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
10  For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
    wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
    gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
    such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
    architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
15  executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
    operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
    and/or visible gaming information to the player and
    receive gaming inputs from the player.
20  However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
    envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
    wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
    and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
    gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
25  the gaming system may operate in stand-alone gaming
    machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
    depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
    and so on.  Other variations will be apparent to persons
    skilled in the art.
30
    Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
    core components.  At the broadest level, the core
    components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
    60 as illustrated in Figure 1.  The player interface is
35  arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
    the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
    input/output components required for the player to enter
                                            10112585_1 (GHMatters) P81471.AU.4 28/03/2018

   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
 5 embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions             (e.g. to
10 place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
15 with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display.   Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
20 accordance with game play rules and may include:               a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
25 A gaming system in the form of a stand-alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2.   The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
30 houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
35 mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
                                            10112585_1 (GHMatters) P81471.AU.4 28/03/2018

                               - 8
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.  A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
 5 the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device.  In some embodiments, the player marketing
10 module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.
15
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.          Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
20 panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
25 display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.  Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.   The top box 26 may also include
30 a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
   type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
35 a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
                                            10112585_1 (GHMatters) P81471.AU.4 28/03/2018

                                -  9
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
 5 communication with the processor 102.     Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
10
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
15 machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
20 random numbers for use by the processor 102.             Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
25 includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107   (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
30 coin output mechanism 111.     Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation.   For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
35 player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used.    For example, in some gaming
                                              10112585_1 (GHMatters) P81471.AU.4 28/03/2018

                               - 10
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
 5 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information,  accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
10 controller, central controller, server or database.                     In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
15 communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                 The RAM
20 103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                 The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
25 integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
30 gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
35 alternative embodiment.   The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
                                            10112585_1 (GHMatters) P81471.AU.4 28/03/2018

                              - 11
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
 5 simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
10 One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
15 and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
20 202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game.  With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller.   A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
25 and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A.   Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.       A loyalty
30 program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
35 provides only the player interface.  With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller.                 The

   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.   In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
 5 that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components.    Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
10 incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
15 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.    An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
20 The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
25 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.    For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
30 separate server may be provided.    For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.   Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
35 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.

   Further detail of gaming system
   Figure 6 shows a spinning reel game embodiment of a gaming
 5 system in which the player operates one or more of the
   input devices which make up the game play mechanism 56 to
   make a wager which will specify the win entitlement which
   will be evaluated for this play of the game and also to
   initiate a play of the game.    In some examples, a single
10 action may both place the wager and initiate a play of the
   game.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a player's
   win entitlement will vary from game to game dependent on
15 player selections.   In most spinning reel games, it is
   typical for the player's entitlement to be affected by the
   amount they wager and selections they make (i.e. the
   nature of the wager).   For example, a player's win
   entitlement may be based on how many lines they play in
20 each game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum
   number of lines allowed by the game   (noting that not all
   permutations of win lines may be available for selection).
   Such win lines are typically formed by a combination of
   symbol display positions, one from each reel, the symbol
25 display positions being located relative to one another
   such that they form a line.
   In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
   strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
30 example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   players selection of pay lines and are an inherent part of
   the win entitlement.
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
35 embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement by
   selecting a number of reels to play.    Such games are
   marketed under the trade name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat
                                             10112585_1 (GHMatters) P81471.AU.4 28/03/2018

                                - 14
    Leisure Industries Pty Ltd.    The selection of the reel
    means that each displayed symbol of the reel can be
    substituted for a symbol at one or more designated display
    positions.   In other words, all symbols displayed at
  5 symbol display positions corresponding to a selected reel
    can be used to form symbol combinations with symbols
    displayed at  a designated,  symbol display positions of the
    other reels.   For example,  if there are five reels and
    three symbol display positions for each reel such that the
10  symbol display positions comprise three rows of five
    symbol display positions, the symbols displayed in the
    centre row are used for non-selected reels.           As a result,
    the total number of ways to win is   determined by
    multiplying the number of active display positions of each
15  reels, the active display positions being all display
    positions of each selected reel and the designated display
    position of the non-selected reels.    As a result for five
    reels and fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to
    win.
20
    In other embodiments a player win entitlement may be
    affected by purchasing access to particular pay tables
    e.g. a first bet amount entitles the player to wins
    including cherries and a second amount entitles them to
25  wins including plums.
    In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
    shown implementing a number of modules based on program
    code and data stored in memory 64.    Persons skilled in the
30  art will appreciate that various of the modules could be
    implemented in some other way, for example by a dedicated
    circuit.
    These modules include the outcome generator 622 which
35  operates in response to the player's operation of game
    play mechanism 56 to place a wager and initiate a play of
    the game and generates a game outcome which is evaluated
                                              10112585_1 (GHMatters) P81471.AU.4 28/03/2018

                               - 15
   by award evaluator 623.   The outcome generator 622 uses a
   symbol selector 622A to select symbols from a set of
   symbols specified by symbol data 641 using random number
   generator 621.   Visual data corresponding to the selected
 5 symbols is advised to the display controller 624 which
   causes them to be displayed on display 54 at a set of
   symbol display positions.
   One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
10 selector 622A to select symbols for display from a
   plurality of symbol sets corresponding to respective ones
   of a plurality of spinning reels stored as symbol data.
    (The symbol sets can also be viewed as subsets of a symbol
   set provided for the whole game.)   The symbol sets can
15 specify a sequence of symbols for each reel such that the
   symbol selector 622A can select all of the symbols by
   selecting a stopping position in the sequence. In one
   example, three symbols of each of five reels may be
   displayed such that symbols are displayed at fifteen
20 symbol display positions on display 54.
   From Figure 6, it will be apparent that the symbol data
   641 includes initial symbols 641A and current symbols
   641B.   This is because in the embodiment the trigger
25 condition is a symbol combination and the game controller
   62 controls the probability of the trigger condition being
   met by adjusting the symbol sets to increase the
   probability of the trigger condition being met.
   Specifically, in the embodiment, the trigger condition is
30 that a symbol combination occurs and hence, the
   probability of the symbol combination being met can be
   increased by adjusting the number of symbols which can
   participate in the triggering symbol combination on one or
   more of the reels.   For example, if the trigger is that
35 three scattered designated symbols appear in the symbol
   display positions, the probability can be adjusted by
   adding a symbol to any of the reels.
                                            10112585_1 (GHMatters) P81471.AU.4 28/03/2018

                              - 16
   Thus the game controller 60 is arranged to monitor play of
   the game and alter the current symbols 641B of the symbol
   set to adjust the probability odds based on outcomes in
 5 prior games.  The game controller is arranged to determine
   which of these prior game outcomes are related, preferably
   such that the games can be ascribed to a particular
   player.  In an embodiment, this is achieved by monitoring
   when a player tracking card is entered into a card reader
10 of the gaming machine or an associated a player tracking
   module connected to the gaming machine, such that the
   initial set of symbols is used when a player tracking card
   is first entered and the current set of symbols 641B is
   used as that set of symbols is modified during play.                       In
15 other embodiments, the game controller 60 may be arranged
   to determine whether the games are related based on timing
   criteria being met in respect of the games, for example,
   if there is a delay of less than 30 seconds between plays
   of the game they may be deemed related.     In such
20 embodiments, the player may be warned  (for example by
   messages on display 56) that if they do not initiate a
   play they will lose the entitlement to an increased
   trigger probability.  In embodiments where a tracking card
   is used, the player may be entitled to take their
25 entitlement to an increased trigger probability with them
   at the end of gaming session as the game controller may be
   arranged to cause the entitlement to be written to a
   player tracking card.  In such embodiments, it will be
   apparent that the game controller 60 will be arranged to
30 check the player tracking card at the beginning of the new
   gaming session to see whether there is any existing
   entitlement to a modified symbol set and hence a modified
   trigger symbol set applies at the beginning of a new
   gaming session and to adjust the current symbol set 641B
35 accordingly.
   In the embodiment shown in Figure 6 the outcome evaluator
                                            10112585_1 (GHMatters) P81471.AU.4 28/03/2018

                              - 17
   623 is arranged to evaluate outcomes of the game against a
   pay table which forms part of the base game data 642.                        The
   outcome evaluator 623 is also arranged to increment a
   count towards adjustment of the symbol set.          In the
 5 embodiment, this count is a count of the symbols which are
   accumulated based on outcomes of the game.         To this end,
   outcome evaluator 623 includes a symbol accumulator 623A
   which processes the game outcome and determines whether a
   designated symbol has occurred during game.          Each time the
10 symbol occurs, this symbol is added to the count and is
   stored as a accumulated symbol data 644.      The trigger
   probability controller 624 monitors the total of the count
   and when the total reaches a designated value, the symbol
   set modifier 624A of the trigger probability controller
15 624 adds trigger combination symbol to the current symbol
   set.  The count can then be reset or continue until
   further designated values are reached depending on the
   implementation.  In an embodiment, the symbol set modifier
   624A adds this symbol by placing an additional symbol in
20 the symbol set of one of the reels, each time sufficient
   symbols are accumulated.  In the embodiment, this is
   achieved by adding these symbols to the set of symbols.
   In other embodiments, this can achieved by replacing
   symbols in the symbol set, for example symbols which are
25 not involved in winning combinations.  In another
   embodiment, there could be a plurality of possible sets of
   symbols and the probability could be adjusted by selecting
   which of the sets is to be the current set.          The symbol
   set as adjusted will be available in the next play of the
30 game.
   In this respect, any play of the game may include one or
   more game rounds and if the trigger condition is met, a
   feature game is initiated under the control of the feature
35 game controller which causes outcome generator and outcome
   evaluator to operate in accordance with feature game data
   643.
                                            10112585_1 (GHMatters) P81471.AU.4 28/03/2018

                              - 18
   Trigger probability controller 624 is arranged to cap the
   potential increase to the probability of the trigger
   condition being met.  In the embodiment, this is achieved
 5 by capping the number of symbols which can be added.
   During play of the game, any wins awarded to the player
   are recorded on a win meter in meter data 645 while the
   meter data 645 also include a credit meter which maintains
   the player's current credit balance.
10
   The method of the embodiment is summarised in Figure 7
   which shows that the method 700 includes monitoring 710
   players of the game to collate data related to plays of
   the game.  The method then involves initiating 720 the
15 current play of the game and controlling 730 the
   probability of a trigger during current game based on
   prior plays of the game.  In the embodiment, this
   probability is controlled by updating the symbol set which
   will apply for the next game on the outcome of the
20 previous game as necessary.   The method then involves
   determining 740 whether a trigger condition has been met
   and when the condition is met conducting 750 a feature
   game.
25 In some embodiments, an eligibility criteria may need to
   be satisfied before the player becomes eligible for the
   probability of the trigger condition being adjusted, for
   example that the player has made a certain sized wager,
   made an ante bet, selected all win lines, played
30 sufficient games, or the player is a member of a loyalty
   program.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the gaming system. Persons skilled in
35 the art will also appreciate that the method could be
   embodied in program code. The program code could be
   supplied in a number of ways, for example on a computer
                                            10112585_1 (GHMatters) P81471.AU.4 28/03/2018

   readable storage medium, such as a disc or a memory (for
   example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as a
   data signal  (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).

   Example
   In the example, lion symbols are "captured" when a five of
   a kind lion is spun up - i.e. when five lions appear in a
10 winning combination on the reels.    In the example for each
   10 lions that are captured an additional lion is added to
   the fifth reel.   In the example, the accumulation of lions
   affects the probability of a second screen feature being
   triggered.  The trigger condition for the feature is that
15 when lions are spun up on reel 1 and lions or diamonds are
   spun up on reel 5.   When this occurs, the player wins
   bonus credits in a second screen feature.        Up to five
   lions may be captured.   As a result, the game starts at a
   returned to player of 87.4% and will peak at 90.6%.                      In
20 the example, the lions are captured at a rate of one every
   300 spins on average.   As a result initially the second
   screen feature game will occur 1 in 262 spins initially
   and the probability will increase to 1 in 94 spins.                      In
   the embodiment, the feature game is one of two feature
25 games which are available.    The other feature being a free
   game feature which is triggered with 3 scattered symbols.
   During the free games an additional wild diamond symbol is
   added to reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 for each free game and
   accordingly the combined feature hit rates starts at 1 in
30 88 spins and caps at 1 in every 56 spins.        Capturing of
   the lions, and hence modification of symbol set results in
   bigger wins at a more frequent rate.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in other
35 embodiments, rather than a feature game being awarded in
   response to modification of the trigger condition another
   award, such as a prize may be made to the player.
