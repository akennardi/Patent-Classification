 FIELD
 [0003]  The present disclosure generally relates to methods and systems for analyte
 measurement.
 BACKGROUND
 [0004]  Fig. 1 shows a specimen test strip 100 with a reaction area 102. Reaction
 area 102 contains reagents that react with an analyte in a specimen sample, such
 as glucose in a blood sample. When the specimen sample reaches reaction area
 102, reaction area 102 changes color according to a characteristic of the analyte,
 such as the glucose level in blood. The user visually compares the color of reaction
 area 102 against a chart 104 to correlate the color of reaction area 102 to the
 characteristic of the analyte. Alternatively the user inserts specimen test strip 100
 into a meter, which optically determines the characteristic of the analyte.
 SUMMARY
 [0005]  According to aspects of the present disclosure, a method is provided for a
 portable computing device to read a reaction area on a test strip, which is located in
 a test strip peripheral device placed over an image sensor and a light source of the
 portable computing device. Light is provided with the light source, which the
 peripheral device directs to the reaction area. An image including the reaction area
 is captured with the image sensor. An analyte characteristic is determined based on
 a color of the captured reaction area in the image.

 a screen 206A (e.g., a touchscreen), a flash 206B, an image sensor 208 (shown in
 phantom), a non-transitory computer readable medium 210 (shown in phantom) for
 storing processor executable instructions of an application 212 (shown in phantom),
 and a processor 214 (shown in phantom) to run the application. Executing
 application 212, processor 214 illuminates a reaction area on test strip 202 with light
 from screen 206A, captures an image of the reaction area with image sensor 208,
 determines the color of the captured reaction area in the image, and determines the
 analyte characteristic based on the color of the captured reaction area in the image.
 [0035]   System 200A includes a test strip peripheral device 216A that assists device
 204 in reading the reaction area on test strip 202. Peripheral device 216A includes
 a light guide 218A that directs light from screen 206A to the reaction area on test
 strip 202.
 [0036]   Fig. 2B shows a system 200B to detect a characteristic of an analyte on test
 strip 202 in examples of the present disclosure. System 200B includes device 204
 and a test strip peripheral device 216B. Executing application 212, processor 214
 illuminates the reaction area on test strip 202 with light from flash 206B (shown in
 phantom), captures an image of the reaction area with image sensor 208,
 determines the color of the captured reaction area in the image, and determines the
 analyte characteristic based on the color of the captured reaction area in the image.
 [0037]   Peripheral device 216B includes a light guide 218B that directs light from
 flash 206B to the reaction area on test strip 202. Peripheral device 216B includes a
 color filter 220 (shown in phantom) to control the color of the light illuminating the
 reaction area on test strip 202.
 [0038]   Fig. 3 shows a test strip peripheral device 300 for device 204 in examples of
 the present disclosure. Peripheral device 300 includes a test strip slot or
 compartment 302 to receive test strip 202, a light guide 304 to direct light from a
 light source, such as screen 206A or flash 206B, to the reaction area on the test
 strip, and an alignment feature 306 to aid the placement of the peripheral device on
 the portable computing device. When flash 206B is used as the light source,

WO 2014/094442                              6                         PCT/CN2013/081138
 peripheral device 300 includes a color filter 308 to control the color of the light
 illuminating the reaction area on test strip 202.
 [0039]   Light emits upward from screen 206A or flash 206B, optionally travels through
 color filter 308, reflects diagonally downward from a reflective surface 310 of light
 guide 304, passes through the reaction area on test strip 202, and impinges image
 sensor 208.
 [0040]   In some examples, light guide 304 is a transparent block and reflective
 surface 310 is a beveled edge of the transparent block that reflects light by total
 internal reflection (TIR) or a reflective coating. Light guide 304 may be covered in a
 case or by a coating to prevent ambient light from entering so the reaction area on
 test strip 202 is illuminated substantially by screen 206A or flash 206B. In other
 examples light guide 304 is the reflective interior in a hollow case of peripheral
 device 300 and reflective surface 310 is a surface of the reflective interior. The
 hollow case blocks ambient light so the reaction area on test strip 202 is illuminated
 substantially by screen 206A or flash 206B.
 [0041]   Color filter 308 is located above a portion of screen 206A or flash 206B. In
 other examples color filter 308 is located over test strip 202.
 [0042]   Alignment feature 306 abuts against an edge 312 of device 204 to place test
 strip 202 above imaging sensor 208 and reflective surface 310 of light guide 304
 over a portion of screen 206A or flash 206B. In other examples, alignment feature
 306 may be received in an opening on device 204, such as a speaker opening or an
 earphone jack.

 the present disclosure. Peripheral device 400 includes a test strip slot or
 compartment 402 to receive test strip 202, a light guide 404 to direct light from
 screen 206A or flash 206B to the reaction area on the test strip, and an alignment
 feature 406 to aid the placement of the peripheral device on the portable computing
 device. When flash 206B is used as the light source, peripheral device 400 includes

WO 2014/094442                               7                           PCT/CN2013/081138
 a color filter 408 to control the color of the light illuminating the reaction area on test
 strip 202.
 [0044]   Light emits from screen 206A or flash 206B, optionally travels through color
 filter 408, travels from an entrance face 412 of light guide 404 to an exit face 414 of
 the light guide, reflects diagonally downward from the reaction area on test strip 202,
 and impinges image sensor 208.
 [0045]   Light guide 404 is slanted so entrance face 412 is located above a portion of
 screen 206A or flash 208 and exit face 414 is located below the reaction area on
 test strip 202. In some examples, light guide 404 is a transparent block that
 constrains light by TIR or a reflective coating on its surfaces. In other embodiments,
 light guide 404 is hollow and constrains light by a reflective coating on its surfaces.
 Light guide 404 may be covered in a case or by a coating to prevent ambient light
 from entering so the reaction area on test strip 202 is illuminated substantially by
 screen 206A or flash 206B.
 [0046]   Color filter 408 is located above a portion of screen 206A or flash 206B. In
 other examples color filter 408 is located below the reaction area on test strip 202.
 [0047]   Alignment feature 406 abuts against edge 312 of device 204 to place test
 strip 202 above imaging sensor 208 and light guide 404 over a portion of screen
 206A or flash 206B. In other examples, alignment feature 406 may be received in
 an opening on device 204, such as a speaker opening or an earphone jack.
 [0048]   Fig. 5 shows a test strip peripheral device 500 for device 204 in examples of
 the present disclosure. Peripheral device 500 includes a test strip slot or
 compartment 502 to receive test strip 202, a light guide 504 to direct light to and
 from the reaction area to imaging sensor 208, and an alignment feature 506 to aid
 the placement of the peripheral device on the portable computing device. When
 flash 206B is used as the light source, peripheral device 500 includes a color filter
 508 to control the color of the light illuminating the reaction area on test strip 202.

 [0049]  In some examples, light emits upward from screen 206A or flash 206B,
 optionally travels through color filter 508, reflects diagonally downward from a first
 reflective surface 510 of light guide 504, reflects diagonally upward from the reaction
 area on test strip 202, reflects downward from a second reflective surface 512 of the
 light guide, and impinges image sensor 208.
 [0050]  In some examples, light guide 504 is a transparent block, first reflective
 surface 510 is a beveled edge of the transparent block that reflects light by TIR or a
 reflective coating, and second reflective surface 512 is a reflector embedded in the
 light guide. Light guide 504 may be covered in a case or by a coating to prevent
 ambient light from entering so the reaction area on test strip 202 is illuminated
 substantially by screen 206A or flash 206B. In other examples light guide 504 is the
 reflective interior in a hollow case of peripheral device 500 and reflective surfaces
 510, 512 are surfaces of the reflective interior. The hollow case blocks ambient light
 so the reaction area on test strip 202 is illuminated substantially by screen 206A or
 flash 206B.
 [0051]  Color filter 508 is located above a portion of screen 206A or flash 206B. In
 other examples color filter 508 is located over test strip 202.
 [0052]  Alignment feature 506 abuts against edge 312 of device 204 to place second
 reflective surface 512 above imaging sensor 208 and first reflective surface 510 over
 a portion of screen 206A or flash 206B. In other examples, alignment feature 506
 may be received in an opening on device 204, such as a speaker opening or an
 earphone jack.

 present disclosure. Peripheral device 600 includes a test strip slot or compartment
 602 to receive test strip 202, a light guide 604 to direct light to and from the reaction
 area on the test strip, and an alignment feature 606 to aid the placement of the
 peripheral device on the portable computing device. When flash 206B is used as
 the light source, peripheral device 600 includes a color filter 608 to control the color
 of the light illuminating the reaction area on test strip 202.

WO 2014/094442                                9                         PCT/CN2013/081138
  [0054]  Light is emitted upward from light source 206A or flash 206B, optionally
 travels through color filter 608, reflects diagonally downward from the reaction area
 on test strip 202, reflects diagonally upward from a first reflective surface 610 of light
 guide 604, reflects downward from a second reflective surface 612 of the light guide,
 and impinges image sensor 208.
  [0055]  In some examples, light guide 604 is a transparent block having a beveled
 edge that forms part of test strip slot or compartment 602. First reflective surface
 610 is located on the bottom of light guide 604 and laterally offset from test strip 202.
  First reflective surface 610 reflects light by TIR or a reflective coating. Second
  reflective surface 612 is a reflector embedded in light guide 604 and is laterally
 offset from first reflective surface 610. Light guide 604 may be covered in a case or
  by a coating to prevent ambient light from entering so the reaction area on test strip
 202 is illuminated substantially by screen 206A or flash 206B. In other examples
  light guide 604 is the reflective interior in a hollow case of peripheral device 600 and
  reflective surfaces 610 and 612 are surfaces of the reflective interior. The hollow
 case blocks ambient light so the reaction area on test strip 202 is illuminated
 substantially by screen 206A or flash 206B.

 702 to receive test strip 202, a light guide 704 to direct light to the reaction area on
 the test strip, and an alignment feature 706 to aid the placement of the peripheral
 device on the portable computing device. When flash 206B is used as the light

 source, peripheral device 700 includes a color filter 708 to control the color of the
 light illuminating the reaction area on test strip 202.
 [0059]    Light is emitted upward from screen 206A or flash 206B, optionally travels
 through color filter 708, scatters within light guide 704, reflects diagonally downward
 from the reaction area on test strip 202, and impinges image sensor 208.
 [0060]    Light guide 704 is a block of scattering material, such as an acrylic,
 polycarbonate, epoxy, or glass with doped hollow shells, located above a portion of
 screen 206A or flash 206B and adjacent to test strip 202 in test strip slot 702. Light
 guide 704 may be covered in a case or by a coating to prevent ambient light from
 entering so the reaction area on test strip 202 is illuminated substantially by screen
 206A or flash 206B.

 806. Light guide 804 directs light from screen 206A or flash 206B (Fig. 2A or 2B) to
 a reaction area on test strip 802. Light guide 804 may be covered in a case or by a
 coating to prevent ambient light from entering so the reaction area on test strip 202
 is illuminated substantially by screen 206A or flash 206B.

 are areas that have a different conductive property than the rest of the test strip or
 peripheral device 1202 so they can be detected by a touchscreen on a portable
 computing device.
 [0072]  Fig. 12B shows smart dots 1204 that are made of conductive rubber in
 examples of the present disclosure. Fig. 12C shows smart dots 1204 that are made
 of conductive fibers in examples of the present disclosure. Fig. 12D shows smart
 dots 1204 that are made of conductive cloth in examples of the present disclosure.
 Fig. 12E shows smart dots 1204 that are made of a combination of metal and plastic
 in examples of the present disclosure.
 [0073]  Figs. 13A, 13B, and 13C show different arrangements (i.e., patterns) of smart
 dots 1204 on test strip or peripheral device 1202 in examples of the present
 disclosure. When smart dots 1204 contact a touchscreen on a portable computing
 device, such as touchscreen 206A on device 204 (Fig. 2A or 2B), the portable
 computing device can detect the smart dots. The different arrangements of smart
 dots 1204 may encode the analyte type, the product batch number of test strip or
 peripheral device 1202, or both. The orientation of smart dots 1204 may also
 convey the location and the orientation of the reaction area on test strip or peripheral
 device 1202.
 [0074]  Alternatively smart dots 1204 are not conductive but form a visible code on
 test strip or peripheral device 1202. Such a code 1204 is captured in an image
 along with the reaction area and decoded by processor 214 (Fig. 2A or 2B) to reveal

 an analyte type, a product batch number of test strip or peripheral device 1202, or
 both. The orientation of code 1204 may also convey the location and the orientation
 of the reaction area on test strip or peripheral device 1202.
 [0075]   Fig. 14A shows a test strip 1400A with a reaction area 1402 and a
 temperature sensor 1404A in examples of the present disclosure. A portable
 computing device, such as device 204 (Fig. 2A or 2B), can electronically read
 temperature sensor 1404A and compensate the analyte measurement based on the
 temperature. Temperature sensor 1404A may be a thermistor or a resistance
 temperature detector with a transmitter. Device 204 includes a receiver to read
 temperature sensor 1404A using near field communication (NFC).
 [0076]   Fig. 14B shows a test strip 1400B with reaction area 1402 and a temperature
 indication area 1404B in examples of the present disclosure. A portable computing
 device, such as device 204 (Fig. 2A or 2B), can optically read temperature indication
 area 1404B and compensate the analyte measurement based on the temperature.
 [0077]   Fig. 15 shows a test strip or a test strip peripheral device 1500 for device 204
 (Fig. 2A or 2B) in examples of the present disclosure. Test strip or peripheral device
 1500 includes a test strip 1502, a light guide 1504 to direct light to a reaction area on
 the test strip, and an integral lancet 1506.
 [0078]   Fig. 16 shows a test strip or a test strip peripheral device 1600 for device 204
 (Figs. 2A or 2B) in examples of the present disclosure. Test strip or peripheral
 device 1600 includes a lancet 1602 that is a microneedle array.
 [0079]   Figs. 17A, 17B, 17C, and 17D show perspective, top, bottom, and side views
 of a test strip peripheral device 1700 in examples of the present disclosure.
 Peripheral device 1700 includes a hollow case 1701 with a slot 1702 to receive a
 test strip, a reflective interior 1704 (Figs. 17C and 17D) that forms a light guide to
 direct light to a reaction area on the test strip, and an alignment feature 1706 (e.g., a
 lip of the case shown in Figs. 17C and 17D) to aid the placement of the peripheral
 device on device 204 (Fig. 2A or 2B). Case 1701 has an open bottom exposed to a
 portion of screen 206A or flash 206B (Fig. 2A or 2B) and image sensor 208 (Fig. 2A

WO 2014/094442                             14                         PCT/CN2013/081138
 or 2B). Case 1701 may have a top opening 1708 for a user to deposit a specimen
 sample on the reaction area of the test strip. In other examples, case 1701 does not
 have top opening 1708 and the user deposits the specimen sample through an end
 of the test strip exposed from peripheral device 1700. The test strip has a capillary
 path that carries the specimen sample from the exposed end to the reaction area. In
 yet other examples, peripheral device 700 includes a capillary 1709 (e.g., shown in
 phantom in case 1701 of Fig. 17C) that carries the specimen sample to the to the
 reaction area inside case 1701. Capillary 1709 may have a first opening at one end
 of case 1701, a conduit that travels along the thickness of the case, and a second
 opening to the interior of the case above the reaction area. In these examples, the
 reaction area on the test strip is illuminated substantially by screen 206A or flash
 206B as the reaction area is enclosed within case 1701 and not exposed to ambient
 light. Within case 1701, the test strip is supported by a U-shaped guide 1710.
 [0080]   Fig. 18 shows screen 206A of device 204 in examples of the present
 disclosure. Screen 206A displays a live preview of what image sensor 208 (shown
 in phantom) will capture. A boundary 1802 is displayed on screen 206A to indicate
 where to locate a reaction area 1804 of test strip 202 by adjusting the placement of
 peripheral device 216A on device 204. In examples where screen 206A serves as a
 light source, a portion 1806 of screen 206A emits light to illuminate the reaction area
 on test strip 202. In these examples, portion 1806 may also server as alignment
 marker 902 (Fig. 9) to facilitate the placement of peripheral device 216A on device
 204. In other examples, a separate alignment marker 902 is provided on screen
 206A. Screen 206A displays a capture button 1808 to accept an input command for
 image sensor 208 to capture reaction area 1804.
 [0081]   Fig. 19 is a flowchart of a method 1900 for device 204 (Fig. 2A or 2B) to read
 the reaction area on test strip 202 (Fig. 2A or 2B), which is located in test strip
 peripheral device 216A or 216B (Fig. 2A or 2B) placed over image sensor 208 (Figs.
 2A or 2B) and a portion of screen 206A or flash 206B, in examples of the present
 disclosure. Method 1900 may be implemented by processor 214 (Fig. 2A or 2B)
 executing application 212 (Fig. 2A or 2B). Although blocks for method 1900 are
 illustrated in a sequential order, these blocks may also be performed in parallel,

WO 2014/094442                            15                         PCT/CN2013/081138
 and/or in a different order than those described herein. Also, the various blocks may
 be combined into fewer blocks, divided into additional blocks, and/or eliminated
 based upon the desired implementation. Method 1900 may begin in block 1902.
 [0082]  In block 1902, processor 214 provides light with screen 206A or flash 206B to
 illuminate the reaction area on test strip 202. Peripheral device 216A or 216B
 directs light from screen 206A or flash 206B, respectively, to the reaction area. In
 examples where screen 206A is used as a light source, processor 214 uses portion
 1806 (Fig. 18) on the screen to illuminate the reaction area. In these examples,
 portion 1806 may also serve as alignment marker 902. Block 1902 may be followed
 by block 1904.
 [0083]  In block 1904, processor 214 displays a live preview of what image sensor
 208 will capture on screen 206A. Processor 214 also displays boundary 1802 (Fig.
 18) on screen 206A to indicate where to locate the reaction area of test strip 202 by
 adjusting the placement of peripheral device 216A or 216B on device 204.
 Processor 214 further displays capture button 1808 (Fig. 18) to receive an input
 command to capture an image of the reaction area on test strip 202. Processor 214
 may display alignment marker 902 (Fig. 9) on screen 206A for peripheral device
 216A or 216B. Block 1904 may be followed by block 1906.
 [0084]  In block 1906, touchscreen 206A senses any smart dots on test strip 202 or
 peripheral device 216A or 216B that are contacting the screen. Based on the
 arrangement of the smart dots, processor 214 may determine an analyte type, a
 production batch number of the test strip, or both. Based on the location and the
 orientation of the smart dots, processor 214 may more accurately determine the
 location and the orientation of the reaction area on test strip 202. Processor 214
 may also electronically read temperature sensor 1404A (Fig. 14A) if present. Block
 1906 may be followed by block 1908.
 [0085]  In block 1908, processor 214 captures an image with image sensor 208 in
 response to an input command (e.g., a selection of capture button 1808). When test

WO 2014/094442                            16                          PCT/CN2013/081138
 strip 202 includes a reference area, processor 214 may first determine imaging
 conditions based on the reference area before capturing the image.
 [0086]  The image includes the reaction area. The image may also include a color
 calibration area, a temperature indication area, or both. Block 1908 may be followed
 by block 1910.
 [0087]  In block 1908, processor 214 determines an analyte characteristic based on
 the color of the captured reaction area in the image. When the image includes a
 color calibration area, processor 214 may determine the color of the reaction area
 based on the color calibration area. Processor 214 may correct the analyte
 characteristic based on a temperature detected by a temperature indication area or
 a temperature sensor. When the image includes a temperature indication area,
 processor 214 determines the temperature based on the color of the temperature
 indication area.
 [0088]  When processor 214 is able to determine the characteristic of multiple analyte
 types, the processor may first determine the analyte type based on the smart dots
 on a test strip or a peripheral device. When processor 214 is able to correct the
 analyte characteristic based on a production batch number, which may be obtained
 through a software update over the Internet, the processor may first determine the
 product batch number based on the smart dots on the test strip or the peripheral
 device.
 [0089]  In some examples, processor 214 repeats method 1900 for a different
 illumination intensity or color. Specifically, processor 214 may change the intensity
 or color of portion 1806 on screen 206A and capture another image of the reaction
 area under a different illumination intensity or color. Using two illumination colors
 extends the dynamic range of the measurement.
 [0090] For example, one image is captured under one illumination intensity or color
 to enhance the details for detecting lower concentrations, and another image is
 captured under a different illumination intensity or color to enhance the details for
 detecting higher concentrations. From the two images, processor 214 may select

WO 2014/094442                              17                          PCT/CN2013/081138
 one image based that has average RGB values of the captured reaction area that is
 neither too low (e.g., <30) or too high (e.g., >240). Processor 214 then correlates
 the color of the captured reaction area to the analyte characteristic.
 [0091] Instead of repeating method 1900, processor 214 may split portion1806 into
 parts 2002 and 2004 of different intensities or colors as shown in Fig. 20 in
 examples of the present disclosure. Thus a first part 2006 of the reaction area is
 illuminated by light 2008 of a first intensity or color, and a second part 2008 of the
 reaction area is illuminated by light 2010 of a second intensity or color 2012.
 Processor then determines the analyte characteristic based on the captured two
 parts in the image. In some examples, processor 214 selects one captured part in
 the image that has average RGB values that is neither too low or too high, and
 correlates the color of that captured part to the analyte characteristic. In other
 examples, processor 214 calculates the average or median values RGB values of
 the two captured parts combined and determines the analyte characteristic based on
 the average or median RGB values. In yet other examples, processor 214
 calculates the average or median values RGB values of each captured part and
 determines the analyte characteristic based on the average or median RGB values
 of both captured parts.
 [0092]   Figs. 21A, 21B, 21C, and 21D show first perspective, second perspective,
 top, bottom, and side views of a test strip peripheral device 2100 in examples of the
 present disclosure. Peripheral device 2100 includes a case 2101 with a
 compartment 2102 to receive a test strip, a reflective interior 2104 (Fig. 21 D) that
 forms a light guide to direct light to a reaction area on the test strip, and an
 alignment feature 2106 (Fig. 21 D) to aid the placement of the peripheral device on
 device 204 (Fig. 2A or 2B). Case 2101 has a hollow body 2108 and a lid 2110
 hinged to the body. Body 2108 has an open bottom exposed to a portion of screen
 206A or flash 206B (Fig. 2A or 2B) and image sensor 208 (Fig. 2A or 2B).
 Compartment 2102 is formed by a recessed area on the top of body 2108.
 Recessed area 2102 defines an opening 2112 to expose the reaction area of the
 test strip to imaging sensor 208.

WO 2014/094442                             18                           PCT/CN2013/081138
 [0093]  Lid 2110 has a top opening 2114 for a user to deposit a specimen sample on
 the reaction area on the test strip. In other examples, lid 2110 does not have top
 opening 2114 and the user deposits the specimen sample through an end of the test
 strip exposed from peripheral device 2100. The test strip has a capillary path that
 carries the specimen sample from the exposed end to the reaction area. In yet other
 examples, peripheral device 2100 includes a capillary 2116 (e.g., shown in phantom
 in lid 2110 of Fig. 21C) that carries the specimen sample to the to the reaction area
 inside case 2101. Capillary 2116 may have a first opening at one end of case lid
 2110, a conduit that travels along the thickness of the lid, and a second opening to
 the interior of the lid above the reaction area. In these examples, the reaction area
 on the test strip is illuminated substantially by screen 206A or flash 206B as the
 reaction area is enclosed within case 2101 and not exposed to ambient light.
 [0094]  The features of the test strip peripheral devices and the test strips may be
 combined. For example, a test strip peripheral device may include any combination
 of a light guide, an alignment feature, a lancet, and smart dots. Similarly a test strip
 may include any combination of a reaction area, a reference area, a color calibration
 area, a temperature sensor, a temperature indication area, and smart dots.
 [0095]  The systems and methods disclosed herein may be used to test for the
 presence and/or concentration of certain analytes, such as but not limited to
 glucose, cholesterol, uric acid, troponin I, ketone, protein, nitrite and leukocyte.
 Various fluids may be tested, such as but not limited to blood, interstitial fluid, urine,
 saliva, and other bodily fluids.

 present disclosure have been described herein for purposes of illustration, and that
 various modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of
 the present disclosure. Accordingly, the various embodiments disclosed herein are
