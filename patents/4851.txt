                                             RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No. 2014414823,
the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                                BACKGROUND
[0002] A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the tooth
surfaces.          Toothbrushes have a handle for gripping and a head which is inserted into a user's
mouth for tooth and oral surface cleaning. The head typically has bristles formed of nylon and
sometimes also cleaning elements formed from elastomeric materials to perform the cleaning
function.           Furthermore, some toothbrushes have been developed that include a tongue or soft
tissue cleanser formed of an elastomeric material on the opposite surface of the head relative to
the bristles.             Conventional toothbrushes may also include a handle and/or thumb grip that is
formed with elastomeric materials for ease and comfort during handling and use.                       In
conventional toothbrushes the tongue or soft tissue cleanser is only positioned on the rear surface
of the head and thus there are limits to the possible variations for the design of the tongue or soft
tissue cleanser and its cleaning effectiveness. Thus, a need exists for a toothbrush or other oral
care implement that has soft tissue cleaning features that are aesthetically pleasing and more
effective at removing bacteria from a user's tongue and soft tissue surfaces.
                                                 BRIEF SUMMARY

[0019] Referring first to FIGS. 1 and 2 concurrently, an oral care implement 100 is illustrated in
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In the exemplified embodiment, the
oral care implement 100 is in the form of a manual toothbrush.           However, in certain other
embodiments the oral care implement 100 can take on other forms such as being a powered
toothbrush, a tongue scraper, a gum and soft tissue cleanser, a water pick, an interdental device, a
tooth polisher, a specially designed ansate implement having tooth engaging elements, or any
other type of implement that is commonly used for oral care. Thus, it is to be understood that the
inventive concepts discussed herein can be applied to any type of oral care implement unless a
specific type of oral care implement is specified in the claims.
[0020] The oral care implement 100, which generally comprises a head 110 and a handle 120,
extends from a proximal end 101 to a distal end 102 along a longitudinal axis A-A. The head
110 extends from a proximal end 118 to a distal end 119 along a longitudinal axis that is
coextensive with the longitudinal axis A-A of the oral care implement 100. Furthermore, in the
exemplified embodiment the distal end 102 of the oral care implement 100 is the same as the
distal end 119 of the head 110.
[0021] The handle 120 is an elongated structure that provides the mechanism by which the user
can hold and manipulate the oral care implement 100 during use.                  In the exemplified
embodiment, the handle 120 is generically depicted having various contours for user comfort.
Of course, the invention is not to be limited by the specific shape illustrated for the handle 120 in
all embodiments and in certain other embodiments the handle 120 can take on a wide variety of
shapes, contours, and configurations, none of which are limiting of the present invention unless
so specified in the claims.
[0022] In the exemplified embodiment, the handle 120 is formed of a hard or rigid plastic
material, such as for example without limitation polymers and copolymers of ethylene,
propylene, butadiene, vinyl compounds, and polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate. The
handle 120 also includes a grip 121 that is formed of a resilient/elastomeric material.        In the
exemplified embodiment the grip 121 is molded over a portion of the handle 120 that is typically
gripped by a user's thumb and forefinger during use. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that
additional regions of the handle 120 can be overmolded with the resilient/elastomeric material to
enhance the gripability of the handle 120 during use. For example, portions of the handle 120
that are typically gripped by a user's palm during use may be overmolded with a thermoplastic
                                                  4
10433137 1 (GHMatters) P103754.AU.1

elastomer or other resilient material to further increase comfort to a user. Furthermore, materials
other than those noted above can be used to form the handle 120, including metal, wood, or any
other desired material that has sufficient structural rigidity to permit a user to grip the handle 120
and manipulate the oral care implement 100 during toothbrushing.
[0023] The head 110 of the oral care implement 100 is coupled to the handle 120 and comprises
a front surface 111 and an opposing rear surface 112. Furthermore, the head 110 comprises a
peripheral surface 113 extending between the rear surface 112 and the front surface 111. In the
exemplified embodiment, the head 110 is formed integrally with the handle 120 as a single
unitary structure using a molding, milling, machining, or other suitable process. However, in
other embodiments the handle 120 and the head 110 may be formed as separate components
which are operably connected at a later stage of the manufacturing process by any suitable
technique known in the art, including without limitation thermal or ultrasonic welding, a tight-fit
assembly, a coupling sleeve, threaded engagement, adhesion, or fasteners. Thus, the head 110
may, in certain embodiments, be formed of any of the rigid plastic materials described above as
being used for forming the handle 120, although the invention is not to be so limited in all
embodiments and other materials that are commonly used during toothbrush head manufacture
may also be used.
[0024] The oral care implement 100 also comprises a plurality of tooth cleaning elements 115
extending from the front surface 111 of the head 110. The invention is not to be limited by the
structure, pattern, orientation, and material of the tooth cleaning elements                115 in all
embodiments. Furthermore, where it does not conflict with the other disclosure provided herein
or the claims, it should be appreciated that the term "tooth cleaning elements" may be used in a
generic sense to refer to any structure that can be used to clean, polish, or wipe the teeth and/or
soft oral tissue (e.g. tongue, cheek, gums, etc.) through relative surface contact.           Common
examples of "tooth cleaning elements" include, without limitation, bristle tufts, filament bristles,
fiber bristles, nylon bristles, polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) bristles, spiral bristles, rubber
bristles, elastomeric protrusions, flexible polymer protrusions, combinations thereof, and/or
structures containing such materials or combinations.         Thus, any combination of these tooth
cleaning elements may be used within the tooth cleaning elements 115 in some embodiments.
Furthermore, where bristles are used for one or more of the tooth cleaning elements 115, such
bristles can be tapered, end-rounded, spiral, or the like.
                                                   5
10433137 1 (GHMatters) P103754.AU.1

[0025] In embodiments that use elastomeric materials to form one or more of the tooth cleaning
elements 115, suitable elastomeric materials may include any biocompatible resilient material
suitable for uses in an oral hygiene apparatus. To provide optimum comfort as well as cleaning
benefits, the elastomeric material of any such tooth cleaning element may have a hardness
property in the range of A10 to A70 Shore hardness in one embodiment, or A8 to A25 Shore
hardness            in       another embodiment.    One   suitable   elastomeric material  is   styrene
ethylene/butylene-styrene              block copolymer (SEBS)      manufactured by GLS Corporation.
Nevertheless, SEBS material from other manufacturers or other materials within and outside the
noted hardness range could be used.
[0026] The tooth cleaning elements 115 may be coupled to the head 110 in any manner known in
the art, including staples, in-mold tufting (IMT), anchor-free tufting (AFT), or a modified AFT
known as AMR. Referring briefly to FIG. 4, 7, and 8, one manner in which the tooth cleaning
elements 115 are secured to the head 110 via AFT will be described.                Specifically, in the
embodiment exemplified the tooth cleaning elements 115 are formed as a cleaning element
assembly on a head plate 130 such that one or more of the tooth cleaning elements 115 are
mounted onto the head plate 130 and then the head plate 130 is coupled to the head 110. In such
an embodiment, the head plate 130 is a separate and distinct component from the head 110 of the
oral care implement 100. However, the head plate 130 is connected to the head 110 at a later
stage of the manufacturing process by any suitable technique known in the art, including without
limitation thermal or ultrasonic welding, any fusion techniques such as thermal fusion, melting, a
tight-fit assembly, a coupling sleeve, threaded engagement, adhesion, or fasteners.           Thus, the
head plate 130 and the head 110 are separately formed components that are secured together
during manufacture of the oral care implement 100.
[0027] In certain embodiments, the head plate 130 may comprise an upper surface 133 and a
lower surface 132. The upper surface 133 of the head plate 130 forms a portion of the front
surface 111 of the head 110 when the head plate 130 is coupled to the head 110 as discussed
herein. The head plate 130 comprises a plurality of holes 131 formed therethrough from the
upper surface 133 to the lower surface 132, and the tooth cleaning elements 115 may be mounted
to the head plate 130 within the holes 131. Specifically, in AFT a plate or membrane (i.e., the
head plate 130) is created separately from the head 110. The tooth cleaning elements 115 (such
as bristles, elastomeric elements, and combinations thereof) are positioned into the head plate
                                                        6
10433137 1 (GHMatters) P103754.AU.1

130 so as to extend through the holes 131 of the head plate 130. The free ends 117 of the tooth
cleaning elements 115 on one side of the head plate 130 perform the cleaning function.             The
anchor portions 116 of the tooth cleaning elements 115 on the other side of the head plate 130
are melted together by heat to be anchored in place. As the tooth cleaning elements 115 are
melted together, a melt matte 106 is formed. The melt matte 106 is a thin layer of plastic that is
formed by melting the anchor portions 116 of the bristles so that the anchor portions 116 of the
bristles transition into a liquid, at which point the liquid of the anchor portions 116 of the bristles
combine together into a single layer of liquid plastic that at least partially covers the lower
surface 132 of the head plate 130. After the heat is no longer applied, the melted anchor portions
116 of the bristles solidify/harden to form the melt matte 106 or thin layer of plastic.
[0028] After the tooth cleaning elements 115 are secured to the head plate 130, the head plate
130 is secured to the head 110 such as by ultrasonic welding or mechanical techniques (i.e.,
snap-fit, interference fit, slot-and-tab, or the like) so that the upper surface 133 of the head plate
130 forms at least a portion of the front surface 111 of the head 110. When the head plate 130 is
coupled to the head 110, the melt matte 106 is located between the lower surface 132 of the head
plate 130 and a floor 107 of a basin 108 of the head 110 in which the head plate 130 is disposed.
The melt matte 106, which is coupled directly to and in fact forms a part of the tooth cleaning
elements 115, prevents the tooth cleaning elements 115 from being pulled through the holes 131
in the head plate 130 to ensure that the tooth cleaning elements 115 remain attached to the head
plate 130 during use of the oral care implement 100.
[0029] As noted above, in another embodiment the tooth cleaning elements may be connected to
the head 110 using a technique known in the art as AMR. In this technique, the handle is formed
integrally with the head plate as a one-piece structure. After the handle and the head plate are
formed, the bristles are inserted into holes in the head plate so that the free/cleaning ends of the
bristles extend from the front surface of the head plate and the bottom ends of the bristles are
adjacent to the rear surface of the head plate. After the bristles are inserted into the holes in the
head plate, the bottom ends of the bristles are melted together by applying heat thereto, thereby
forming a melt matte at the rear surface of the head plate. The melt matte is a thin layer of
plastic that is formed by melting the bottom ends of the bristles so that the bottom ends of the
bristles transition into a liquid, at which point the liquid of the bottom ends of the bristles
combine together into a single layer of liquid plastic that at least partially covers the rear surface
                                                    7
10433137 1 (GHMatters) P103754.AU.1

of the head plate. After the heat is no longer applied, the melted bottom ends of the bristles
solidify/harden to form the melt matte/thin layer of plastic.                   In some embodiments, after
formation of the melt matte, a tissue cleanser is injection molded onto the rear surface of the
head plate, thereby trapping the melt matte between the tissue cleanser and the rear surface of the
head plate. In other embodiments, other structures may be coupled to the rear surface of the
head plate to trap the melt matte between the rear surface of the head plate and such structure
without the structure necessarily being a tissue cleanser (the structure can just be a plastic
material that is used to form a smooth rear surface of the head, or the like).
[0030] Of course, techniques other than AFT and AMR can be used for mounting the tooth
cleaning elements 115 to the head 110, such as widely known and used stapling techniques or the
like. In such embodiments the head plate 130 may be omitted and the tooth cleaning elements
115 may be coupled directly to the head 110. Furthermore, in a further modified version of the
AFT and AMR processes discussed above, the head plate 130 may be formed by positioning the
tooth cleaning elements 115 within a mold, and then molding the head plate 130 around the tooth
cleaning elements 115 via an injection molding process.
[0031] Referring again to FIGS. 1 and 2, in the exemplified embodiment the plurality of tooth
cleaning elements 115 includes a plurality of separate tufts of bristles 114 and a plurality of
elastomeric tooth cleaning elements 103.                    Although illustrated herein as having a specific
arrangement and shape, the arrangement of the tufts of bristles 114 and elastomeric tooth
cleaning elements 103 as well as the shapes thereof can be modified from that which is depicted
in the figures.                   Thus, the collective tooth cleaning elements 115 can be any pattern or
arrangement and each one of the tooth cleaning elements 115 can have any desired shape.
[0032] Referring to FIGS. 3-8 concurrently, the head 110 of the oral care implement 100 will be
described in more detail. As noted above, the head 110 comprises the front surface 111, the rear
surface 112 opposite the front surface 111, and the peripheral surface 113 extending between the
front and rear surfaces 111, 112. The peripheral surface 113 forms a periphery of the head 110
and defines the outermost boundary of the head 110. The peripheral surface 113 of the head 110
includes a first lateral side portion 140, a second lateral side portion 141 opposite the first lateral
side portion 140, and a distal portion 142 extending between the first and second lateral side
portions 140, 141. The distal portion 142 of the peripheral surface 113 includes the distal end
119 of the head 110.

[0033] The head 110 of the oral care implement 100 comprises a base 144 that is formed of a
hard plastic material, such as any of the materials noted above for forming the handle 120
(including polypropylene and the like). Furthermore, the head 110 comprises a first elastomeric
soft tissue cleanser 150 and a second elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180 that are coupled to the
base 144. Each of the first and second elastomeric soft tissue cleansers 150, 180 are formed of a
resilient and flexible elastomeric material, such as a thermoplastic elastomer.       The first and
second elastomeric soft tissue cleansers 150, 180 serve to clean the user's tongue and soft tissue
surfaces and to protect the user's gums. Specifically, the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser
150 is positioned on the peripheral surface 113 of the head 110 and thus reduces the impact of
the hard plastic of the base 144 against the user's gums during use of the toothbrush. The first
elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 also includes raised features that protrude beyond the rear
surface 112 of the head 110 and can also be used for cleaning/scraping a user's tongue. The
second elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180 is positioned on the rear surface 112 of the head 110
and can be used to clean and scrub a user's tongue and other soft tissue surfaces.              The
combination of the first and second elastomeric soft tissue cleansers 150, 180 also results in a
highly desirable aesthetic appearance for the oral care implement 100.
[0034] As noted above, the second elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180 is coupled to the base 144
of the head 110 on the rear surface 112 of the head 110. The second elastomeric soft tissue
cleanser 180 comprises a pad 181 and a plurality of protuberances 182 that extend from the pad
181. In the exemplified embodiment, each of the plurality of protuberances 182 is in the form of
a nub. As used herein a "nub" generally refers to a column-like protrusion (without limitation to
the cross-sectional shape of the protrusion) which is upstanding from a base surface. In a general
sense, the protuberances 182 in the preferred construction have a height that is greater than the
width at the base of the protuberance 182 (as measured in the longest direction). Nevertheless,
protuberances or nubs could include projections wherein the widths and heights are roughly the
same or wherein the heights are somewhat smaller than the base widths. Moreover, in some
circumstances (e.g., where the protuberances taper to a tip or include a base portion that narrows
to a smaller projection), the base width can be substantially larger than the height. Furthermore,
in the exemplified embodiment the plurality of protuberances 182 have varying heights such that
some of the protuberances 182 are taller than other of the protuberances 182 (as best seen in
FIGS. 3, 7, and 8).

10433137 1 (GHMatters) P103754.AU.1

[0035] The base 144 of the head 110 comprises a basin 190 formed therein.        The basin 190 is
defined by a floor 191 that is recessed relative to the rear surface 112 of the head 110 and a
sidewall 192 that extends from the floor 191 to the rear surface 112 of the head 110. The second
elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180 is positioned within the basin 190. More specifically, the
pad 181 of the second elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180 is disposed within the basin 190 so
that an exposed surface 183 of the pad 181 is flush or substantially flush with the portion of the
rear surface 112 of the head 110 that is formed by the base 144 (substantially flush can be the
exposed surface 183 of the pad 181 either extending beyond or being recessed relative to the rear
surface 112 of the base 144 of the head 110 by between approximately 0.1 mm and 1.0 mm).
The exposed surface 183 of the pad 181 thus forms a part of the rear surface 112 of the head 110.
Furthermore, the plurality of protuberances 192 extend from the rear surface 112 of the head 110
for contact with a user's soft tissue surfaces. The second elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180
may be coupled to the head via an injection molding process (i.e., by injection molding an
elastomeric material directly into the basin 190 while the head 110 is positioned within a mold).
In certain embodiments the head 110 may include one or more peg members 193 that extend
upwardly from the floor 191 of the basin 190 to assist in retaining the second elastomeric soft
tissue cleanser 180 within the basin 190.
[0036] The first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 is a completely separate and distinct
component relative to the second elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180. Thus, in the exemplified
embodiment the first and second elastomeric soft tissue cleansers 150, 180 are completely
isolated from one another and do not overlap or contact one another at any location. Rather, the
first and second elastomeric soft tissue cleansers 150, 180 are isolated from one another by an
exposed portion 146 of the base 144 of the head 110. Thus, the first elastomeric soft tissue
cleanser 150 may be injection molded to the head 110 in a separate process than the injection
molding of the second elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180.      The first elastomeric soft tissue
cleanser 150 is also formed of a soft, resilient, and flexible material, such as a thermoplastic
elastomer. In certain embodiments the first and second elastomeric soft tissue cleansers 150, 180
may have the same Shore durometer/hardness.         In other embodiments the first and second
elastomeric soft tissue cleansers 150, 180 may have different Shore durometer/hardnesses (with
either of the first and second elastomeric soft tissue cleansers 150, 180 being harder than the
other to achieve a desired cleaning effect).
                                                10
10433137 1 (GHMatters) P103754.AU.1

[0037] As noted above, the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 is coupled to the head 110
along the peripheral surface 113 of the head 110. More specifically, the first elastomeric soft
tissue cleanser 150 comprises a bumper portion 151 that extends along the peripheral surface 113
of the head 110 and a connecting portion 152 that is located on one or both of the rear surface
112 of the head 110 and a neck portion 122 of the handle 120. The bumper portion 151 of the
first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 extends in a continuous manner along each of the first
lateral side portion 140 of the peripheral surface 113 of the head 110, the distal portion 142 of
the peripheral surface 113 of the head 110, and the second lateral side portion 141 of the
peripheral surface 113 of the head 110.         Due to the connecting portion 152 of the first
elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 extending along the rear surface 112 of the head 110 or the
neck portion of the handle 120, the bumper portion 151 and the connecting portion 152 of the
first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 collectively form an annular structure that surrounds the
rear surface 112 of the head 110.
[0038] In the exemplified embodiment the connecting portion 152 of the first elastomeric soft
tissue cleanser 150 comprises a first section 153 that extends along the proximal portion of the
rear surface 112 of the head 110. Thus, the first section 153 of the connecting portion 152 of the
first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 extends between the first and second lateral side
portions 140, 141 of the peripheral surface 113 of the head 110 and connects the portion of the
bumper portion 151 that is positioned on the first lateral side portion 140 to the portion of the
bumper portion 151 that is positioned on the second lateral side portion 141. The connecting
portion 152 of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 also comprises a second section 154
that extends longitudinally along the rear surface of the neck 122 of the handle 120 (see FIG. 2).
[0039] As best seen in FIGS. 4, 7, and 8, the base 144 of the head 110 comprises a channel 145
that extends along the first and second lateral side portions 140, 141 and the distal portion 142 of
the peripheral surface 113. The channel 145 is a continuous, indented surface feature formed
into the base 144 of the head 110 that extends along each of the portions of the peripheral surface
113 of the head 110. The channel 145 has a wave-like, undulating, or sinusoidal shape as it
extends along the first and second lateral side portions 140, 141 and the distal portion 142 of the
peripheral surface 113. The channel 145 forms a closed-loop because in addition to extending
along the first and second lateral side portions 140, 141 and the distal portion 142 of the
peripheral surface 113, it also extends along the rear surface of the proximal end of the head 110
                                                  11
10433137 1 (GHMatters) P103754.AU.1

or along the neck 122. The first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 is at least partially disposed
within the channel 145. Stated another way and as will be better understood from the description
below, a first portion of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 is disposed in the channel
145 and a second portion of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 protrudes from the
channel 145.
[0040] Still referring to FIGS. 3-8 concurrently, in between the first and second elastomeric soft
tissue cleansers 150, 180 the base 144 of the head 110 comprises an exposed annular surface
146. The exposed annular surface 146 of the base 144 forms a portion of the rear surface 112 of
the head 110 and it maintains the first and second elastomeric soft tissue cleansers 150, 180
completely separate from one another.                  In the exemplified embodiment, the exposed annular
surface 146 of the base 144 and the exposed surface 183 of the pad 181 of the second elastomeric
soft tissue cleanser 180 collectively form the entire rear surface 112 of the head 110.
[0041] The exposed annular surface 146 of the base 144 is located adjacent to the peripheral
surface 113 of the head 110 and circumscribes the second elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180.
Thus, the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 circumscribes the exposed annular surface 146
of the base 144 and the exposed annular surface 146 of the base 144 circumscribes the second
elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180. Because the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 is a
continuous structure, the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 substantially surrounds the
exposed annular surface 146 of the base 144. Similarly, because the exposed annular surface
146 of the base 144 is a continuous surface, the exposed annular surface 146 of the base 144
substantially surrounds the second elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180. As can be seen in the
figures, in the exemplified embodiment no portion of the first or second elastomeric soft tissue
cleansers 150, 180 traverses or otherwise passes over or along the exposed annular surface 146
of the base 144. Thus, the exposed annular surface 146 of the base 144 is an annular region of
the base 144 that is completely devoid of an elastomeric material being coupled or adhered
thereto.
[0042] As noted above, the bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150
extends continuously along the first and second lateral portions 140, 141 and the distal portion
142 of the peripheral surface 113 of the head 110. The peripheral surface 113 of the head 110
and the rear surface 112 of the head 110 intersect to form a perimeter 104 of the rear surface 112
of the head 110.                    The bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150
                                                            12
10433137 1 (GHMatters) P103754.AU.1

comprises a plurality of raised portions 160 located along the perimeter 104 that protrude above
(or protrude beyond) the rear surface 112 of the head 110 and a plurality of lower portions 164
that are located on the peripheral surface 113.       Thus, the bumper portion 151 of the first
elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 extends continuously along the peripheral surface 113 of the
head 110 without gaps or breaks and includes the raised portions 160 that protrude beyond the
rear surface 112 of the head 110 at the perimeter 104 where the peripheral surface 113
meets/intersects the rear surface 112 and the lower portions 164 that are located on the peripheral
surface 113 and do not protrude beyond the rear surface 112 of the head 110.
[0043] The bumper portion 151 alternates between the raised portions 160 and the lower
portions 164 as it extends along the periphery 113 of the head 110. Thus, the raised portions 160
are spaced-apart along the perimeter 103 of the head 110 and the lower portions 164 are spaced
apart along the peripheral surface 113 of the head 110. A portion of the exposed annular surface
146 of the base 144 of the head 110 is located between each pair of adjacent raised portions 160.
Thus, the perimeter 104 alternates between the raised portions 160 and the exposed annular
surface 146 along the entirety of the perimeter 104 of the head 110. An exposed side surface
portion 162 of the base 144 is located between adjacent ones of the lower portions 164 of the
bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150. Thus, the peripheral surface
113 alternates between the lower portions 164 and the exposed side surface portion 162 of the
base 144 along the entirety of the peripheral surface 113 of the head 110.
[0044] The plurality of raised portions 160 protrude beyond the rear surface 112 of the head 110
such that a reference plane that is coextensive with or includes the rear surface 112 of the head
110 will intersect the raised portions 160 of the bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft
tissue cleanser 150. The plurality of raised portions 160 are arranged in a spaced-apart manner
about the perimeter 104 of the head 110 so as to at least partially circumscribe the rear surface
112 of the head 110.
[0045] The bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 comprises the
raised portions 160 on each of the first lateral side portion 140, the second lateral side portion
141, and the distal portion 142. Furthermore, each of the raised portions 160 on the first lateral
side portion 140 are transversely aligned with one of the raised portions 160 on the second lateral
side portion 141 so that an axis that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis A-A that intersects
one of the raised portion 160 on the first lateral side portion 140 will also intersect one of the
                                                 13
10433137 1 (GHMatters) P103754.AU.1

raised portions 160 on the second lateral side portion 141. Similarly, each of the lower portions
164 on the first lateral side portion 140 are transversely aligned with one of the lower portions
164 on the second lateral side portion 141. Stated another way, the bumper portion 151 of the
first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 is substantially symmetric about the longitudinal axis A
A.
[0046] In the exemplified embodiment, the plurality of raised portions 160 of the bumper portion
151 of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 are ridges having a length L measured along
the perimeter 104 and a width W measured orthogonal to the length L. The length L of each of
the plurality of raised portions 160 is greater than its width W. Furthermore, each of the plurality
of raised portions 160 protrudes only slightly beyond the rear surface 112 of the head 110, such
as between approximately 0.5 mm and 2.0 mm, and more specifically between approximately 0.8
mm and 1.5 mm (indicated in FIG. 8 as protruding distance D).                  The length L of each of the
plurality of raised portions 160 is greater than its protruding distance D. Due to a combination of
the length L, width W, and protruding distance D, the raised portions 160 of the bumper portion
151 are somewhat rigid while also being flexible due to being formed of an elastomeric material,
which enables the raised portions 160 to gently scrape debris from a user's tongue and other soft
tissue surfaces during use.
[0047] The protruding distance D of the raised portions 160 of the bumper portion 151 of the
first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 is less than the height of at least some (and potentially
all) of the protuberances 182 of the second elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180 (measured from
the rear surface 112 of the head 110 to the terminal/distal ends of the protuberances 182). Thus,
while the protuberances 182 of the second elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180 may readily flex
and bend when contacted against a user's tongue and other soft tissue surfaces, the raised
portions 160 of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 will bend to a lesser degree due to
the length L and protruding distance D, which enables the raised portions 160 to be used for
scraping and penetrating rather than just one or the other.
[0048] Of course, the invention is not limited to the raised portions 160 being ridges in all
embodiments.                  In certain other embodiments, the raised portions 160 may be nubs having a
protruding distance that is greater than the length and width of the raised portion 160. In such an
embodiment the raised portions 160 will be more flexible because a taller, thinner elastomeric
structure will have more flexibility than a shorter, thicker elastomeric structure.             In certain
                                                           14
10433137 1 (GHMatters) P103754.AU.1

embodiments it is desirable to have the protruding distance D be less than the length L to
minimize the flexibility of the raised portions 160 to increase their ability to scrape a user's
tongue and other soft tissue surfaces. Thus, in certain embodiments it is preferred that L > D and
L > W.
[0049] The raised portions 160 of the bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft tissue
cleanser 150 comprise an inner surface 165 facing the second elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 180
and an opposite outer surface 166. In the exemplified embodiment the inner surface 165 is an
arcuate surface that extends from a terminal end of the raised portions 160 to the rear surface 112
of the head 110 (and more specifically to the exposed annular surface 146 of the base 144).
More specifically, the inner surface 165 is arcuate and convex. The outer surface 166 of the
raised portions 160 is also an arcuate and convex surface. More specifically, the outer surface
166 is a continually convex surface from the peripheral surface 113 to the terminal end of the
raised portions 160 and the inner surface 165 is a continually convex surface from the rear
surface 112 to the terminal end of the raised portions 160. Thus, the inner and outer surfaces
165, 166 of the raised portions 160 are both convex surfaces so that the raised portions 160 have
a generally egg-shaped cross-sectional profile (see FIG. 8).
[0050] The bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 comprises an
undulating upper edge 155 and an undulating lower edge 158. Each of the undulating upper and
lower edges 155, 158 takes on a sinusoidal shape when viewed in side profile.           Due to the
undulating upper and lower edges 155, 158, the bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft
tissue cleanser 150 is also wavy and undulating and has a sinusoidal shape when viewed in side
profile.
[0051] The undulating upper edge 155 of the bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft
tissue cleanser 150 includes a plurality of high points 156 that protrude above the rear surface
112 of the head 110 and a plurality of low points 157 that are located at or below the rear surface
112 of the head 110. The protruding appearance of the plurality of high points 156 is best seen
in FIGS. 6 and 8. In the exemplified embodiment the plurality of low points 157 of the
undulating upper edge 155 are located on the peripheral surface 113 of the head 110 and spaced
a distance below the rear surface 113 of the head 110. However, the invention is not to be so
limited in all embodiments and the low points 157 of the undulating upper edge 155 may
                                                 15
10433137 1 (GHMatters) P103754.AU.1

protrude beyond the rear surface 113 in some embodiments, or it may be located right at the
perimeter 104 in other embodiments.
[0052] The raised portions 160 of the bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft tissue
cleanser 150 comprise the high points 156 of the undulating upper edge 155. In the exemplified
embodiment the plurality of low points 157 appear to be located below the rear surface 112 of
the head 110 and entirely positioned on the peripheral surface 113 of the head 110, but the
invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments and the plurality of low points 157 may be
located at the rear surface 112 of the head 110 (or directly at the perimeter 104 formed by the
intersection of the peripheral surface 113 and the rear surface 112) in other embodiments. The
undulating upper edge 155 of the bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser
150 alternates repetitively between the high points 156 and the low points 157 along the
peripheral surface 113 of the head 110.
[0053] The undulating lower edge 158 comprises a plurality of high points 159 located on the
peripheral surface 113 and a plurality of low points 161 that are also located on the peripheral
surface 113. Furthermore, as noted above the base 144 comprises the plurality of exposed side
surface portions 162 on the peripheral surface 113. The exposed side surface portions 162 of the
base 144 and the lower portions 164 of the bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft tissue
cleanser 150 collectively form the peripheral surface 113 of the head 110.         Specifically, the
undulating lower edge 158 of the bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser
150 comprises a plurality of valleys 163 that include the low points 161 of the undulating lower
edge 158. The exposed side surface portions 162 of the base 144 are located between adjacent
ones of the valleys 163 of the undulating lower edge 158.
[0054] The high points 156 of the undulating upper edge 155 are aligned with the high points
159 of the undulating lower edge 158. The low points 157 of the undulating upper edge 155 are
aligned with the low points 161 of the undulating lower edge 158. In this sense, aligned means
that a reference plane that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis A-A and that extends through
the front and rear surfaces 111, 112 of the head 110 will intersect one of the high points 156 of
the undulating upper edge 155 and one of the high points 159 of the undulating lower edge 158
or one of the low points 157 of the undulating upper edge 155 and one of the low points 161 of
the undulating lower edge 158.
                                                  16

[0055] Furthermore, the raised portions 160 of the bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric
soft tissue cleanser 150 are located between the high points 156 of the undulating upper edge 155
and the correspondingly aligned high points 159 of the undulating lower edge 158. The lower
portions 164 of the bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150 are
positioned on the peripheral surface 113 and in the exemplified embodiment do not protrude
beyond the rear surface 112 of the head 110 (although they could in alternative embodiments).
The lower portions 164 of the bumper portion 151 of the first elastomeric soft tissue cleanser 150
are located between the low points 157 of the undulating upper edge 155 and the
correspondingly aligned low points 161 of the undulating lower edge 158.
