 5                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            "Kennel cough" or infectious tracheobronchitis (ITB) is an acute, contagious
    respiratory infection in dogs characterized mainly by coughing (Ford et al, 1998).      Canine
    ITB is considered one of the most prevalent infectious respiratory diseases of dogs
    worldwide, and outbreaks can reach epidemic proportions when dogs are housed in high
 '0 density population environments such as kennels. Most outbreaks are due to direct dog-to
    dog contact or aerosolization of respiratory secretions (Ford et al, 1998). The clinical signs
    are caused by infection with one or a combination of bacterial and viral agents that colonize
    the epithelium of the upper and lower respiratory tract. Canine parainfluenza virus (CPiV)
    and Bordetella bronchiseptica bacteria are the most common organisms isolated from
25  affected dogs, but several other viruses such as canine distemper virus (CDV) and canine
    adenoviruses-1 and -2 (CAV-1, CAV-2), along with bacteria such as Streptococcus sp.,
    Pasteurella multicoda and Escherichia coli, can influence the clinical course and outcome
    (Ford et al, 1998).     While outbreaks occur most efficiently and rapidly in high-density
    populations with high morbidity, complicated          respiratory infections    and death are
30  uncommon.       Although life-threatening secondary bacterial pneumonia can develop, the
    majority of ITB cases are self-limiting and resolve without any treatment (Ford et al, 1998).
            In July 1992, a respiratory infection presumed to be "kennel cough" became epidemic
    at several greyhound tracks in New England, Florida, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Kansas,

                                                    2
    Colorado, Oklahoma and Arizona. According to veterinarians, most of the affected dogs had
    a mild cough that resolved, but more than a dozen greyhounds developed an acute
    hemorrhagic pneumonia followed by rapid death (Greyhound Daily News, 1999).
            In late 1998 to early 1999, several outbreaks of "kennel cough" occurred in racing
 5  greyhound kennels across the country, resulting in mandatory closure of tracks and
    quarantine of all racing greyhounds in the U.S. for several weeks (Greyhound Daily News,
    1999). At one track in Florida (Palm Beach Kennel Club), coughing was recorded in nearly
    40% of the dog population on a single day (Personal communication from Dr. William
    Duggar). Similar to the outbreak in 1992, the coughing resolved in most greyhounds, but 10
 0  dogs in Florida died from a hemorrhagic pneumonia syndrome uncharacteristic of "kennel
    cough" (Putnam, 1999).
            In March-April 2003, another outbreak of "kennel cough" occurred at greyhound
    tracks in the eastern U.S.    The outbreak is believed to have originated in kennels at four
    tracks in Florida and caused the suspension of racing and quarantine of dogs for almost three
 5  weeks. Nearly 25% of the dogs at the track in West Palm Beach were affected, while almost
    50% of the 1400 dogs at Derby Lane in St. Petersburg developed coughing. Again, most
    dogs recovered, but several dogs have died from the respiratory infection. The estimated
    economic impact of the respiratory outbreak at the Derby Lane track alone was $2 million.
            There are no published reports documenting the etiology or clinicopathology of the
 .0 "kennel cough" epidemics in racing greyhound kennels in 1992, 1998-1999, or 2003. The
    assumption has been that the infections were due to CPiV and/or B. bronchiseptica, the two
    most common causes of kennel cough. Unsubstantiated communications such as web sites
    have attributed the fatal hemorrhagic pneumonias reported in some of the coughing dogs to
    infection with p-hemolytic Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus, and refer to the
25  syndrome as "canine streptococcal toxic shock."
            Transmission of virus from one host species to another is a crucial feature of the
    ecology and epidemiology of influenza virus (Webster, 1998).          Two basic mechanisms of
    interspecies transmission of influenza virus are possible (Webster et al., 1992; Lipatov et al.,
    2004). One is the direct transfer of an essentially unaltered virus from one species to another.
30  Examples of this mechanism include the recent human infections with the H5N1 subtype of
    avian influenza virus (Subbarao et al., 1998; Peiris et al., 2004; Guan et al., 2004) and
    possibly the pandemic of 1918, known as Spanish flu (Reid et al., 2004).            The second
    mechanism is a consequence of the segmented nature of the influenza genome. Co-infection

                                                   3
    of a host with viruses from different species can result in reassortment of the segmented viral
    genes and the generation of a recombinant with the ability to infect other species.         For
    example, novel viruses generated by gene reassortment between avian and human influenza
    viruses resulted in human influenza pandemics in 1957 and 1968 (Webster et al., 1992;
 5  Lipatov et al., 2004; Kawaoka et al., 1989).
            Most direct transmissions of unaltered influenza viruses from the natural host species
    to a different species are terminal events because sustained transmission between individuals
    of the new species fails to occur.        Multiple virus-host interactions are necessary for
    replication and horizontal transmission and provide a formidable barrier to perpetuation of
 0  influenza viruses in the new host (Webby et al., 2004). Therefore, establishment of new
    host-specific lineages of influenza virus is uncommon and has only occurred in domestic
    poultry, pigs, horses, and humans (Webster et al., 1992; Lipatov et al., 2004).
            Because of the serious nature of influenza virus infection, there remains a need for
    methods for diagnosing, preventing, and treating infection by influenza virus.

30  75, or 77.    In a preferred embodiment, an expression construct of the present invention
    provides for overexpression of an operably linked polynucleotide of the invention.
            Expression constructs of the invention generally include regulatory elements that are
    functional in the intended host cell in which the expression construct is to be expressed.

                                                    14
    Thus, a person of ordinary skill in the art can select regulatory elements for use in, for
    example, human host cells, mammalian host cells, insect host cells, yeast host cells, bacterial
    host cells, and plant host cells. In one embodiment, the regulatory elements are ones that are
    functional in canine cells. Regulatory elements include promoters, transcription termination
 5  sequences, translation termination sequences, enhancers, and polyadenylation elements. As
    used herein, the term "expression construct" refers to a combination of nucleic acid
    sequences that provides for transcription of an operably linked nucleic acid sequence.          As
    used herein, the term "operably linked" refers to a juxtaposition of the components described
    wherein the components are in a relationship that permits them to function in their intended
 0  manner. In general, operably linked components are in contiguous relation.
             An expression construct of the invention can comprise a promoter sequence operably
    linked to a polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention. Promoters can
    be incorporated into a polynucleotide using standard techniques known in the art. Multiple
    copies of promoters or multiple promoters can be used in an expression construct of the
 5  invention. In a preferred embodiment, a promoter can be positioned about the same distance
    from the transcription start site in the expression construct as it is from the transcription start
    site in its natural genetic environment. Some variation in this distance is permitted without
    substantial decrease in promoter activity. A transcription start site is typically included in the
    expression construct. Preferably, the promoter associated with an expression construct of the
 '0 invention provides for overexpression of an operably linked polynucleotide of the invention.
             Promoters for use with an expression construct of the invention in eukaryotic cells can
    be of viral or cellular origin. Viral promoters include, but are not limited to, cytomegalovirus
    (CMV) gene promoters, SV40 early or late promoters, or Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) gene
    promoters. Promoters of cellular origin include, but are not limited to, desmin gene promoter
25  and actin gene promoter        Promoters suitable for use with an expression construct of the
    invention in yeast cells include, but are not limited to, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase promoter,
    glyceraldehyde-3 -phosphate dehydrogenase promoter, metallothionein promoter, alcohol
    dehydrogenase-2 promoter, and hexokinase promoter.
             If the expression construct is to be provided in or introduced into a plant cell, then
30  plant viral promoters, such as, for example, a cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S
    (including the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter (see, for example U.S. Patent No. 5,106,739
    and An, 1997)) or a CaMV 19S promoter can be used. Other promoters that can be used for
    expression constructs in plants include, for example, prolifera promoter, Ap3 promoter, heat

                                                   15
    shock promoters, T-DNA 1'- or 2'-promoter of A. tumefaciens, polygalacturonase promoter,
    chalcone synthase A (CHS-A) promoter from petunia, tobacco PR-la promoter, ubiquitin
    promoter, actin promoter, alcA gene promoter, pin2 promoter (Xu et al., 1993), maize WipI
    promoter, maize trpA gene promoter (U.S. Patent No. 5,625,136), maize CDPK gene
 5  promoter, and RUBISCO SSU promoter (U.S. Patent No. 5,034,322) can also be used. Root
    specific promoters, such as any of the promoter sequences described in U.S. Patent No.
    6,455,760 or U.S. Patent No. 6,696,623, or in published U.S. patent application Nos.
    20040078841; 20040067506; 20040019934; 20030177536; 20030084486; or 20040123349,
    can be used with an expression construct of the invention. Constitutive promoters (such as
 0  the CaMV, ubiquitin, actin, or NOS promoter), developmentally-regulated promoters, and
    inducible promoters (such as those promoters than can be induced by heat, light, hormones,
    or chemicals) are also contemplated for use with polynucleotide expression constructs of the
    invention.   Tissue-specific promoters, for example fruit-specific promoters, such as the E8
    promoter of tomato (accession number: AF515784; Good et al. (1994)) can also be used.
 5  Seed-specific promoters such as the promoter from a         p-phaseolin  gene (for example, of
    kidney bean) or a glycinin gene (for example, of soybean), and others, can also be used.
            For expression in prokaryotic systems, an expression construct of the invention can
    comprise promoters such as, for example, alkaline phosphatase promoter, tryptophan (trp)
    promoter, lambda PL promoter, P-lactamase promoter, lactose promoter, phoA promoter, T3
 '0 promoter, T7 promoter, or tac promoter (de Boer et al., 1983).
            Expression constructs of the invention may optionally contain a transcription
    termination sequence, a translation termination sequence, a sequence encoding a signal
    peptide, and/or enhancer elements.      Transcription termination regions can typically be
    obtained from the 3' untranslated region of a eukaryotic or viral gene sequence. Transcription
25  termination sequences can be positioned downstream of a coding sequence to provide for
    efficient termination.  A signal peptide sequence is a short amino acid sequence typically
    present at the amino terminus of a protein that is responsible for the relocation of an operably
    linked mature polypeptide to a wide range of post-translational cellular destinations, ranging
    from a specific organelle compartment to sites of protein action and the extracellular
30  environment. Targeting gene products to an intended cellular and/or extracellular destination
    through the use of an operably linked signal peptide sequence is contemplated for use with
    the polypeptides of the invention. Classical enhancers are cis-acting elements that increase
    gene transcription and can also be included in the expression construct. Classical enhancer

                                                   16
    elements are known in the art, and include, but are not limited to, the CaMV 35S enhancer
    element, cytomegalovirus (CMV) early promoter enhancer element, and the SV40 enhancer
    element. Intron-mediated enhancer elements that enhance gene expression are also known in
    the art. These elements must be present within the transcribed region and are orientation
 5  dependent.
             DNA sequences which direct polyadenylation of mRNA transcribed from the
    expression construct can also be included in the expression construct, and include, but are not
    limited to, an octopine synthase or nopaline synthase signal.
             Expression constructs can also include one or more dominant selectable marker genes,
 0  including, for example, genes encoding antibiotic resistance and/or herbicide-resistance for
    selecting transformed cells. Antibiotic-resistance genes can provide for resistance to one or
    more of the following antibiotics: hygromycin, kanamycin, bleomycin, G418, streptomycin,
    paromomycin, neomycin, and spectinomycin.          Kanamycin resistance can be provided by
    neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT II).           Herbicide-resistance genes can provide for
 5  resistance to phosphinothricin acetyltransferase or glyphosate. Other markers used for cell
    transformation screening include, but are not limited to, genes encoding p-glucuronidase
    (GUS), p-galactosidase, luciferase, nopaline synthase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
    (CAT), green fluorescence protein (GFP), or enhanced GFP (Yang et al., 1996).
             The   subject  invention   also   concerns  polynucleotide    vectors  comprising    a
 '0 polynucleotide sequence of the invention that encodes a polypeptide of the invention. Unique
    restriction enzyme sites can be included at the 5' and 3' ends of an expression construct or
    polynucleotide of the invention to allow for insertion into a polynucleotide vector. As used
    herein, the term "vector" refers to any genetic element, including for example, plasmids,
    cosmids, chromosomes, phage, virus, and the like, which is capable of replication when
25  associated with proper control elements and which can transfer polynucleotide sequences
    between cells. Vectors contain a nucleotide sequence that permits the vector to replicate in a
    selected host cell. A number of vectors are available for expression and/or cloning, and
    include, but are not limited to, pBR322, pUC series, M13 series, pGEM series, and
    pBLUESCRIPT vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA and Promega, Madison, WI).
30           The subject invention also concerns oligonucleotide probes and primers, such as
    polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, that can hybridize to a coding or non-coding
    sequence of a polynucleotide of the present invention.          Oligonucleotide probes of the
    invention can be used in methods for detecting influenza virus nucleic acid sequences.

                                                   17
    Oligonucleotide primers of the invention can be used in PCR methods and other methods
    involving nucleic acid amplification. In a preferred embodiment, a probe or primer of the
    invention can hybridize to a polynucleotide of the invention under stringent conditions.
    Probes and primers of the invention can optionally comprise a detectable label or reporter
 5  molecule, such as fluorescent molecules, enzymes, radioactive moiety, and the like. Probes
    and primers of the invention can be of any suitable length for the method or assay in which
    they are being employed. Typically, probes and primers of the invention will be 10 to 500 or
    more nucleotides in length. Probes and primers that are 10 to 20, 21 to 30, 31 to 40, 41 to 50,
    51 to 60, 61 to 70, 71 to 80, 81 to 90, 91 to 100, or 101 or more nucleotides in length are
 0  contemplated within the scope of the invention. In one embodiment, probes and primers are
    any of 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30
    nucleotides in length.    Probes and primers of the invention can have complete (100%)
    nucleotide sequence identity with the polynucleotide sequence, or the sequence identity can
    be less than 100%. For example, sequence identity between a probe or primer and a sequence
 5  can be 99%, 98%, 97%, 96%, 95%, 90%, 85%, 80%, 75%,              7 0% or any other percentage
    sequence identity so long as the probe or primer can hybridize under stringent conditions to a
    nucleotide sequence of a polynucleotide of the invention. Exemplified probes and primers of
    the invention include those having the nucleotide sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NO: 35,
    SEQ ID NO: 36, SEQ ID NO: 37, SEQ ID NO: 38, SEQ ID NO: 39, SEQ ID NO: 40, SEQ
 '0 ID NO: 41, SEQ ID NO: 42, SEQ ID NO: 43, SEQ ID NO: 44, SEQ ID NO: 45, and SEQ ID
    NO: 46, or a functional fragment or variant of any of the SEQ ID NOs: 35-46.
            As used herein, the terms "nucleic acid," "polynucleotide," and "oligonucleotide"
    refer to a deoxyribonucleotide,     ribonucleotide,   or a mixed deoxyribonucleotide        and
    ribonucleotide polymer in either single- or double-stranded form, and unless otherwise
25  limited, would encompass known analogs of natural nucleotides that can function in a similar
    manner as naturally-occurring nucleotides.      Polynucleotide sequences include the DNA
    strand sequence that can be transcribed into RNA and the RNA strand that can be translated
    into protein.    The complementary sequence of any nucleic acid, polynucleotide, or
    oligonucleotide of the present invention is also contemplated within the scope of the
30  invention.   Polynucleotide sequences also include both full-length sequences as well as
    shorter sequences derived from the full-length sequences.          The subject invention also
    encompasses     those  polynucleotides    that  are   complementary     in  sequence    to   the

                                                    18
    polynucleotides disclosed herein. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention can be
    provided in purified or isolated form.
             Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a variety of different polynucleotide
    sequences can encode a polypeptide of the present invention. A table showing all possible
 5  triplet codons (and where U also stands for T) and the amino acid encoded by each codon is
    described in Lewin (1985). In addition, it is well within the skill of a person trained in the art
    to create alternative polynucleotide sequences encoding the same, or essentially the same,
    polypeptides    of the subject     invention.     These degenerate     variant and alternative
    polynucleotide sequences are within the scope of the subject invention. As used herein,
 0  references to "essentially the same" sequence refers to sequences which encode amino acid
    substitutions, deletions, additions, or insertions which do not materially alter the functional
    and/or immunogenic activity of the polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotides of the
    present invention.
             The subject invention also concerns variants of the polynucleotides of the present
 5  invention that encode polypeptides of the invention.         Variant sequences include those
    sequences wherein one or more nucleotides of the sequence have been substituted, deleted,
    and/or inserted. The nucleotides that can be substituted for natural nucleotides of DNA have
    a base moiety that can include, but is not limited to, inosine, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil,
    hypoxanthine, 1-methylguanine, 5-methylcytosine, and tritylated bases. The sugar moiety of
 '0 the nucleotide in a sequence can also be modified and includes, but is not limited to,
    arabinose, xylulose, and hexose. In addition, the adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and
    uracil bases of the nucleotides can be modified with acetyl, methyl, and/or thio groups.
    Sequences containing nucleotide substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions can be prepared
    and tested using standard techniques known in the art.
25           Substitution of amino acids other than those specifically exemplified or naturally
    present in a polypeptide of the invention are also contemplated within the scope of the
    present invention. For example, non-natural amino acids can be substituted for the amino
    acids of a polypeptide, so long as the polypeptide having the substituted amino acids retains
    substantially the same functional activity as the polypeptide in which amino acids have not
30  been substituted.     Examples of non-natural amino acids include, but are not limited to,
    ornithine, citrulline, hydroxyproline, homoserine, phenylglycine, taurine, iodotyrosine, 2,4
    diaminobutyric acid, a-amino isobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, 2-amino butyric acid, 7
    amino butyric acid, s-amino hexanoic acid, 6-amino hexanoic acid, 2-amino isobutyric acid,

                                                      19
    3-amino propionic acid, norleucine, norvaline, sarcosine, homocitrulline, cysteic acid, T
    butylglycine,    r-butylalanine, phenylglycine, cyclohexylalanine,       p-alanine, fluoro-amino
    acids, designer amino acids such as p-methyl amino acids, C-methyl amino acids, N-methyl
    amino acids, and amino acid analogues in general. Non-natural amino acids also include
 5  amino acids having derivatized side groups. Furthermore, any of the amino acids in the
    protein can be of the D (dextrorotary) form or L (levorotary) form. Allelic variants of a
    protein sequence of a polypeptide of the present invention are also encompassed within the
    scope of the invention.
            Amino acids can be generally categorized in the following classes:              non-polar,
 0  uncharged polar, basic, and acidic. Conservative substitutions whereby a polypeptide of the
    present invention having an amino acid of one class is replaced with another amino acid of
    the same class fall within the scope of the subject invention so long as the polypeptide having
    the substitution still retains substantially the same functional activity as the polypeptide that
    does not have the substitution. Polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide having one or more
 5  amino acid substitutions in the sequence are contemplated within the scope of the present
    invention. Table 11 below provides a listing of examples of amino acids belonging to each
    class. Single letter amino acid abbreviations are defined in Table 12.
            Fragments and variants of polypeptides of influenza virus of the present invention can
    be generated using standard methods known in the art and tested for the presence of function
 '0 or immunogenecity using standard techniques known in the art. For example, for testing
    fragments and/or variants of a neuraminidase polypeptide of the invention, enzymatic activity
    can be assayed. Thus, an ordinarily skilled artisan can readily prepare and test fragments and
    variants of a polypeptide of the invention and determine whether the fragment or variant
    retains activity relative to full-length or a non-variant polypeptide.
25          Polynucleotides and polypeptides contemplated within the scope of the subject
    invention can also be defined in terms of more particular identity and/or similarity ranges
    with those sequences of the invention specifically exemplified herein. The sequence identity
    will typically be greater than 60%, preferably greater than 75%, more preferably greater than
    80%, even more preferably greater than 90%, and can be greater than 95%. The identity
30  and/or similarity of a sequence can be 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62,
    63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87,
    88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% as compared to a sequence exemplified
    herein. Unless otherwise specified, as used herein percent sequence identity and/or similarity

                                                   20
    of two sequences can be determined using the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (1990),
    modified as in Karlin and Altschul (1993).        Such an algorithm is incorporated into the
    NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al. (1990).               BLAST searches can be
    performed with the NBLAST program, score         = 100, wordlength  = 12, to obtain sequences
 5  with the desired percent sequence identity. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison
    purposes, Gapped BLAST can be used as described in Altschul et al. (1997). When utilizing
    BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs
    (NBLAST and XBLAST) can be used. See NCBI/NIH website.
            The subject invention also contemplates those polynucleotide molecules having
 0  sequences which are sufficiently homologous with the polynucleotide sequences exemplified
    herein so as to permit hybridization with that sequence under standard stringent conditions
    and standard methods (Maniatis et al., 1982).      As used herein, "stringent" conditions for
    hybridization refers to conditions wherein hybridization is typically carried out overnight at
    20-25 C below the melting temperature (Tm) of the DNA hybrid in 6x SSPE, 5x Denhardt's
 5  solution, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml denatured DNA. The melting temperature, Tm, is described
    by the following formula (Beltz et al., 1983):
            Tm=81.5 C+16.6 Log[Na+]+0.41(%G+C)-0.61(% formamide)-600/length of duplex
    in base pairs.
            Washes are typically carried out as follows:
 10         (1)    Twice at room temperature for 15 minutes in 1x SSPE, 0.1% SDS (low
    stringency wash).
            (2)    Once at Tm-20 C for 15 minutes in 0.2x SSPE, 0.1% SDS (moderate
    stringency wash).
            The subject invention also concerns viral proteins and peptides encoded by the genes
25  of an influenza virus of the present invention.     In one embodiment, the viral protein is a
    mature HA protein. In a specific embodiment, the mature HA protein comprises one or more
    of the following: a serine at position 82; a leucine at position 221; a threonine at position
    327; and/or a threonine at position 482.     In an exemplified embodiment, the mature HA
    protein has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 33 or SEQ ID NO: 34, or a
30  functional and/or immunogenic fragment or variant of SEQ ID NO: 33 or SEQ ID NO: 34.
    In another embodiment, the viral protein is an NA protein, NS protein, PB protein, PA
    protein, or MA protein. Viral proteins and peptides of the invention can be used to generate

                                                    21
    antibodies that bind specifically to the protein or peptide. Viral proteins and peptides of the
    present invention can also be used as immunogens and in vaccine compositions.
             The subject invention also concerns compositions and methods for inducing an
    immune response against an influenza virus that is capable of infecting a susceptible host
 5  animal and causing respiratory disease.      The invention can be used to induce an immune
    response against an influenza virus of any subtype in a susceptible host animal. For example,
    the influenza virus can be an HA subtype of H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11,
    H12, H13, H14, H15, or H16, and an NA subtype of N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6, N7, N8, or N9.
    In one embodiment, the HA subtype is H3 or H5. In a further embodiment, the NA subtype
 0  is N7 or N8. In a specific embodiment, an immune response is induced against an influenza
    virus of subtype H3N8.      In one embodiment, the host animal is a canid. Canines include
    wild, zoo, and domestic canines, such as wolves, coyotes, and foxes. Canines also include
    dogs, particularly domestic dogs, such as, for example, pure-bred and/or mongrel companion
    dogs, show dogs, working dogs, herding dogs, hunting dogs, guard dogs, police dogs, racing
 5  dogs, and/or laboratory dogs. In a specific embodiment, the host animal is a domesticated
    dog, such as a greyhound. In one embodiment, an animal is administered an effective amount
    of an immunogenic composition of the present invention sufficient to induce an immune
    response against an influenza virus of the invention. The immune response can be a humoral
    and/or cellular immune response.       In a specific embodiment, the immune response is a
 '0 protective immune response that is capable of preventing or minimizing viral infection in the
    immunized host animal for some period of time subsequent to the immunization. Thus, the
    subject invention also concerns vaccine compositions and methods that can provide a
    vaccinated animal with a protective immune response to a virus of the present invention.
             As described herein, the vaccine or immunogenic compositions of the subject
25  invention may comprise cell-free whole virus, including attenuated or inactivated virus, or
    portions of the virus, including subvirion particles (including "split vaccine" wherein a vision
    is treated to remove some or all viral lipids), viral proteins (including individual proteins and
    macromolecular complexes of multiple proteins), polypeptides, and peptides, as well as virus
    infected cell lines, or a combination of any of these. Vaccine or immunogenic compositions
30  comprising virus-infected cell lines may comprise multiple cell lines, each infected with a
    different viral strain.
             In one embodiment of the invention, a canine may be immunized with one or more
    inactivated (i.e.,   killed) and/or live attenuated influenza virus vaccines or vaccines

                                                    22
    comprising one or a multiplicity of influenza virus antigens from one or more virus isolates.
    In one embodiment, the influenza virus is a canine influenza virus. In another embodiment,
    the influenza virus is an equine influenza virus that encodes or expresses a polypeptide that
    has at least about 90%, or at least about 95%, or at least about 96%, or 97%, or 98%, or 99%
 5  or more amino acid sequence identity with a canine influenza virus polypeptide.        In one
    embodiment, an influenza antigen used in a vaccine of the present invention has at least about
    96% sequence identity with an HA antigen and/or NA antigen of a canine influenza virus.
             An example of an inactivated vaccine is EQUICINE IITM, which has been marketed
    by Intervet Inc. (Millsboro, DE, USA) as a liquid vaccine.           EQUICINE IITM contains
 0  inactivated   A/Pennsylvania/63    influenza   virus ("A/Pa/63")    and A/equine/Kentucky/93
    influenza virus ("A/KY/93") with carbopol (i.e., HAVLOGEN@ (Intervet Inc.)).             More
    specifically, a dose of EQUICINE IITM contains:           inactivated A/Pa/63 at 106.a EIDsa,
    inactivated A/KY/93 at 1067 EID50 , 0.25% by volume carbopol, and sufficient PBS to create
    a total volume of 1 ml.
 5           Another example of an inactivated vaccine is equine flu virus A/equine/Ohio/03
    ("Ohio 03"). In some embodiments, such a vaccine contains CARBIGEN TM , which is an
    emulsified polymer-based adjuvant commercially available from MVP Laboratories, Inc.
    (Ralston, NE). In such vaccines, a dosage unit typically comprises at least about 250 HA
    units of the virus, from about 250 to about 12,500 HA units of the virus, or from about 1000
 '0 to about 6200 HA units of the virus. The recommended concentration of CARBIGENTM is
    from about 5 to about 30% (by mass).
             An example of a live attenuated vaccine is modified live equine/Kentucky/91
    ("A/KY/91") influenza in the form of a freeze-dried vaccine that may be reconstituted with
    water.    In some embodiments, this reconstitution is conducted using vaccine-grade water
25  sufficient to bring the vaccine dosage to a total volume of 1 ml. Aspects of such vaccines are
    discussed in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,436,408; 6,398,774; and 6,177,082, which are
    incorporated by reference in their entirety into this patent. When reconstituted, a dose of
    such a vaccine may, for example, contain A/KY/91 at 107.2 TCID50 per ml, 0.015 grams N-Z
    AMINE ASTM per ml, 0.0025 grams gelatin per ml, and 0.04 grams D lactose per ml. N-Z
30  AMINE ASTM is a refined source of amino acids and peptides produced by enzymatic
    hydrolysis of casein.    N-Z AMINE ASTM is marketed by Kerry Bio-Science (Norwich, NY,
    USA).

                                                    23
            In a preferred embodiment, the vaccine comprises an H3 influenza antigen having at
    least about 93% homology with Florida/43/2004 in HA coding sequences, such as, for
    example, the equine/New Market/79 strain. Preferred homology is at least about 96%, such
    as, for example, the equine/Alaska/1/91 and equine/Santiago/85 strains. In the examples that
 5  follow, the equine/Kentucky/ 91, equine-2/Kentucky/93,          equine- 1/Pennsylvania/63, and
    equine Ohio/03 influenza antigens were incorporated into vaccines. Preferred vaccines also
    include vaccines comprising equine/Wisconsin/03, equine/Kentucky/02, equine/Kentucky/93,
    and equine/New Market 2/93. In the examples that follow, H3N8 viruses were used. It is
    believed, however, that other H3 influenza viruses can be used in accordance with this
 0  invention.
            Live attenuated vaccines can be prepared by conventional means.            Such means
    generally include, for example, modifying pathogenic strains by in vitro passaging, cold
    adaptation, modifying the pathogenicity of the organism by genetic manipulation, preparation
    of chimeras, insertion of antigens into viral vectors, selecting non-virulent wild type strains,
 5  etc.
            In some embodiments, the live attenuated virus strain is derived by serial passage of
    the wild-type virus through cell culture, laboratory animals, non-host animals, or eggs. The
    accumulation of genetic mutation during such passage(s) typically leads to progressive loss of
    virulence of the organism to the original host.
 10         In some embodiments, the live attenuated virus strain is prepared by co-infection of
    permissible cells with an attenuated mutant virus and pathogenic virus. The desired resultant
    recombinant virus has the safety of the attenuated virus with genes coding for protective
    antigens from the pathogenic virus.
            In some embodiments, the live attenuated virus strain is prepared by cold adaptation.
25  A cold-adapted virus has an advantage of replicating only at the temperature found in upper
    respiratory tract. A method of generation of a cold-adapted equine influenza virus has been
    described in U.S. Patent No. 6,177,082. A desired resulting cold-adapted virus confers one or
    more of the following phenotypes: cold adaptation, temperature sensitivity, dominant
    interference, and/or attenuation.
30          In some embodiments, the live attenuated virus strain is prepared by molecular means,
    such as point mutation, deletion, or insertion to convert a pathogenic virus to a non
    pathogenic or less-pathogenic virus compared to the original virus, while preserving the
    protective properties of the original virus.

                                                     24
             In some embodiments, the live attenuated virus is prepared by cloning the candidate
    of genes of protective antigens into a genome of a non-pathogenic or less-pathogenic virus or
    other organism.
             Inactivated (i.e., "killed") virus vaccines may be prepared by inactivating the virus
 5  using conventional methods. Typically, such vaccines include excipients that may enhance
    an immune response, as well as other excipients that are conventionally used in vaccines. For
    example,     in the examples that follow, EQUICINE IITM comprises HAVLOGEN@.
    Inactivation of the virus can be accomplished by treating the virus with inactivation
    chemicals (e.g., formalin, beta propiolactone ("BPL"), bromoethylamine ("BEA"), and binary
 0  ethylenimine ("BEI")) or by non-chemical methods (e.g., heat, freeze/thaw, or sonication) to
    disable the replication capacity of the virus.
             In the examples that follow, equine/Ohio/03 was used as a challenge virus. It is
    known to have about 99% homology with Florida/43/04 isolates, and has been shown to
    induce symptoms of infection and seroconversion in dogs.            Example 18 illustrates the
 5  efficacy of equine influenza vaccine in dogs, showing hemagglutination inhibition (or "HI" or
    "HAI") titers in dogs vaccinated with inactivated Ohio 03 antigen in a vaccine composition
    comprising     CARBIGEN TM        adjuvant.    Table 29 shows titers pre-vaccination,     post
    vaccination, and post-second vaccination, as well as post-challenge. The results indicate HI
    titers at each stage post-vaccination for the vaccinated dogs, with little or no increase for
 .0 controls. Table 30 illustrates the clinical signs, virus isolation,
    and histopathology results from the same study. Although challenged animals did not show
    clinical signs, virus shedding, or positive histopathology, the positive HI titers (Table 29)
    indicate significant antibody titers in immunized animals.
             It should be noted that other H3 influenza virus antigen vaccines are encompassed by
25  this invention as well. Those described in this specification and the following examples are
    provided to illustrate the invention and its preferred embodiments, and not to limit the scope
    of the invention claimed.
             It should further be noted that influenza antigens other than H3 influenza virus
    antigens may be used in accordance with this invention. Such antigens include, for example,
30  those from equine/PA/63, which is an equine Al subtype (H7N7). It is contemplated that one
    or more of such antigens may be used with or without one or more H3 influenza antigens.
             In general, the vaccine is administered in a therapeutically effective amount.      A
    "therapeutically effective amount" is an amount sufficient to induce a protective response in

                                                     25
    the canine patient against the target virus. Typically, a dosage is "therapeutically effective" if
    it prevents, reduces the risk of, delays the onset of, reduces the spread of, ameliorates,
    suppresses, or eradicates the influenza or one or more (typically two or more) of its
    symptoms.      Typical influenza symptoms include, for example, fever (for dogs, typically
 5  >103.0 0 F; >39.4 0 C), cough, sneezing, histopathological lesions, ocular discharge, nasal
    discharge, vomiting, diarrhea, depression, weight loss, gagging, hemoptysis, and/or audible
    rales. Other often more severe symptoms may include, for example, hemorrhage in the lungs,
    mediastanum,      or   pleural   cavity;   tracheitis;  bronchitis;   bronchiolitis;   supportive
    bronchopneumonia; and/or infiltration of the epithelial lining and airway lumens of the lungs
 0  with neutrophils and/or macrophages.
             The vaccine may be administered as part of a combination therapy, i.e., a therapy that
    includes, in addition to the vaccine itself, administering one or more additional active agents,
    adjuvants, therapies, etc. In that instance, it should be recognized the amount of vaccine that
    constitutes a "therapeutically effective" amount may be less than the amount of vaccine that
 5  would constitute a "therapeutically effective" amount if the vaccine were to be administered
    alone. Other therapies may include those known in the art, such as, for example, anti-viral
    medications,    analgesics,   fever-reducing    medications,   expectorants,   anti-inflammation
    medications, antihistamines, antibiotics to treat bacterial infection that results from the
    influenza virus infection, rest, and/or administration of fluids.    In some embodiments, the
 '0 vaccine of this invention is administered in combination with a bordetella vaccine,
    adenovirus vaccine, and/or parainfluenza virus vaccine.
             In some embodiments, for example, a typical dose for a live attenuated vaccine is at
    least about 103 pfu/canine, and more typically from about 103 to about 109 pfu/canine. In this
    patent, "pfu" means "plaque forming units". In some embodiments, a typical dose for a live
25  attenuated vaccine is at least about 103 TCID 50/canine, and more typically from about 103 to
    about 109 TCID 5 0/canine. In some embodiments, a typical dose for a live attenuated vaccine
    is at least about 103 EID 5 0/canine, and more typically from about 103 to about 109
    EID 5 0/canine. In some embodiments, a typical dose for a killed vaccine is at least about 40
    HA units, typically from about 40 to about 10,000 HA units, and more typically from about
30  500 to about 6200 HA units. In some embodiments, the dose is from about 6100 to about
    6200 HA units.
             In some preferred embodiments, the vaccine comprises a live attenuated vaccine at a
    concentration which is at least about 100.5 pfu/canine greater than the immunogenicity level.

                                                    26
    In some preferred embodiments, the vaccine comprises a live attenuated vaccine at a
    concentration which is at least about 100.5 TCID 5 0/canine greater than the immunogenicity
    level. In some preferred embodiments, the vaccine comprises a live attenuated vaccine at a
    concentration which is at least about 1005 EID 50/canine greater than the immunogenicity
 5  level.
             The immunogenicity level may be determined experimentally by challenge dose
    titration study techniques generally known in the art.        Such techniques typically include
    vaccinating a number of canines with the vaccine at different dosages, and then challenging
    the canines with the virulent virus to determine the minimum protective dose.
 0           Factors affecting the preferred dosage regimen may include, for example, the type
    (e.g., species and breed), age, weight, sex, diet, activity, lung size, and condition of the
    subject; the route of administration; the efficacy, safety, and duration-of-immunity profiles of
    the particular vaccine used; whether a delivery system is used; and whether the vaccine is
    administered as part of a drug and/or vaccine combination.            Thus, the dosage actually
 5  employed can vary for specific animals, and, therefore, can deviate from the typical dosages
    set forth above. Determining such dosage adjustments is generally within the skill of those in
    the art using conventional means. It should further be noted that live attenuated viruses are
    generally self-propagating; thus, the specific amount of such a virus administered is not
    necessarily critical.
 10          It is contemplated that the vaccine may be administered to the canine patient a single
    time; or, alternatively, two or more times over days, weeks, months, or years.         In some
    embodiments, the vaccine is administered at least two times. In some such embodiments, for
    example, the vaccine is administered twice, with the second dose (e.g., the booster) being
    administered at least about 2 weeks after the first. In some embodiments, the vaccine is
25  administered twice, with the second dose being administered no greater than 8 weeks after
    the first. In some embodiments, the second dose is administered at from about 2 weeks to
    about 4 years after the first dose, from about 2 to about 8 weeks after the first dose, or from
    about 3 to about 4 weeks after the first dose.       In some embodiments, the second dose is
    administered about 4 weeks after the first dose. In the above embodiments, the first and
30  subsequent dosages may vary, such as, for example, in amount and/or form. Often, however,
    the dosages are the same as to amount and form. When only a single dose is administered,
    the amount of vaccine in that dose alone generally comprises a therapeutically effective

                                                     27
    amount of the vaccine. When, however, more than one dose is administered, the amounts of
    vaccine in those doses together may constitute a therapeutically effective amount.
            In some embodiments, the vaccine is administered before the canine recipient is
    infected with influenza.        In such embodiments, the vaccine may, for example, be
 5  administered to prevent, reduce the risk of, or delay the onset of influenza or one or more
    (typically two or more) influenza symptoms.
            In some embodiments, the vaccine is administered after the canine recipient is
    infected with influenza.    In such embodiments, the vaccine may, for example, ameliorate,
    suppress, or eradicate the influenza or one or more (typically two or more) influenza
 0  symptoms.
            The preferred composition of the vaccine depends on, for example, whether the
    vaccine is an inactivated vaccine, live attenuated vaccine, or both. It also depends on the
    method of administration of the vaccine.      It is contemplated that the vaccine will comprise
    one or more conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, other immune
 5  response enhancers, and/or vehicles (collectively referred to as "excipients"). Such excipients
    are generally selected to be compatible with the active ingredient(s) in the vaccine. Use of
    excipients is generally known to those skilled in the art.
            The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" is used adjectivally to mean that the modified
    noun is appropriate for use in a pharmaceutical product.       When it is used, for example, to
 '0 describe an excipient in a pharmaceutical vaccine, it characterizes the excipient as being
    compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not disadvantageously
    deleterious to the intended recipient canine.
            The vaccines may be administered by conventional means, including, for example,
    mucosal administration, (such as intranasal, oral, intratracheal, and ocular), and parenteral
25  administration. Mucosal administration is often particularly advantageous for live attenuated
    vaccines.    Parenteral administration is often particularly advantageous for inactivated
    vaccines.
            Mucosal vaccines may be, for example, liquid dosage forms, such as pharmaceutically
    acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. Excipients suitable for such
30  vaccines include, for example, inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, water, saline,
    dextrose, glycerol, lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids,
    cellulose alkyl esters, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and
    calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, gelatin, acacia gum, sodium alginate,

                                                     28
    polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or polyvinyl alcohol.           Excipients also can comprise various
    wetting, emulsifying, suspending, flavoring (e.g., sweetening), and/or perfuming agents.
            Oral mucosal vaccines also may, for example, be tableted or encapsulated for
    convenient administration.       Such capsules or tablets can contain a controlled-release
 5  formulation. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms also can comprise
    buffering agents, such as sodium citrate, or magnesium or calcium carbonate or bicarbonate.
    Tablets and pills additionally can be prepared with enteric coatings.
            It is contemplated that the vaccine may be administered via the canine patient's
    drinking water and/or food. It is further contemplated that the vaccine may be administered
 0  in the form of a treat or toy.
             "Parenteral administration" includes subcutaneous injections, submucosal injections,
    intravenous    injections, intramuscular    injections, intrasternal injections,   transcutaneous
    injections, and infusion. Injectable preparations (e.g., sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous
    suspensions) can be formulated according to the known art using suitable excipients, such as
 5  vehicles, solvents, dispersing, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and/or suspending agents.
    These typically include, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, corn oil,
    cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, 1,3-butanediol, Ringer's
    solution, isotonic sodium chloride solution, bland fixed oils (e.g., synthetic mono- or
    diglycerides), fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid), dimethyl acetamide, surfactants (e.g., ionic and
 .0 non-ionic detergents), propylene glycol, and/or polyethylene glycols. Excipients also may
    include small amounts of other auxiliary substances, such as pH buffering agents.
            The vaccine may include one or more excipients that enhance a canine patient's
    immune response (which may include an antibody response, cellular response, or both),
    thereby increasing the effectiveness of the vaccine. Use of such excipients (or "adjuvants")
25  may be particularly beneficial when using an inactivated vaccine. The adjuvant(s) may be a
    substance that has a direct (e.g., cytokine or Bacill6 Calmette-Guerin ("BCG")) or indirect
    effect (liposomes) on cells of the canine patient's immune system. Examples of often suitable
    adjuvants include oils (e.g., mineral oils), metallic salts (e.g., aluminum hydroxide or
    aluminum phosphate), bacterial        components (e.g.,      bacterial liposaccharides,  Freund's
30  adjuvants, and/or MDP), plant components (e.g., Quil A), and/or one or more substances that
    have a carrier effect (e.g., bentonite, latex particles, liposomes, and/or Quil A, ISCOM).     As
    noted above, adjuvants also include, for example, CARBIGEN           M and carbopol. It should be

                                                  29
    recognized that this invention encompasses both vaccines that comprise an adjuvant(s), as
    well as vaccines that do not comprise any adjuvant.
            It is contemplated that the vaccine may be freeze-dried (or otherwise reduced in liquid
    volume) for storage, and then reconstituted in a liquid before or at the time of administration.
 5  Such reconstitution may be achieved using, for example, vaccine-grade water.
            The present invention further comprises kits that are suitable for use in performing the
    methods described above. The kit comprises a dosage form comprising a vaccine described
    above. The kit also comprises at least one additional component, and, typically, instructions
    for using the vaccine with the additional component(s). The additional component(s) may,
 0  for example, be one or more additional ingredients (such as, for example, one or more of the
    excipients discussed above, food, and/or a treat) that can be mixed with the vaccine before or
    during administration.     The additional component(s) may alternatively (or additionally)
    comprise one or more apparatuses for administering the vaccine to the canine patient. Such
    an apparatus may be, for example, a syringe, inhaler, nebulizer, pipette, forceps, or any
 5  medically acceptable delivery vehicle. In some embodiments, the apparatus is suitable for
    subcutaneous administration of the vaccine. In some embodiments, the apparatus is suitable
    for intranasal administration of the vaccine.
            Other excipients and modes of administration known in the pharmaceutical or
    biologics arts also may be used.
 10         The vaccine or immunogenic compositions of the subject invention also encompass
    recombinant viral vector-based constructs that may comprise, for example, genes encoding
    HA protein, NA protein, nucleoprotein, polymerase basic protein, polymerase acidic protein,
    and/or matrix protein of an influenza virus of the present invention. Any suitable viral vector
    that can be used to prepare a recombinant vector/virus construct is contemplated for use with
25  the subject invention.      For example, viral vectors derived from adenovirus, avipox,
    herpesvirus, vaccinia, canarypox, entomopox, swinepox, West Nile virus and others known in
    the art can be used with the compositions and methods of the present invention.
    Recombinant polynucleotide vectors that encode and express components can be constructed
    using standard genetic engineering techniques known in the art.         In addition, the various
30  vaccine compositions described herein can be used separately and in combination with each
    other. For example, primary immunizations of an animal may use recombinant vector-based
    constructs, having single or multiple strain components, followed by secondary boosts with
    vaccine compositions comprising inactivated virus or inactivated virus-infected cell lines.

                                                     30
    Other immunization protocols with the vaccine compositions of the invention are apparent to
    persons skilled in the art and are contemplated within the scope of the present invention.
            The subject invention also concerns reassortant virus comprising at least one gene or
    genomic segment of an influenza virus of the present invention and the remainder of viral
 5  genes or genomic segments from a different influenza virus of the invention or from an
    influenza virus other than a virus of the present invention. Reassortant virus can be produced
    by genetic reassortant of nucleic acid of a donor influenza virus of the present invention with
    nucleic acid of a recipient influenza virus and then selecting for reassortant virus that
    comprises the nucleic acid of the donor virus. Methods to produce and isolate reassortant
 0  virus are well known in the art (Fields et al., 1996). In one embodiment, a reassortant virus
    of the invention comprises genes or genomic segments of a human, avian, swine, or equine
    influenza virus. A reassortant virus of the present invention can include any combination of
    nucleic acid from donor and recipient influenza virus so long as the reassortant virus
    comprises at least one gene or genomic segment from a donor influenza virus of the present
 5  invention. In one embodiment, a recipient influenza virus can be an equine influenza virus.
            Natural, recombinant or synthetic polypeptides of viral proteins, and peptide
    fragments thereof, can also be used as vaccine compositions according to the subject
    methods.    In one embodiment, a vaccine composition comprises a polynucleotide or a
    polypeptide of a canine influenza virus.          In one embodiment, a vaccine composition
 '0 comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in
    any of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 48, 50,
    52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, or 78, or a functional and/or immunogenic
    fragment or variant thereof. In a specific embodiment, the polynucleotide encoding the
    amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28,
25  30, 32, 33, 34, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, or 78, comprises the
    nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27,
    29, 31, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, or 77, respectively, or a
    sequence encoding a functional and/or immunogenic fragment or variant of any of SEQ ID
    NOs: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60,
30  62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, or 78. In a further specific embodiment, a polynucleotide of
    the invention can comprise: Nucleotides 1-2271 of SEQ ID NO: 3; Nucleotides 1-2148 of
    SEQ ID NO: 5; Nucleotides 1-657 of SEQ ID NO: 7; Nucleotides 1-1494 of SEQ ID NO: 9;
    Nucleotides 1-1410 of SEQ ID NO: 11; Nucleotides 1-756 of SEQ ID NO: 13; Nucleotides

 0  SEQ ID NO: 73; Nucleotides 1-756 of SEQ ID NO: 75; and Nucleotides 1-1695 of SEQ ID
    NO: 77. In another embodiment, a vaccine composition comprises a polypeptide having the
    amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24,
    26, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, or 78, or a
    functional and/or immunogenic fragment or variant thereof. In a further embodiment, a
 5  vaccine composition comprises a polynucleotide or a polypeptide of an equine influenza virus
    wherein the polynucleotide or polypeptide has at least about 90%, or at least about 95%, or at
    least about 96%, or 97%, or 98%, or 99% or more sequence identity with a canine influenza
    polynucleotide or polypeptide. In one embodiment, viral polypeptides derived from multiple
    strains can be combined in a vaccine composition and are used to vaccinate a host animal.
 '0 For example, polypeptides based on the viral HA protein from at least two different strains of
    influenza virus of the invention can be combined in the vaccine. The polypeptides may be
    homologous to one strain or may comprise Ahybrid@ or Achimeric@ polypeptides whose
    amino acid sequence is derived from joining or linking polypeptides from at least two distinct
    strains. Procedures for preparing viral polypeptides are well known in the art. For example,
25  viral polypeptides and peptides can be synthesized using solid-phase synthesis methods
    (Merrifield, 1963). Viral polypeptides and peptides can also be produced using recombinant
    DNA techniques wherein a polynucleotide molecule encoding an viral protein or peptide is
    expressed in a host cell, such as bacteria, yeast, or mammalian cell lines, and the expressed
    protein purified using standard techniques of the art.
30          Vaccine compositions of the present invention also include naked nucleic acid
    compositions.    In one embodiment, a nucleic acid may comprise a nucleotide sequence
    encoding an HA and/or an NA protein of an influenza virus of the present invention.
    Methods for nucleic acid vaccination are known in the art and are described, for example, in

                                                     32
    U.S. Patent Nos. 6,063,385 and 6,472,375. The nucleic acid can be in the form of a plasmid
    or a gene expression cassette. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid is provided encapsulated
    in a liposome which is administered to an animal.
             Vaccine compositions and immunogens, such as polypeptides and nucleic acids, that
 5  can be used in accordance           with the present invention can be provided with a
    pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier or diluent. Compounds and compositions useful in the
    subject   invention   can be     formulated    according   to  known methods      for preparing
    pharmaceutically useful compositions.       Formulations are described in detail in a number of
    sources which are well known and readily available to those skilled in the art. For example,
 0  Remington's Pharmaceutical Science by E.W. Martin, Easton Pennsylvania,                    Mack
    Publishing Company, 19th ed., 1995, describes formulations which can be used in connection
    with the subject invention.     In general, the compositions of the subject invention will be
    formulated such that an effective amount of an immunogen is combined with a suitable
    carrier in order to facilitate effective administration of the composition. The compositions
 5  used in the present methods can also be in a variety of forms. These include, for example,
    solid, semi-solid, and liquid dosage forms, such as tablets, pills, powders, liquid solutions or
    suspension, suppositories, injectable and infusible solutions, and sprays. The preferred form
    depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application.                 The
    compositions also preferably include conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and
 '0 diluents which are known to those skilled in the art. Examples of carriers or diluents for use
    with the subject peptidomimetics include, but are not limited to, water, saline, oils including
    mineral oil, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, gelatin, cyclodextrans,         magnesium stearate,
    dextrose, cellulose, sugars, calcium carbonate, glycerol, alumina, starch, and equivalent
    carriers and diluents, or mixtures of any of these. Formulations of an immunogen of the
25  invention can also comprise suspension agents, protectants, lubricants, buffers, preservatives,
    and stabilizers. To provide for the administration of such dosages for the desired therapeutic
    treatment, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will advantageously comprise
    between about 0.1% and 45%, and especially, 1 and 15% by weight of the immunogen or
    immunogens based on the weight of the total composition including carrier or diluent.
30           The vaccine and immunogenic compositions of the subject invention can be prepared
    by procedures well known in the art. For example, the vaccine or immunogens are typically
    prepared as injectables, e.g., liquid solutions or suspensions. The vaccine or immunogens are
    administered in a manner that is compatible with dosage formulation, and in such amount as

                                                   33
    will be therapeutically effective and immunogenic in the recipient. The optimal dosages and
    administration patterns for a particular vaccine or immunogens formulation can be readily
    determined by a person skilled in the art.
            Peptides and/or polypeptides of the present invention can also be provided in the form
 5  of a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) construct. The preparation of MAP constructs has
    been described in Tam (1988). MAP constructs utilize a core matrix of lysine residues onto
    which multiple copies of an immunogen are synthesized (Posnett et al., 1988). Multiple
    MAP constructs, each containing the same or different immunogens, can be prepared and
    administered in a vaccine composition in accordance with methods of the present invention.
 0  In one embodiment, a MAP construct is provided with and/or administered with one or more
    adjuvants. Influenza polypeptides of the invention can also be produced and administered as
    macromolecular protein structures comprising one or more polypeptides.         Published U.S.
    Patent Application US2005/0009008 describes methods for producing virus-like particles as a
    vaccine for influenza virus.
 5          According to the methods of the subject invention, the vaccine and immunogenic
    compositions described herein are administered to susceptible hosts, typically canids, and
    more typically domesticated dogs, in an effective amount and manner to induce protective
    immunity against subsequent challenge or infection of the host by virus. In one embodiment,
    the host animal is a canid. Canines include wild, zoo, and domestic canines, such as wolves,
 '0 coyotes, and foxes.    Canines also include dogs, particularly domestic dogs, such as, for
    example, pure-bred and/or mongrel companion dogs, show dogs, working dogs, herding
    dogs, hunting dogs, guard dogs, police dogs, racing dogs, and/or laboratory dogs.          In a
    specific embodiment, the host animal is a domesticated dog, such as a greyhound.            The
    vaccines or immunogens are typically administered parenterally, by injection, for example,
25  either subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, or intramuscularly.       Other suitable modes of
    administration include oral or nasal administration. Usually, the vaccines or immunogens are
    administered to an animal at least two times, with an interval of one or more weeks between
    each administration. However, other regimens for the initial and booster administrations of
    the vaccine or immunogens are contemplated, and may depend on the judgment of the
30  practitioner and the particular host animal being treated.
            Virus and virus-infected cells in a vaccine formulation may be inactivated or
    attenuated using methods known in the art. For example, whole virus and infected cells can
    be inactivated or attenuated by exposure to paraformaldehyde, formalin, beta propiolactone

                                                    34
    (BPL), bromoethylamine (BEA), binary ethylenimine (BEI), phenol, UV light, elevated
    temperature, freeze thawing, sonication (including ultrasonication), and the like. The amount
    of cell-free whole virus in a vaccine dose can be in the range from about 0.1 mg to about 5
    mg, and more usually being from about 0.2 mg to about 2 mg.            The dosage for vaccine
 5  formulations comprising virus-infected cell lines will usually contain from about 106 to about
    108 cells per dose, and more usually from about 5 x 106 to about 7.5 x 107 cells per dose. The
    amount of protein or peptide immunogen in a dose for an animal can vary from about 0.1 ptg
    to 10000 ptg, or about I pg to 5000 pg, or about 10 pg to 1000 pg, or about 25 pg to 750 gg,
    or about 50 pg to 500 pg, or 100 [tg to 250 pg, depending upon the size, age, etc., of the
 0  animal receiving the dose.
            An immunogenic or vaccine composition of the invention, such as virus or virus
    infected cells or viral proteins or peptides, can be combined with an adjuvant, typically just
    prior to administration. Adjuvants contemplated for use in the vaccine formulations include
    threonyl muramyl dipeptide (MDP) (Byars et al., 1987), saponin, Cornebacteriumparvum,
 5  Freund's complete and Fruend's incomplete adjuvants, aluminum, or a mixture of any of
    these. A variety of other adjuvants suitable for use with the methods and vaccines of the
    subject invention, such as alum, are well known in the art and are contemplated for use with
    the subject invention.
            The subject invention also concerns antibodies that bind specifically to a protein or a
 '0 peptide of the present invention. Antibodies of the subject invention include monoclonal and
    polyclonal antibody compositions.      Preferably, the antibodies of the subject invention are
    monoclonal antibodies.       Whole antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof are
    contemplated in the present invention. Thus, for example, suitable antigen binding fragments
    include Fab 2, Fab and Fv antibody fragments. Antibodies of the invention can be labeled
25  with a detectable moiety, such as a fluorescent molecule (e.g., fluorescein or an enzyme).
            The subject invention also concerns methods and compositions for detection and
    identification of an influenza virus of the invention and for diagnosis of infection of an
    animal with an influenza virus of the present invention. The methods of the invention include
    detection of the presence of canine influenza, in a biological sample from an animal. The
30  detection of canine influenza in a sample, is useful to diagnose canine influenza in an animal.
    In turn, this information can provide the ability to determine the prognosis of an animal based
    on distinguishing levels of canine influenza present over time, and can assist in selection of
    therapeutic agents and treatments for the animal, and assist in monitoring therapy.        The

                                                     35
    method also provides the ability to establish the absence of canine influenza in an animal
    tested.
             The ability to detect canine influenza in an animal permits assessment of outbreaks of
    canine influenza in different geographical locations.       This information also permits early
 5  detection so that infected animals can be isolated, to limit the spread of disease, and allows
    early intervention for treatment options. In addition, having this information available can
    provide direction to medical personnel for preparing to treat large numbers of ill animals,
    including assembling medical supplies, and, if available, vaccines.
             In one embodiment, a method of the present invention involves the collection of a
 0  biological sample from a test animal, such as a canine. The biological sample may be any
    biological material, including, cells, tissue, hair, whole blood, serum, plasma, nipple aspirate,
    lung lavage, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, sweat and tears.
             The animal test sample may come from an animal suspected of having canine
    influenza virus, whether or not the animal exhibits symptoms of the disease. Control samples
 5  can also be provided or collected from animals known to be free of canine influenza.
    Additional controls may be provided, e.g., to reduce false positive and false negative results,
    and verify that the reagents in the assay are actively detecting canine influenza A virus.
             In addition to detecting the presence or absence of canine influenza in a biological
    sample, the methods of detection used in the invention can detect mutations in canine
 '0 influenza virus, such as changes in nucleic acid sequence, that may result from the
    environment, drug treatment, genetic manipulations or mutations, injury, change in diet,
    aging, or any other characteristic(s) of an animal. Mutations may also cause canine influenza
    A to become resistant to a drug that was formerly effective, or to enable the virus to infect
    and propagate in a different species of animal, or human. For example, avian influenza A
25  virus has been shown to infect other animals and humans.
             In one embodiment for detecting an influenza virus in an animal, diagnosis is
    facilitated by the collection of high-quality specimens, their rapid transport to a testing
    facility, and appropriate storage, before laboratory testing.         Virus is best detected in
    specimens containing infected cells and secretions. In one embodiment, specimens for the
30  direct detection of viral antigens and/or for nucleic acids and/or virus isolation in cell cultures
    are taken during the first 3 days after onset of clinical symptoms. A number of types of
    specimens are suitable to diagnose virus infections of the upper respiratory tract, including,
    but not limited to, nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasal wash and

                                                    36
    throat swabs. In addition to swabs, samples of tissue or serum may be taken, and invasive
    procedures can also be performed.
             In one embodiment, respiratory specimens are collected and transported in 1-5 ml of
    virus transport media. A number of media that are satisfactory for the recovery of a wide
 5  variety of viruses are commercially available.       Clinical specimens are added to transport
    medium. Nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs can also be transported in the virus transport
    medium. One example of a transport medium is 10 gm of veal infusion broth and 2 gm of
    bovine albumin fraction V, added to sterile distilled water to 400 m. Antibiotics such as 0.8
    ml gentamicin sulfate solution (50 mg/ml) and 3.2 ml amphotericin B (250 pg/ml) can also
 0  be added. The medium is preferably sterilized by filtration. Nasal washes, such as sterile
    saline (0.85% NaCl), can also be used to collect specimens of respiratory viruses.
             In one embodiment, sera is collected in an amount of from 1-5 ml of whole blood
    from an acute-phase animal, soon after the onset of clinical symptoms, and preferably not
    later than 7 days. A convalescent-phase serum specimen can also be collected, for example
 5  at about 14 days after onset of symptoms.        Serum specimens can be useful for detecting
    antibodies against respiratory viruses in a neutralization test.
             In some instances, samples may be collected from individual animals over a period of
    time (e.g., once a day, once a week, once a month, biannually or annually). Obtaining
    numerous samples from an individual animal, over a period of time, can be used to verify
 '0 results from earlier detections, and/or to identify response or resistance to a specific
    treatment, e.g., a selected therapeutic drug.
             The methods of the present invention can be used to detect the presence of one or
    more pathological agents in a test sample from an animal, and the level of each pathological
    agent.    Any method for detecting the pathological agent can be used, including, but not
25  limited to, antibody assays including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs),
    indirect    fluorescent   antibody    (IFA)   tests,   hemagglutinating,  and   inhibition  of
    hemagglutination (HI) assays, and Western Blot. Known cell-culture methods can also be
    used. Positive cultures can be further identified using immunofluorescence of cell cultures or
    HI assay of the cell culture medium (supernatant).
30           In addition, methods for detecting nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) or protein can be used.
    Such methods include, but are not limited to, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and reverse
    transcriptase (RT) PCR tests and real time tests, and quantitative nuclease protection assays.

                                                   37
    There are commercially available test kits available to perform these assays.      For example,
    QIAGEN (Valencia, CA) sells a one step RT-PCR kit, and viral RNA extraction kit.
            In one embodiment, the method utilizes an antibody specific for a virus or viral
    protein of the invention. In a specific embodiment, an antibody specific for an HA protein of
 5  a virus of the invention is utilized. In another embodiment, an antibody specific for an NP
    protein of a virus of the invention is used. A suitable sample, such as from the nasal or
    nasopharyngeal region, is obtained from an animal and virus or viral protein is isolated
    therefrom. The viral components are then screened for binding of an antibody specific to a
    protein, such as HA or NP, of a virus of the invention. In another embodiment, a serum
 0  sample (or other antibody containing sample) is obtained from an animal and the serum
    screened for the presence of antibody that binds to a protein of a virus of the invention. For
    example, an ELISA assay can be performed where the plate walls have HA and/or NP
    protein, or a peptide fragment thereof, bound to the wall. The plate wall is then contacted
    with serum or antibody from a test animal. The presence of antibody in the animal that binds
 5  specifically to the HA and/or NP protein is indicative that the test animal is infected or has
    been infected with an influenza virus of the present invention.
            In one embodiment, the presence of a pathological agent is detected by determining
    the presence or absence of antibodies against the agent, in a biological sample. It can take
    some time (e.g. months) after an animal is infected before antibodies can be detected in a
 '0 blood test. Once formed, antibodies usually persist for many years, even after successful
    treatment of the disease. Finding antibodies to canine influenza A may not indicate whether
    the infection was recent, or sometime in the past.
            Antibody testing can also be done on fluid(s).      Antibody assays include enzyme
    linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assays, and
25  Western Blot. Preferably, antibody testing is done using multiple assays, for example ELISA
    or IFA followed by Western blot. Antibody assays can be done in a two-step process, using
    either an ELISA or IFA assay, followed by a Western blot assay. ELISA is considered a
    more reliable and accurate assay than IFA, but IFA may be used if ELISA is not available.
    The Western blot test (which is a more specific test) can also be done in all animals,
30  particularly those that have tested positive or borderline positive (equivocal) in an ELISA or
    IFA assay.
            Other antibody-based tests that can be used for detection of influenza virus include
    hemagglutination inhibition assays. Hemagglutination activity can be detected in a biological

                                                   38
    sample from an animal, using chicken or turkey red blood cells as described (Burleson et al.,
    1992) and Kendal et al., 1982). In one embodiment, an influenza or an HA protein or peptide
    of the invention is contacted with a test sample containing serum or antibody. Red blood
    cells (RBC) from an animal, such as a bird, are then added. If antibody to HA is present, then
 5  the RBC will not agglutinate. If antibody to HA is not present, the RBC will agglutinate in
    the presence of HA. Variations and modifications to standard hemagglutination inhibition
    assays are known in the art and contemplated within the scope of the present invention.
            Infection of an animal can also be determined by isolation of the virus from a sample,
    such as a nasal or nasopharyngeal swab. Viral isolation can be performed using standard
 0  methods, including cell culture and egg inoculation.
            In a further embodiment, a nucleic acid-based assay can be used for detection of a
    virus of the present invention. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid sample is obtained from an
    animal and the nucleic acid subjected to PCR using primers that will generate an
    amplification product if the nucleic acid contains a sequence specific to an influenza virus of
 5  the present invention. In a specific embodiment, RT-PCR is used in an assay for the subject
    virus. In an exemplified embodiment, real-time RT-PCR is used to assay for an influenza
    virus of the invention. PCR, RT-PCR and real-time PCR methods are known in the art and
    have been described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,202; 4,683,195; 4,800,159; 4,965,188;
    5,994,056; 6,814,934; and in Saiki et al. (1985); Sambrook et al. (1989); Lee et al. (1993);
 '0 and Livak et al. (1995). In one embodiment, the PCR assay uses oligonucleotides specific for
    an influenza matrix (MA) gene and/or HA gene.          The amplification product can also be
    sequenced to determine if the product has a sequence of an influenza virus of the present
    invention. Other nucleic acid-based assays can be used for detection and diagnosis of viral
    infection by a virus of the invention and such assays are contemplated within the scope of the
25  present invention. In one embodiment, a sample containing a nucleic acid is subjected to a
    PCR-based amplification using forward and reverse primers where the primers are specific
    for a viral polynucleotide or gene sequence. If the nucleic acid in the sample is RNA, then
    RT-PCR can be performed.         For real-time PCR, a detectable probe is utilized with the
    primers.
30          Primer sets specific for the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of many of the circulating
    influenza viruses are known, and are continually being developed.         The influenza virus
    genome is single-stranded RNA, and a DNA copy (cDNA) must be made using a reverse
    transcriptase (RT) polymerase. The amplification of the RNA genome, for example using

                                                     39
    RT-PCR, requires a pair of oligonucleotide primers, typically designed on the basis of the
    known HA sequence of influenza A subtypes and of neuraminadase (NM)-1. The primers
    can be selected such that they will specifically amplify RNA of only one virus subtype.
    DNAs generated by using subtype-specific primers can be further analyzed by molecular
 5  genetic techniques such as sequencing. The test is preferably run with a positive control, or
    products are confirmed by sequencing and comparison with known sequences. The absence
    of the target PCR products (i.e, a "negative" result) may not rule out the presence of the virus.
    Results can then be made available within a few hours from either clinical swabs or infected
    cell cultures. PCR and RT-PCR tests for influenza A virus are described by Fouchier et al.,
 0  2000 and Maertzdorf et al., 2004.
            The subject invention also concerns methods for screening for compounds or drugs
    that have antiviral activity against a virus of the present invention. In one embodiment, cells
    infected with a virus of the invention are contacted with a test compound or drug.           The
    amount of virus or viral activity following contact is then determined. Those compounds or
 5  drugs that exhibit antiviral activity can be selected for further evaluation.
            The subject invention also concerns isolated cells infected with an influenza virus of
    the present invention. In one embodiment, the cell is a canine cell, such as canine kidney
    epithelial cells.
            The subject invention also concerns cells transformed with a polynucleotide of the
 '0 present invention encoding a polypeptide of the invention. Preferably, the polynucleotide
    sequence is provided in an expression construct of the invention. More preferably, the
    expression construct provides for overexpression in the cell of an operably linked
    polynucleotide of the invention.        In one embodiment, the cell is transformed with a
    polynucleotide sequence comprising a sequence encoding the amino acid sequence shown in
25  any of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 48, 50,
    52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, or 78, or a functional fragment or variant
    thereof. In a specific embodiment, the cell is transformed with a polynucleotide encoding the
    amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28,
    30, 32, 33, 34, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, or 78 comprises the
30  nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27,
    29, 31, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, or 77, respectively, or a
    sequence encoding a functional fragment or variant of any of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
    14,16, 18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,33,34,48,50,52,54,56,58,60,62,64,66,68,70,72,

                                                    40
    74, 76, or 78. Thus, the subject invention concerns cells transformed with a polynucleotide
    sequence comprising the nucleotide sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,
    13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75,
    or 77, or a fragment or variant, including a degenerate variant, of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5,
 5  7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69,
    71, 73, 75, or 77.
            The transformed cell can be a eukaryotic cell, for example, a plant cell, including
    protoplasts, or the transformed cell can be a prokaryotic cell, for example, a bacterial cell
    such as E. coli or B. subtilis. Animal cells include human cells, mammalian cells, partially
 0  canine cells, avian cells, and insect cells.      Plant cells include, but are not limited to,
    dicotyledonous, monocotyledonous, and conifer cells.
            The subject invention also concerns plants, including transgenic plants that express
    and produce a viral protein or polypeptide of the present invention. Plants, plant tissues, and
    plant cells transformed with or bred to contain a polynucleotide of the invention are
 5  contemplated by the present invention.       Preferably, the polynucleotide of the invention is
    overexpressed in the plant, plant tissue, or plant cell. Plants can be used to produce influenza
    vaccine compositions of the present invention and the vaccines can be administered through
    consumption of the plant (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,484,719 and 6,136,320).
            The subject invention also concerns kits for detecting a virus or diagnosing an
 '0 infection by a virus of the present invention. In one embodiment, a kit comprises an antibody
    of the invention that specifically binds to an influenza virus of the present invention, or an
    antigenic portion thereof. In another embodiment, a kit comprises one or more polypeptides
    or peptides of the present invention.     In a specific embodiment, the polypeptides have an
    amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOs. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24,

    functional and/or immunogenic fragment or variant thereof. In a further embodiment, a kit
    comprises one or more polynucleotides or oligonucleotides of the present invention. In a
    specific embodiment, the polynucleotides have a nucleotide sequence shown in any of SEQ
    ID NOs. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61,
30  63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, or 77, or a fragment or variant thereof. A kit may optionally
    comprise one or more control antibody, control polypeptide or peptide, and/or control
    polynucleotide or oligonucleotide.      The antibody, polypeptides, peptides, polynucleotides,
    and/or oligonucleotides of the kit can be provided in a suitable container or package.

             The subject application also concerns the use of mongrel dogs as a model for infection
    and pathogenesis of influenza virus. In one embodiment, a mongrel dog is inoculated with an
    influenza virus, such as a canine influenza virus of the present invention. Optionally, the dog
    can be administered therapeutic agents subsequent to inoculation. The dog can also have
 5  been administered a composition for generating an immune response against an influenza
    virus prior to inoculation with virus. Tissue, blood, serum, and other biological samples can
    be obtained before and/or after inoculation and examined for the presence of virus and
    pathogenesis of tissue using methods known in the art including, but not limited to, PCR, RT
    PCR, nucleic acid sequencing, and immunohistochemistry.
 0           Canine    influenza virus   strains (designated as    "A/canine/Florida/43/2004"    and
    "A/canine/Florida/242/2003")      were deposited with American Type Culture Collection

                         MATERIALS AND METHODS FOR EXAMPLES 1-6
    Blood and Nasal Swab Collection from Greyhounds.
 5           Acute and convalescent blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture from
    clinically diseased or normal greyhounds in racing kennels experiencing outbreaks of
    respiratory disease.     Convalescent samples were collected 4 to 12 weeks after the acute
    sample. Serum was harvested and stored at -80'C. Nasal swabs were collected and placed in
    Amies transport medium with charcoal (Becton Dickinson Biosciences) pending submission
 '0 for bacterial isolation.
    Postmortem examination of greyhounds.
             Complete postmortem examinations were performed by the Anatomic Pathology
    Service at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine (UF CVM) on 5 of the 8
25  greyhounds that died in the January 2004 outbreak at a Florida track.                  Postmortem
    examination of another dog was performed at a private veterinary clinic with submission of
    tissues to the UF CVM for histopathologic diagnosis. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral
    buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and 5-pm sections were either stained with
    hematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic diagnosis or processed for immunohistochemistry
30  as described below. Unfixed tissues were submitted for bacterial culture and also stored at
    800C.
    Serological tests for canine viral respiratory pathogens.

                                                    43
            Paired acute and convalescent serum samples were submitted to the Animal Health
    Diagnostic Laboratory (AHDL) at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine for
    serum neutralization assays against canine distemper virus, adenovirus type 2, and
    parainfluenza virus.    Antibody titers were expressed as the last dilution of serum that
 5  inhibited viral infection of cell cultures. Seroconversion, defined as a > 4-fold increase in
    antibody titer between the acute and convalescent sample, indicated viral infection.       No
    seroconversions to these viral pathogens were detected.
    Microbial tests for canine bacterial respiratory pathogens.
 0          Paired nasal swabs and postmortem tissues were submitted to the Diagnostic Clinical
    Microbiology/Parasitology/Serology      Service at the UF CVM for bacterial isolation and
    identification. The samples were cultured on nonselective media as well as media selective
    for Bordetella species (Regan-Lowe; Remel) and Mycoplasma species (Remel). All cultures
    were held for 21 days before reporting no growth. Nasal swabs from some of the greyhounds
 5  were also submitted to the Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology at the Kansas
    State University College of Veterinary Medicine for bacterial culture.        Of 70 clinically
    diseased dogs tested, Bordetella bronchiseptica was isolated from the nasal cavity of 1 dog,
    while Mycoplasma spp. were recovered from the nasal cavity of 33 dogs.             Pasteurella
    multocida was commonly recovered from the nasal cavity of dogs with purulent nasal
 '0 discharges.   Two of the dogs that died in the January 2004 outbreak had scant growth of
    Escherichia coli in the lungs postmortem, one dog had scant growth of E. coli and
    Streptococcus canis, and another had scant growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a yeast.
    Neither Bordetella bronchisepticanor Mycoplasma was isolated from the trachea or lungs of
    dogs that died.
25  Virus isolation from postmortem tissues.
            Frozen tissues were thawed and homogenized in 10 volumes of minimum essential
    medium (MEM) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and antibiotics.
    Solid debris was removed by centrifugation and supernatants were inoculated onto cultured
    cells or into 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs. Tissue homogenates from greyhounds
30  that died were inoculated into diverse cell cultures that supported the replication of a broad
    range of viral pathogens.    The cell cultures included Vero (African green monkey kidney
    epithelial cells, ATCC No. CCL-81), A-72 (canine tumor fibroblasts, CRL-1542), HRT-18
    (human rectal epithelial cells, CRL-1 1663), MDCK (canine kidney epithelial cells, CCL-34),

                                                   44
    primary canine kidney epithelial cells (AHDL, Cornell University), primary canine lung
    epithelial cells (AHDL), and primary bovine testicular cells (AHDL). MDCK and HRT cells
    were cultured in MEM supplemented with 2.5 ug/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma); the
    remaining cell lines were cultured in MEM supplemented           with 10% fetal calf serum and
 5  antibiotics. Cells were grown in 25 cm 2 flasks at 37 0 C in a humidified atmosphere containing
    5% CO 2 . A control culture was inoculated with the supplemented MEM. The cultures were
    observed daily for morphologic changes and harvested at 5 days post inoculation.            The
    harvested fluids and cells were clarified by centrifugation and inoculated onto fresh cells as
    described for the initial inoculation; two blind passages were performed. Hemagglutination
 0  activity in the clarified supernatants was determined using chicken or turkey red blood cells
    as described (Burleson et al., 1992; Kendal et al., 1982).       For virus isolation in chicken
    embryos, 0.1 mL of tissue homogenate was inoculated into the allantoic sac and incubated for
    48 hours at 35'C. After two blind passages, the hemagglutination activity in the allantoic
    fluids was determined as described (Burleson et al., 1992; Kendal et al., 1982).
 5
    RT-PCR, nucleotide sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses.
            Total RNA was extracted from tissue culture supernatant or allantoic fluid using the
    RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The total RNA
    (10 ng) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using a one-step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
 '0 CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification of the coding region of the
    8 influenza viral genes in the cDNA was performed as previously described (Klimov et al.,
    1992a), using universal gene-specific primer sets. The resulting DNA amplicons were used
    as templates for automated sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 3100 automated DNA
    sequencer using cycle sequencing dye terminator chemistry (ABI).           Nucleotide sequences
25  were analyzed using the GCG Package, Version 10.0 (Accelyrs) (Womble, 2000).               The
    Phylogeny Inference Package Version 3.5 was used to estimate phylogenies and calculate
    bootstrap values from the nucleotide sequences (Felsenstein, 1989). Phylogenetic trees were
    compared to those generated by neighbor-joining analysis with the Tamura-Nei gamma
    model implemented in the MEGA program (Kumar et al., 2004) and confirmed by the
30  PAUPO 4.0 Beta program (Sinauer Associates).
    Experimental inoculation of dogs.

                                                   45
            Four 6-month old specific pathogen-free beagles [(2 males and 2 females (Liberty
    Research)] were used. Physical examination and baseline blood tests including complete
    blood cell count/differential, serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis determined that the
    animals were healthy. They were housed together in a BSL 2-enhanced facility accredited by
 5  the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.           Baseline
    rectal temperatures were recorded twice daily for 7 days.      The dogs were anesthetized by
    intravenous injection of propofol (Diprivan@, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, 0.4 mg/kg body
    weight to effect) for intubation with endotracheal tubes. Each dog was inoculated with a total
    dose of 106.6 median tissue culture infectious doses (TCID5 a) of A/Canine/Florida/43/2004
 0  (Canine/FL/04) (H3N8) virus with half the dose administered into the distal trachea through
    the endotracheal tube and the other half administered into the deep nasal passage through a
    catheter.   Physical examinations and rectal temperature recordings were performed twice
    daily for 14 days post inoculation (p.i.). Blood samples (4 mL) were collected by jugular
    venipuncture on days 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 p.i. Nasal and oropharyngeal specimens were
 5  collected with polyester swabs (Fisher Scientific) from each dog on days 0 to 5, 7, 10, and 14
    p.i. The swabs were placed in viral transport medium (Remel) and stored at -80'C. Two
    dogs (1 male and 1 female) were euthanatized by intravenous inoculation of Beuthanasia-D@
    solution (1 mL/5 kg body weight; Schering-Plough Animal Health Corp) on day 5 p.i. and the
    remaining 2 dogs on day 14 for postmortem examination. Tissues for histological analysis
 '0 were processed as described. Tissues for virus culture were stored at -80'C. This study was
    approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
    Virus shedding from experimentally inoculated dogs.
             Serial dilutions of lung homogenates and swab extracts, prepared by clarification of
25  the swab transport media by centrifugation, were set up in MEM supplemented with 0.5%
    BSA and antibiotics.      Plaque assays were performed as described (Burleson et al., 1992)
    using monolayers of MDCK cells in 6-well tissue culture plates. Inoculated cell monolayers
    were overlaid with supplemented MEM containing 0.8% agarose and 1.5 ug/mL of TPCK
    trypsin. Cells were cultured for 72 hours at 37'C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
30  CO 2 prior to fixation and staining with crystal violet. Virus concentration was expressed as
    plaque forming units (PFU) per gram of tissue or per swab.
    Immunohistochemistry.

                                                  46
            Deparaffinized and rehydrated 5-pm lung tissue sections from the greyhounds and
    beagles were mounted on Bond-RiteTM slides (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI) and
    subsequently treated with proteinase K (DakoCytomation, Carpenteria, CA) followed by
    peroxidase blocking reagent (Dako@ EnVisionTM Peroxidase Kit, Dako Corp.). The sections
 5  were incubated with 1:500 dilutions of monoclonal antibodies to canine distemper virus
    (VMRD, Inc.), canine adenovirus type 2 (VMRD, Inc.), canine parainfluenza virus (VMRD,
    Inc.), or influenza A H3 (Chemicon International, Inc.) for 2 hours at room temperature.
    Controls included incubation of the same sections with mouse IgG (1 mg/mL, Serotec, Inc.),
    and incubation of the monoclonal antibodies with normal canine lung sections.      Following
 0  treatment with the primary antibodies, the sections were incubated with secondary
    immunoperoxidase and peroxidase substrate reagents (Dako@ EnVisionTM Peroxidase Kit,
    Dako Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were counterstained
    with hematoxylin, treated with Clarifier #2 and Bluing Reagent (Richard-Allan Scientific,
    Kalamazoo, MI), dehydrated, and coverslips applied with Permount (ProSciTech).
 5
    Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay.
            Serum samples were incubated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, Denka) (1
    part serum: 3 parts RDE) for 16 hours at 37'C prior to heat inactivation for 60 minutes at
    56C. Influenza A/Canine/FL/04 (H3N8) virus was grown in MDCK cells for 36-48 hr at
 '0 37C. Virus culture supernatants were harvested, clarified by centrifugation, and stored at
    80'C. The HI assay was performed as described previously (Kendal et al., 1982). Briefly, 4
    hemagglutinating units of virus in 25pl were added to an equal volume of serially diluted
    serum in microtiter wells and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes.         An equal
    volume of 0.5% v/v turkey erythrocytes was added and the hemagglutination titers were
25  estimated visually after 30 minutes. The endpoint HI titer was defined as the last dilution of
    serum that completely inhibited hemagglutination.    Seroconversion was defined as > 4-fold
    increase in HI titer between paired acute and convalescent samples. Seropositivity of a single
    sample was defined as a HI antibody titer >1:32.
30  Microneutralization (MN) assay.
            Neutralizing serum antibody responses to A/Canine/FL/04 (H3N8) were detected by a
    MN assay as described previously (Rowe et al., 1999) except that canine sera were RDE-

                                                   47
    treated as described above prior to the assay. The endpoint titer was defined as the highest
    dilution of serum that gave 50% neutralization of 100 TCID50 of virus. Seroconversion was
    defined as > 4-fold increase in MN titer between paired acute and convalescent samples.
    Seropositivity of a single sample was defined as a MN titer >1:80.

    solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted.
    EXAMPLE 1
 0          In January 2004, an outbreak of respiratory disease occurred in 22 racing greyhounds
    housed in 2 kennels at a Florida track and the local farm that supplied dogs to these kennels.
    There were approximately 60 dogs in each kennel building and 300 dogs at the farm. The
    outbreak occurred over a 6-day period after which no new cases were identified. Fourteen of
    the 22 dogs had fevers of 39.5 to 41.5'C, a soft, gagging cough for 10 to 14 days, and
 5  eventual recovery. Of the remaining 8 dogs, 6 apparently healthy dogs died unexpectedly
    with hemorrhage from the mouth and nose.         Two other dogs were euthanatized within 24
    hours of onset of hemorrhage from the mouth and nose due to rapid deterioration. Both of
    these dogs had fevers of 41C. Four of the 8 deaths occurred in the kennel buildings and 4
    occurred at the farm. Fifty percent of the deaths occurred on day 3 of the outbreak. The 22
 '0 dogs ranged in age from 17 months to 4 years, but 73% were 17 to 33 months old.
            Two clinical syndromes were evident: a milder illness characterized by initial fever
    and then cough for 10-14 days (14 dogs) with subsequent recovery, or a peracute death
    associated with hemorrhage in the respiratory tract (8 dogs for a mortality rate of 36%).
    Postmortem examinations were performed on 6 of the 8 fatal cases. All dogs had extensive
25  hemorrhage in the lungs, mediastinum, and pleural cavity. Histological examination of the
    respiratory tract revealed that in addition to pulmonary hemorrhage, all dogs had tracheitis,
    bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and suppurative bronchopneumonia (Figure 3). The epithelial lining
    and airway lumens in these tissues were infiltrated by neutrophils and macrophages. Lung
    homogenates prepared from these dogs were inoculated into a variety of monkey, human,
30  bovine, and canine cell lines for virus culture. The lung homogenate from one dog caused
    cytopathic effects in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCK) cultured in the
    presence of trypsin, and the cell culture supernatant agglutinated chicken red blood cells.
    Preliminary evidence of an influenza type A virus was provided by a commercial ELISA for

                                                    48
    detection of the nucleoprotein of influenza A and B viruses, and by PCR analysis using
    primers specific for the matrix gene of influenza A viruses. In addition, the hemagglutinating
    activity was inhibited by reference antisera to the equine influenza A H3 subtype, but not by
    antisera specific for human influenza A subtypes Hi-Hi1            and H13 (Table 3).       To
 5  characterize the molecular properties of the virus, we determined the nucleotide sequences of
    the 8 RNA segments of the viral genome. Sequence comparisons with known influenza virus
    genes and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the 8 genes of the canine isolate were most
    similar to those from contemporary equine influenza A (H3N8) viruses, with which they
    shared    9 6 -9 7 % sequence identity (Figure 1A, Table 4). In contrast, representative genes
 0  from avian, swine, and human influenza A isolates had <94% identity with the canine isolate
    (Table 4). These data identified the canine isolate A/Canine/Florida/43/2004 (Canine/FL/04)
    as an influenza A H3N8 virus closely related to contemporary lineages of equine influenza
    viruses.    Since all genes of the canine isolate were of equine influenza virus origin, we
    concluded that the entire genome of an equine influenza virus had been transmitted to the
 5  dog.
    EXAMPLE 2
             To investigate the role of the Canine/FL/04 virus in the clinical and pathological
    observations in the greyhounds, we performed immunohistochemical staining (IHC) on lung
 '0 tissues using a monoclonal antibody to influenza A H3. Viral H3 antigen was consistently
    detected in the cytoplasm of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells, bronchial gland
    epithelial cells, and macrophages in airway lumens and alveolar spaces (Figure 2A). These
    data support a diagnosis of pulmonary infection with influenza virus of the H3 subtype in
    multiple dogs.
25
    EXAMPLE 3
             To determine involvement of a Canine/FL/04-like virus in the etiology of the
    respiratory disease outbreak, we analyzed paired acute and convalescent sera from 11 sick
    dogs     and     16   asymptomatic    contacts  by  hemagglutination    inhibition  (HI)   and
30  microneutralization (MN). Seroconversion, defined as a > 4-fold rise in antibody titer to
    Canine/FL/04 from the acute to convalescent phase, occurred in 8 of 11 (73%) sick dogs in
    both assays (Table 1). Seroconversion occurred in 6 of 16 (38%) asymptomatic contacts in
    the HI assay, while 8 of 16 (50%) seroconverted in the MN assay (Table 1).                 The

                                                   49
    seroconversion data demonstrated infection of the dogs with a Canine/FL/04-like virus which
    coincided temporally with the onset of respiratory disease in most animals.
             Single serum samples were collected 3 months after the outbreak from an additional
    46 asymptomatic dogs housed with the sick dogs. Of these, 43 (93%) were seropositive in
 5  both assays. For the total population of 73 dogs tested, 93% were seropositive in both assays,
    including 82% (9/11) of the sick dogs and 95% (59/62) of the healthy contacts.         The high
    seroprevalence in dogs with no history of respiratory disease indicates that most infections
    with canine influenza virus are subclinical and suggest efficient spread of the virus among
    dogs. It is not known if subclinical infections contribute to the spread of the virus.
 0
    EXAMPLE 4
             To better understand the capacity of the Canine/FL/04 virus to infect dogs, four 6
    month old purpose-bred beagles were each inoculated with 1066 median tissue culture
    infectious doses (TCID 5o) by the intratracheal and intranasal routes. All dogs developed a
 5  fever (rectal temperature 239'C) for the first 2 days postinoculation (p.i.), but none exhibited
    respiratory symptoms such as cough or nasal discharge over a 14 day observation period.
    Virus shedding was examined by quantification of virus in nasal and oropharyngeal swabs.
    Only 2 of the 4 dogs shed detectable amounts of virus. One dog shed virus on days 1 and 2
    p.i. (1.0-2.5 logio PFU per swab), whereas the other dog shed virus for 4 consecutive days
 '0 after inoculation (1.4-4.5 logio PFU per swab). Postmortem examination of 2 dogs on day 5
    p.i. revealed necrotizing and hyperplastic tracheitis, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis similar to
    that found in the spontaneous disease in greyhounds, but there was no pulmonary hemorrhage
    or bronchopneumonia. Viral H3 antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of
    bronchi, bronchioles, and bronchial glands by IHC (Figure 2B).             Infectious virus was
25  recovered from the lung tissue of one of the dogs. Postmortem examination of the remaining
    2 dogs on day 14 p.i. showed minimal histological changes in respiratory tissues, no viral H3
    antigen by IHC, and no recovery of virus from lung homogenates.         Seroconversion in these
    latter 2 dogs was detected in MN assays by day 7 p.i., with a further 2-to 3-fold increase in
    antibody titers by day 14. These results established the susceptibility of dogs to infection
30  with Canine/FL/04, as evidenced by the febrile response, presence of viral antigen and
    infectious virus in the lung parenchyma, histopathological findings typical for influenza, and
    seroconversion.    The failure to reproduce severe disease and death in the experimentally

                                                  50
    inoculated beagles is not surprising since a large proportion of the naturally infected
    greyhounds were asymptomatic.
    EXAMPLE 5
 5          To investigate whether a Canine/FL/04-like influenza virus had circulated among
    greyhound populations in Florida prior to the January 2004 outbreak, archival sera from 65
    racing greyhounds were tested for the presence of antibodies to Canine/FL/04 using the HI
    and MN assays. There were no detectable antibodies in 33 dogs sampled from 1996 to 1999.
    Of 32 dogs sampled between 2000 and 2003, 9 were seropositive in both assays - 1 in 2000, 2
 0  in 2002, and 6 in 2003 (Table 5).      The seropositive dogs were located at Florida tracks
    involved in outbreaks of respiratory disease of unknown etiology from 1999 to 2003,
    suggesting that a Canine/FL/04-like virus may have been the causative agent of those
    outbreaks.    To investigate this possibility further, we examined archival tissues from
    greyhounds    that died from hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia           in March 2003.       Lung
 5  homogenates inoculated into MDCK cells and chicken embryos from one dog yielded H3N8
    influenza virus, termed A/Canine/Florida/242/2003 (Canine/FL/03).         Sequence analysis of
    the complete genome of Canine/FL/03 revealed >99% identity to Canine/FL/04 (Table 4),
    indicating that Canine/FL/04-like viruses had infected greyhounds prior to 2004.
 '0 EXAMPLE 6
            From June to August 2004, respiratory disease outbreaks occurred in thousands of
    racing greyhounds at 14 tracks in Florida, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, West Virginia, and
    Kansas.
            Officials at some of these tracks estimated that at least 80% of their dog population
25  had clinical disease. Most of the dogs had clinical signs of fever (> 39 0C) and cough similar
    to the dogs in the January 2004 outbreak, but many dogs also had a mucopurulent nasal
    discharge.    Multiple deaths were reported but an accurate mortality rate could not be
    determined.
            We collected paired acute and convalescent sera from 94 dogs located at 4 Florida
30  tracks: 56% of these dogs had     4-fold rises in antibody titers to Canine/FL/04, and 100%
    were seropositive (Table 6). Convalescent sera from 29 dogs in West Virginia and Kansas
    also had antibodies to Canine/FL/04. We isolated influenza A (H3N8) virus from the lungs
    of a greyhound that died of hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia at a track in Texas. Sequence

    analysis of the entire genome of this isolate, named A/Canine/Texas/1/2004 (Canine/TX/04),
    revealed    99% identity to Canine/FL/04 (Table 4).      The isolation of three closely related
    influenza viruses from fatal canine cases over a 13-month period and from different
    geographic locations, together with the substantial serological evidence of widespread
 5  infection among racing greyhounds, suggested sustained circulation of a Canine/FL/04-like
    virus in the dog population.
            Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes of Canine/FL/03,              Canine/FL/04, and
    Canine/TX/04 showed that they constitute a monophyletic group with robust bootstrap
    support that was clearly distinct from contemporary H3 genes of equine viruses isolated in
 0  2002 and 2003 (Figure IB).          Phylogentic analysis and pairwise nucleotide sequence
    comparisons of the other 7 genomic segments supported the segregation of the canine genes
    as a distinct sub-lineage most closely related to the equine virus lineage (data not shown, and
    Table 4). The clustering of the canine influenza genes as a monophyletic group separate from
    equine influenza is also supported by the presence of 4 signature amino acid changes in the
 5  HA (Table 2).     Together with the serological results from 2003 and 2004, these data are
    consistent with a single virus transmission event from horses to dogs with subsequent
    horizontal spread of the virus in the greyhound population. However, repeated introductions
    of this unique lineage of influenza virus from an unidentified reservoir species can not be
    formally excluded, unlikely as it may be.
 10         The viral HA is a critical determinant of host species specificity of influenza virus
    (Suzuki et al., 2000). To identify residues within HA that may be associated with adaptation
    to the canine host, we compared the deduced amino acid sequence of canine HAs to those of
    contemporary equine viruses. Four amino acid changes differentiate the equine and canine
    mature HA consensus amino acid sequences: N83S, W222L, 1328T, and N483T (see Table
25  2). The canine viruses have an amino acid deletion when compared to the consensus equine
    sequences. Therefore, amino acid position 7 in the HA equine sequence is position 6 in the
    HA canine sequence, amino acid position 29 in the HA equine sequence is position 28 in the
    HA canine sequence, amino acid position 83 in the HA equine sequence is position 82 in the
    HA canine sequence, etc. Thus, the four substituted amino acids are at position 82, 221, 327,
30  and 482 of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 33 and SEQ ID NO: 34. The
    substitution of serine for asparagine at consensus sequence position 83 is a change of
    unknown functional significance since various polar residues are found in H3 molecules from
    other species. The strictly conserved isoleucine at consensus sequence position 328 near the

                                                     52
    cleavage site of the H3 HA has been replaced by threonine. The pivotal role of HA cleavage
    by host proteases in pathogenesis suggests that this change merits further study.            The
    substitution of leucine for tryptophan at consensus sequence position 222 is quite remarkable
    because it represents a non-conservative change adjacent to the sialic acid binding pocket
 5  which could modulate receptor function (Weis et al., 1988). Interestingly, leucine at position
    222 is not unique to canine H3 HA since it is typically found in the H4, H8, H9, and H12 HA
    subtypes (Nobusawa et al., 1991; Kovacova et al., 2002). The leucine substitution may be
    more compatible with virus specificity for mammalian hosts since infections of swine with
    subtype H4 (Karasin et al., 2000) and humans and swine with subtype H9 (Peiris et al., 1999)
 0  viruses have been reported.      The substitution of asparagine with threonine at consensus
    sequence position 483 resulted in the loss of a glycosylation site in the HA2 subunit that is
    conserved in all HA subtypes (Wagner et al., 2002). Although the importance of these amino
    acid changes in the HA for adaptation of an equine virus to dogs remains to be determined,
    similar amino acid changes have been observed previously in association with interspecies
 5  transfer (Vines et al., 1998; Matrosovich et al., 2000). Amino acid differences between other
    influenza viral proteins of the invention and equine consensus sequence are shown in Tables
    19 to 25.
             The source of the equine influenza virus that initially infected racing greyhounds
    remains speculative.    Kennels at greyhound racetracks are not located near horses or horse
 '0 racetracks, suggesting that contact between greyhounds and shedding horses is not a
    sufficient explanation for the multiple outbreaks in different states in 2004.       A potential
    source of exposure to the equine virus is the feeding of horsemeat to greyhounds, whose diet
    is supplemented with raw meat supplied by packing houses that render carcasses, including
    horses which could carry influenza. Precedents for this mode of infection include reports of
25  interspecies transmission of H5N1 avian influenza virus to pigs and zoo felids fed infected
    chicken carcasses (Webster, 1998; Keawcharoen et al., 2004; Kuiken et al., 2004). Although
    this is a plausible route for the initial introduction of equine influenza into dogs, it does not
    explain the recent multiple influenza outbreaks in thousands of dogs in different states. Our
    experimental inoculation study demonstrated the presence of virus in the nasal passages and
30  oropharynx of dogs, albeit at modest titers. Nevertheless, these results indicate that shedding
    is possible, and that dog-to-dog transmission of virus by large droplet aerosols, fomites, or
    direct mucosal contact could play a role in the epizootiology of the disease.

                                                  53
           The interspecies transfer of a whole mammalian influenza virus to an unrelated
   mammal species is a rare event.        Previous studies have provided limited serological or
   virological evidence, but not both, of transient infection of dogs with human influenza A
   (H3N2) viruses (Nikitin et al., 1972, Kilbourne, et al., 1975; Chang et al., 1976; Houser et
 5 al., 1980).   However, there was no evidence of sustained circulation in the canine host.
   Although direct transfer of swine influenza viruses from pigs to people is well-documented
   (Dacso et al., 1984; Kimura et al., 1998; Patriarca et al., 1984; Top et al., 1977), there is no
   evidence for adaptation of the swine viruses in human hosts. In this report, we provide
   virological, serological, and molecular evidence for interspecies transmission of an entire
 0 equine influenza A (H3N8) virus to another mammalian species, the dog. Unique amino acid
   substitutions in the canine virus HA, coupled with serological confirmation of infection of
   dogs in multiple states in the U.S., suggest adaptation of the virus to the canine host. Since
   dogs are a primary companion animal for humans, these findings have implications for public
   health; dogs may provide a new source for transmission of novel influenza A viruses to
 5 humans.

   Canine tissues
15         Postmortem examinations were performed by the Anatomic Pathology Service at the
   University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine on 6 mixed breed dogs that died in
   April/May 2005 during an influenza outbreak in a shelter facility in northeast Florida, and on
   a pet Yorkshire Terrier dog that died in May 2005 during an influenza outbreak in a

                                                   58
    veterinary clinic in southeast Florida. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin,
    embedded in paraffin, and 5-tm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for
    histopathologic diagnosis. Unfixed tissues were stored at -80'C pending virological analyses.
 5  RNA extraction from canine tissue samples
            Frozen lung tissues from each of the 7 dogs were thawed and homogenized in
    minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
    and antibiotics (gentamycin and ciprofloxacin) using a disposable tissue grinder (Kendall,
    Lifeline Medical Inc., Danbury, CT).       Total RNA was extracted using a commercial kit
 0  (RNeasy Mini Kit, QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions
    and eluted in a final volume of 60 pL of buffer. Total RNA was also extracted from lung
    tissue collected from dogs without respiratory disease.
    Real-time RT-PCR
 5          A single-step quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed on total RNA extracted
    from the canine tissue samples using the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Kit containing ROX as
    a passive reference dye (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA).        Briefly, 2 primer-probe sets were
    used for detection of influenza A sequences in each sample (Table 7). One primer-probe set
    was selective for canine hemagglutinin (H3) gene sequences.        The other primer-probe set
 '0 targeted a highly conserved region of the matrix (M) gene of type A influenza virus. For
    each real-time RT-PCR reaction, 5 ptL of extracted total RNA were added to a reaction
    mixture containing 12.5 pL of 2X QuantiTech Probe RT-PCR Master Mix, 0.25 piL of
    QuantiTech RT Mix, forward and reverse primers (0.4 ptM final concentration for each),
    probe (0.1 pM final concentration) and RNase-free water in a final volume of 25 ptL. The
25  TaqMan Ribosomal RNA Control Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were
    used according to manufacturer's instructions for detection of 18S rRNA as an endogenous
    internal control for the presence of RNA extracted from the canine tissue samples.
            Quantitative one-step real-time RT-PCR was performed on the reaction mixtures in a
    Mx3000P* QPCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cycling conditions included a reverse
30  transcription step at 50'C for 30 minutes, an initial denaturation step at 95'C for 15 minutes
    to activate the HotStarTaq DNA polymerase, and amplification for 40 cycles.              Each
    amplification    cycle   included  denaturation   at  94'C   for   15  seconds   followed   by

                                                    59
    annealing/extension at 60'C for 1 minute. The FAM (emission wavelength 518 nm) and VIC
    (emission wavelength 554 nm) fluorescent signals were recorded at the end of each cycle.
    The threshold cycle (Ct) was determined by setting the threshold fluorescence (dR) at 1000 in
    each individual experiment. The Mx3000P version 2.0 software program (Stratagene, La
 5  Jolla, CA) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Samples were considered positive for
    influenza A virus when the threshold cycle (Ct) for the H3 or M gene was 3 units smaller
    than the Ct for lung tissues from dogs without respiratory disease.       The positive control
    consisted of amplification of RNA extracted from A/canine/FL/242/03 (H3N8) virus.
 0  Virus isolation in MDCK cells
             Frozen lung tissues from each of the 7 dogs were thawed and homogenized in 10
    volumes of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.5% (BSA)
    and antibiotics (gentamycin and ciprofloxacin). Solid debris was removed by centrifugation
    and supernatants were inoculated onto Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells cultured in
 5  DMEM supplemented with 1 ttg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis,
                                                                                         2
    MO) and antibiotics (gentamycin and ciprofloxacin). Cells were grown in 25 cm flasks at
    37'C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . The cultures were observed daily for
    morphologic changes and harvested at 5 days post inoculation. The harvested cultures were
    clarified by centrifugation and the supernatants inoculated onto fresh MDCK cells as
 '0 described for the initial inoculation; two additional passages were performed for samples that
    did not show evidence of influenza virus by hemagglutination or RT-PCR. Hemagglutination
    activity in the clarified supernatants was determined using 0.5% turkey red blood cells as
    previously described (Burleson, F. et al., 1992; Kendal, P. et al., 1982).      RT-PCR was
    performed as described below.
25
    Virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs
             Homogenates were prepared from frozen lung tissues as described above for
    inoculation of MDCK cells. The homogenates (0.2 mL) were inoculated into the allantoic
    sac of 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs. After 48 hours of incubation at 35'C, the eggs
30  were chilled at 4'C overnight before harvesting the allantoic fluid. Hemagglutination activity
    in the clarified supernatants was determined using 0.5% turkey red blood cells as previously
    described (Burleson, F. et al., 1992; Kendal, P. et al., 1982).     RT-PCR was performed as

                                                   60
    described below. Two additional passages in embryonated eggs were performed for samples
    that did not show evidence of influenza virus after the initial inoculation.
    RT-PCR, nucleotide sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses
 5          Viral RNA was extracted from MDCK supernatant or allantoic fluid using the
    QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's
    instructions. The viral RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the QIAGEN OneStep
    RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR
    amplification of the coding region of the 8 influenza viral genes in the cDNA was performed
 0  as previously described (Klimov, A. et al., 1992b), using universal gene-specific primer sets
    (primer sequences available on request).       The resulting DNA amplicons were used as
    templates for automated sequencing in the ABI PRISM* 3100 automated DNA sequencer
    using cycle sequencing dye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
    Nucleotide sequences were analyzed using the Lasergene 6 Package (DNASTAR, Inc.,
 5  Madison, WI).       The PHYLIP Version 3.50 software program was used to estimate
    phylogenies and calculate bootstrap values from the nucleotide sequences (Felsenstein, J.,
    1989).    Phylogenetic trees were compared to those generated by neighbor-joining analysis
    with the Tamura-Nei model implemented in the MEGA program (Kumar, S. et al., 2004)
    and confirmed by the PAUPO 4.0 Beta program (Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA).
 10
    Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay
             Serum samples were incubated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, DENKA
    SEIKEN Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) (1 part serum: 3 parts RDE) for 16 hours at 370 C prior to
    heat inactivation for 30 minutes at 56'C. Influenza A/Canine/Jacksonville/05 (H3N8) virus
25  was grown in MDCK cells for 72 hrs at 370 C in       5%  CO 2 . Virus culture supernatants were
    harvested, clarified by centrifugation, and stored at -80'C. All other viruses used in the HI
    assay were grown in 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs from which allantoic fluid was
    collected and stored at -80'C. The HI assay was performed as described previously (Kendal,
    P. et al., 1982). Briefly, 4 hemagglutinating units of virus in 25pl were added to an equal
30  volume of serially diluted serum in 96-well plastic plates and incubated at room temperature
    for 30 minutes.      An equal volume of 0.5% turkey erythrocytes was added and the
    hemagglutination titers were estimated visually after 30 minutes. The endpoint HI titer was
    defined as the last dilution of serum that completely inhibited hemagglutination.

    EXAMPLE 7-CLINICAL CASES
            In April and May 2005, a previously described (Crawford, P.C. et al., 2005)
    respiratory disease outbreak occurred in dogs housed in a shelter facility in northeast Florida.
 5  The outbreak involved at least 58 dogs ranging in age from 3 months to 9 years, and included
    purebred dogs as well as mixed breeds. The most common clinical signs were purulent nasal
    discharge and a cough for 7 to 21 days. Of the 43 dogs that had clinical disease for >7 days,
    41 had HI antibody titers to canine/FL/04 (H3N8) ranging from 32 to >1024. At least 10
    dogs progressed to pneumonia, of which 6 were euthanized.            These 6 mixed breed dogs
 0  included 3 males and 3 females ranging in age from 4 months to 3 years. The duration of
    clinical signs ranged from 2 to 10 days at the time of euthanasia.                On postmortem
    examination, these dogs had pulmonary congestion and edema. Histological examination of
    the respiratory tract revealed rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and suppurative
    bronchopneumonia. There was epithelial cell necrosis and erosion in the trachea, bronchi,
 5  bronchioles, and bronchial glands. The respiratory tissues were infiltrated by neutrophils and
    macrophages.
            In May 2005, a respiratory disease outbreak occurred in 40 pet dogs at a veterinary
    clinic in southeast Florida. The most common clinical signs were purulent nasal discharge
    and a cough for 10 to 30 days. Of the 40 dogs, 17 were seropositive for canine/FL/04 (H3N8)
 '0 with HI antibody tiers ranging from 32 to >1024. Seroconversion occurred in 10 dogs for which
    paired acute and convalescent sera were available. Three dogs progressed to pneumonia. One
    of these dogs, a 9-year old male Yorkshire Terrier, died 3 days after onset of clinical signs. This
    dog had tracheobronchitis, pulmonary edema and congestion, and severe bronchopneumonia.
    Similar to the 6 shelter dogs, there was epithelial cell necrosis and erosion of the airways and
25  neutrophilic infiltrates in the tissues.
    EXAMPLE 8-REAL-TIME RT-PCR AND VIRAL ISOLATION
            Lung tissues from the 7 dogs were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays
    that detect the M gene of influenza type A and the H3 gene of canine H3N8 influenza A
30  virus. The lungs from all 7 dogs were positive for both the influenza A M gene and the
    canine influenza H3 gene (Table 8). After 3 passages in MDCK cells, influenza A subtype
    H3N8 virus was isolated from the lungs of a shelter dog that died after 3 days of pneumonia.
    This virus was named A/canine/Jacksonville/05 (H3N8) (canine/Jax/05). After 2 passages in

                                                  62
    embryonated chicken eggs, influenza A subtype H3N8 virus was recovered from the lungs of
    the pet dog that also died after 3 days of pneumonia.               This virus was named
    A/canine/Miami//05 (H3N8) (canine/Miami/05).
 5  EXAMPLE        9-GENETIC ANALYSES           OF    THE CANINE        INFLUENZA       A H3N8
    ISOLATES
            Sequence analyses     of canine/Jax/05   and canine/Miami/05     revealed that their
    hemagglutinin (HA) genes were 98% identical to the canine/FL/04, canine/TX/04, and
    canine/Iowa/05    isolates recovered from the lungs of racing greyhounds that died of
 0  pneumonia during influenza outbreaks at tracks in 2004 and 2005 (Crawford, P.C. et al.,
    2005; Yoon K-Y. et al., 2005).         In addition, the HA genes of canine/Jax/05 and
    canine/Miami/05 were 98% identical to contemporary equine influenza viruses isolated after
    the year 2000. Phylogenetic comparisons of the HA genes showed that the canine/Jax/05 and
    canine/Miami/05     viruses  were clustered   with the    canine/FL/04,   canine/TX/04,   and
 5  canine/Iowa/05 greyhound isolates and contemporary equine isolates, forming a distinct
    group from the older equine viruses isolated in the early 1990's (Figure 4). Furthermore, the
    canine/Jax/05, canine/Miami/05, and canine/Iowa/05 isolates were more closely related to
    canine/Tx/04 than to either canine/FL/04 or canine/FL/03.        The 2005 isolates formed a
    subgroup that appears to branch off from the earlier 2003 and 2004 canine viruses with
 '0 differences at approximately 10 parsimony-informative sites. These differences support the
    hypothesis that canine influenza virus is being transmitted horizontally from dog-to-dog as
    opposed to being reintroduced periodically from an outside source.      The accumulation of
    mutations from 2003 to 2005 illustrates the ongoing process of adaptation that the virus must
    undergo after being transmitted to a new host, as is expected to have happened for the canine
25  influenza viruses.
    EXAMPLE 10-AMINO ACID ANALYSES OF THE CANINE INFLUENZA A H3N8
    ISOLATES.
            There were conserved amino acid substitutions in all 6 canine isolates that
30  differentiated them from contemporary equine influenza viruses (Table 9). These conserved
    substitutions were Il5M, N83S, W222L, 1328T, and N483T. Phylogenetic comparisons of
    the mature HA protein showed that the canine/Jax/05, canine/Miami/05, and canine/Iowa/05
    viruses formed a subgroup with the canine/TX/04 isolate (Figure 4).      There were 3 amino

                                                   63
    acid changes (Li 18V, K26 IN, and G479E) that differentiated this subgroup from the other
    canine viruses (Table 9).       There were 2 amino acid changes (F79L and G218E) that
    differentiated the 2005 isolates from their canine/TX/04 root. Furthermore, the 2005 isolates
    from non-greyhound         dogs, canine/Jax/05    and canine/Miami/05,      differed   from the
 5  canine/Iowa/05 greyhound isolate by one amino acid change, R492K. Finally, canine/Jax/05
    differed from canine/Miami/05 at a single amino acid, S107P. In all other H3N8 equine and
    canine viruses, S is conserved at position 107 except for A/Equine/Jilin/l/89 which has a T
    (Guo Y. et al., 1992).
 0  EXAMPLE 11-ANTIGENIC ANALYSES OF THE CANINE INFLUENZA A H3N8
    ISOLATES
            Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests were performed using an antigen panel of older
    and contemporary equine influenza viruses and the canine influenza viruses, and serum
    collected in 2005 from horses and dogs that had been infected with influenza virus (Table
 5  10). Serum from ferrets immunized against canine/FL/04 was also included in the analyses.
    The HI antibody titers in equine serum were 8 to 16-fold higher when tested with
    contemporary equine viruses compared to older isolates, but decreased by at least 4-fold
    when tested with the canine viruses. The canine serum was nonreactive with the older equine
    viruses, but the antibody titers increased 4-fold when tested with contemporary equine
 '0 isolates and canine isolates. This was also observed for the serum from ferrets immunized
    against canine influenza virus.      These seroreactivity patterns demonstrated the antigenic
    similarity between the canine influenza viruses and contemporary equine influenza viruses
    and were consistent with the phylogenetic analyses. The antibody titers in equine, canine,
    and ferret sera to the canine/Miami/05 isolate were similar to those for the 2003 and 2004
25  canine isolates. However, the titers were 2 to 4-fold lower for the canine/Jax/05 isolate. This
    suggests that canine/Jax/05 is antigenically distinct from the other canine isolates, which may
    in part be related to the single amino acid change at position 107 in the mature HA.

    Canine influenza virus inoculum.
           The virus inoculum was prepared by inoculation of Madin-Darby canine kidney
    (MDCK) epithelial cells with a stock of A/canine/FL/43/04 (H3N8) representing passage 3 of

                                                   68
   the original isolate previously described (Crawford et al., 2005). The inoculated MDCK cells
   in Dulbecco's Minimal Essential Media (DMEM) supplemented with 1 tg/mL TPCK-treated
   trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) and antibiotics (gentamycin and ciprofloxacin)
   were grown in 250 cm2 flasks at 370 C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . The
 5 cultures were observed daily for morphologic changes and harvested at 5 days post
   inoculation.   The harvested cultures were clarified by centrifugation and the supernatants
   were stored at -80'C pending inoculation of dogs. An aliquot of supernatant was used for
   determination of virus titer by the Reed and Muench method. The titer was 107 median tissue
   culture infectious doses (TCID5 a)of A/canine/Florida/43/2004 (canine/FL/04) per mL.
 0
   Experimental inoculation.
           Eight 4-month old colony bred mongrel dogs (Marshall BioResources, North Rose,
   NY) (4 males and 4 females) were used for the experimental inoculation study approved by
   the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.        The dogs' body
 5 weights ranged from 13 to 17 kg. The dogs were healthy based on physical examinations,
   baseline blood tests, and recording of body temperatures for 2 weeks prior to inoculation. All
   dogs were free from prior exposure to canine influenza virus based on serology tests
   performed on paired serum samples collected at the time of arrival into the facility and 2
   weeks later. The dogs were anesthetized by intravenous injection of propofol (Diprivan@,
 0 Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, 0.4 mg/kg body weight to effect) for intubation with endotracheal
   tubes.    Six dogs (3 males and 3 females) were each inoculated with 107 TCID50 of
   canine/FL/04 virus in 5 mL of sterile saline administered into the distal trachea through a
   small diameter rubber catheter inserted into the endotracheal tube. Two dogs (1 male and 1
   female) were sham-inoculated with an equal volume of sterile saline. The sham-inoculated
25 control dogs were housed in a different room from the virus-inoculated dogs and cared for by
   different personnel. Physical examinations and rectal temperature recordings were performed
   twice daily for 6 days post inoculation (p.i.).
   Pharyngeal and rectal swab collection.
30         To monitor for virus shedding, oropharyngeal specimens were collected twice daily
   from each dog on days 0 to 6 p.i. using polyester swabs (Fisher Scientific International Inc.,
   Pittsburgh, PA). The swabs were placed in 1 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
   containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Rectal swabs were collected from each dog

                                                   69
    daily from days 0 to 6. Swab extracts were prepared by clarification of the swab transport
    media by centrifugation. An aliquot of swab extract was tested immediately for influenza A
    virus nucleoprotein using the DirectigenTM commercial immunoassay kit (BD, Franklin
    Lakes, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The remaining extract was stored at
 5  -800 C pending other virological assays.
    Postmortem examinations.
            On day 1 p.i., one sham-inoculated dog and one virus-inoculated dog were
    euthanatized by intravenous inoculation of Beuthanasia-D solution (1 mL/5 kg body weight;
 0  Schering-Plough Animal Health Corp). One virus-inoculated dog was similarly euthanatized
    each day from days 2 to 5 p.i. On day 6 p.i., the remaining sham-inoculated and virus
    inoculated dog were euthanatized. Complete postmortem examinations were performed by
    one of the investigators (WLC).       Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin,
    embedded in paraffin, and 5-tm sections were either stained with hematoxylin and eosin for
 5  histopathologic diagnosis or processed for immunohistochemistry as described below.
    Unfixed lung tissues were submitted to the Diagnostic Clinical Microbiology/Parasitology/
    Serology Service at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine for bacterial
    isolation and identification. The samples were cultured on nonselective media as well as
    media selective for Bordetella species (Regan-Lowe; Remel, Lenexa, KS) and Mycoplasma
 '0 species (Remel). All cultures were held for 21 days before reporting no growth. Unfixed
    tissues were also stored at -800 C pending virological analyses.
    Immunohistochemistry.
            Deparaffinized and rehydrated 5-pm trachea and lung tissue sections were mounted
25  on Bond-RiteTM slides (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI) and subsequently treated
    with proteinase K (DAKOCytomation Inc., Carpenteria, CA) followed by peroxidase
    blocking reagent (DAKO@ EnVision TM Peroxidase Kit, DAKO Corp., Carpenteria, CA ).
    The sections were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of monoclonal antibody to influenza A H3
    (Chemicon International, Inc., Ternecula, CA) for 2 hours at room temperature.     Controls
30  included incubation of the same sections with mouse IgG (1 mg/mL, Serotec, Inc. Raleigh,
    NC), and incubation of the monoclonal antibody with normal canine lung sections. Following
    treatment with the primary antibody, the sections were incubated with secondary
    immunoperoxidase and peroxidase substrate reagents (Dako@ EnVisionTM Peroxidase Kit,

                                                   70
    Dako Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were counterstained
    with hematoxylin, treated with Clarifier #2 and Bluing Reagent (Richard-Allan Scientific,
    Kalamazoo,     MI),    dehydrated,  and coverslips    applied   with Permount     (ProSciTech,
    Queensland, Australia).

    RNA extraction from swabs and tissues.
            Lung and tracheal tissues from each dog were thawed and homogenized in minimum
    essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
    antibiotics (gentamycin and ciprofloxacin) using a disposable tissue grinder (Kendall,
 0  Lifeline Medical Inc., Danbury, CT). Total RNA was extracted from the tissue homogenates
    as well as orpharyngeal and rectal swab extracts using a commercial kit (RNeasy Mini Kit,
    QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions and eluted in a final
    volume of 60 pL of buffer.
 5  Real-time RT-PCR.
            A single-step quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed on the total RNA using
    the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Kit containing ROX as a passive reference dye (QIAGEN
    Inc., Valencia, CA) and a primer-probe set that targeted a highly conserved region of the
    matrix (M) gene of type A influenza virus (Payungporn S. et al., 2006a; Payungporn S. et al.,
 '0 2006b). For each real-time RT-PCR reaction, 5 pL of extracted total RNA were added to a
    reaction mixture containing 12.5 pL of 2X QuantiTech* Probe RT-PCR Master Mix, 0.25 PL
    of QuantiTech RT Mix, forward and reverse primers (0.4 PM final concentration for each),
    probe (0.1 pM final concentration) and RNase-free water in a final volume of 25 pL.        The
    TaqMan GAPDH Control Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used
25  according to manufacturer's instructions for detection of GAPDH as an endogenous internal
    control for the presence of RNA extracted from the swab and tissue samples and as a
    normalization control.
            Quantitative one-step real-time RT-PCR was performed on the reaction mixtures in a
    Mx3000P* QPCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cycling conditions included a reverse
30  transcription step at 50'C for 30 minutes, an initial denaturation step at 95'C for 15 minutes
    to activate the HotStarTaq DNA polymerase, and amplification for 40 cycles.              Each
    amplification    cycle   included  denaturation   at  94'C    for  15   seconds  followed   by

                                                    71
    annealing/extension at 60'C for 1 minute. The FAM (emission wavelength 518 nm) and VIC
    (emission wavelength 554 nm) fluorescent signals were recorded at the end of each cycle.
    The threshold cycle (Ct) was determined by setting the threshold fluorescence (dR) at 1000 in
    each individual experiment. The Mx3000P version 2.0 software program (Stratagene, La
 5  Jolla, CA) was used for data acquisition and analysis.       The positive control consisted of
    amplification of RNA extracted from A/canine/FL/242/03 (H3N8) virus.         The results were
    normalized by dividing the M Ct value by the corresponding GAPDH Ct value for each
    sample.
 0  Virus re-isolation from tissues.
             Frozen lung and trachea tissues from virus-inoculated dogs were thawed and
    homogenized in 10 volumes of DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA and antibiotics. Solid
    debris was removed by centrifugation and supernatants were inoculated onto MDCK cells
    cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1 tg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.,
 5  St. Louis, MO) and antibiotics as described above. Cells were grown in 25 cm 2 flasks at
    37 0 C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . The cultures were observed daily for
    morphologic changes and harvested at 5 days post inoculation. The harvested cultures were
    clarified by centrifugation and the supernatants inoculated onto fresh MDCK cells as
    described for the initial inoculation; two additional passages were performed for samples that
 '0 did not show evidence of influenza virus by hemagglutination or RT-PCR. Hemagglutination
    activity in the clarified supernatants was determined using 0.5% turkey red blood cells as
    previously described (Crawford et al., 2005). RT-PCR was performed as described below.
    RT-PCR, nucleotide sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses.
25           Viral RNA was extracted from MDCK supernatant using the QIAamp Viral RNA
    Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The viral
    RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN

    coding region of the 8 influenza viral genes in the cDNA was performed as previously
30  described (Crawford et al., 2005), using universal gene-specific primer sets (primer
    sequences available on request). The resulting DNA amplicons were used as templates for
    automated sequencing in the ABI PRISM 3100 automated DNA sequencer using cycle

    sequencing dye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).           Nucleotide
    sequences were analyzed using the Lasergene 6 Package (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI).
    The nucleotide sequences for viruses recovered from infected dogs were compared to the
    sequences of the virus in the inoculum to determine if any changes had occurred during
 5  replication in the respiratory tract.
    EXAMPLE 12-CLINICAL DISEASE
             All 6 virus-inoculated dogs developed a transient fever (rectal temperature >39'C) for
    the first 2 days p.i., but none exhibited respiratory signs such as cough or nasal discharge
 0  over the 6-day observation period. The sham-inoculated dogs remained clinically healthy.
    EXAMPLE 13-VIRUS SHEDDING
             Influenza A nucleoprotein was detected in the oropharyngeal swab collected from one
    of the virus-inoculated dogs at 24 hours p.i. The oropharyngeal swabs collected from one
 5  dog at 72, 84, and 120 hours p.i., and another dog at 108, 120, and 132 hours p.i., were
    positive for virus by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Table 11).        The absolute number of
    influenza M gene copies per tL of swab extract increased with time from 3 to 6 days p.i. No
    virus was detected in the rectal swabs.
 '0 EXAMPLE 14-POSTMORTEM EXAMINATIONS
             In contrast to the previous experimental infection using specific pathogen-free
    Beagles (Crawford et al., 2005), the virus-inoculated mongrel dogs had pneumonia as
    evidenced by gross and histological analyses of the lungs from days 1 to 6 p.i. In addition to
    pneumonia, the dogs had rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis similar to that
25  described in naturally infected dogs (Crawford et al., 2005). There was epithelial necrosis
    and erosion of the lining of the airways and bronchial glands with neutrophil and macrophage
    infiltration of the submucosal tissues (Figure 5, upper panels).          Immunohistochemistry
    detected viral H3 antigen in the epithelial cells of bronchi, bronchioles, and bronchial glands
    (Figure 5, lower panels). No bacterial superinfection was present. The respiratory tissues
30  from the 2 sham-inoculated dogs were normal.

   Virus strains
           Canine influenza virus strains as well as those of avian, equine and human origin
   (listed in Table 15) were propagated in embryonated eggs or MDCK cells and their
   infectivity was titrated by endpoint dilution in chicken embryos, or plaque assay. Rapid virus
15 quantification was performed by hemagglutination assay using turkey red blood cell
   erythrocytes.
   Diagnostic specimens
   A Total of 60 canine's lung tissues collected from suspect cases of viral respiratory disease
20 during the year of 2005 were tested for the presence of canine influenza virus.

    RNA extraction from canine tissue samples
            Blocks of lung tissue weighing between 20 and 30 mg were homogenized in a
    disposable tissue grinder (Kendal).      Total RNA was extracted using a commercial kit
    (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and eluted in a final volume of 60 pL, following
 5  the manufacturer's recommendations.
    Primers and probes design
            Multiple sequence alignments of the H3 and M genes from various subtypes and from
    diverse species were performed using the CLUSTAL X program (Version 1.8). Matrix (M)
 0  primers and probe were selected from the conserved regions of over the known sequences
    corresponding to different subtypes of influenza A virus, whereas the H3 hemagglutinin
    gene-specific primers and probe set were selected to specifically match equine and canine
    influenza A virus genes and mismatch the homologous avian and human genes (Table 13).
    Primer design software (OLIGOS Version 9.1) and the web based analysis tools provided by
 5  EXIQON (http://lnatools.com) was used for Tm calculation and prediction of secondary
    structure as well as self hybridization. A conserved region of an 18S rRNA gene was used as
    endogenous internal control for the presence of RNA extracted from canine tissue sample.
    The Pre-Developed TaqMan@ Assay Reagents for Eukaryotic 18S rRNA (VIC/TAMRA)
    (Applied Biosystems) was used for the real-time detection of 18S rRNA in tissue samples.

    Real-time RT-PCR condition
            A single-step real-time RT-PCR was performed by using the Quantitect Probe RT
    PCR Kit containing ROX as a passive reference dye (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). In each real
    time RT-PCR reaction, 5 pL of RNA sample were used as a template to combine with a
25  reaction mixture containing 10 tL of 2X QuantiTech Probe RT-PCR Master Mix, 0.2 PL of
    QuantiTech RT Mix, primers (0.4 tM final conc. for H3 gene or 0.6 pM final conc. for M
    gene), probe (0.1   tM final conc. for H3 gene or 0.2 pM final conc. for M gene) and RNase
    free water in a final volume of 20 [tL. One-step real-time RT-PCR was performed in the
    Mx3005P Real-Time QPCR System (Stratagene).            Cycling conditions included a reverse
30  transcription step at 50'C for 30 minutes. After an initial denaturation step at 95'C for 15
    minutes in order to activate the HotStarTaq DNA polymerase, amplification was performed
    during 40 cycles including denaturation (94'C for 15 seconds) and annealing/extension (60'C

                                                     76
    for 30 seconds). The FAM (emission wavelength 516 nm for H3 and M detection) and VIC
    (emission wavelength 555 nm for 18S rRNA detection) fluorescent signals were obtained
    once per cycle at the end of the extension step. Data acquisition and analysis of the real-time
    PCR assay were performed using the Mx3005P software version 2.02 (Stratagene).

    Specificity of H3 primers/ probe set for canine influenza (H3N8) and universality of M
    primers/probe set for type A influenza virus
             In order to test the specificity of each primers/probe set, RNA extracted from several
    known subtypes of influenza A viruses were used as a template in the real-time RT-PCR
 0  assay (Table 15).
    RNA standard for determination of the real-timer RT-PCR performance
             The genes of canine influenza A virus (A/canine/Florida/242/2003(H3N8)) were used
    to generate the PCR amplicons for H3 (nt 1-487) and M (nt 1-276) by using primers linked
 5  with T7 promoter (Table 13).        Then the purified PCR amplicons of H3 and M genes were
    used as templates for in vitro transcription by using Riboprobe in vitro Transcription System
    T7 (Promega) following the manufacturer's recommendations.             The concentration of the
    transcribed RNAs was calculated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The RNAs were then
    serially diluted 10-fold, ranging from 108 to 10 copies/ pL to perform sensitivity tests.
 '0 Moreover, a standard curve was generated by plotting the log of initial RNA template
    concentrations (copies/ pL) against the threshold cycle (Ct) obtained from each dilution in
    order to determine the overall performance of real-time RT-PCR.
    Comparative sensitivity tests between real-time RT-PCR and Directigen Flu A test kit
25           Stock viruses of two viral strains including A/Wyoming/3/2003 (H3N2) at 10667
    EID 5 0/mL (HA=64) and A/canine/Florida/242/2003(H3N8) at 107-7 EID 50/mL (HA=16) were
    used for the detection threshold assay.        Logarithmic dilution of specimens in phosphate
    buffered saline (PBS) (125 pL) were used in a rapid influenza A antigen detection kit,
    Directigen Flu A, (Becton, Dickinson and Company)                 following the manufacturer's
30  instructions. Each Directigen Flu A test device has an HINI influenza antigen spot in the
    center of the membrane which develops as a purple dot and indicates the integrity of the test,
    which is based on a monoclonal antibody to the nucleoprotein (NP). The development of a

    purple triangle surrounding the dot is indicative of the presence of influenza NP in the tested
    specimen. The intensity of the purple signal from the triangle was scored as + (outline of
    triangle), ++ (lightly colored triangle), +++ (dark-purple triangle) and ++++ (very dark
    purple triangle). Viral RNA was extracted 125 tL aliquots of each virus dilution by using
 5  QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and eluting in a final volume of 50 ptL.
    A volume of 5 uL of the extracted viral RNAs were tested by real-time RT-PCR for
    comparative sensitivity test with Directigen Flu A kit.
    EXAMPLE 16
 0          The real-time RT-PCR assay for canine influenza relies on information from three
    molecular probes which target 18S rRNA from host cell was well as M and H3 from the
    influenza A virus genome (Table 14).           Amplification of the host gene is a reporter of
    specimen quality and integrity. Clinical, necropsy or laboratory samples containing canine
    influenza (H3N8) virus are expected to yield amplification signal with the three probes.
 5  Specimens yielding amplification signal with M and 18S rRNA probes but negative for H3
    would be indicative of an influenza virus subtype H3 from human, swine or avian origin or
    from non-H3 subtypes. These rare cases could be resolved by RT-PCR using HA universal
    primers to generate amplicon cDNA that can be analyzed by sequencing. Properly collected
    and handled specimens lacking influenza A virus yield 18S rRNA amplification signal only.
 '0 Situations in which only the 18S rRNA probe and the H3 probes yield amplification signal
    are indicative of faulty technique, unless proven otherwise; either a false negative with M
    probes or false positive for H3 need to be demostrated. Finally, specimens failing to yield
    amplification signals with the three probes are indicative of defective sample collection,
    degradation, faulty RNA extraction or the presence of inhibitors the polymerases used in
25  PCR.
            In order to test the specificity of the H3 primers/probe set for canine influenza A virus
    (H3N8) and the universality of M primers/probe set for type A influenza, several subtypes of
    influenza A viruses were tested by real-time RT-PCR.                The results show that H3
    primers/probe set yielded a positive amplification signal only with canine influenza (H3N8).
30  No significant false positive or non-specific amplification signals were observed in other
    subtypes or human H3 strains. The M primers/probe set yielded positive amplification signal
    with all of the strains tested (Table 15).       These results indicated that H3 primers/probe

                                                      78
    specifically detects canine influenza A virus (H3N8) whereas M primers/probe detect
    multiple subtypes of type A influenza viruses.
             The performance of real-time RT-PCR assays was evaluated by endpoint dilution of
    M and H3 in vitro transcribed RNAs.          As expected, the threshold cycle (Ct) increased in
 5  direct correlation with the dilution of the RNA standards.          The fluorescent signals can be
    detected at RNA standard dilutions of M and H3 as low as 103 and 102 copies/tL,
    respectively (Figure 6A and 6B). The standard curves of M and H3 genes were constructed
    by plotting the log of starting RNA concentrations against the threshold cycle (Ct) obtained
    from each dilution (Figure 6C and 6D). The slope of the standard curve is used to determine
 0  the PCR reaction efficiency, which is theoretically exponential;                100% amplification
    efficiency would imply doubling of amplicon cocentration each cycle. The standard curves
    with a slope between approximately -3.1            and -3.6 are typically acceptable for most
    applications requiring accurate quantification (90-110 % reaction efficiency). An Rsq value
    is the fit of all data to the standard curve plot. If all the data lie perfectly on the line, the Rsq
 5  will be 1.00. As the data fall further from the line, the Rsq decreases. An Rsq value         > 0.985
    is acceptable for most assays. The M standard curve revealed a slope of -3.576 (efficiency=
    90.4 %) and Rsq= 1.00 whereas H3 standard curve yielded a slope of -3.423 (efficiency=
    95.9%) and Rsq= 0.999.          These values indicate satisfactory amplification efficiency and
    overall performance of the real-time RT-PCR assays. We attribute the lower efficiency and
 '0 sensitivity of M primers/probe set as compared to H3 primers/probe set to the N-fold
    degeneracy of M primer sequences required to ensure broad coverage of M gene sequences
    variability across viruses of multiple subtypes, hosts and lineages.
             The sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR assay was also compared with the commercial
    rapid    antigen     detection    assay   (Directigen     Flu   A).    Logarithmic     dilutions   of
25  A/Wyoming/3/2003         (H3N2) and A/canine/Florida/242/2003(H3N8)            were analyzed with
    Directigen Flu A and by real-time RT-PCR. The results of Directigen Flu A showed that the
    sensitivities against both viral strains are approximately 100-fold dilution from the stock
    viruses used in these experiments (Figure 7). The signals (purple color) generated by the
    canine virus (A/canine/Florida/242/2003:       106, PFU/ml) samples were much weaker than
30  those found in human virus (A/Wyoming/3/2003: 107. PFU/ml), in agreement with the lower
    virus concentration in these samples. Alternatively, lower signal for canine influenza could

                                                   79
    be attributed to the molecular specificity of monoclonal antibodies against the NP; i.e. poor
    conservation of the amino acids within the NP epitope of canine influenza A viruses.
            Real-time RT-PCR of the M gene yielded Ct values above threshold with virus 10 and
    30 PFU equivalents per reaction of A/canine/Florida/242/2003         and A/Wyoming/3/2003,
 5  respectively (Table 16).    The differences between the sensitivity value of 2 viral strains
    because the differences in the original viral titers.    The H3 gene detection comparison
    between canine     and human influenza viruses        was not performed because the H3
    primers/probe in our realtime RT-PCR assay amplifies exclusively canine influenza A virus.
    RT-PCR was 105 times more sensitive than the rapid antigen detection kit.
 0          To evaluate the performance of the RT-PCR test in necropsy specimens from dogs
    with acute respiratory disease, sixty canine lung tissue samples submitted during the year of
    2005 were tested for the presence of canine influenza A virus by real-time RT-PCR. A total
    of 12 out of 60 samples (20%) were positive with both M and H3 genes whereas the
    remaining 48 samples yielded negative result for both M and H3 gene.          Virus isolation
 5  attempts were conducted by egg and MDCK cell inoculation, to evaluate the specificity of the
    realtime assay; 2 out 12 samples that were positive for canine influenza by RT-PCR yielded
    canine influenza virus (data not shown, manuscript in preparation).      Although all of the
    tissues were collected from dogs with a history of severe respiratory disease, most of the
    samples yielded no canine influenza virus by either realtime PCR or conventional isolation,

   EXAMPLE 17 - CANINE INFLUENZA CHALLENGE MODEL DEVELOPMENT.
           The canine influenza (canine flu) virus, which was isolated from flu outbreaks in
   Florida, was observed to be a H3N8 type influenza virus, and closely related to equine flu
   virus strain, A/equine/Ohio/03 (Crawford et al., SCIENCE Vol. 309, September 2005,
 5 incorporated by reference in its entirety into this patent). The potential of using the equine
   flu virus strain A/equine/Ohio/03 to induce influenza-like disease in dogs was investigated in
   this study.
   Procedure:
 0         Ten 13-week-old beagles of mixed sex were obtained from a commercial supplier,
   and housed in individual cages in a BSL-2 facility. The dogs were randomly assigned to two
   groups of 5 dogs each. As shown in Table 26, one group was subjected to a intratracheal
   challenge, and the other group was subjected to an oronasal challenge.         The dogs were
   challenged at 14 weeks-of-age.

           A cell culture grown equine flu virus A/equine/Ohio/03 was used as the challenge
   virus. For intratracheal challenge, the challenge virus was administered via a delivery tube,
   which consisted of a cuffed tracheal tube (Size 4.0/4.5, Sheridan, USA) and feeding tube
20 (size 5Fr, 1.7 mm, /16 inches in length, Kendall, USA) in 0.5 to 1.0 ml volume. For oronasal
   challenge, the challenge virus (107 to 108 TCID50 per dog) was administered as a mist using
   a nebulizer (DeVilbiss Ultra-Neb@99 ultrasonic nebulizer, Sunrise Medical, USA) in a 2 to 3
   ml volume.
           The dogs were observed for flu related clinical signs for 14 days post-challenge.
25 Serum samples were collected from each dog on day zero (before challenge), and days 7 and
   14 post-challenge for determining the HI titer using a H3N8 equine influenza virus with a
   standard protocol (SAM 124, CVB, USDA, Ames, IA). All dogs were humanely euthanized
   and lung tissues were collected in 10% buffered formalin for histopathological evaluation.

  compared to 1 of 5 (i.e., 20%) dogs in Group 2. One dog from the oronasal challenge group
  had sneezing, and another had cough following the challenge. An HI titer range from 10 to
  80, with a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 20, was observed for Group 1. A titer range of 40
  to 160, with a GMT of 86, was observed for Group 2.         One dog from each group had
0 histopathological lesions compatible with or pathognomic for influenza.

   Procedure:
 0          Nine 7-week-old beagles of mixed sex were obtained from a commercial supplier, and
   housed in individual cages in a BSL-2 facility. These dogs were randomly assigned to two

 5 The first group consisted of 5 dogs, which were vaccinated with an inactivated,
   CARBIGEN          adjuvanted, equine flu virus A/equine/Ohio/03 vaccine at 8 and 12 weeks-of
   age via subcutaneous (SQ) route.          The A/equine/Ohio/03 was inactivated by binary
   ethylenimine ("BEI") using a standard method. Each dose of the vaccine contained 5% by
   mass CARBIGENTM , 4096 HA units of the inactivated virus, sufficient PBS to bring the total
20 volume of the dose to 1 ml, and sufficient NaOH to adjust the pH to between 7.2 and 7.4.
   Serum samples were collected from all dogs on the day of first and second vaccination and
   day 7 and 14, post-first and -second vaccination, and at pre-challenge for determining the HI
   titer using a H3N8 equine influenza virus a standard protocol (SAM 124, CVB, USDA,
   Ames, IA). At 3 weeks post-second vaccination, the 5 vaccinated dogs and the second group
25 (i.e., the control group) consisting of 4 age-matched dogs were challenged oronasally with a
   cell-culture-grown equine influenza virus A/equine/Ohio/03 (1070 to 10'0 TCID50 per dog)
   in a 1-2 ml volume per dose. The challenge virus was administered to the dogs as a mist
   using a nebulizer (DeVilbiss Ultra-Neb@99 ultrasonic nebulizer, Sunrise Medical, USA).

                                                   91
   The dogs were observed for flu-related clinical signs for 14 days post-challenge. Five dogs
   (3 vaccinates and 2 controls) 7 days post-challenge and 4 dogs (2 controls and 2 vaccinates)
   14 days post-challenge were humanely euthanized for collection of lung tissues in 10%
   buffered formalin for histopathological evaluation.
5
   Results:
           The results of this experiment are summarized in Tables 29 and 30. All vaccinated
   dogs seroconverted following the vaccination. An HI titer range from 40 to 640, with the
   GMT of 129, was observed during the post-vaccination period with equine influenza virus
0  A/equine/Ohio/03, and a HI titer of 160 to 320, with a geometric mean titer of 211, was
   observed with canine flu isolate, A/canine/Florida/242/03.     Two of 6 vaccinates had a fever
   of>103 0 F (>39.40 C) for one day and no other clinical signs were observed in any of the dogs
   following challenge.
5  Conclusion:
           All the vaccinated dogs responded to the inactivated, CARBIGENTm adjuvanted
   equine influenza vaccine. The HI titer results with a canine influenza virus isolate suggest
   that the inactivated equine influenza vaccine did induce a detectable level of cross reactive
   antibody to canine influenza virus. Even though the challenge virus used in this did not
'0 induce any noticeable clinical disease in beagle dogs, based on the HI titer with a canine
   influenza virus isolate, it was concluded that inactivated equine vaccine could be used in dogs
   to induce cross reactive antibodies, which could potentially protect dogs against "canine flu"
   disease caused by H3N8 type canine influenza viruses.

   EXAMPLE 19 - EFFICACY OF AN EQUINE INFLUENZA VIRUS VACCINE FOR
   DOGS.
            The canine influenza virus isolated from flu outbreaks in Florida was characterized
   is closely related to a number of H3N8 type equine influenza virus isolates. By DNA and
 5 amino acid sequence similarity analysis it was demonstrated that the canine influenza
   virus is very similar to an equine influenza virus, A/equine/Ohio/03. The following study
   was conducted in dogs to determine the efficacy of commercially available equine
   influenza vaccines in dogs.
10 Procedure:
           Approximately 16 month old, 20 mongrels and 20 beagles of mixed sex were used
   in the study. The dogs were randomly assigned to 6 groups (Table 31) of 6-7 dogs each.
   Dogs in groups 1 and 4 were vaccinated with a commercially available inactivated,
                                                        TM
   adjuvanted equine influenza vaccine (EQUICINE           , Intervet Inc., Millsboro, DE) at 16
15 and 17 months of age via subcutaneous (SQ) route. The dogs in groups 2 and 5 were
   vaccinated with a modified live equine/Kentucky/91 influenza vaccine in a 1 ml volume
   via intranasal route (single nostril).      Blood samples were collected on the day of
   vaccination, day 7 and 14 post first vaccination (groups 1, 2, 4, and 5) and post second
   vaccination (groups 1 and 4) for determining the HI titer using an H3N8 equine influenza
20 virus and a canine influenza virus using per a standard protocol (SAM 124, CVB, USDA,
   Ames, IA).
           Vaccinates (at 72 days post final vaccination) and the controls were challenged
   oronasally with a cell-culture grown equine influenza virus strain A/equine/Ohio/03 (1070
   to 108.0 TCID50 per dog) in a 1-2 ml volume. The challenge virus was administered to the
25 dogs as mist using a nebulizer (DeVilbiss Ultra-Neb@99 ultrasonic nebulizer, Sunrise
   Medical, USA). The dogs were observed for influenza-related clinical signs for 12 days
   post-challenge. The nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected in Earl's MEM
   medium with antibiotics (neomycin and polymyxin B) daily from day -1 to day 12 post
   challenge for virus isolation. The presence of virus in the swabs indicates that the animal
30 is excreting the virus in nasal/oral secretions. All dogs were humanely euthanized on day
   12 post-challenge and lung tissues were collected in 10% buffered formalin for
   histopathological evaluation.

           The samples collected at 2 weeks post vaccination (post second vaccination for
   EQUICINE IITM vaccine) were analyzed for HI titer determination with a canine influenza
25 as well as with an equine influenza virus (H3N8 type). The HI results are shown in Table
   32. The clinical signs include fever (>103'F; >39.4oC), occasional cough, and mild nasal
   discharge observed following the challenge.

           Among beagles, 2 of 6 dogs in the EQUICINE II      TM vaccine group (Group 1), 1 of
 5 7 dogs in the A/KY/91 vaccine group (Group 2) and 2 of 6 dogs in the control group
   (Group 3) had fever. One of 6 dogs in Group 3 (control) was positive for virus in the cell
   culture supernatant of nasal swab material by hemagglutination assay with 0.25% chicken
   red blood cells (CRBC). One of 6 dogs in the control group (Group 3) and 1 of 7 dogs in
   the A/KY/91 vaccine group (Group 2) had mild nasal discharge during the post challenge
10 observation period.    There was no statistical significant difference (P > 0.05) between
   control and vaccine groups for beagle dogs.
           Among mongrels, 5 of 7 dogs in the EQUICINE IITM vaccine group (Group 4), 1
   of 7 dogs in the A/KY/91 vaccine group (Group 5) and 5 of 6 dogs in the control group
   (Group 6) had fever. One dog from each of Group 4 and 6 had a mild nasal discharge, and
15 one dog from Group 5 had an occasional cough. Two of 7 dogs in the EQUICINE IITM
   vaccine group (Group 4) and 3 of 6 dogs in the control group (Group 6) were positive for
   influenza virus in the nasal swab by HA assay. None of the dogs from the A/KY/91 group
   (Group 5) were positive for influenza virus in the nasal swab materials.
20 Conclusion:
           By serology, it was demonstrated that vaccination of dogs with commercially
   available equine influenza vaccines stimulated a moderate level influenza antibody
   response.    There may be some breed difference in development of influenza-related
   clinical signs in dogs following a challenge with H3N8 type influenza virus.      The live
25 attenuated equine influenza vaccine (A/KY/91) provided a significant (P< 0.05) protection

   from clinical disease development in rectal temperature in mongrels.           Also, the live
   attenuated viral vaccine prevented the shedding of influenza virus in the nasal secretions.
   EXAMPLE 20 - CANINE INFLUENZA CHALLENGE MODEL DEVELOPMENT
 5         In view of reports that inducing disease in canines for purposes of study had not
   proven successful, the potential for using a canine influenza virus, H3N8, to develop a
   canine influenza challenge model in dogs was investigated in the following study.
   Procedure:
10         Ten mongrels of mixed sex were obtained from a commercial supplier, and housed
   in cages in a BSL-2 facility. The dogs were randomly assigned to two groups of 5 dogs
   each.   As shown in Table 33, one group was subjected to an intratracheal/intranasal
   challenge, and the other group was subjected.

15
   The dogs were challenged at approximately12 weeks-of-age.          Embryonated-chicken-egg
   grown canine influenza virus (A/canine/Florida/242/03) virus was used as challenge virus.
   Each dog received a total of approximately 107.2 TCID50 of virus in either 2 ml (for
   oronasal route) or 4 ml (intratracheal/intranasal route) volume.
20         For intratracheal/intranasal challenge, 3 ml of the challenge virus was administered
   into the trachea first, followed by 5 ml of PBS using a delivery tube, which consisted of a
   cuffed tracheal tube (Size 4.5/5.0, Sheridan, USA) and feeding tube (size 5Fr, 1.7 mm; 16
   inches (41 cm) in length, Kendall, USA), and a 1 ml challenge virus, followed by 3 ml of
   atmospheric air was administered into nostrils using a syringe.
25         For oronasal challenge, the challenge virus was administered as a mist using a
   nebulizer (NebulairTM, DVM Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Miami, FL) in approximately 2 ml
   volume. The dogs were observed for flu-related clinical signs for 14 days post-challenge.
   The dogs were euthanized at day 14 post challenge, and tissue (lung and trachea) samples
   were collected in 10% buffered formalin for histopathological examination.
30

   Results:
          All dogs in groups 1 and 2 developed canine influenza clinical signs within 24 to
   48 hours. Each dog had 2 or more of the following clinical signs: fever (>103.0'F;
   >39.4'C), cough, serous or mucopurulent ocular discharge, serous or mucopurulent nasal
 5 discharge, vomiting, diarrhea, depression, weight loss, gagging, hemoptysis, and audible
   rales. Lung tissues from 5 of 5 dogs from group 1 and 4 of 5 dogs from group 2 had
   histopathological lesions which included one or more of the following: diffuse suppurative
   bronchopneumonia, bronchitis/bronchoiolitis with plugs of neutrophilic exudate in the
   lumina and marked mononuclear cell aggregation in mucosa and peribronchiolar tissue,
10 mixed exudate within alveoli with large numbers of foamy macrophages, lymphocellular
   and plasma cellular as well as granulocytic cell infiltration, and thickening of alveolar
   septa with proliferation of type II pneumocytes compatible with or pathognomic to an
   influenza virus infection. The trachea tissue samples were normal.
15 Conclusion:
          An H3N8 canine influenza isolate such as the one used in this study may be used
   for inducing canine influenza disease in dogs using one of the methods described in this
   study or a similar method.
20 EXAMPLE 21 - CANINE INFLUENZA CHALLENGE MODEL DEVELOPMENT.
           The potential for using a canine influenza virus, H3N8, to develop a canine
   influenza challenge model in dogs was further investigated in the following study.
   Procedure:
25         Fifteen 17- to 18-week-old mongrels and five 15-week-old beagles were obtained
   from commercial suppliers, and were housed in cages in a BSL-2 facility. The mongrels
   were randomly assigned to 3 groups (Groups 1 to 3) of 5 dogs each. All beagles were
   assigned to one group (Group 4) as shown in Table 34:

   The dogs     were    challenged  oronasally    with   a virulent    canine  influenza virus,
   A/Canine/Florida/242/2003 (isolated from lung of a greyhound dog with canine influenza
   disease (provided by Dr. Cynda Crawford at the University of Florida)). The challenge
 5 virus was administered as a mist using a nebulizer (NebulairTM) in approximately 2 ml
   volume. The dogs were observed for flu-related clinical signs for 14 days post-challenge.
   Results:
           Eighty percent (4 of 5) of the dogs in Group 1 and 4, 100% of the dogs in Group 2
10 and 3, developed canine influenza clinical signs within 48 hours. Each dog had one or
   more of the following clinical signs: fever (>103.0'F; >39.4'C), cough, serous or
   mucopurulent ocular discharge, serous or mucopurulent nasal discharge, vomiting,
   diarrhea, depression, weight loss, gagging, and rales.       The clinical signs observed in
   beagles were generally milder and short-course compared to mongrels.
15
   Conclusion:
           An H3N8 canine influenza isolate such as the one used in this study may be used
   for inducing canine-influenza-like or kennel-cough-like disease in dogs using method
   described in this study or a similar method with a challenge dose range from 1048 to1068
20 TCID50. There were some differences in clinical signs observed in mongrels and beagles.
   In general, beagles tend to have milder flu-related clinical signs compared to mongrels.

            The vaccine used in this study was a HAVLOGEN@-adjuvanted, inactivated
   equine influenza virus (A/equine/KY/02) vaccine. To prepare this vaccine, the virus was
 5 inactivated by binary ethylenimine (BEI) using a standard method.         Each vaccine dose
   contained HAVLOGEN@ (10% v/v), 6144 HA units of the inactivated virus, 0.1% (v/v) of
   10% thimerosal, 0.1 % (v/v) of phenol red, sufficient NaOH to adjust the pH to from 6.8
   to 7.2, and sufficient PBS to bring the total dose volume to 1 ml.
            The dogs in Groups 1 and 4 were vaccinated with 2 doses of the vaccine. The
10 second dose (i.e., the booster) was administered 4 weeks after the first. The dogs in Group
   2 were vaccinated with 1 dose at 18 weeks-of-age. Blood samples were collected to assess
   HI titer using a standard protocol (e.g., SAM 124, CVB, USDA, Ames, IA) with an H3N8
   canine influenza isolate on days zero (before vaccination), 7, and 14 post first and second
   vaccinations. Approximately 5 days before challenge, the dogs were moved to a BSL-2
15 facility and housed in individual cages.
            All vaccinates and age-matched control dogs were challenged oronasally with a
   virulent canine influenza virus (1077 TCID50 of A/Canine/Florida/242/2003 per dog) at 2
   weeks post second vaccination of Groups 1 and 4 and first vaccination of Group 2. The
   challenge virus was administered as a mist using a nebulizer (NebulairTM) at 2 ml per dog.
20 The dogs were observed for influenza-related clinical signs for 17 days post-challenge.
   Nasal and oropharygeal swabs were collected in tubes containing 2 ml of virus transport
   medium for virus isolation from day -1 (i.e., one day before challenge) to day 17 days
   post-challenge. All dogs were euthanized at day 17 post-challenge and lung and tracheal
   samples were collected in 10% buffered formalin for histopathology. Blood samples were
25 collected on days 7 and 14 post challenge for HI titer determination. The clinical sign
   score assignments used for the post challenge observation are shown in Table 36.

                                                IU'
           Results:
           All dogs in 2-dose vaccination groups (Group 1 and 4) developed HI antibody titer
   responses to the canine influenza virus isolate (Table 37).        Following the challenge,
   approximately a 4-fold increase in titer on day 14 post challenge in all groups indirectly
 5 indicated that all dogs were exposed to the challenge virus. All dogs exhibited one or more
   of the following signs of canine influenza: fever (>103.0'F; >39.4'C), cough, serous or
   mucopurulent ocular discharge, serous or mucopurulent nasal discharge, vomiting,
   diarrhea, depression, weight loss, and dyspnea. Vaccinates had less severe clinical signs,
   compared to age-matched controls (Table 38).         There was a significant reduction in
10 clinical signs due to the 2-dose vaccination in both 8-week-old (P    = 0.040) and 14-week
   old (P   =  0.003) dogs (Groups 4 and 1 respectively).        In this experiment, one-dose
   vaccination did not provide a significant (P = 0.294) reduction in clinical signs (Group 2)
           Virus isolation results are shown in Table 39. Among 14-week-old dogs, canine
   influenza virus was isolated from swab samples collected from 2 of 7 dogs (29%) from the
15 2-dose vaccine group (Group 1), 3 of 5 dogs (60%) from the 1-dose vaccine group (Group
   2), and 5 of 5 dogs (100%) from the control group (Group 3). Among 8-week-old dogs,
   the virus was isolated from 1 of 5 dogs (20%) from the 2-dose vaccine group (Group 4),
   and 4 of 5 dogs (80%) from the control group (Group 5).             There was a significant
   reduction (P   = 0.003) in the number of dogs positive for canine influenza virus in swab
20 samples due to 2-dose vaccination (Groups 1 and 4) compared to unvaccinated controls
   (Groups 3 and 5). Although there was a reduction in the number of dogs (60% vs. 100%)
   positive for canine influenza virus in swab samples between 1-dose vaccine group (Group
   2) and the control group (Group 3), the difference was not statistically significant (P     =
   0.222).
25         Histopathological evaluation of lung and tracheal tissue samples for lesions was
   conducted to identify lesions compatible with or pathognomic to canine influenza disease.
   This includes, for example, determination of whether one or more of the following exist:
   areas    with    suppurative   bronchopneumonia;      peribronchitis/peribronchiolitis  with
   mononuclear cell aggregation (lymphocytes, plasma cells); presence of plugs of
30 granulocytic cellular debris in the lumina; hyperplasia of respiratory epithelium; mixed
   exudate in the alveoli with large amount of granulocytic cells and cell debris; aggregates
   of (foamy) macrophages, plasma cells, and lymphocytes; and thickening of alveolar septa
   with proliferation of type II pneumocytes.

           Table 40 provides a summary of the extent of lesions in this experiment for the
   dogs. Among 14-week-old dogs, the lung lesions were less extensive and less severe in 5
   of 7 dogs in the 2-dose vaccination group (Group 2), and 4 of 5 dogs in the 1-dose
   vaccination group (Group 1).        All controls dogs (Group 3) had severe and extensive
 5 lesions suggestive of no protection. There was no difference in tracheal lesions due to 1
   or 2-dose vaccination among 14- week-old dogs. Among 8-week-old dogs, there was no
   difference in lung lesions between 2-dose vaccinates and control dogs. None of the dogs
   had any tracheal lesions.
10         Conclusion:
           The results from this study demonstrate that:         (1) inactivated H3N8 equine
   influenza virus can induce canine influenza virus cross reactive HI antibody responses in
   vaccinated dogs, (2) use of an H3N8 equine influenza virus vaccine can reduce the
   severity of canine influenza virus disease in dogs, and (3) use of an H3N8 equine
15 influenza virus vaccine can reduce virus excretion in nasal and/or oral secretions.

   EXAMPLE 23 - CANINE INFLUENZA VACCINE EFFICACY STUDY
            The following study was conducted to determine the efficacy of a multivalent
10 H3N8 equine influenza vaccine against canine influenza virus in dogs.
   Procedure:

             Seventeen 15-week-old beagles were obtained from a commercial supplier.       The
   dogs were randomly assigned to 3 groups as shown in Table 41, and housed in a research
   facility.

             The vaccine used in this study was a HAVLOGEN@ adjuvanted, inactivated
   equine influenza (A/equine/KY/02, A/equine/KY/93, and A/equine/NM/2/93) vaccine. To
   prepare this vaccine, the viruses were inactivated by binary ethylenimine (BEI) using a
   standard method. Each vaccine dose contained HAVLOGEN@ (10% v/v), 2048 HA units
10 of each of the inactivated virus, 0.l1% (v/v) of 10% thimerosal, 0.1 % (v/v) of phenol red,
   sufficient NaOH to adjust the pH to 6.8 to 7.2, and sufficient PBS to bring the total dose
   volume to 1 ml.
             The dogs in Group 1 were vaccinated with 2 doses of the vaccine.       The second
   (i.e., booster) dose was administered 4 weeks after the first dose. The dogs in Group 2
15 were vaccinated with 1 dose of vaccine at 19 weeks-of-age. Blood samples were collected
   to assess HI titer using a standard protocol with an H3N8 canine influenza isolate on days
   zero (before vaccination), 7, and 14 post first and second vaccinations. Seven days before
   challenge, the dogs were moved to a BSL-2 facility and housed in individual cages.
            All vaccinates and age-matched control dogs were challenged oronasally with a
20 virulent canine influenza virus (1073 TCID50 of A/Canine/Florida/242/2003 per dog) at 2
   weeks post second vaccination of Group 1 and first vaccination of Group 2. The challenge
   virus was administered as a mist using a nebulizer (NebulairTM) at 2 ml per dog. The dogs
   were observed for influenza-related clinical signs for 14 days post challenge. All dogs
   were euthanized at day 14 post-challenge, and lung and trachea samples were collected in
25 10% buffered formalin for histopathology. Blood samples were collected on days 7 and
   14 post challenge for HI titer determination. The clinical sign score assignments used for
   the post challenge observation are shown in Table 42.

   Results:
           All vaccinated dogs developed HI antibody titer responses to the canine influenza
   virus isolate (Table 43). Following the challenge, approximately a 4 fold increase in HI
   titer on day 14 post challenge compared to the pre-challenge HI titer in all groups
 5 indirectly indicate that all dogs were exposed to the challenge virus. All dogs exhibited
   signs canine influenza disease with each dog demonstrating one or more of the following
   clinical signs: fever (>103.0'F; >39.4'C), cough, serous or mucopurulent ocular discharge,
   serous or mucopurulent nasal discharge, vomiting, diarrhea, depression, weight loss, and
   dyspnea. Vaccinates had less severe clinical signs, compared to age-matched controls
10 (Table 44). There was a significant (P    =  0.028) reduction in clinical signs due to the 2
   dose vaccination in dogs (Group 1). One dose vaccination did not provide a significant (P
    = 0.068) reduction in clinical signs (Group 2).
           As in Example 22, histopathological evaluation of lung and tracheal tissue samples
   for lesions was conducted to identify lesions compatible with or pathognomic to canine
15 influenza disease. Table 45 provides a summary of the extent of lesions in this experiment
   for the dogs. Among 15-week-old dogs, vaccination of dogs with either 1 dose or 2 doses
   prevented the lung lesions in all dogs.         Four of 5 control dogs (80%) had severe
   suppurative bronchopneumonia consistent with an influenza disease. One of 7 dogs from
   the 2-dose vaccine group (Group 1) and 1 of 5 dogs from the control group (Group 3) had
20 mild trachea lesions suggestive of tracheitis which could be attributed to influenza disease.
   Conclusion:
            The results from this study demonstrate that 1) inactivated H3N8 equine influenza
   virus can induce canine influenza virus cross reactive HI antibody responses in vaccinated
25 dogs, and 2) Use of a H3N8 equine influenza virus vaccine can reduce the severity of
   canine influenza virus disease in dogs.

             Three types of vaccines (VAX-1, VAX-2, and VAX-3) were used. The VAX-i
   was a HAVLOGEN@-adjuvanted, inactivated equine influenza virus (A/equine/KY/02)
   monovalent vaccine, and each dose contained HAVLOGEN@ (10% v/v), 6144 HA units
15 of the inactivated virus, 0.1% (v/v) of 10% thimerosal, 0.1 % (v/v) of phenol red,
   sufficient NaOH to adjust the pH to 6.8 to 7.2, and sufficient PBS to bring the total dose
   volume to 1 ml.       The VAX-2 was a HAVLOGEN@-adjuvanted, inactivated equine
   influenza virus (A/equine/KY/02)        monovalent vaccine, and each dose of vaccine
   contained HAVLOGEN@ (10% v/v), 4096 HA units of the inactivated virus, 0.1% (v/v) of
20 10% thimerosal, 0.1 % (v/v) of phenol red, sufficient NaOH to adjust the pH to 6.8 to 7.2,
   and sufficient PBS to bring the total dose volume to 1 ml.                   The VAX-3 was a
   HAVLOGEN@-adjuvanted,             inactivated          equine     influenza      (A/equine/KY/02,
   A/equine/KY/93,      and   A/equine/NM/2/93          )    multivalent   vaccine,   and   contained
   HAVLOGEN@ (10% v/v), 2048 HA units of inactivated virus per strain, 0.1% (v/v) of
25 10% thimerosal, 0.1 % (v/v) of phenol red, sufficient NaOH to adjust the pH to 6.8 to 7.2,
   and sufficient PBS to bring the total dose volume to 1 ml. All influenza viruses used for

                                                 I I-)
   the vaccine formulation were inactivated by binary ethylenimine (BEI) using a standard
   method.
            The vaccines and routes of administration for each group are described in Table
   46. All dogs in the vaccinated groups were vaccinated either via the intranasal (IN) or the
 5 subcutaneous (SQ) route, and each dog received 2 doses. The second (i.e., booster) dose
   was administered 4 weeks after the first dose. Blood samples were collected to assess HI
   titer using a standard protocol with an H3N8 canine influenza isolate on days zero (before
   vaccination), 7, and 14 post first and second vaccinations. Seven days before challenge,
   the dogs were moved to a BSL-2 facility and housed in individual cages.
10          All vaccinates and age-matched control dogs were challenged oronasally with a
   virulent canine influenza virus (107A TCID50 of A/Canine/Florida/242/2003 per dog) at 2
   weeks post second vaccination. The challenge virus was administered as a mist using a
   nebulizer (NebulairTM) in a 2 ml volume per day. The dogs were observed for influenza
   related clinical signs for 14 days post-challenge. Blood samples were collected on days 7
15 and 14 post challenge for HI titer determination. All dogs were euthanized at day 14 post
   challenge, and lung and trachea samples were collected in 10% buffered formalin for
   histopathology.     The clinical sign score assignments used for the post challenge
   observation are shown in Table 47.
20 Results:
            All dogs vaccinated via the SQ route developed HI antibody titer responses to the
   canine influenza virus isolate, regardless of the vaccine type (Table 48). None of the dogs
   from the IN vaccination groups (i.e., Groups 1, 3, and 5) developed HI antibody titer
   responses to the canine influenza virus isolate, regardless of the vaccine type, during the
25 post vaccination period. There was, however, a 4-fold increase in titer by day 14 post
   challenge in all dogs indirectly, indicating that all dogs were exposed to the challenge
   virus (Table 47).
            All dogs exhibited one or more of the following clinical signs of canine influenza:
   fever (>103.0'F; >39.4'C), cough, serous or mucopurulent ocular discharge, serous or
30 mucopurulent nasal discharge, vomiting, diarrhea, depression, weight loss, and dyspnea.
   Vaccinates had less severe clinical signs, compared to age-matched controls (Table 49).
   There was a significant reduction in clinical signs in dogs vaccinated with VAX-3 via the
   SQ route (Group 4). In this experiment, IN administration of either VAX-i, VAX-2, or
   VAX-3 did not provide a significant reduction in clinical signs of canine influenza virus.

                                                 110
           As in Examples 22 and 23, histopathological evaluation of lung and tracheal tissue
   samples for lesions was conducted to identify lesions compatible with or pathognomic to
   canine influenza disease. Table 50 provides a summary of the extent of lesions in this
   experiment for the dogs. Five of 5 control dogs (Group 6) had lung lesions consistence
 5 with an influenza infection.     Two of 5 dogs vaccinated with VAX-2 via the SC route
   (Group 2) and 3 of 5 dogs vaccinated with VAX-3 via the SC route (Group 4) were free of
   any influenza-related lung lesions. All the dogs that received the vaccine via the intranasal
   route, irrespective of the vaccine type, had severe lung lesions consistent with an influenza
   infection. The trachea lesions observed in this study were very mild.
10
   Conclusion:
           The results from this study demonstrate that: (1) inactivated H3N8 equine
   influenza virus can induce canine influenza virus cross reactive HI antibody responses in
   dogs vaccinated via the SQ route, (2) intranasal administration of either monovalent
15 (VAX-1 and VAX-2) or multivalent vaccine (VAX-3) was not efficacious in dogs, and (3)
   subcutaneous administration of multivalent vaccine (VAX-3) provided a significant
   (P=0.016) reduction in severity of canine influenza virus disease in dogs.

EXAMPLE 25 - CANINE INFLUENZA VACCINE EFFICACY STUDY
         Canine influenza disease is caused by an H3N8 influenza virus (CIV). CIV is very
closely related to equine H3N8 viruses (Crawford et al., 2005) and infects all exposed dogs.

                                               123
Approximately 80% of exposed dogs develop clinical signs.            In the following study the
efficacy of an inactivated H3N8 equine influenza virus vaccine and a canine influenza virus
vaccine were determined.
Procedure:
         Thirty-five beagles and five mongrels were used in this study.            Beagles were
randomly assigned to three groups (Table 51). All mongrels were assigned to control group
(Group 3). All dogs were fed with a standard growth diet and water was available as libitum.

VAX-i       was    a   HAVLOGEN@         adjuvanted,    inactivated    equine   influenza  virus
(A/equine/KY/02) vaccine.      For vaccine preparation, the vaccine virus was inactivated by
binary ethylenimine (BEI) using a standard method.            Each dose of vaccine contained
HAVLOGEN@ (10% v/v), 6144 HA units of the inactivated virus, 0.1% (v/v) of 10%
thimerosal, 0.1 % (v/v) of phenol red and sufficient PBS to bring the total dose volume to 1
ml and sufficient NaOH to adjust the pH to 6.8 to 7.2.
         VAX-2 was an inactivated, CARBIGENTM adjuvanted, canine influenza antigen
vaccine    (A/canine/Fl/43/2004).     The A/canine/Fl/43/2004       was inactivated    by binary
ethylenimine ("BEI") using a standard method. Each dose of the vaccine contained 5% by
mass CARBIGENTM, approximately 1280 HA units of the inactivated virus, sufficient PBS
to bring the total volume of the dose to 1 ml, and sufficient NaOH to adjust the pH to
between 7.2 and 7.4. Serum samples were collected from all dogs on the day of first and
second vaccination, days 7 and 14 post first and second vaccinations, and at pre-challenge to
determine the HI titers using an H3N8 equine influenza virus standard protocol (SAM 124,
CVB, USDA, Ames, IA). Seven days before challenge, the dogs were moved to a ABSL-2
facility and housed in individual cages.

                                               124
        All vaccinates and age-matched control dogs were challenged oronasally with virulent
canine influenza virus (107.2 TCID50 of A/Canine/Florida/242/2003 per dog) at 2 weeks post
second vaccination.      The challenge virus was administered as a mist (2ml/dog) using a
nebulizer (NebulairTM).    The dogs were observed for influenza-related clinical signs for 14
days post-challenge. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected daily in tubes containing
2 ml of virus transport medium for virus isolation from day -1 (i.e., one day before challenge)
through day 14      post-challenge.   Blood samples were collected on days 7 and 14 post
challenge for HI titer determination. The clinical sign score assignments used for post
challenge observation are shown in Table 52.
Results:
        All vaccinated dogs (Groups 1 and 2) developed HI antibody titer responses to the
canine influenza virus isolate (Table 53). All dogs exhibited one or more of the following
signs of canine influenza: fever (>103.0'F; >39.4'C), cough, serous or mucopurulent ocular
discharge, serous or mucopurulent nasal discharge, vomiting, diarrhea, depression, and
anorexia. Vaccinates had less severe clinical signs, compared to age-matched controls (Table
54). There was a significant (P < 0.001) reduction in clinical signs in dogs vaccinated with
either VAX-I (Group 1) or VAX-2 (Group 2).
        Virus isolation results are shown in Tables 55 and 56. Following a virulent canine
influenza virus challenge, the canine influenza virus was isolated from 5 of 15 (33%) dogs
from Group 1 (VAX-1), 0 of 5 (0%) dogs from Group 2 (VAX-2) and 17 of 20 (85%)
controls (Group 3). Both inactivated equine influenza vaccine (VAX-1) and canine influenza
virus (VAX-2) vaccinates demonstrated a significant (P    = 0.004) reduction in virus shedding
in nasal or oral secretions or both (Table 55) compared to controls.
Conclusion:
        The results from this study demonstrate that: (1) inactivated H3N8 equine influenza
virus and canine influenza virus vaccines can induce canine influenza virus reactive HI
antibody responses in vaccinated dogs, (2) use of an H3N8 equine influenza virus or canine
influenza virus vaccine can reduce the severity of canine influenza virus disease in dogs, and
(3) use of an H3N8 equine influenza virus or canine influenza virus vaccine can reduce virus
excretion in nasal and/or oral secretions.
