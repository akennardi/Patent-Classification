         SYNTHETIC LETHALITY AND THE TREATMENT OF CANCER
  RELATED APPLICATIONS
          This application claims priority to United         States Application number
  61/510,686, filed July 22, 2011, the contents all of which are hereby incorporated by
  reference in their entirety.
  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
  [0001]          The    field of the    invention   generally   relates  to  compounds,
  compositions and methods for treatment of cancer.
  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
  [0002]          Cancer is a leading cause of death in Canada. The Canadian Cancer
  Society estimate there will be approximately 170000 new cases of cancer in 2011, and
  approximately 75000 deaths as a result of cancer.
  [0003]          An emerging approach for the treatment of cancer relates to the
  concept of synthetic lethality. Two genes (or two gene products) are synthetic lethal
  if mutation of either alone is compatible with viability but mutation of both leads to
  death.    Put another way, "synthetic lethality" describe situations where a mutation
  and a drug (for example) together cause a cancer cell's death - either the mutation or
  the drug would not result in cell death. Targeting a gene (or gene product) that is
  synthetic lethal to a cancer-relevant mutation should kill only cancer cells and spare
  normal cells. Synthetic lethality therefore provides a framework for the development
  of anti-cancer specific agents.
  10004]          The approach of synthetic lethality to the treatment of cancer is
  emerging, is not yet a routine approach largely due to the absence identification of
  synthetic lethal genes (and gene products).
  100051          N-myristoylation of proteins is a modification in which myristate (a
  14-carbon saturated fatty acid) is covalently attached to the NH 2 terminal glycine of a
  variety of cellular, viral, and onco-proteins (e.g., oncogenic Src-related tyrosine
 kinases, heterotrimeric G alpha subunits, etc.).

WO 2013/013302                                                         PCT/CA2012/000696
  [00061         Cellular myristoylated proteins have diverse biological functions in
  signal transduction and oncogenesis.     Modification of proteins by myristoylation is
  required for the subcellular targeting, protein conformation and biological activity of
  many important proteins in eukaryotic cells, including those required for signal
  transduction and regulatory functions important in cell growth. Tyrosine kinases of
  the Src    family   (proto-oncogenes)    are among     the most     extensively   studied
  myristoylated proteins.
  10007]         Myristoylation of proteins is catalyzed N-myristoyltransferase (NMT).
  NMT is responsible for this activity in eukaryotic cells and works by modifying its
  polypeptide substrate after the removal of the initiator methionine residue by
  methionyl aminopeptidase.      This modification occurs primarily as a cotranslational
  process, although myristoylation can also occur post-translationally after proteolytic
  cleavage of proteins, typically during apoptosis. Two isozymes of the mammalian
  NMT enzymes have been cloned and are designated NMT1 and NMT2. NMTs play a
  pro-survival role in cells. The two NMTs are present in all normal cells.
  100081         There remains a need for compounds, composition and method for the
  treatment of cancer.

  known information believed by the applicant to be of possible relevance to the present
  invention. No admission is necessarily intended, nor should it be construed, that any

  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
  [0059]           As will be described in more detail below, there is described herein
  compounds, composition and methods for the treatment of a subject with cancer.
  There are also described here methods for identifying subject with cancer that are
  suitable for treatment with the compounds, composition and methods are described
  herein. There are also described here methods for identifying subject with cancer.
  [0060]           The present application provides methods and compositions for the
  treatment of NMT deficient cancers. NMT-deficient cancers include cancers deficient
  in NMT2 or NMTI.         In a specific example, the NMT deficient cancer is a NMT2
  deficient cancer.
  [0061]           The term "cancer", as used herein, refers to a variety of conditions
  caused by the abnormal, uncontrolled growth of cells. Cells capable of causing
  cancer, referred to as "cancer cells", possess characteristic properties such as
  uncontrolled proliferation, immortality, metastatic       potential, rapid growth and
  proliferation rate, and/or certain typical morphological features. Cancer cells may be
  in the form of a tumour, but such cells may also exist alone within a subject, or may
  be a non-tumorigenic cancer cell. A cancer can be detected in any of a number of
  ways, including, but not limited to, detecting the presence of a tumor or tumors (e.g.,
  by clinical or radiological means), examining cells within a tumor or from another
  biological sample (e.g., from a tissue biopsy), measuring blood markers indicative of
  cancer, and detecting a genotype indicative of a cancer. However, a negative result in
  one or more of the above detection methods does not necessarily indicate the absence
  of cancer, e.g., a patient who has exhibited a complete response to a cancer treatment
  may still have a cancer, as evidenced by a subsequent relapse.

   [00621          In a specific example of the present disclosure, the cancer is
  lymphoma.
   [0063]          The term "lymphoma" as used herein refers to a malignant growth of B
  or T cells in the lymphatic system. "Lymphoma" includes numerous types of
  malignant growths, including Hodgkin's Lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
  The term "non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma" as used herein, refers to a malignant growth of
  B or T cells in the lymphatic system that is not a Hodgkin's Lymphoma (which is
  characterized, e.g., by the presence of Reed-Stenberg cells in the cancerous area).
  Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas encompass over 29 types of lymphoma, the distinctions
  between which are based on the type of cancer cells.
   [0064]          In a more specific example of the present disclosure, the cancer is a B
  lymphoma.
   [00651          Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds, compositions and methods
  of the disclosure are suitable for the treatment of a subject with B cell lymphoma.
   [0066]          Examples of B-cell lymphomas include, but are not limited to, for
  example, follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma,
  B-CLL/SLL, immunocytoma/Waldenstrom's,            and MALT-type/monocytoid B cell
   lymphoma. Also contemplated are the treatment of pediatric lymphomas such as
  Burkitt's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, precursor
  B-LBL, precursor T-LBL, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
   100671          The term "subject", as used herein, refers to an animal, and can
  include, for example, domesticated animals, such as cats, dogs, etc., livestock (e.g.,
  cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, etc.), laboratory animals (e.g., mouse, rabbit, rat,
  guinea pig, etc.), mammals, non-human mammals, primates, non-human primates,
  rodents, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and any other animal. In a specific example,
  the subject is a human.
   10068]         The term "treatment" or "treat" as used herein, refers to obtaining
  beneficial or desired results, including clinical results. Beneficial or desired clinical
  results can include, but are not limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or more

  compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. "Treating" and "treatment"
  as used herein also include prophylactic treatment. For example, a subject with early
  cancer, for example an early stage lymphoma, can be treated to prevent progression or
  alternatively a subject in remission can be treated with a compound or composition
  described herein to prevent recurrence.
   [00691         It is shown herein that B cell lymphoma cells express NMT1, but not
  NMT2. This is in contrast to the leukemic and other cells tested which express both
  NMTl and NMT2. (As shown in Figures 1 and 4)
   [00701         It is further shown herein that B lymphoma cells are sensitive to
  inhibition of cell viability by NMT inhibitors.
   100711         In one example, the NMT inhibitor is tris-dibenzylideneacetone
  dipalladium (Tris-DBA) (Figure 2)
   [00721         In other examples, the NMT inhibitor 2-hydroxymyristae (HMA) is
  used to inhibit B lymphoma cells.
   100731         In yet another example, the pyrazole sulphonamide inhibitor of T
  brucie NMT [J.A.Frearson et al (2010) Nature. 464.728-723)] ( DDD85646) is used
  to inhibit B lymphoma cells. (Figure 5).
   [0074]         In a specific example, treatment of a subject with B lymphoma
  comprises administering said subject with an NMT inhibitor.
  [00751          NMT inhibitor compounds or derivatives may be used in the present
  invention for the treatment of NMT2 deficient cancer.
  10076]          There term "deficient" as used herein refers broadly to inhibition,
  reduction or elimination of (as compared to wild type or control samples), for
  example, NMT synthesis, levels, activity, or function, as well as inhibition of the
  induction or stimulation of synthesis, levels, activity, or function of the protein of
  NMT (for example NMT 1 or NMT2).            The term also refers to any metabolic or
  regulatory pathway which can regulate the synthesis, levels, activity, or function of
  NMT. The term includes also includes inhibition, reduction or elimination resulting
  form binding with other molecules and complex formation.           Therefore, the term
  "NMT deficient" refers to that which results in the inhibition, reduction,           or
  elimination of protein function or protein pathway function. However, the term does

  not imply that each and every one of these functions must be inhibited at the same
  time.
  [0077]          In some examples, a cancer may be identified as being deficient in
  NMT by determining the presence of a mutation in a NMT gene. Such methods of
  nucleic acid detection and amplification are well known to the skilled worker.
   [0078]         For example the nucleic acid to be amplified may be from a biological
  sample. Various methods (such as phenol and chloroform extraction) of extraction are
  suitable for isolating the DNA or RNA. Nucleic acid extracted from a sample can be
  amplified using nucleic acid amplification techniques well known in the art. Non
  limiting examples include chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase polymerase
  chain reaction (RT-PCR), nested PCR, ligase chain reaction, amplifiable RNA
  reporters, Q-beta replication, transcription-based      amplification, boomerang DNA
  amplification, strand displacement activation, cycling probe technology, isothermal
  nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA), or other sequence replication
  assays or signal amplification assays may also be used.
   [00791         Methods of amplification are well-known in the art. Some methods
  employ reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA.
   [0080]         In one example, PCR is used to amplify a target sequence of interest,
  e.g., a NMT2 sequence.
  [0081]          Nucleic acids may be amplified prior to detection or may be detected
  directly   during   an   amplification  step,    e.g., "real-time"   methods.  In  some
  embodiments, the target sequence is amplified using a labeled primer such that the
  resulting amplicon is detectably labeled. In some embodiments, the primer is
  fluorescently labeled. In some embodiments, the target sequence is amplified and the
  resulting amplicon is detected by electrophoresis.
  100821          The level of gene expression can be determined by assessing the
  amount of NMT2 mRNA in a sample. Methods of measuring mRNA in samples are
  known in the art. To measure mRNA levels, the cells in the samples can be lysed and
  the levels of mRNA in the lysates or in RNA purified or semi-purified from lysates
  can be measured by any variety of methods familiar to those in the art. Such methods
  include, without limitation, hybridization assays using detectably labeled DNA or
  RNA probes, e.g., northern blotting, or quantitative or semi-quantitative RT-PCR
  methodologies using appropriate oligonucleotide primers. Alternatively, quantitative
                                            - 11 -

  or semi-quantitative in situ hybridization assays can be carried out using, for example,
  tissue sections, or unlysed cell suspensions, and detectably labeled, e.g., fluorescent,
  or enzyme-labeled, DNA or RNA probes. Additional methods for quantifying mRNA
  include RNA protection assay ("RPA"), cDNA and oligonucleotide microarrays,
  representation difference analysis ("RDA"), differential display, EST sequence
  analysis, serial analysis of gene expression ("SAGE"), and multiplex ligation
  mediated amplification with the Luminex FlexMAP ("LMF").
  [0083]          Amplification can also be monitored using "real-time" methods. Real
  time PCR allows for the detection and quantitation of a nucleic acid target. Typically,
  this approach to quantitative PCR utilizes a fluorescent dye, which may be a double
  strand specific dye, such as SYBR Green.RTM. I. Alternatively, other fluorescent
  dyes, e.g., FAM or HEX, may be conjugated to an oligonucleotide probe or a primer.
  Various instruments capable of performing real time PCR are known in the art. The
  fluorescent signal generated at each cycle of PCR is proportional to the amount of
  PCR product. A plot of fluorescence versus cycle number is used to describe the
  kinetics of amplification and a fluorescence threshold level is used to define a
  fractional cycle number related to initial template concentration. When amplification
  is performed and detected on an instrument capable of reading fluorescence during
  thennal cycling, the intended PCR product from non-specific PCR products can be
  differentiated using melting analysis. By measuring the change in fluorescence while
  gradually increasing the temperature of the reaction subsequent to amplification and
  signal generation it may be possible to detennine the (Act) of the intended product(s)
  as well as that of the nonspecific product.
  10084]          The methods may include amplifying multiple nucleic acids in sample,
  also known as "multiplex detection" or "multiplexing." As used herein, the term
  "multiplex PCR" refers to PCR, which involves adding more than one set of PCR
  primers to the reaction in order to detect and quantify multiple nucleic acids,
  including nucleic acids from one or more target gene markers. Furthermore,
  multiplexing with an internal control, e.g., 18s rRNA, GADPH, or beta.-actin)
  provides a control for the PCR without reaction.
  10085]          In some examples, a cancer may be identified as being deficient in
  NMT by determining epigenetic inactivation a NMT gene, or loss of the loss of
  protein function.

   [00861         In some examples, a cancer may be identified as being deficient in
   NMT by determining the activity of NMT (including NMT1 or NMT2) in a sample of
   cells from a subject. Activity may be determined relative to a control, for example in
   the case of defects in cancer cells, relative to non-cancerous cells, preferably from the
   same tissue. Thus, a cancer deficient in NMT may have reduced or eliminated NMT
   activity and/or expression.     The activity of NMT may be determined by using
   techniques well known in the art. In these examples, a cancer deficient in NMT has a
   reduced or eliminated activity.
   [0087]         In some examples, a cancer may be identified as NMT deficient by
   determining the amount, concentration and/or levels of NMT protein.
   [00881         In some examples, a cancer may be identified as NMT deficient by
   determining the amount of myristoylated proteins in a biological sample from a
   subject with cancer, or suspected of having cancer.       In this example, the presence,
   absence or amount of myristoylated protein can be determined, for example, using
   click chemistry using appropriate fatty acid analogs.         Non-limiting methods are
   described herein, in the Materials and Method. Alternate methods of determining the
  presence, absence, or amount of myristoylated proteins will be known to the skilled
  worker.    A sample which has a reduced amount myristoylated protein in a sample
   (optionally as compared to a control) is indicative of an NMT deficient sample, or
  NMT deficient cancer.
   [0089]         In some examples, a cancer may be identified as NMT deficient by
  determining the amount of the amount of acylation of proteins in a biological sample
  from a subject with cancer, or suspect of having cancer.            In this example, the
  presence, absence or amount of acylation of proteins can be detennined.              Such
  methods would be know to the skilled worker. A sample which as a reduced amount
  of acylation of proteins in a sample (optionally as compared to a control) is indicative
  of an NMT deficient sample, or NMT deficient cancer.
   10090]         In some examples, a cancer may be identified as a NMT deficient by
  determining the presence of one or more sequence variations such as mutations and
  polymorphisms may include a deletion, insertion or substitution of one or more
  nucleotides, relative to the wild-type nucleotide sequence. The one or more variations
  may be in a coding or non-coding region of the nucleic acid sequence and, may
  reduce or abolish the expression or function of NMT. Thus, the variant nucleic acid

  may encode a variant polypeptide which has reduced or abolished activity or may
  encode a wild-type polypeptide which has little or no expression within the cell, for
  example through the altered activity of a regulatory element.
  [00911           A variety of methods may be used for determining the presence or
  absence of a particular nucleic acid sequence in a sample obtained from a subject.
  [00921           In some examples, a cancer may be identified as NMT-deficient by
  assessing the level of expression or activity of a positive or negative regulator of
  NMT of a component of the NMT pathway. Expression levels may be determined,
  for example, by immunoassays, such as immoblotts and ELISA, and nucleic acid
  detection methods, such as RT-PCR, nanostring technology, RNA-seq, nucleic acid
  hybridisation or karyotypic analysis.
  [0093]           In some examples, a cancer may be identified as being deficient in
  NMT by determining the presence in a cell sample from the individual of one or more
  variations, for example, polymorphisms or mutations in NMT.
  [00941           Mutations and polymorphisms associated with cancer may also be
  detected at the protein level by detecting the presence of a variant (i.e. a mutant or
  allelic variant) polypeptide.
  [00951           In another example, there is provided a method a treating a subject
  with cancer, wherein said cancer comprises cancer cells which are deficient in NMT2,
  comprising administering to said subject an NMT inhibitor and/or an NMT1 inhibitor.
  [0096]           The term "inhibit" or "inhibitor" as used herein, refers to any method
  or technique which inhibits protein synthesis, levels, activity, or function, as well as
  methods of inhibiting the induction or stimulation of synthesis, levels, activity, or
  function of the protein of interest, for example NMT2.      The term also refers to any
  metabolic or regulatory pathway which can regulate the synthesis, levels, activity, or
  function of the protein of interest. The term includes binding with other molecules and
  complex formation. Therefore, the tenn "inhibitor" refers to any agent or compound,
  the application of which results in the inhibition of protein function or protein
  pathway function. However, the term does not imply that each and every one of these
  functions must be inhibited at the same time.

  Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage etc., is within the responsibility of
   general practitioners and other medical doctors, and typically takes account of the
   disorder to be treated, the condition of the individual patient, the site of delivery, the
  method of administration and other factors known to practitioners.

  or which is suspected of containing cancer cells, which can be assayed for gene
  expression levels, proteins levels, enzymatic activity levels, and the like. The sample
  may include, for example, a blood sample, a fractionated blood sample, a bone
  marrow sample, a biopsy, a frozen tissue sample, a fresh tissue specimen, a cell
  sample, and/or a paraffin embedded section, material from which RNA can be
  extracted in sufficient quantities and with adequate quality to permit measurement of

   [001211       The determination, analysis or measurement of NMT1 or NMT2, or
  the presence or absence of NMTl and/or NMT2 can be correlated with the benefit of
  NMT1-inhibtor or NMT2-inhibitor treatment of cancer in the patient.

  or the presence or absence of myristolyated proteins can be correlated with the benefit
  of NMT1 -inhibtor or NMT2-inhibitor treatment of cancer in the patient.
   100123]       In a specific example, antibodies of the present invention are
  immunoreactive or immunospecific for, and therefore specifically and selectively bind
  to a protein of interest, for example the protein NMT1 or NMT2.          In one example,
  antibodies which are immunoreactive and immunospecific for human NMT1                 or
  NMT2 can be used.          Antibodies for human NMTI          or NMT2 are preferably
  immunospecific. The term "antibody" and "antibodies" includes, but is not limited to,
  monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
   [00124]       In    another   example,   antibodies  of the    present    invention are
  immunoreactive or immunospecific for, and therefore specifically and selectively bind
  to both NMT1        and NMT2 protein.         In this example, antibodies which are
  immunoreactive and immunospecific for both human NMTl and NMT2 can be used.
  Antibodies for human NMTl and NMT2 are preferably immunospecific. In this
  example, and owing to the different molecular mass of NMTl and NMT2, it is
  possible identify the presence or absence of both proteins using a single antibody,
  using, for example SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.              The term "antibody" and
  "antibodies" includes, but is not limited to, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
   [001251       The term "binds specifically" refers to high avidity and/or high affinity
  binding of an antibody to a specific polypeptide e.g., an epitope of NMTl or NMT2.

  Antibody binding to its epitope on this specific polypeptide is stronger than binding of
  the same antibody to any other epitope, particularly those which may be present in
  molecules in association with, or in the same sample, as the specific polypeptide of
  interest.   Antibodies which bind specifically to a polypeptide of interest may be
  capable of binding other polypeptides at weak, yet detectable, level.        Such weak
  binding, or background binding, is readily discernable from the specific antibody
  binding to the compound or polypeptide of interest, e.g., by use of appropriate
  controls, as would be known to the worker skilled in the art.
   1001261         In one example, a sample containing cancerous cells or suspected as
  containing cancerous cells is obtained from a subject with cancer. Collection of such
  a sample is well known to the skilled worker. In a specific example, the sample is a
  blood sample. Methods of obtaining a sample sample, processing and/or storage of
   such a sample are also well known to the skilled worker.
   [001271         In a specific example, the detection, analysis or measurement of NMTI
   or NMT2 protein within a sample is carried out using immunohistochemistry. It will
  be clear to the skilled worker that other immuno assays, both qualitative or
   quantitative, may be used in the present invention.
   [00128]          Other examples that may be used in the detection, analysis or
  measurement of NMT1 or NMT2 include, but are not limited to, immunoblotting,
   ELISA,       indirect    immuno-fluorescence,       multiplexing    bead    technology,

   patient for the presence or absence or amount of NMTI and/or NMT2 activity. In this

  [00134]        In another example, a method of the present disclosure comprises
  identifying a mutation, deletion, or the like, in the NMTl or NMT2 gene in a sample
  from a subject with cancer or suspect of having cancer.       Wherein, said mutation,
  deletion, or the like, in NMTI or NMT2 gene results in a loss of diminishment of
  NMT1 or NMT2 protein activity in cancer cells within said sample.         Methods of
  identifying such mutations, deletions, or the like, in NMT1 or NMT2 are known to the
  skilled worker, and include, but are not limited to, RFLP, RT-PCT, microarray
  analysis, and/or any suitable type of DNA sequencing. In practice, in the example in
  which a patient sample is detennined to have a mutation, deletion, or the like, in
  NMT2 which results in a low or absent NMT2 protein activity, the subject is
  considered a good candidate for NMT-inhibitor therapy.

  100136]         In another example, a method of the present disclosure, there is
  provided a method for the treatment of a subject suffering from cancer, associated
  with a defect in NMTl or NMT2, comprising administering to said subject an
  inhibitor of NMT.
   100137]         Examples of inhibitors include, but are not limited to, small molecules,
  antibodies, peptide fragments, and/or nucleic acid molecules.
   [001381         Specific examples of small molecules include Tris-DBA, HMA,
  DDD85646, and their derivatives. The term "derivatives" as used herein includes, but
  is not limited to, salts, coordination complexes, esters such as in vivo hydrolysable
  esters, free acids or bases, hydrates, prodrugs or lipids, coupling partners.
   [00139]         Peptide fragments may be prepared wholly or partly by chemical
  synthesis that active site of NMTI. Peptide fragments can be prepared according to
  established, standard liquid or solid-phase peptide synthesis methods, which will be
  known to the skilled worker.
   [001401         Nucleic acid inhibitors, or the complements thereof, inhibit activity or
   function by down-regulating production of active polypeptide. This can be monitored
  using conventional methods well known in the art, for example by screening using
  real time PCR as described in the examples.
   [001411         Examples of nucleic acid inhibitors include anti-sense or RNAi
  technology, the use of which is to down-regulate gene expression is well-established
   in the art.    Anti-sense oligonucleotides may be designed to hybridise to the
   complementary sequence of nucleic acid, pre-mRNA or mature mRNA, interfering
   with the production of the base excision repair pathway component so that its
   expression is reduced or completely or substantially completely prevented. In addition
   to targeting coding sequence, anti- sense techniques may be used to target control
   sequences of a gene, e.g. in the 5' flanking sequence, whereby the anti-sense
   oligonucleotides can interfere with expression control sequences.
   [00142]         An alternative to anti-sense is to use a copy of all or part of the target
   gene inserted in sense, that is the same, orientation as the target gene, to achieve
  reduction in expression of the target gene by co-suppression.

  [001431         Additionally, double stranded RNA (dsRNA) silencing may be used.
  dsRNA mediated silencing is gene specific and is often termed RNA interference
  (RNAi).
  [001441         In another example, nucleic acid is used which on transcription
  produces a ribozyme, able to cut nucleic acid at a specific site and therefore also
  useful in influencing NMT.
  [001451         In yet another example, small RNA molecules may b e employed to
  regulate gene expression.     These include targeted degradation o f mRNAs by small
  interfering   RNAs      (siRNAs),    post    transcriptional  gene  silencing   (PTGs),
  developmentally regulated sequence-specific translational repression of mRNA by
  micro-RNAs (miRNAs) and targeted transcriptional gene silencing.
  [00146]         In yet another example, the expression of a short hairpin RNA
  molecule (shRNA) in the cell may be used.           A shRNA consists of short inverted
  repeats separated by a small loop sequence. One inverted repeat is complimentary to
  the gene target. In the cell the shRNA is processed by DICER into a siRNA which
  degrades the target NMT gene mRNA and suppresses expression. In a preferred
  embodiment the shRNA is produced endogenously (within a cell) by transcription
  from a vector.
  1001471         A defect in NMT1 or NMT2 is a NMTl or NMT2 deficient phenotype
  which may be deficient in a component of a NMTI or NMT2 mediated pathway i.e.,
  expression of activity of a component of the pathway may be reduced or abolished in
  the cancer cell relative to control cells. In some embodiments, the cancer cell may be
  deficient in NMTI or NMT2 i.e., expression of activity of NMTl or NMT2 may be
  reduced or abolished in the cancer cell relative to control cells.
  1001481         Accordingly, there is provided the use of NMT2 as a marker for one or
  more of diagnosis, prognosis, classifying, or monitoring of cancer in a subject. In
  some examples, NMT2 is said measured using an assay selected from immunoassays
  or nucleic acid detection, or protein activity.
  1001491         There is also provided the use of protein myristoylation as a marker for
  one or more of diagnosis, prognosis, classifying or monitoring cancer in a subject.
  1001501         There is also provided the use of protein acylation as a marker for one
  or more of diagnosis, prognosis, classifying or monitoring cancer in a subject.

  preferably contains the composition.      Such a kit preferably contains instructions for

  resuspended in 0.25 M sucrose buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4) and subjected to 2
  rounds of sonication at level 6.0 on a Branson Sonicator. Reaction mixture is

   [001721        A sample which has a reduced amount myristoylated protein in a
   sample (optionally as compared to a control) is indicative of an NMT deficient
  sample, or NMT deficient cancer.         Such an NMT deficient cancer is suitable to
  treatment with an inhibitor or NMTL.

  Various B and T cells were incubated for 24h with increasing concentration of Tris
  DBA. Cell viability was measured using trypan blue exclusion method and adjusted to
   100% for control. Cell survival curves measured by trypan blue exclusion show that
  B cell lymphornas are more sensitive to the NMT inhibitor tris-dibenzylideneacetone

  cellular debris. Cells in the supernatant were allowed to recover for 6 hours in complete
  RPMI. After a PBS wash, cells were resuspended and grown in RPMI containing
  TrisDBA (5ug/ml) for 24hours then counted using the trypan blue exclusion method

  [001861         In this example, qRT-PCR was performed with Taqman NMT1 and
  NIT2 probes using an 18S probe as an internal control. The difference in the number of
  cycle times (Act) was calculated by subtracting the cycle time (ct) at which we see an
  exponential increase in the expression of the 18S internal control for each cell type from
  the NMT cycle time, again at a point where exponential increase of the signal is seen. As
  shown in Table 1, below, the ratio of NMT2 to NMIT1 expression is decreased (up to 60
  fold) in B lymphoma cell lines. While not wishing to be bound by theory, these results
  may suggest that that a reduction in mRNA encoding for NMT2 may be responsible for
  the reduction of NMT 2 protein levels assessed by Western blotting.
