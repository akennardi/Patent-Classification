Description
AREA ISOLATION SYSTEM
Technical Field
[0001]      The present disclosure relates generally to remote control of a machine and, more
particularly, relates to a remote operation of machines used in mining, earth moving, or the like.
Background
[0002]      Many machines used in the earth-moving, construction, mining, and agricultural
industries operate in challenging environments. For example, some mining machines operate in
underground mines where the environment may be more challenging due to low tunnel
clearances and ground stability concerns surrounding the immediate area. In recent efforts to
improve safety at such worksite environments, trends have been to reduce the number of on-site
operators at these worksites by implementing machines that are remotely controlled from a
remote operator station (ROS).
[0003]      For machines employed at the physical worksite, the ROS may be positioned remote
from the machine at a safer location at or near the worksite or may be away from the worksite.
For example, the ROS may be positioned indoors in an office environment.
[0004]      United States Patent No. 6,616,244 (the '244 patent) discloses a method of
determining the position of unmanned mining vehicles, as well as a measuring vehicle. The
method and vehicle of the '244 patent provide for a marking device, such as a paint sprayer, that
provides a mine gallery with control marks. While beneficial, a better system is needed.
Summary
[0005]      In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, an area isolation system (AIS) is
provided. The AIS may include a barrier adjacent to a work area, a barrier control panel (BCP)
operatively connected to and disposed proximate the barrier, the BCP including a BCP controller
in communication with a BCP short-range transceiver, the BCP controller configured to control
the barrier, and a machine configured to autonomously operate within the work area. The
machine may include a remote shutdown module (RSM) having an RSM controller in
communication with an RSM short-range transceiver, and an RSM unique identifier
preprogrammed into a memory associated with the RSM controller. The RSM short-range

                                                   -2
transceiver may be configured to send signals indicative of the RSM unique identifier to the BCP
short-range transceiver when a machine radio zone associated with the RSM short-range
transceiver intercepts with a BCP radio zone associated with the BCP short-range transceiver.
[0006]      In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a method for autonomously
operating a plurality of machines in a worksite including an area isolation system (AIS) is
provided. The AIS may include an AIS controller, a plurality of barriers each surrounding at
least one work area, a barrier control panel (BCP) associated with each barrier, and a remote
shutdown module (RSM) disposed on each machine. Each BCP may include a BCP controller in
communication with a BCP short-range transceiver and the AIS controller. Each RSM may
include an RSM controller in communication with an RSM short-range transceiver, and an RSM
unique identifier preprogrammed into a memory associated with the RSM controller.
[0007]      The method may include moving a first machine of the plurality of machines towards
a first barrier of the plurality of barriers. The method may further include communicating, via
radio frequency, the RSM unique identifier from the RSM of the first machine to the BCP
associated with the first barrier, using the RSM short-range transceiver of the first machine and
the BCP short-range transceiver of the first barrier, when a machine radio zone associated with
the RSM short-range transceiver intercepts with a BCP radio zone associated with the BCP
short-range transceiver. The method may further include identifying the first machine based on
the RSM unique identifier. The moving, communicating, and identifying may be performed by
the AIS.
[0008]      In accordance with yet another aspect, a method for autonomously operating a
plurality of machines including an AIS is provided. The AIS may include an AIS controller, a
plurality of barriers each surrounding a work area, a BCP associated with each barrier, at least
one barrier sensor disposed proximate each barrier and operatively connected to the BCP, and a
RSM disposed on each machine. Each BCP may include a BCP controller in communication
with a BCP short-range transceiver and the AIS controller.
[0009]      A BCP unique identifier may be preprogrammed into a memory associated with the
BCP controller. The at least one barrier sensor may be configured to detect an incursion of the
barrier. The RSM may include an RSM controller in communication with an RSM short-range
transceiver and the AIS controller. The RSM unique identifier may be preprogrammed into a
memory associated with the RSM controller.

                                                    -3
[0010]      The method may include moving a first machine of the plurality of machines towards
a first barrier of the plurality of barriers, the moving being performed by the AIS controller. The
method may further include detecting a first incursion of the first barrier, the detecting being
performed by the at least one barrier sensor disposed proximate the first barrier. The method
may further include communicating, via radio frequency, the RSM unique identifier from the
RSM of the first machine to the BCP associated with the first barrier when a machine radio zone
associated with the RSM short-range transceiver intercepts with a BCP radio zone associated
with the BCP short-range transceiver. The communicating may be performed by the RSM short
range transceiver of the first machine and the BCP short-range transceiver of the first barrier.
[0011]      The method may further include sending signals indicative of the RSM unique
identifier of the first machine and the BCP unique identifier of the first barrier to the AIS
controller, the sending being performed by the BCP controller. The method may further include
determining an identity and a location of the first machine within a work area associated with the
first barrier based on the RSM unique identifier of the first machine and the BCP unique
identifier of the first barrier, the determining being performed by the AIS controller. The method
may further include detecting a second incursion of the first barrier of the plurality of barriers,
the detecting being performed by the at least one barrier sensor disposed proximate the first
barrier.
[0012]      The method may further include determining the second incursion to be of unknown
origin if a predetermined time period lapses without communication of an RSM unique identifier
to the BCP short-range transceiver of the BCP associated with the first barrier, the predetermined
time period being preprogrammed into a memory associated with the AIS controller. The
method may further include sending signals to the RSM of the first machine located in the work
area associated with the first barrier to shut down the machine. The determining and the sending
may be performed by the AIS controller.
[0013]      These and other aspects and features of the present disclosure will be more readily
understood upon reading the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the
accompanying drawings.

Description
[0023]      FIG. 1 illustrates one example of a machine 100 with which the control system 102 (as
seen in totality in the combination of FIGS. 2 - 3) of the present disclosure is utilized. The
exemplary machine 100 may be, but is not limited to, underground mining machines such as
underground load-haul-dump (LHD) loaders and underground mining trucks, backhoe loaders,

                                                 -5
skid steer loaders, wheel loaders, material loaders, motor graders, track-type tractors, landfill
compactors, excavators, and articulated trucks, to name a few, which are employed at a worksite.
[0024]     The exemplary machine 100 may include a body frame 104. The exemplary machine
100 may be supported on the ground by a plurality of wheels 106 (or track assemblies or the
like). An engine 108 may provide power to the wheels 106 via a transmission 107 and a
mechanical or electric drive drain. The end of the body frame 104 in which the engine 108 is
disposed may be referred to as the Engine End Frame (EEF) 109. The opposite end of the body
frame 104 may be referred to as the Non-Engine End Frame (NEEF) 111. The machine 100 may
include an implement 110. While the following detailed description and drawings are made with
reference to exemplary machine 100 that is an underground LHD loader 112 having an
implement 110 that is a bucket 114, which is mounted to the body frame 104 by a pair of lift
arms 116, the teachings of this disclosure may be employed on other machines 100.
[0025]     The exemplary machine 100 may be operated in one or more of the following modes:
(1) manually by an operator disposed in a cab 118 on the machine 100 ("manual mode"); (2)
remotely by an operator using video, audio or other positioning and machine-related information
to guide and control the machine 100 ("teleremote mode"); (3) remotely by an operator using a
mobile (e.g., handheld) remote control device within line of sight (LOS) of the machine ("LOS
mode") for LOS control of the machine 100; (4) semi-autonomously by a remote operator using
video, audio or other positioning information and machine information to guide the machine 100
as well as utilizing autonomous control for selected functions/operations of the machine 100
("semi-autonomous mode" or "guidance mode"); or (5) autonomously by a computer or
computer system ("autonomous mode"). With reference to "guidance mode," the guidance mode
may be an autonomous or semi-autonomous control mode in which steering, throttling, and/or
braking of the machine 100 is performed based on controller input from one or more sensors on
board the machine 100, such as a LADAR sensor.
[0026]     The control system 102 (FIGS. 2 - 3) disclosed herein includes a Machine Automation
System (MAS) 120 disposed on the machine 100 and an off-board system 122. The MAS 120
(FIG. 2) includes a plurality of Vehicle Electronic Control Modules (ECM)s 124, a local
transceiver 126, an Ethernet Local Area Network (LAN) 128, a first Controller Area Network
(CAN) 130, a second CAN 132, an Autonomy Electronic Control Module (AECM) 134, an
environment monitoring system 136, a Remote Shutdown Module (RSM) 138 and a service port
140. The MAS 120 may also include a data link (DL) 142. The MAS 120 may include one or

                                                 -6
more machine strobe light assemblies 144 disposed on the machine 100, an indicator light 284

vehicle health and utilization system (VHUS) 148 a positioning system 150, a first inertial
monitoring unit (IMU) 154, a second IMU 156, a keypad 158 and one or more line of sight
(LOS) transceivers 160. In some embodiments, the MAS 120 may also include a Tire
Monitoring System (TMS) transceiver 218.
[0027]     The off-board system 122 (primarily, FIG. 3) may include a ROS 164, an Area
Isolation System (AIS) Monitoring System 166, an off-board transceiver 168, an off-board Local
Area Network ("Off-board LAN") 170 and one or more LOS operator consoles 184 (see FIG. 2).
[0028]     Each Vehicle ECM 124 is disposed on the machine 100. The Vehicle ECMs 124
include a machine ECM 172, a transmission ECM 174, an implement ECM 176 and an engine
ECM 178. The Vehicle ECMs 124 may include an aftertreatment ECM 180 and a Heating
Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) ECM 182.
[0029]     The machine ECM 172 includes a processor 188a (FIG. 6), which may be
implemented by one or more microprocessors or other processors well-known in the art. The
processor 188a includes a local memory 190a and is in communication with a read-only memory
192a and a random access memory 194a via a bus 196a. The random access memory 194a may
be implemented by Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM), Dynamic
Random Access Memory (DRAM), RAMBUS Dynamic Random Access memory (RDRAM)
and/or any other type of random access memory device. The read-only memory 192a may be
implemented by a hard drive, flash memory and/or any other desired type of memory device.
The processor 188a is configured to execute machine-readable instructions and to generate
(output) control signals, based on received (input) control signals, to control movement of the
machine 100 and/or operation of the transmission ECM 174 (e.g., traction control, ride control,
power management, braking, throttling), to control operation of the implement ECM 176, to
actuate one or more horns, indicators (e.g., parking brake indicator) or the like disposed on the
machine 100, and to control illumination of the one or more machine strobe light assemblies 144
mounted on the machine 100. Such machine-readable instructions may be read into or
incorporated into a machine-readable medium such as, for example, the local memory 190a. In
alternative embodiments, hard wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with,
machine-readable instructions to implement a control method for the machine 100.

                                                 -7
[0030]     The (input) control signals to the machine ECM 172 may be received from the LOS
operator console 184 (via the (on-board) LOS transceiver 160 and the second CAN 132), or the
AECM 134 (FIG. 2). In addition, a safety control signal may be received by the machine ECM
172 from the RSM 138, as explained later herein. The control signals received from the AECM
134 may be based on control signals output by the ROS ECM 186 (FIG. 3), transmitted from the
off-board-transceiver 168 to the local transceiver 126 (FIG. 2), and then communicated to the
AECM 134 via the local router 162, first switch 206 and Ethernet LAN 128. In some examples,
the control signals received from the AECM 134 may be additionally or alternatively based on
input received by the AECM 134 from the environment monitoring system 136, as discussed in
more detail below. The machine ECM 172 is also configured to transmit data, including control
feedback, to the AECM 134 via the Ethernet LAN 128, the first CAN 130 or the second CAN
132.
[0031]     The term "machine-readable medium" as used herein refers to any non-transitory
medium or combination of media that participates in providing instructions to the processor 188a
described above, or other processors 188 described hereinafter, for execution. Such a machine
readable medium may comprise all machine-readable media except for a transitory, propagating
signal. Common forms of machine-readable media include any medium from which a processor
188 (FIG. 6) can read.
[0032]     The transmission ECM 174 (FIG. 2) includes a processor 188b (FIG. 6), which may be
implemented by one or more microprocessors or other processors well-known in the art. The
processor 188b includes a local memory 190b and is in communication with a read-only memory
192b and a random access memory 194b via a bus 196b. The random access memory 194b may
be implemented by Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM), Dynamic
Random Access Memory (DRAM), RAMBUS Dynamic Random Access memory (RDRAM)
and/or any other type of random access memory device. The read-only memory 192b may be
implemented by a hard drive, flash memory and/or any other desired type of memory device.
The processor 188b is configured to execute machine-readable instructions and to generate
(output) control signals, based on received (input) control signals, to control operation of the
transmission 107 (FIG. 1) (e.g. transmission speed, transmission mode (drive, reverse, parking
brake, neutral)), and related operations. Such machine-readable instructions may be read into or
incorporated into a machine-readable medium such as, for example, the local memory 190b
(FIG. 6). In alternative embodiments, hard wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in

                                                  -8
combination with, machine-readable instructions to implement a control method for the machine
100 (FIG. 1).
[0033]      The (input) control signals may be received by the transmission ECM 174 from the
LOS operator console 184 (via the (on-board) LOS transceiver 160 and the second CAN 132), or
the machine ECM 172 (FIG. 2). In addition, a safety control signal may be received by the
transmission ECM 174 from the RSM 138, as explained later herein. The control signals
received from the machine ECM 172 may be based on control signals output by the ROS ECM
186, transmitted from the off-board-transceiver 168 to the local transceiver 126, and then
communicated to the AECM 134 via the local router 162, first switch 206 and Ethernet LAN
128, and then communicated to the machine ECM 172. In some examples, the control signals
received from the AECM 134 may be additionally or alternatively based on input received by the
AECM 134 from the environment monitoring system 136, as discussed in more detail below. In
some embodiments, (output) control signals generated by the LOS operator console 184 may be
communicated to the transmission ECM 174 via the (on-board) LOS transceiver 160 and the
machine ECM 172. Control signals output by the machine ECM 172 may be communicated
from the machine ECM 172 to the transmission ECM 174 via the Ethernet LAN 128, the first
CAN 130, the second CAN 132 or the DL 142. The transmission ECM 174 is also configured to
transmit data, including control feedback, to the machine ECM 172.
[0034]      The implement ECM 176 includes a processor 188c (FIG. 6), which may be
implemented by one or more microprocessors or other processors well-known in the art. The
processor 188c includes a local memory 190c and is in communication with a read-only memory
192c and a random access memory 194c via a bus 196c. The random access memory 194c may
be implemented by Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM), Dynamic
Random Access Memory (DRAM), RAMBUS Dynamic Random Access memory (RDRAM)
and/or any other type of random access memory device. The read-only memory 192c may be
implemented by a hard drive, flash memory and/or any other desired type of memory device.
The processor 188c is configured to execute machine-readable instructions and to generate
(output) control signals, based on received (input) control signals, to control movement of the
implement 110 (FIG. 1), steering of the machine 100 and other machine 100 functions (e.g.,
lifting, holding the bucket 114 to retain a current position, floating the bucket 114 to hold the
bucket 114 above a defined limit, lowering the lift arms 116 with respect to the body frame 104,
tilting the bucket 114, turning on/off front and rear lights, steering the machine 100). Such
machine-readable instructions may be read into or incorporated into a machine-readable medium

                                                 -9
such as, for example, the local memory 190c (FIG. 6). In alternative embodiments, hard wired
circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, machine-readable instructions to
implement a control method for the machine 100.
[0035]     The (input) control signals may be received by the implement ECM 176 from the LOS
operator console 184 (via the (on-board) LOS transceiver 160 and the second CAN 132), or from
the machine ECM 172 (FIG. 2). The control signals received from the machine ECM 172 may
be based on control signals output by the ROS ECM 186, transmitted from the off-board
transceiver 168 to the local transceiver 126, and then communicated to the AECM 134 via the
local router 162, first switch 206 and Ethernet LAN 128, and then communicated to the machine
ECM 172. In some examples, the control signals received from the AECM 134 may be
additionally or alternatively based on input received by the AECM 134 from the environment
monitoring system 136, as discussed in more detail below. In some embodiments, (output)
control signals generated by the LOS operator console 184 may be communicated to the
implement ECM 176 via the (on-board) LOS transceiver 160 and the machine ECM 172.
Control signals may be communicated from the machine ECM 172 to the implement ECM 176
via the Ethernet LAN 128, the first CAN 130, the second CAN 132 or the DL 142. The
implement ECM 176 is also configured to transmit data, including control feedback, to the
machine ECM 172.
[0036]     The engine ECM 178 includes a processor 188d (FIG. 6), which may be implemented
by one or more microprocessors or other processors well-known in the art. The processor 188d
includes a local memory 190d and is in communication with a read-only memory 192d and a
random access memory 194d via a bus 196d. The random access memory 194d may be
implemented by Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM), Dynamic Random
Access Memory (DRAM), RAMBUS Dynamic Random Access memory (RDRAM) and/or any
other type of random access memory device. The read-only memory 192d may be implemented
by a hard drive, flash memory and/or any other desired type of memory device. The processor
188d is configured to execute machine-readable instructions and to generate (output) control
signals, based on received (input) control signals, to control operation of the engine 108 (FIG. 1)
(e.g. engine speed and acceleration). Such machine-readable instructions may be read into or
incorporated into a machine-readable medium such as, for example, the local memory 190d
(FIG. 6). In alternative embodiments, hard wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in
combination with, machine-readable instructions to implement a control method for the machine
100 (FIG. 1).

[0037]     The (input) control signals may be received from the LOS operator console 184 (via
the (on-board) LOS transceiver 160 and the second CAN 132), or from the machine ECM 172
(FIG. 2). The control signals received from the machine ECM 172 may be based on control
signals output by the ROS ECM 186, transmitted from the off-board-transceiver 168 to the local
transceiver 126, and then communicated to the AECM 134 via the local router 162, first switch
206 and Ethernet LAN 128, and then communicated from the AECM 134 to the machine ECM
172. In some examples, the control signals received from the AECM 134 may be additionally or
alternatively based on input received by the AECM 134 from the environment monitoring
system 136, as discussed in more detail below. In some embodiments, (output) control signals
generated by the LOS operator console 184 may be communicated to the engine ECM 178 via
the (on-board) LOS transceiver 160 and the machine ECM 172. In some embodiments (e.g., the
embodiment of FIG. 3) control signals may be communicated from the machine ECM 172 to the
engine ECM 178 via the first CAN 130 or the DL 142. In other embodiments, the MAS 120
may be so configured that control signals may be communicated from the machine ECM 172 to
the engine ECM 178 via the second CAN 132 or the Ethernet LAN 128. The engine ECM 178 is
also configured to transmit data, including control feedback, to the machine ECM 172.
[0038]     The aftertreatment ECM 180 includes a processor 188e (FIG. 6), which may be
implemented by one or more microprocessors or other processors well-known in the art. The
processor 188e includes a local memory 190e and is in communication with a read-only memory
192e and a random access memory 194e via a bus 196e. The random access memory 194e may
be implemented by Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM), Dynamic
Random Access Memory (DRAM), RAMBUS Dynamic Random Access memory (RDRAM)
and/or any other type of random access memory device. The read-only memory 192e may be
implemented by a hard drive, flash memory and/or any other desired type of memory device.
The processor 188e is configured to execute machine-readable instructions and to generate
(output) control signals, based on received (input) control signals, to control emissions for of the
machine 100 (FIG. 1). Such machine-readable instructions may be read into or incorporated into
a machine-readable medium such as, for example, the local memory 190e (FIG. 6). In
alternative embodiments, hard wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with,
machine-readable instructions to implement a control method for the machine 100 (FIG. 1).
[0039]     The (input) control signals may be received from the machine ECM 172 (FIG. 2). In
an embodiment (for example the embodiment of FIG. 3), control signals may be communicated

                                                 -11
from the machine ECM 172 to the aftertreatment ECM 180 via the first CAN 130 or the DL 142.
In other embodiments, the MAS 120 may be configured such that control signals may be
communicated from the machine ECM 172 to the aftertreatment ECM 180 via the second CAN
132 or the Ethernet LAN 128. The aftertreatment ECM 180 is also configured to transmit data,
including control feedback, to the machine ECM 172.
[0040]     The HVAC ECM 182 includes a processor 188f (FIG. 6), which may be implemented
by one or more microprocessors or other processors well-known in the art. The processor 188f
includes a local memory 190f and is in communication with a read-only memory 192f and a
random access memory 194f via a bus 196f. The random access memory 194f may be
implemented by Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM), Dynamic Random
Access Memory (DRAM), RAMBUS Dynamic Random Access memory (RDRAM) and/or any
other type of random access memory device 194f. The read-only memory 192f may be
implemented by a hard drive, flash memory and/or any other desired type of memory device.
The processor 188f is configured to execute machine-readable instructions and to generate
(output) control signals, based on received (input) control signals, to control operation of the
heating, ventilation or air conditioning for the machine 100 (FIG. 1). Such machine-readable
instructions may be read into or incorporated into a machine-readable medium such as, for
example, the local memory 190f (FIG. 6). In alternative embodiments, hard wired circuitry may
be used in place of, or in combination with, machine-readable instructions to implement a control
method for the machine 100 (FIG. 1).
[0041]     The (input) control signals may be received from the LOS operator console 184 (via
the (on-board) LOS transceiver 160 and the second CAN 132), or from the machine ECM 172
(FIG. 2). The control signals received from the machine ECM 172 may be based on control
signals output by the ROS ECM 186, transmitted from the off-board-transceiver 168 to the local
transceiver 126, and then communicated to the AECM 134 via the local router 162, first switch
206 and Ethernet LAN 128, and then communicated from the AECM 134 to the machine ECM
172. In some examples, the control signals received from the AECM 134 may be additionally or
alternatively based on input received by the AECM 134 from the environment monitoring
system 136, as discussed in more detail below. In some embodiments, (output) control signals
generated by the LOS operator console 184 may be communicated to the HVAC ECM 182 via
the (on-board) LOS transceiver 160 and the machine ECM 172. In some embodiments (for
example, the embodiment of FIG. 3), control signals may be communicated from the machine
ECM 172 to the HVAC ECM 182 via the first CAN 130. In other embodiments, the MAS 120

                                                -12
may be so configured that control signals may be communicated from the machine ECM 172 to
the HVAC ECM 182 via the Ethernet LAN 128, the second CAN 132 or the DL 142. The
HVAC ECM 182 is also configured to transmit data, including control feedback, to the machine
ECM 172.
[0042]     The local transceiver 126 may be disposed on the remotely operated machine 100. In
one embodiment, the local transceiver 126 may be an Ethemet-compatible, wireless radio. The
local transceiver 126 may include one or more antennas 141. The local transceiver 126 is in
operable communication with the off-board transceiver 168, a local router 162 (discussed herein
below) and the RSM 138. In one embodiment, the local transceiver 126 is in wireless
communication with the off-board transceiver 168, and may be in communication with the local
router 162 and the RSM 138 via the Ethernet LAN 128.
[0043]     The local transceiver 126 is configured to receive (wirelessly) control signals, safety
signals and data from the off-board transceiver 168 (FIG. 3), and is configured to transmit data
from the MAS 120 (FIG. 2) to the off-board transceiver 168 (FIG. 3). The received control
signals may be generated by a ROS ECM 186 (based on operator input received from the second
and third interface devices 228, 230 and the first and second input devices 246, 248) and may
control the operation of the machine 100 (FIG. 1) and its systems (e.g., the environment
monitoring system 136 (FIG. 2)). Some received control signals (for example, a safety signal)
may be generated by a machine shutdown module 264 of the AIS Monitoring System 166 (FIG.
3).
[0044]     The data transmitted by the local transceiver 126 (FIG. 2) to the off-board transceiver
168 (FIG. 3) may include video data (captured by one or more IP cameras 198), audio data
(captured by the microphone 200) related to the operation of the machine 100 (FIG. 1) and the
work area adjacent to the machine 100, positional and distance measurement information from
the LADARs 202 (FIG. 2), machine 100 operational or health related data, and other information
collected and transmitted to the off-board system 122 for monitoring/logging by the ROS ECM
186 (FIG. 3), or display/replaying (e.g., video data and audio data) on, for example, the first,
second or third interface devices 226, 228, 230. The video data may include video of the work
area in which the machine 100 is positioned/operating.
[0045]     The local transceiver 126 and the off-board transceiver 168 act as a bridge between the
MAS 120 and the off-board system 122. In one embodiment, the local transceiver 126 (FIG. 2)

                                                 -13
is configured to support multiple Service Set Identifiers (SSID), thus allowing the local
transceiver 126 to function on multiple subnetworks within the MAS 120. In an embodiment,
the local transceiver 126 may be configured to utilize Multi-in Multi-out (MIMO) 802.1 IN
technology, which provides improved bandwidth and signal integrity when compared to a
Single-In Single-Out 802.1 IG radio operating in diversity mode. In such an embodiment, the
antennas 141 may be, for example, dual band MIMO (2.4/5 GHZ) antennas. The local
transceiver 126 is also configured to support Profinet. As is known in the art, Profinet defines the
communication with field connected peripheral devices. Its basis is a cascading real-time
concept. Profinet may be used to define the data exchange between controllers and devices, as
well as parameter setting and diagnosis.
[0046]      The Ethernet LAN 128 (FIG. 2) is disposed on the machine 100 and is configured to
enable operative communication between the AECM 134, the machine ECM 172, the
transmission ECM 174, the implement ECM 176, the service port 140, the first display 146, the
RSM 138, the positioning system 150, the environment monitoring system 136 and the local
transceiver 126. The Ethernet LAN 128 may include a plurality of communication channels 204,
the local router 162, a first switch 206 and a second switch 208. In one embodiment, the
Ethernet LAN 128 may operate at 100 base-T.
[0047]      In some examples, such as the example depiction of FIG. 5, components of the
Ethernet LAN 128 or any components connected by the Ethernet LAN 128 (e.g., the first switch
206, the local router 162, and the second switch 208) are disposed within or proximate to the cab
118 of the machine 100. For example, as depicted schematically in FIG. 5, the local router 162,
the first switch 206, and the second switch 208 are located within the cab 118. In some such
examples, elements of or associated with the Ethernet LAN 128 may be contained within a cab
headliner of the cab 118. By positioning elements of the Ethernet LAN 128 within the cab 118,
operators and/or technicians of the machine 100 are allowed easier ingress to the Ethernet LAN
128 for both repair and scalability purposes. Further, by disposing the Ethernet LAN 128 within
the cab 118, the Ethernet LAN 128 and associated elements may be protected from heat and/or
dirt ingress and, thereby, may be protected from wear.
[0048]      The local router 162 is disposed on the machine 100 and includes a local router
processor 210. The local router 162 is in operable communication via communication channels
204 (of the Ethernet LAN 128) with the local transceiver 126, the first switch 206, the RSM 138
and the second switch 208. The local router 162 is also in operable communication with the

                                                 -14
AECM 134 and the environment monitoring system 136 via the first switch 206 and the
communication channels 204. The local router 162 is in operable communication with the
machine ECM 172, the service port 140, the first display 146 and the positioning system 150 via
the second switch 208 and the communication channels 204.
[0049]     The local router 162 is configured to manage data traffic on the Ethernet LAN 128 and
to convert serial data to Ethernet Internet Protocol (IP)/ Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
packets and vice versa. Such conversion allows serial data from third party systems to be accessed
on the Ethernet LAN 128.
[0050]     The local router 162 is configured to receive the control signals/safety signals,
generated by either the ROS ECM 186 (FIG. 3) or the AIS Monitoring System 166, from the
local transceiver 126 (FIG. 2) and to transmit such control/safety signals via the communication
channels 204 to the AECM 134. The local router 162 also receives input control or safety
signals from the RSM 138. The local router 162 receives data from the AECM 134 and from the
environment monitoring system 136 (e.g., video data, audio data, and positional and distance
measurement information) via the first switch 206. The local router 162 receives data from one
or more Vehicle ECMs 124, the service port 140, the first display 146, the VHUS 148 and the
positioning system 150 via the second switch 208.
[0051]     The first switch 206 is disposed on the machine 100 and is in operable communication
with at least the local router 162, the environment monitoring system 136 (IP cameras 198,
microphone 200 and LADARs 202) and the AECM 134 via the communication channels 204 of
the Ethernet LAN 128. The first switch 206 is configured to transmit and receive control
signals/safety signals from the local router 162, and data from, at least, the environment
monitoring system 136 and the AECM 134. The first switch 206 is configured to transmit data
only to the one or more devices for which the message was intended. The second switch 208 is
disposed on the machine 100 and is in operable communication with the machine ECM 172 via
the communication channels 204 of the Ethernet LAN 128.
[0052]     As shown in greater detail in the illustration of FIG. 4, the first switch 206 is
configured to include a plurality of Ethernet input ports 201, wherein one or more of the Ethernet
input ports 201 may have a specific device of the MAS 120 assigned to it for data
communication. Accordingly, the first switch 206 may have Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) address assignments which allow such devices, for example the IP cameras

                                                -15
198, LADARs 202, the AECM 134, and/or the local router 162, to be fitted or replaced without
manually configuring static IP addresses. DHCP is a standardized network protocol used for
dynamically distributing network configuration parameters, such as IP addresses, reducing the
need for a user to configure such parameters manually.
[0053]      The plurality of communication channels 204 are configured to transfer control
signals/safety control signals or data between two points, for example, between devices
connected to the communication channels 204. In addition to that described above, at least one
communication channel 204 is disposed between the machine ECM 172 and the transmission
ECM 174 and another communication channel 204 is also disposed between the transmission
ECM 174 and the implement ECM 176. The first display 146 may also be in communication
with the VHUS 148 (including any associated wireless interface for the VHUS 148) via one of
the communication channels 204 of the Ethernet LAN 128.
[0054]      The first CAN 130 is disposed on the machine 100 and enables operative
communication between the AECM 134, the machine ECM 172, the transmission ECM 174, the
implement ECM 176, the service port 140, the engine ECM 178, the aftertreatment ECM 180,
the first display 146, the HVAC ECM 182, the VHUS 148, and the TMS transceiver 218.
[0055]      The second CAN 132 is disposed on the machine 100. The second CAN 132 includes
a plurality of segments 214. The first segment 214a of the plurality enables operative
communication between the AECM 134, the machine ECM 172, the LOS transceiver(s) 160, a
first IMU 154 and a second IMU 156. The second segment 214b enables operative
communication between the engine ECM 178 and the aftertreatment ECM 180. The third
segment 214c enables operative communication between the keypad 158, the transmission ECM
174, the implement ECM 176 and the first display 146.
[0056]      The DL 142 is disposed on the machine 100. The machine ECM 172, the transmission
ECM 174, the implement ECM 176, the service port 140, the engine ECM 178 and the
aftertreatment ECM 180, the local router 162 and the VHUS 148 are in operative communication
via the DL 142.
[0057]      The AECM 134 is disposed on the machine 100. The AECM 134 includes a processor
188g which may be implemented by one or more microprocessors or other processors well
known in the art. The processor 188g includes a local memory 190g and is in communication

                                                -16
with a read-only memory 192g and a random access memory 194g via a bus 196g. The random
access memory 194g may be implemented by Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory
(SDRAM), Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), RAMBUS Dynamic Random Access
memory (RDRAM) and/or any other type of random access memory device. The read-only
memory 192g may be implemented by a hard drive, flash memory and/or any other desired type
of memory device. The processor 188g is configured to execute machine-readable instructions
and to generate (output) control signals, based on received (input) control signals and/or signals
received from the environment monitoring system 136, to control operation of the machine 100
and one or more of the Vehicle ECMs 124. Such machine-readable instructions may be read into
or incorporated into a machine-readable medium such as, for example, the local memory 190g.
In alternative embodiments, hard wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with,
machine-readable instructions to implement a control method for the machine 100.
[0058]      The AECM 134 is in operable communication with the environment monitoring
system 136 and the local router 162 via the first switch 206 and communication channels 204.
Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 2, the AECM 134 is in operable communication with the RSM
138, the local transceiver 126, one or more Vehicle ECMs 124, the service port 140, the first
display 146, the positioning system 150 and the VHUS 148 via the Ethernet LAN 128.
[0059]      In addition, the AECM 134 is in operable communication with the Vehicle ECMs 124,
the service port 140, the first display 146, VHUS 148 and the TMS transceiver 218 via the first
CAN 130. The AECM 134 is also in operable communication with the machine ECM 124, the
first IMU 154, the second IMU 156, the LOS operator console 184 and associated LOS
transceiver 160, via one or more segments 214 of the second CAN 132.
[0060]      The AECM 134 is configured to receive the control signals and data via the local
router 162 and/or the first switch 206. Additionally, the AECM 134 is configured to receive
positioning data from the LADARs 202 of the environment monitoring system 136 via the first
switch 206. The AECM 134 may also receive control signals from the service port 140. The
control signals may be generated by the ROS ECM 186 (FIG. 3), the AIS Monitoring System
166 or the keypad 158.
[0061]      The AECM 134 is further configured to process the control signals and data. The
AECM 134 is configured to generate (output) control signals based on the processed control
signals and data, and to transmit such control signals to the environment monitoring system 136,

                                                 -17
the first display 146 or one or more of the Vehicle ECMs 124, wherein the control signals control
an operation of, or on, the machine 100. The control signals generated by the AECM 134 may
be generated, at least in part, based on positioning information provided to the AECM 134 by
one or more LADARs 202 when the machine 100 is configured to operate in an autonomous,
semi-autonomous, or guidance mode of operation. When such control signals are received by
the Vehicle ECMs 124, such Vehicle ECMs 124 then implement the instructions/commands of
the control signal from the AECM 134.
[0062]      By way of explanation, the Vehicle ECMs 124 implement control signals from the
AECM 134 that are based on operator input to the ROS 164 and/or positioning information
provided by the LADAR(s) 202, but they also monitor and regulate certain functions on the
machine 100. Thus, advanced machine control features, such as traction control, ride control,
power control and the like, will still operate while the machine 100 (FIG. 1) is under teleremote,
semi-autonomous, autonomous, and/or guidance control by the operator and receiving control
signals from the ROS ECM 186 (FIG. 3) that are based on operator input to the input devices
246, 248. For example, the AECM 134 (FIG. 2) may transmit a control signal that instructs the
machine ECM 172 to apply braking. While the machine ECM 172, in response to the control
signal, may actuate the brakes, the machine ECM 172 may still continue to implement power
management (an advanced machine control feature). In another scenario, the AECM 134 may
transmit a control signal that instructs the machine ECM 172 to steer the wheels 106 toward the
right. The machine ECM 172 may generate and transmit, in response to such control signal, a
control signal to the implement ECM 176 to actuate steering of the wheels 106 (by the
implement ECM 176) toward the right but still continues to generate control signals that
implement traction control (an advanced machine control feature) on the machine 100.
[0063]      The AECM 134 may receive data from one or more Vehicle ECMs 124, the first
display 146, the VHUS 148 and the positioning system 150 via the second switch 208 (the local
router 162 and the first switch 206) of the Ethernet LAN 128. The AECM 134 is also configured
to receive data captured by various sensors 220 disposed on the machine 100 (e.g., linear
position sensors 220a, the first and second IMUs 212, 216, engine and transmission speed
sensors 220b, 220c, and the like). The AECM 134 receives data (via the Ethernet LAN 128, the
first CAN 130 or second CAN 132) from the linear position sensors 220a and uses such data to
determine the steering articulation angle and the implement lift and tilt angle. The AECM 134
receives data from the first IMU 212 (in one embodiment, via the second CAN 130) and the
second IMU 216 (in one embodiment, via the second CAN 132) and uses such data to determine

                                                -18
acceleration and machine inclination angle. In an embodiment, the first IMU 212 may be
disposed on the engine end-frame 109 and the second IMU 216 may be disposed on the non
engine end frame 111. The AECM 134 receives data from the engine and transmission speed
sensors 220 (b-c) to determine engine revolutions per minute (RPM) and machine ground speed.
The AECM 134 is configured to determine machine direction, implement position and machine
mode. In teleremote, semi-autonomous, guidance, or autonomous modes, when the remote
operator is controlling the machine, the maximum available gear may be restricted. For
example, the machine 100 may be limited to operation in first and second gear. The AECM 134
is also configured to control certain (machine 100) functions, such as ground condition
monitoring, automatic steering/turning (when activated by the operator) etc. The AECM 134 is
also configured to forward certain operator requests for advanced control features from the ROS
ECM 186 to the appropriate Vehicle ECMs 124 (e.g., automatic dig position). When automatic
dig position is requested/enabled, the depth and loading of the bucket 114 (ground engaging
work tool) in a material is automatically controlled by the machine 100 in response to a
productivity value. The AECM 134 may also be configured to provide data to payload type
systems that analyze load times, number of passes and payload data to determine efficiency
optimization. Similarly, the AECM 134 may be configured to support tire monitoring, as well.
[0064]     The AECM 134 is also configured to transmit data via the local transceiver 126,
including feedback information, to the ROS ECM 186. In addition, the AECM 134 is configured
transfer control of the machine 100 to the LOS operator console 184 for machine recovery
purposes, when the machine ECM 172 detects that signals are being received from both the
AECM 134 and the LOS operator console 184, as discussed later herein.
[0065]     The environment monitoring system 136, generally, determines and transmits data
based on the environment in which the machine 100 operates. More specifically, as shown, the
environment monitoring system 136 includes one or more internet protocol (IP) cameras 198. In
an embodiment, the environment monitoring system 136 may further include the microphone
200. In another embodiment, the environment monitoring system 136 may further include one or
more LADARs 202. As shown in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3, each of the one or more
IP cameras 198, the microphone 200, and the one or more LADARs 202 are connected to the first
switch 206, which may then provide data collected from such devices to be transmitted to, for
example, the AECM 134, the local router 162, the local transceiver 126 and the ROS ECM 186.

                                                  -19
[0066]      The one or more IP cameras 198 are mounted on the machine 100 and allow the
operator to monitor the machine 100 and its surrounding environment. The one or more IP
cameras 198 are configured to provide one or more viewing perspectives from the machine 100
(e.g., a front-facing viewing perspective, a rear-facing viewing perspective, etc.). Accordingly,
each of the one or more IP cameras 198 may be positioned, relative to the machine 100, to
provide a specific viewing perspective. For example, a first IP camera 198a may be positioned
to replicate the field of view an operator would see looking forward while in a cab 118 of the
machine 100, as illustrated in FIG. 5. Further, for example, the plurality of IP cameras may
include a second IP camera 198b, which is positioned to replicate the field of view an operator
would see when looking rearward while in the cab 118 of the machine 100. A third IP camera
198c may provide a view forward on the left hand side of the front of the body frame 104 to
assist with tramming around corners and loading and dumping. A forth IP camera 198d may be
positioned either on the right hand side of the front of body frame 104, the right hand side of the
rear of the body frame 104 or as a camera that engages when the machine 100 is moving
backwards (in reverse). However, the example positions of IP cameras 198a-d are only
exemplary and any additional IP cameras 198 may be included and/or the positioning of IP
cameras 198a-d may differ from the examples discussed above.
[0067]      As discussed above and illustrated in FIG. 4, one or more of the IP cameras 198 may
have a corresponding Ethernet input port 201 on the first switch 206. The first camera 198a may
be connected to the first switch 206 via a first IP camera Ethernet input port 201a, the first IP
camera Ethernet input port 201a being specifically configured to recognize the first IP camera
198a and may be associated with the positioning, relative to the machine 100, of the first IP
camera 198a. Similarly, the second IP camera 198b may be connected to the first switch 206 via
a second IP camera Ethernet input port 201b, the second IP camera Ethernet input port 201b
being specifically configured to recognize the second IP camera 198b and may be associated
with the positioning, relative to the machine 100, of the second IP camera 198b. Further, the
third IP camera 198c may be connected to the first switch 206 via a third IP camera Ethernet
input port 201c, the third IP camera Ethernet input port 201c specifically configured to recognize
the third IP camera 198c and may be associated with the positioning, relative to the machine 100,
of the third IP camera 198c. The fourth IP camera 198d may be connected to the first switch 206
via a fourth IP camera Ethernet input port 201 d, the fourth IP camera Ethernet input port 201 d
specifically configured to recognize the fourth IP camera 198d and may be associated with the
positioning, relative to the machine 100, of the fourth IP camera 198d and/or the configuration of
the fourth IP camera 198d (e.g., engaging when the machine 100 moves in reverse). Each of the

                                                 -20
respective connections between the first, second, third and fourth IP cameras 198a-d and the
first, second, third, and fourth IP camera Ethernet input ports 201a-d may be configured via
DHCP address assignments which allows the IP cameras 198 to be fitted or replaced without
manually configuring static IP addresses.
[0068]      The IP cameras 198 are configured to generate video data associated with viewing
perspectives of the machine 100. In an embodiment, the IP cameras 198 provide video data via
high definition video streams that are transmitted to the first interface device 226 (FIG. 3) of the
ROS 164. Each IP camera 198 (FIG. 2) is configured to transmit such video data via a video
stream to the local transceiver 126 via the Ethernet LAN 128 (more specifically, the first switch
206, the local router 162 and the associated communication channels 204). The AECM 134 can
determine, upon connection of an IP camera 198 to the first switch 206, the physical location in
relation to the machine 100 that the IP camera 198 occupies and the IP assignment of the IP
camera 198. This is accomplished via the DHCP IP address assignments provided by the first
switch 206. This reduces the requirement for manual configuration of each IP camera 198 and
the possibility of error in the determination of positional mounting.
[0069]      The microphone 200 is configured to capture audio data associated with the machine
100, and the work area adjacent to the machine 100. Such audio data may be captured by the
microphone 200 and transmitted in a video stream from one of the IP cameras 198 to the local
transceiver 126 via the first switch 206 and the local router 162, and then is transmitted by the
local transceiver 126 to the ROS 164 (FIG. 3). The term video stream, as used herein, includes
video data, and may also include audio data.
[0070]      The one or more LADARs 202 (FIG. 2) are sensing devices used to determine
positioning data associated with the machine 100. LADAR 202 is a radar-like remote sensing
technology that measures distance by illuminating a target with a laser and analyzing the
reflected light. The one or more LADARs 202 are configured to generate positioning data
associated with the machine 100, which is used in guiding/operating the machine 100 in, for
example, an autonomous, semi-autonomous, and/or guidance mode. In some examples, the one
or more LADARs 202 may generate positioning data based on specific placements of the
LADARs 202 on the machine 100 or perspectives of the machine 100. The determined
positioning data is transmitted to the local transceiver 126 via the first switch 206 and the local
router 162 and from thereto the ROS 164 (FIG. 3).

                                                 -21
[0071]      The LADARs 202 may include, at least, a front LADAR 202a and a rear LADAR
202b. The front LADAR 202a is affixed to the machine proximate to the "front" of the machine
100, for example, proximate to the NEEF 111 and/or proximate to the cab 118 but also in the
general direction of the NEEF 111, as depicted in FIG. 5. The front LADAR 202a senses
environmental elements in relation to positioning of the machine 100 from the front perspective
of the machine 100. Further, the rear LADAR 202b is affixed to the machine proximate to the
"rear" of the machine, for example, proximate to the EEF 109 and/or proximate to the cab 118
but also in the general direction of the EEF 109. Accordingly, the rear LADAR 202b senses
environmental elements in relation to positioning of the machine 100 from the rear perspective of
the machine 100.
[0072]      Similar to the IP cameras 198, the first switch 206 will assign DHCP addresses to the
LADARs 202 based on their physical location on the machine 100, thereby reducing the need for
manual configuration of input ports. Accordingly, the plurality of Ethernet input ports 201 of the
first switch 206 include Ethernet input ports 201 specifically dedicated to the input of the
LADARs 202. For example, the front LADAR 202a may be connected to the first switch 206
via a front LADAR Ethernet input port 201 e, the front LADAR Ethernet input port 201 e
specifically configured to recognize the front LADAR 202a and associated with positioning,
relative to the machine 100, of the front LADAR 202a. Similarly, the rear LADAR 202b may be
connected to the first switch 206 via a rear LADAR Ethernet input port 201 f, the rear LADAR
Ethernet input port 201f specifically configured to recognize the rear LADAR 202b and
associated with positioning, relative to the machine 100, of the rear LADAR 202b. Each of the
respective connections between the front and rear LADARs 202a-b and the front and rear
LADAR Ethernet input ports 201e-f may be configured via DHCP address assignments which
allow the LADARs 202 to be fitted or replaced without manually configuring static IP addresses.
[0073]      The RSM 138 (FIG. 2) is disposed on the machine 100 and is in operative
communication with the AIS Monitoring System 166 (FIG. 3). The RSM 138 is configured to
receive a safety control signal from the AIS Monitoring System 166 (FIG. 3) (more specifically,
the machine shutdown module 264 of the AIS Monitoring System 166) when the machine is
being operated in teleremote mode, a guidance mode, a semi-autonomous mode or an
autonomous mode. The RSM 138 (FIG. 2) then sends to the machine ECM 172 and the
transmission ECM 174 a control signal indicating that the safety control signal is being received.
The RSM 138 also receives digital inputs from the machine ECM 172 and the transmission ECM
174 as a feedback to authenticate the reception of the control signal. If the RSM 138 ceases to

                                                 -22
receive the safety control signal from the machine shutdown module 264 of the AIS Monitoring
System 166 (FIG. 3), no further control signal is sent by the RSM 138 (FIG. 2) to the machine
ECM 172 and the transmission ECM 174; this results in the machine ECM 172 and the
transmission ECM 174 immediately shutting down the machine 100.
[0074]      The LOS transceiver 160 is disposed on the machine 100 and is in operative
communication with the second CAN 132 and the (off-board) LOS operator console 184. In one
embodiment, the LOS transceiver 160 is in wireless communication with the LOS operator
console 184. The LOS transceiver 160 receives control signals from the LOS operator console
184 that are based on operator input entered into the LOS operator console 184. These received
control signals are transmitted by the LOS transceiver 160 to one or more of the Vehicle ECMs
124 via the second CAN 132 and control the operation of the machine 100.
[0075]      Each keypad 158 may be disposed on the machine 100 and is configured to
receive/accept user input and to transmit control signals based on the user input, via the second
CAN 132 to the AECM 134 or the appropriate Vehicle ECM 124. For example, a control signal
may be sent from the keypad 158 directly to the transmission ECM 174 to activate the
transmission 107 or to turn on/off a parking brake, or may be sent to the implement ECM 176 to
activate the lift arms/implement or to activate high/low beam lights on the machine 100. A
control signal may be sent (based on user input to the keypad 158) to the transmission ECM 174
and the machine ECM 172 that selects/deselects remote status for the machine 100.
[0076]      The autonomous control switch 282 may be disposed on the machine 100 and is
configured to select/deselect autonomous status for the machine 100.
[0077]      By way to explanation, if remote status and autonomous status are both "off' or not
selected, the machine 100 is placed in manual mode and may be operated manually by an
operator in the cab 118. If remote status is selected but autonomous status is not selected, the
machine 100 is placed in LOS mode and will only operate under the control of the LOS operator
console 184. If remote status is not selected but autonomous status is selected, the machine 100
will not operate. If remote status and autonomous status are both "on" or selected, the machine
100 will operate in teleremote mode, semi-autonomous mode, autonomous mode or LOS mode.
[0078]      An indicator light 284 may be disposed on or near the rear of the cab 118. In one
embodiment, the indicator light 284 may be a green light.

                                                  -23
[0079]      On or more machine strobe light assemblies 144 (FIGS. 1 - 2) may be positioned on
the outside of the machine 100 to indicate machine mode. In one embodiment, the machine
strobe light assemblies 144 may indicate 1.) manual mode, 2.) LOS mode or 3.) teleremote/semi
autonomous/autonomous mode. In one embodiment, a machine strobe light assembly 144 may
be disposed on the front of the machine 100 (the front machine strobe light assembly 144a) to
provide 180' visibility when viewed from the front half of the machine 100. In such an
embodiment, the front machine strobe light assembly 144a is positioned to not be visible in any
IP camera 198 views. A machine strobe light assembly 144 may be disposed on the rear of the
machine 100 (the rear machine strobe light assembly 144b). The rear machine strobe assembly
144b may be disposed on the machine to provide 180' visibility when viewed from the rear half
of the machine 100 without being visible in any IP camera 198 views. Each of the machine
strobe light assemblies 144 include a first light 286 and a second light 288, the second light 288
emitting a different colored light than the first light 286. In the exemplary embodiment
described below, the first light 286 is an amber light and the second light 288 is a red light.
[0080]      Each machine strobe light assembly 144 is configured to provide a visual indication of
which mode (manual mode, LOS mode, teleremote/semi-autonomous /autonomous mode) the
machine 100 is operating in. This involves the use of the indicator light 284, and the first light
286 (amber light) and the second light 288 (red light) of the machine strobe light assemblies 144
in various combinations. When the machine 100 (FIG. 1) is being operated in manual mode
(operator in the cab 118 on the machine 100 and the remote status and autonomous status are
both off), the indicator light 284 (green) and the first light 286 (amber) and the second light
(red) 288 of the machine strobe light assemblies 144 are not illuminated.
[0081]      When autonomous status is on/off and remote status for the machine 100 is initially
selected via the keypad 158, the indicator light 284 (green) may flash (e.g., at 2 hertz) during the
request for selection of remote status, the first light 286 (amber) and the second light 288 (red)
(FIG. 1) are not illuminated. Once the remote status selection request is granted, the indicator
light 284 (green) may flash in a pulsed fashion; the first light 286 (amber) and second light 288
(red) are not illuminated. Once the machine 100 (FIG. 1) is being run in LOS mode by an
operator using the LOS operator console 184 (FIG. 3), the indicator light 284 (green) (FIG. 1)
may be illuminated in a constant manner and the first light 286 (amber) and the second light 288
(red) are not illuminated.

                                                    -24
[0082]       When remote status is selected via the keypad 158 and autonomous control (semi
autonomous control or entirely autonomous control) is initially requested by an operator through
selection of the autonomous state via the autonomous control switch 282, the indicator light 284
(green) flashes (e.g., at 2 hertz) and the first light 286 (amber) and the second light 288 (red) in
the machine strobe light assemblies 144 flash for a period of time (for example 5 seconds). After
the period of time, the second light 288 (red) will turn off, but the first light 286 (amber) and the
indicator light 284 (green) remain flashing. This is indicative of the AIS Monitoring System 166
(FIG. 3) not yet transmitting a safety control signal to the RSM 138 (FIG. 2) of the MAS 120.
(If the AIS Monitoring System 166 is not transmitting a safety control signal, the first light 286
(amber) (FIG. 1) is flashing and the second light 288 (red) is not illuminated.) If the AIS
Monitoring System 166 is transmitting a safety signal, the second light 288 (red) flashes and the
first light 286 (amber) is not illuminated. Thus, in the scenario above, when the RSM 138 (FIG.
2) receives the safety control signal, the RSM 138 will send a control signal to the machine ECM
172 so that the second light 288 (red) (FIG. 1) will flash and the amber light 145b will not be on;
the indicator light 284 (green) will remain flashing. If the ROS ECM 186 does not subsequently
request control of the machine 100, then the indicator light 284 (green) continues to flash (at, for
example, 2 hertz). If the ROS ECM 186 does subsequently request control of the machine 100
(for the teleremote, semi-autonomous or autonomous mode), the illumination of the indicator
light 284 (green) will begin pulsing. Once the machine 100 is operating under the control of the
ROS ECM 186, the indicator light 284 (green) is illuminated in a constant manner.
[0083]       The first display 146 (FIG. 2) is disposed on the machine 100. For example, the first
display 146 may be disposed in an operator cab 118 (FIG. 1) of the machine 100. The first
display 146 (FIG. 2) may receive from the AECM 134, and display, various machine fault codes,
machine modes, various functions and diagnostics. For example, the first display 146 may
display machine mode information and may accept operator input for transmission to the AECM
134 or the machine ECM 172. For example, the first display 146 may accept operator input that
selects a strobe pattern and then transmit that input to the machine ECM 172. The first display
146 may display information indicating whether the signals from the transmission ECM 174 and
the machine ECM 172 to the RSM are active, whether the autonomous status is
selected/deselected by the autonomous control switch 282, whether the remote status is
selected/deselected on the keypad 158, whether remote status is pending or active, whether the
ROS ECM 186 or (a controller associated with) the LOS operator console 184 has reservation of
the machine or whether the machine is unreserved, the current state (on, off, flashing etc.) of the
indicator light 284, or the first and second lights 286, 288, the current position indicated by the

                                                -25
steering and implement sensors 220a diagnostics on certain relays in the machine 100 and
whether the power saving mode is on/off. The power saving mode turns off various components
on the machine 100, including some of the Vehicle ECMs 124 and LADARs 202 to reduce
battery consumption while still keeping the Ethernet LAN 128 and the RSM 138 active. In some
embodiments, power saving mode can be deactivated when a machine 100 is operated in
teleremote, semi-autonomous or autonomous mode.
[0084]      The VHUS 148 provides detection of an impeding or abnormal condition in any of the
machine's 100 systems and an operator notification to either modify operation of the machine
100, schedule maintenance, or perform a safe shutdown of the machine 100. VHUS 148 also
may provide production and performance information and may record load time, travel loaded,
dump time, and travel empty, along with delay times. Data from the VHUS may be transmitted
to the AECM 134 and to the ROS 164 (FIG. 3).
[0085]      The positioning system 150 (FIG. 2) is disposed on the machine 100. The positioning
system 150, in some embodiments, may include a second display 152, and may be in operative
communication with the second switch 208 via the Ethernet LAN 128. The positioning system
150 is configured communicate fleet management information such as position and other
machine 100 related information to off-board fleet management systems (and the like) that
provide real-time machine 100 positioning/tracking, assignment and productivity management
for a fleet. The second display 152 may be in operative communication with such off-board fleet
management systems, and may be configured to display tracking, assignment and productivity
and other machine 100 related information.
[0086]      The TMS transceiver 218 is configured to receive tire pressure and temperature data
associated with each wheel 106 and to transmit such tire pressure and temperature data to the
VHUS 148 and the first display 146 via the first CAN 130. The TMS transceiver 218 is also
configured to transmit such tire pressure and temperature data to the AECM 134 via the first
CAN 130. Such data is then transmitted from the AECM 134 to the ROS ECM 186 (FIG. 3) for
display on a first and second interface 226, 228.
[0087]      The ROS 164 (FIG. 3) is configured to remotely operate one or more machines 100
employed at a worksite. The ROS 164 is remotely located from the machines 100. In some
embodiments, the ROS 164 may be disposed at a location underground (but outside of the work
area of the machine 100). In other embodiments, the ROS 164 may be located near or above the

                                                 -26
surface of the mine. The ROS 164 enables the operator to control the machine 100 (FIG. 1)
functions as if the operator was in the cab 118 disposed on the controlled machine 100. For
example, the operator can remotely control functions such as the speed and direction
(forward/reverse), steering, implement controls, lights and hom. Additionally, the ROS 164 may
be configured to direct the machine 100 to operate in a guidance mode and/or control parameters
of the guidance mode.
[0088]     The ROS 164 includes a frame 222 (FIG. 5) and a seat 224 configured to receive an
operator. The ROS 164 further includes the ROS ECM 186 (FIG. 3), a first interface device 226,
a second interface device 228, and an AIS 232. In some embodiments, the ROS 164 may further
include a third interface device 230 and/or a fire suppression switch 254.
[0089]     The first interface device 226 includes a first interface processor 234 and a first
interface memory 236 in communication with the first interface processor 234. In an
embodiment, the first interface device 226 may be a touch-based display interface configured to
receive touch-based input from an operator's bare or gloved finger and/or a conductive stylus.
The first interface processor 234 may be implemented by one or more microprocessors or other
processors well-known in the art. The first interface processor 234 may execute machine
readable instructions to receive, and display on the first interface device 226, real-time
situational awareness features of the machine 100 such as, but not limited to, speed, fuel level,
engine temperature, and gage levels, and live video received from the IP camera(s) 198. The
machine-readable instructions may be read into or incorporated into a computer-readable
medium, such as the first interface memory 236. In alternative embodiments, hard wired
circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, machine-readable instructions. The
video is based on the video data captured by the IP cameras 198 and transmitted to the first
interface device 226 from the local transceiver 126. The first interface device 226 is configured
to display the output of one of the camera views in full resolution at any time. The resolution of
the other views may be downscaled to reduce data on the Ethernet LAN 128 (FIG. 2) and Off
board LAN 170 (FIG. 3). The ROS ECM 186 will automatically select for display the output of
one of the forward or reverse IP cameras 198, depending on the direction the machine 100 is
travelling in; the operator can manually choose a different IP camera 198 (FIG. 2) output for
display, if desired.
[0090]     The first interface device 226 (FIG. 3) is also configured to play real-time audio
captured by and received from the microphone 200 (FIG. 2) of the environment monitoring

                                                 -27
system 136. The audio is based on the audio data captured by the microphone 200 and
transmitted to the first interface device 226 (FIG. 3) from the MAS 120 (FIG. 2).
[0091]     The second interface device 228 (FIG. 3) includes a second interface processor 238
and a second interface memory 240 in communication with the second interface processor 238.
In an embodiment, the second interface device 228 may be a robust, scratch-proof touch-based
display interface configured to receive touch-based input from an operator's bare or gloved
finger and/or a conductive stylus. The second interface processor 238 may be implemented by
one or more microprocessors or other processors well-known in the art. The second interface
processor 238 may execute machine-readable instructions to receive touch-based input from the
second interface device 228 for generating control signals to remotely control non-movement
features and functions of a machine such as, but not limited to, starting/stopping the engine,
turning on/off lights, controlling microphone volume, controlling IP camera recording. The
second interface processor 238 may execute machine-readable instructions to display on the
second interface device 228, or to log, machine information received from the MAS 120. Such
machine-readable instructions may be read into or incorporated into a machine-readable medium,
such as the second interface memory 240. In alternative embodiments, hard wired circuitry may
be used in place of, or in combination with, machine-readable instructions. The machine
information may include machine diagnostics, machine health, operator notifications,
measurements, information collected by the LADARs 202 (FIG. 2), information from sensors
220 (for example, ground and engine speed sensors 220b), and other data related to the
operation of the machine 100. The second interface 228 (FIG. 3) displays machine health
notifications if the Vehicle ECMs 124 (FIG. 2) flag an event or if detected by the VHUS 148.
The second interface device 228 also displays the status of the AIS 232 (FIG. 3).
[0092]     In some embodiments, the ROS 164 may be configured to control a plurality of
machines 100, typically one machine 100 at a time. A separate external server 280 is not
required to remotely operate multiple machines 100.
[0093]     The third interface device 230 includes a third interface processor 242 and a third
interface memory 244 in communication with the third interface processor 242. In an
embodiment, the third interface device 230 may be a robust, scratch-proof touch-based display
interface configured to receive touch-based input from an operator's bare or gloved finger and/or
a conductive stylus. The third interface processor 242 may be implemented by one or more
microprocessors or other processors well-known in the art. The third interface processor 242

                                                  -28
may execute machine-readable instructions to receive, and display on the third interface device
230, fleet management information such as, but not limited to, map features illustrating machine
positioning. The third interface device 230 is also configured to receive touch-based input to edit
at least some of the fleet management information. The third interface processor 242 may
execute machine-readable instructions for allowing the operator to the fleet management
information. Such machine-readable instructions may be read into or incorporated into a
computer-readable medium, such as the third interface memory 244. In alternative
embodiments, hard wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, software
instructions.
[0094]     The first input device 246 may be a first joystick or the like, and is configured to
transmit input signals to the ROS ECM 186 (FIG. 2) for processing and communicating to the
machine 100, via the off-board transceiver 168 (FIG. 3), for specific operations related to an
implement 110 (FIG. 1) of the machine 100 such as, but not limited to, the bucket 114. For
example, movement of the first input device 246 may control operation of the implement 110
such that forward movement lowers the implement 110, backward movement raises the
implement 110, leftward movement tilts the implement 110 back, and rightward movement
controls the implement 110 to dump. Moreover, the first input device 246 includes a plurality of
implement control buttons which, when engaged, control operations related to the implement 110
including but not limited to: initiating a next machine operation, turning on/off the autonomous
mode, initiating an autonomous loading operation, initiating a next goal operation, initiating an
autopilot activation operation, initiating an ejector bucket operation, initiating a bucket counter
increment operation, and initiating an operation to raise engine rotations per minute (rpm).
[0095]     The second input device 248 (FIG. 3) may be a second joystick or the like and is
configured to transmit input signals to the ROS ECM 186 for processing and communicating to
the machine 100, via an off-board transceiver 168, for specific operations related to controlling
motion thereof. For example, movement of the second input device 248 controls movement and
steering of the machine 100 such that forward movement propels the machine 100 in a forward
direction, backward movement propels the machine 100 in a reverse direction, leftward
movement turns the machine 100 left, and rightward movement turns the machine 100 right.
Moreover, the second input device 248 includes a plurality of machine control buttons which,
when engaged, control operations related to movement of the machine 100, including but not
limited to: initiating an engine stop operation, initiating a straightening operation, switching IP
camera 198 views, initiating momentary view switching on the first interface device 226 between

                                                 -29
a forward-facing IP camera 198 and a rear-facing IP camera 198, sounding a horn, and initiating
transmission shifting. The first and second input devices 246, 248 may be any input devices
well-known in the industry such as, but not limited to, joysticks, levers, and push-buttons.
[0096]     The ROS ECM 186 may include a processor 188h (FIG. 6), which may be
implemented by one or more microprocessors or other processors well-known in the art. The
processor 188h includes a local memory 190h and is in communication with a read-only memory
192h and a random access memory 194h via a bus 196h. The random access memory 194h may
be implemented by Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM), Dynamic
Random Access Memory (DRAM), RAMBUS Dynamic Random Access memory (RDRAM)
and/or any other type of random access memory device. The read-only memory 192h may be
implemented by a hard drive, flash memory and/or any other desired type of memory device.
The processor 188h is configured to execute machine-readable instructions to receive input
signals from the first and second input devices 246, 248 for generating control signals to
remotely operate the machine 100 such as, but not limited to, machine 100 (FIG. 1) movement,
implement 110 movement and implement-related functions. Such machine-readable instructions
may be read into or incorporated into a computer-readable medium such as, for example, the
local memory 190h (FIG. 4). In alternative embodiments, hard wired circuitry may be used in
place of, or in combination with, machine-readable instructions to implement a method for the
machine 100.
[0097]     The ROS 164 may include a fire suppression switch 254. The fire suppression switch
254 is configured to provide the worksite with a safe guard against possible fires and is in
operative communication with the ROS ECM 186.
[0098]     The AIS 232 (FIG. 3) includes an AIS shutdown switch 250, an AIS reset switch 252,
a first AIS shutdown programmable logic controller 256 and a second AIS control programmable
logic controller 258. The AIS shutdown switch 250 is configured to provide a safety feature at
the worksite where the machine 100 is employed and is in operative communication with the
AIS shutdown programmable logic controller 256. The AIS reset switch 252 is configured to
reset the safety feature at the worksite back to operating conditions and is operatively associated
with an AIS shutdown programmable logic controller 256.
[0099]     The AIS shutdown switch 250 and the AIS reset switch 252, may both be in
communication with the off-board router 260 via the AIS shutdown programmable logic

                                                -30
controller 256 and the AIS control programmable logic controller 258. In this manner, the off
board router 260 is also in communication with the AIS Monitoring System 166 via the off
board network switch 262.
[00100]     The AIS Monitoring System 166 ensures that the work area the machine 100 is
operating in remains isolated from personnel and equipment. A pair of barriers may be set up at
each entrance to the work area of the machine 100. One barrier may prevent personnel from
entering the work area, the second may prevent the remotely operated, or an autonomously
operated, machine 100 from escaping the work area. The AIS Monitoring System 166 may be
located off-board of the machine 100 and may include an at least one machine shutdown module
264 in communication with an at least one barrier control panel 266, both of which are in
communication with the off-board network switch 262. The at least one barrier control panel
266 is further in communication with a machine barrier switch 268, and a personal barrier switch
270 and barrier sensors disposed on or adjacent to barriers. The AIS Monitoring System 166
monitors signals from barrier sensors disposed adjacent to each barrier, as well as the machine
barrier switches 268, and the personal barrier switches 270 at each barrier and at the ROS 164.
Barrier sensors may include light curtains, LADARs, proximity switches mounted to gates, and
fixed tension switches attached to lanyard cables.
[00101]     When all signals are satisfactory (e.g., at the AIS shutdown switch 250, machine
barrier switches 268, personal barrier switches 270, the barrier sensors etc.), the machine
shutdown module 264 transmits a safety control signal to the machine 100, more specifically to
the RSM 138 that then transmits a control signal to the machine ECM 172 and the transmission
ECM 174, that allows the machine 100 to operate. If a barrier sensor, machine barrier switch
268, personal barrier switch 270 or AIS shutdown switch 250 has been triggered or the signal
from such is lost, the machine shutdown module 264 ceases to transmit the safety control signal
to the RSM 138 and the RSM 138 ceases to transmit the control signal to the machine ECM 172
and the transmission ECM 174. The machine ECM 172 and the transmission ECM 174
immediately shut down the machine 100 if the control signal from the RSM 138 is lost or ceases.
[00102]     The LOS operator console 184 (FIG. 2) is disposed off-board the machine 100 and is
be configured to accept operator input, to generate control signals for the machine 100 based on
the operator input and to wirelessly transmit such control signals to the LOS transceiver 160.
These control signals are transmitted by the LOS transceiver 160 to the machine ECM 172 via
the second CAN 132 and control the operation of the machine 100.

                                                -31
[00103]     If both signals from the LOS operator console 184 and the AECM 134 are sensed by
the machine ECM 172, the machine ECM is configured to give preference to (act upon) the
signals from the LOS operator console 184. The AECM 134, in this situation, is configured to
relinquish control of the machine 100 to the LOS operator console 184. This is to allow the
machine 100 to be recovered from a situation/location (for example, a dangerous location) via
use of the LOS operator console 184, without an operator having to approach the machine 100 to
change the operation mode to the LOS mode. For example, in a scenario where the machine is
operating in autonomous mode (remote status is selected and autonomous status is selected) and
an urgent need arises (for example, the machine 100 moves onto unsupported ground) for the
operator to take control of the machine 100, while in line of sight of the machine 100, the
operator can take control of the machine via the LOS operator console 184 without having to
approach the machine to deselect the autonomous status on the autonomous control switch 282
on the machine.
[00104]     The off-board transceiver 168 (FIG. 3) is disposed remotely from the machine 100.
In one embodiment, the off-board transceiver 168 may be an Ethernet-compatible, wireless
radio. The off-board transceiver 168 may include one or more antennas 141. The off-board
transceiver 168 is in operable communication with the ROS ECM 186, the first, second and third
interface devices 226, 228, 230, the first and second input devices 246, 248, the AIS 232 and the
AIS Monitoring System 166 via the off-board LAN 170. The off-board transceiver 168 is in
wireless communication with the local transceiver 126.
[00105]     The off-board transceiver 168 is configured to receive control signals from the ROS
ECM 186 and to transmit such to the local transceiver 126. The received control signals may be
generated by the ROS ECM 186 (based on operator input received from the second and third
interface devices 226, 228, 230 and the first and second input devices 246, 248) to control the
operation of the machine 100 and related systems via the AECM 134 and the Vehicle ECMs 124.
The received control signals may also be generated by the AIS Monitoring System 166. The off
board transceiver 168 may receive from the local transceiver 126 data from the MAS 120 (e.g.,
images or video of the work area in which the machine 100 is positioned/operating captured by
the IP cameras 198, audio captured by the microphone 200, and positional and distance
measurement information from by the LADAR 202 related to the machine 100 and the work area
adjacent to the machine 100, machine operational or health related data, and other information).

                                                   -32
[00106]      The off-board LAN 170 (FIG. 3) includes a plurality of off-board communication
channels 272 that are either Ethernet or CAN, the off-board router 260 and an off-board Ethernet
switch 274, the off-board transceiver 168 and the off-board network switch 262. The off-board
router 260 includes a router processor and a router memory that are in operable communication
with the off-board Ethernet switch 274, the off-board transceiver 168, the off-board network
switch 262 via the off-board communication channels 272. The off-board router 260 is
configured to receive and transmit control signals and data between these components. The off
board Ethernet switch 274 is also in communication with the ROS ECM 186, the first, second
and third interface devices 226, 228, 230, and a service port 276 that is also in communication
with the ROS ECM 186. The ROS ECM 186 is also in communication via the off-board LAN
170 with the first and second input devices 246, 248, the fire suppression switch 254, and a seat
sensor 278 for detecting an operator in the seat 224 of the ROS 164.
[00107]      In an embodiment, the seat sensor 278 (FIG. 3) is disposed integrally with the seat
224 (FIG. 7) of the ROS 164 (FIG. 3) and is configured to detect when an operator has moved
out of the seat 224 such that, upon detection, the ROS ECM 186 is configured to automatically
lock down the first and second input devices 246, 248; the RSM 138 may bring the machine 100
to a safe state (shut it down) as a result of the triggering of the seat sensor 278. As non-limiting
examples, the seat sensor 278 can be a pressure sensor, an analog-voltage sensor, and any other
well-known sensors in the art.
[00108]      The off-board router 260 (FIG. 3) is in communication with the off-board network
switch 262 via the off-board communication channels 272. Additionally or alternatively, the off
board router 260 may be in further communication with an external server 280 separate from the
ROS 164. The external server 280 may be configured to store data and information such as, but
not limited, operator login information, maps, configurations, and machine operation logs, and to
allow the ROS ECM 186 and machine 100 access to such stored information. The off-board
network switch 262 is further in communication with an off-board transceiver 168 configured to
(wirelessly) transmit operating signals initiated from the ROS ECM 186 to the machine 100, and
to wirelessly receive real-time machine characteristics from the machine 100 such as, but not
limited to, speed, engine temperature, and position information, for transmission to the ROS 164.
[00109]      Referring now to FIG. 8, with continued reference to FIGS. 1-7, a diagram of an area
isolation system (AIS) 300 provided at a worksite 302 is shown, in accordance with another
aspect. The worksite 302 may include a plurality of work areas 304, 306, and 308. Although the

                                                -33
worksite 302 in FIG. 8 is illustrated as having three work areas 304, 306, and 308, the worksite
302 is shown for example purposes only and may have more or less than three work areas 304,
306, and 308.
[00110]      The AIS 300 may include a plurality of machines 100 and at least one barrier 314,
316, and 318 adjacent to each of the work areas 304, 306, and 308, respectively. Each of the
machines 100 may be configured to autonomously operate within the work areas 304, 306, and
308. The barriers 314, 316, and 318 may be set up at each entrance to the work areas 304, 306,
and 308 of the machine 100. The barriers 314, 316, and 318 may prevent personnel from
entering the work areas 304, 306, and 308 and/or may prevent the remotely operated, or
autonomously operated, machines 100 from escaping the work areas 304, 306, and 308.
[00111]      A barrier control panel (BCP) 320 may be operatively connected to and disposed
proximate each of the barriers 314, 316, and 318. The AIS 300 may further include barrier
sensors 322 disposed proximate each of the barriers 314, 316, and 318 and operatively connected
to the BCPs 320. The barrier sensors 322 may be configured to monitor the barriers 314, 316,
and 318 and detect incursions of the barriers 314, 316, and 318. In addition, the barrier sensors
322 may be configured to detect a direction of travel of a machine or a person that has breached
the barriers 314, 316, and 318. For example, the barrier sensors 322 may include light curtains,
LADARs, proximity switches mounted to gates, and fixed tension switches attached to lanyard
cables.
[00112]      Turning now to FIG. 9, with continued reference to FIGS. 1-8, each of the BCPs 320
may include a BCP controller 324 in communication with a BCP short-range transceiver 326.
Furthermore, each of the machines 100 may include a remote shutdown module (RSM) 330.
The RSM 330 may include an RSM controller 332 in communication with an RSM short-range
transceiver 334. The AIS 300 may further include an AIS controller 340 in communication with
each of the BCP controllers 324 of the BCPs 320 and each of the RSM controllers 332 of the
RSMs 330 on the machines 100. For instance, the AIS controller 340 may be connected to the
BCP controllers 324 via a hardwired Ethernet LAN and may be connected to the RSM
controllers 332 via a wireless Ethernet LAN, such as via Wi-Fi. However, other configurations
may be used.
[00113]      Each of the BCP controllers 324, the RSM controllers 332, and the AIS controller
340 may comprise a programmable logic controller (PLC). However, the BCP controllers 324,

                                                 -34
the RSM controllers 332, and the AIS controller 340 may be implemented using any processor
based device that may include or be associated with a non-transitory computer readable storage
medium having stored thereon computer-executable instructions, or any other suitable means for
electronically controlling functionality of the AIS 300. For example, each of the BCP controllers
324, the RSM controllers 332, and the AIS controller 340 may be configured to operate
according to predetermined algorithms or sets of instructions.
[00114]      Such algorithms or sets of instructions may be programmed or incorporated into a
memory 328 associated with or at least accessible to each of the BCP controllers 324, a memory
336 associated with or at least accessible to each of the RSM controllers 332, and a memory 342
associated with or at least accessible to the AIS controller 340. Each of the memories 328, 336,
and 342 may comprise a non-volatile memory provided within and/or external to the BCP
controllers 324, the RSM controllers 332, and the AIS controller 340, respectively. It is
understood that the AIS 300 may include other hardware, software, firmware, and combinations
thereof.
[00115]      For example, a BCP unique identifier may be preprogrammed or stored into each
memory 328 of the BCP controllers 324, and a RSM unique identifier may be preprogrammed or
stored into each memory 336 of the RSM controllers 332. Each BCP unique identifier may
comprise a code that is unique to the BCP controller 324 of the BCP 320 it is stored associated
with. Each RSM unique identifier may comprise a code that is unique to the RSM controller 332
of the RSM 330 of the machine 100 it is associated with. Furthermore, a location of each BCP
320 within the worksite 302 may be preprogrammed and stored into the memory 342 of the AIS
controller 340. In so doing, the AIS controller 340 may be configured to identify the locations of
each BCP 320.
[00116]      Each of the BCP short-range transceivers 326 of the BCPs 320 and the RSM short
range transceivers 334 of the RSMs 330 may be configured to transmit and receive signals over a
short range. In one example, the BCP short-range transceivers 326 and the RSM short-range
transceivers 334 may communicate via radio frequency. For instance, the BCP short-range
transceivers 326 of the BCPs 320 and the RSM short-range transceivers 334 of the RSMs 330
may each comprise a short-range radio or other short-range wireless device. The BCP short
range transceivers 326 and the RSM short-range transceivers 334 may be dedicated transceivers
for wireless point-to-point communication to each other, as opposed to a wireless Ethernet LAN
communication, such as a Wi-Fi network, which has no localization capability.

                                                -35
[00117]      A BCP radio zone 344 may be associated with each BCP short-range transceiver 326,
and a machine radio zone 346 may be associated with each RSM short-range transceiver 334.
Each of the BCP radio zones 344 and the machine radio zones 346 may comprise a limited signal
range over which signals from the BCP short-range transceivers 326 and the RSM short-range
transceivers 334, respectively, may be communicated. For example, the BCP radio zones 344
and the machine radio zones 346 may each have a radius of ten meters (10 m) or less, although
other signal ranges may be used.
[00118]      When one of the machines 100 approaches one of the barriers 314, 316, and 318, the
machine radio zone 346 associated with the RSM short-range transceiver 334 may intercept with
the BCP radio zone 344 associated with the BCP short-range transceiver 326 and establish a
secure communications channel between the RSM 330 and the BCP 320. When the machine
radio zone 346 intercepts with the BCP radio zone 344, the RSM short-range transceiver 334 of
the RSM 330 on the machine 100 may be configured to send signals indicative of the RSM
unique identifier to the BCP short-range transceiver 326 of the BCP 320 proximate the barrier
314, 316, and 318. Furthermore, the BCP controller 324 may be configured to send the same to
the AIS controller 340. Based on the RSM unique identifier, the AIS controller 340 may be
configured to identify the machine 100.
[00119]      In addition, when the machine radio zone 346 intercepts with the BCP radio zone
344, the BCP controller 324 may be configured to send signals indicative of the BCP unique
identifier to the AIS controller 340, along with the signals indicative of the RSM unique
identifier. Based on the BCP unique identifier and the RSM unique identifier, the AIS controller
340 may be configured to determine a location of the machine 100 within the worksite 302.
More specifically, whenever a machine radio zone 346 intercepts with a BCP radio zone 344, the
AIS controller 340 may automatically locate the autonomously operated machine 100. In so
doing, the AIS 300 may track the locations of the machines 100 within the worksite 302 in order
to ensure safety requirements are maintained.
[00120]      The AIS 300 may be further configured to detect identified and unidentified
incursions of the barriers 314, 316, and 318. For instance, the barrier sensors 322 disposed
proximate each of the barriers 314, 316, and 318 may detect an incursion of the barriers 314,
316, and 318, and send signals indicative of the incursion to the BCPs 320. The BCPs 320 may

                                                -36
then send corresponding signals to the AIS controller 340 indicating which of the barriers 314,
316, and 318 the incursion is associated with.
[00121]     The AIS controller 340 may be configured to determine whether the incursion is
identified or unidentified based on whether the AIS controller 340 located a machine 100 at the
barrier associated with the incursion within a predetermined time period. The predetermined
time period may be preprogrammed into the memory 342 of the AIS controller 340. For
example, the predetermined time period may be a period of time that extends before and after the
incursion was detected.
[00122]     Thus, if there is communication, via an RSM short-range transceiver 334 and a BCP
short-range transceiver 326, of an RSM unique identifier from an RSM 330 of a machine 100 to
the BCP 320 of the barrier 314, 316, and 318 associated with the incursion within the
predetermined time period, then the AIS controller 340 may be configured to identify and locate
the machine 100 that caused the incursion. However, if there is no communication of an RSM
unique identifier to the BCP 320 of the barrier 314, 316, and 318 associated with the incursion
within the predetermined time period, and the predetermined time period lapses, then the AIS
controller 340 may be configured to determine an unidentified incursion, or the incursion is of
unknown origin. For instance, the unidentified incursion may be caused by a person or a
machine without an RSM unique identifier entering or exiting the work area through the barrier.
[00123]     If the incursion is determined to be of unknown origin, the AIS 300 may be
configured to implement a temporary shutdown of one or more work areas 304, 306, and 308
within the worksite 302. More specifically, the AIS controller 340 may be configured to
temporarily shut down the one or more work areas 304, 306, and 308 proximate the barrier 314,
316, and 318 associated with the unidentified incursion. For example, the AIS controller 340
may send signals to the RSM controllers 332 of the RSMs 330 on the machines 100 located
within the one or more work areas 304, 306, and 308 proximate the barrier associated with the
unidentified incursion via the wireless Ethernet LAN, such as via Wi-Fi.
[00124]     Based on the signals from the AIS controller 340, the RSM controller 332 of the
RSM 330 may communicate to other components of the machine 100 in order to shut down the
machine 100, such as to turn off the engine of the machine 100. In an example, the temporary
shutdown of the machines 100 in the one or more work areas 304, 306, and 308 may cease when
a subsequent unidentified incursion is detected without identification of a machine 100. The

                                                   -37
subsequent unidentified incursion may be associated with one of the barriers 314, 316, and 318
proximate the work area that was associated with the previous unidentified incursion. When the
AIS controller 340 determines the subsequent incursion to be of unknown origin, the AIS
controller 340 may send signals to the RSM controllers 332 of the RSMs 330 on the machines
100 to resume autonomous operation of the machines 100.
Industrial Applicability
[00125]     In general, the present disclosure may find applicability in any number of industrial
applications such as, but not limited to, mining, earth-moving, construction, and agricultural
industries. The MAS 120 is configured to implement operation of a machine 100 such as, but
not limited to, underground mining machines such as underground load-haul-dump loaders 112
and underground mining trucks, backhoe loaders, skid steer loaders, wheel loaders, material
loaders, motor graders, track-type tractors, landfill compactors, excavators, and articulated
trucks, to name a few, which are employed at a worksite. The MAS 120 implements operation
of the machine in teleremote mode, guidance mode, semi-autonomous mode and autonomous
mode.
[00126]     Disclosed herein is a method for autonomously operating a plurality of machines 100
in a worksite 302 including an area isolation system (AIS) 300. The AIS 300 may include an
AIS controller 340, a plurality of barriers 314, 316, and 318 each surrounding at least one work
area 304, 306, 308, a barrier control panel (BCP) 320 associated with each barrier 314, 316, and

memory 336 associated with the RSM controller 332.
[00127]     The method may comprise moving a first machine of the plurality of machines 100
towards a first barrier of the plurality of barriers 314, 316, and 318. The method may further
comprise communicating, via radio frequency, the RSM unique identifier from the RSM 330 of
the first machine to the BCP 320 associated with the first barrier, using the RSM short-range
transceiver 334 of the first machine and the BCP short-range transceiver 326 of the first barrier,
when a machine radio zone 346 associated with the RSM short-range transceiver 334 intercepts
with a BCP radio zone 344 associated with the BCP short-range transceiver 326. The method

                                                   -38
may further comprise identifying the first machine based on the RSM unique identifier. The
moving, communicating, and identifying may be performed by the AIS 300.
[00128]       Further disclosed herein is a method for autonomously operating a plurality of
machines including an AIS 300. The AIS 300 may include an AIS controller 340, a plurality of
barriers 314, 316, and 318 each surrounding a work area 304, 306, and 308, a BCP 320
associated with each barrier 314, 316, and 318, at least one barrier sensor 322 disposed
proximate each barrier 314, 316, and 318 and operatively connected to the BCP 320, and a RSM
330 disposed on each machine 100. Each BCP 320 may include a BCP controller 324 in
communication with a BCP short-range transceiver 326 and the AIS controller 340.
[00129]       A BCP unique identifier may be preprogrammed into a memory 328 associated with
the BCP controller 324. The at least one barrier sensor 322 may be configured to detect an
incursion of the barrier 314, 316, and 318. The RSM 330 may include an RSM controller 332 in
communication with an RSM short-range transceiver 334 and the AIS controller 340. The RSM
unique identifier may be preprogrammed into a memory 336 associated with the RSM controller
332.
[00130]       The method may comprise moving a first machine of the plurality of machines 100
towards a first barrier of the plurality of barriers 314, 316, and 318, the moving being performed
by the AIS controller 340. The method may further comprise detecting a first incursion of the
first barrier, the detecting being performed by the at least one barrier sensor 322 disposed
proximate the first barrier. The method may further comprise communicating, via radio
frequency, the RSM unique identifier from the RSM 330 of the first machine to the BCP 320
associated with the first barrier when a machine radio zone 346 associated with the RSM short
range transceiver 334 intercepts with a BCP radio zone 344 associated with the BCP short-range
transceiver 326. The communicating may be performed by the RSM short-range transceiver 334
of the first machine and the BCP short-range transceiver 326 of the first barrier.
[00131]       The method may further comprise sending signals indicative of the RSM unique
identifier of the first machine and the BCP unique identifier of the first barrier to the AIS
controller 340, the sending being performed by the BCP controller 324. The method may further
comprise determining an identity and a location of the first machine within a work area
associated with the first barrier based on the RSM unique identifier of the first machine and the
BCP unique identifier of the first barrier, the determining being performed by the AIS controller

                                                 -39
340. The method may further comprise detecting a second incursion of the first barrier of the
plurality of barriers, the detecting being performed by the at least one barrier sensor 322 disposed
proximate the first barrier.
[00132]      The method may further comprise determining the second incursion to be of
unknown origin if a predetermined time period lapses without communication of an RSM unique
identifier to the BCP short-range transceiver 326 of the BCP 320 associated with the first barrier,
the predetermined time period being preprogrammed into a memory associated with the AIS
controller 340. The method may further comprise sending signals to the RSM 330 of the first
machine located in the work area associated with the first barrier to shut down the machine 100.
The determining and the sending may be performed by the AIS controller 340.
[00133]      The teachings of this disclosure may be particularly beneficial to provide a safe
means of identifying machines entering and exiting an area to ensure that the LHD location is
known to the AIS 300. More specifically, a radio network comprised of two transceivers are
temporarily paired point to point when an LHD comes into range of a BCP, thereby establishing
a secure communications channel between the LHD and the BCP. In so doing, the connection
between the BCP and the RSM of the LHD is local to the trusted wireless pair, as opposed to an
Ethernet LAN or Wi-Fi network. This ensures the localization of the LHD identity to the
vicinity of the BCP, whereas an Ethernet LAN or Wi-Fi network would not provide localization
capability.
[00134]      After the LHD identity is determined in a secure manner, the LHD may be
transitioned from one area to another. Failure to identify a LHD identity within a predetermined
time period may result in the incursion being determined as from an unknown origin. In
addition, the AIS 300 may implement a temporary shutdown of autonomous LHDs within the
area and other adjacent areas where the incursion of unknown origin occurred. In so doing, the
disclosed AIS 300 allows LHDs to move autonomously between work areas 304, 306, and 308,
as well as allowing personnel to traverse through the work areas 304, 306, and 308 by
temporarily disarming the autonomous LHDs within the work areas 304, 306, and 308.
