   Summary
   [0004]     In the unmanned vehicle traveling system, the
20 work machine travels in accordance with target travel track
   data representing a target travel track and sent from a
   management apparatus.   A plurality of work machines travel
   along the same target travel track.   For that reason, there
   is a high possibility that a rut is generated in a
25 transportation track or a work place in a mine.        When a
   deep rut is generated, the traveling of the work machine is

   target travel track RP in which the dump truck 2 travels
   among the plurality of target travel tracks RP      (RP1, RP2,
20 and RP3) generated by the travel track generating unit 123
    (step SP40).
    [0083]    The target travel track RP generated by the
   travel track generating unit 123 and selected by the travel
   track selecting unit 125 is sent to each of the plurality
25 of dump trucks 2 operated in the mine.    Each of the
   plurality of dump trucks 2 travels within the loading place
   LPA along any target travel track RP selected by the travel
   track selecting unit 125.
    [0084]    The travel control unit 126 outputs a control
30 signal for controlling the traveling of the dump truck 2
   entering the loading place LPA from the first
   transportation track HL1   (step SP50).  In the embodiment,
   the travel control unit 126 outputs a control signal to the

                                              Docket No. PKOA-1 6300-PCT
                                23
   dump truck 2 so that the dump truck 2 entering the loading
   place IPA travels along the target travel track RP selected
   by the travel track selecting unit 125.
    [0085]   When the travel track selecting unit 125 selects
 5 the target travel track RP in which the dump truck 2
   travels from the plurality of target travel tracks RP         (RP1,
   RP2, and RP3) set in the loading place LPA, the travel
   control unit 126 outputs a control signal to the dump truck
   2 so that the dump truck 2 travels along the selected
10 target travel track RP.
    [0086]   In the embodiment, the travel track selecting
   unit 125 selects a first target travel track RP as the
   target travel track RP in which the first dump truck 2
   exists in the loading place LPA and selects a second target
15 travel track RP different from the first target travel
   track RP as the target travel track RP in which a second
   dump truck 2 subsequently entering the loading place LPA
   exists in the loading place LPA.
    [0087]   In the embodiment, the travel track selecting
20 unit 125 selects the target travel track RP so that the
   dump truck 2 sequentially passes through the plurality of
   switchback points BP (BP1, BP2, and BP3).  For example, the
   plurality of dump trucks 2 are controlled so that a first
   operation of causing the first dump truck 2 to travel along
25 the target travel track RP1 passing through the switchback
   point BP1 and directed to the loading point LP, a second
   operation of causing the second dump truck 2 to travel
   along the target travel track RP2 passing through the
   switchback point BP2 and directed to the loading point LP,
30 and a third operation of causing the third dump truck 2 to
   travel along the target travel track RP3 passing through
   the switchback point BP3 and directed to the loading point
   LP are performed in such a manner that the first operation,

                                                Docket No. PKOA-16300-PCT
                                 24
   the second operation, and the third operation are performed
   sequentially and the first operation, the second operation,
   and the third operation are performed sequentially again.
    [0088]   In the embodiment, the switchback point setting
 5 unit 121 sets the plurality of switchback points BP         (BP1,
   BP2, and BP3) so that the generation of a rut in the
   loading place LPA is suppressed.    The travel track
   generating unit 123 sets the plurality of target travel
   tracks RP  (RP1, RP2, and RP3) to correspond to the
10 plurality of switchback points BP in the loading place LPA.
   The travel track selecting unit 125 selects the target
   travel track RP through which the dump truck 2 passes so
   that the generation of a rut in the loading place LPA is
   suppressed.   The travel track control unit 126 sends a
15 control signal to each dump truck 2 so that the dump truck
   travels along the selected target travel track RP.
   [0089]    For example, when a gap between the plurality of
   switchback points BP is narrow or a gap between the
   plurality of target travel tracks RP is narrow, the vehicle
20 wheels 26 of the plurality of dump trucks 2 substantially
   pass through the same route.    As a result, there is a high
   possibility that a deep rut is generated.    The switchback
   point setting unit 121 may set the positions of the
   plurality of switchback points BP so that a gap between the
25 plurality of switchback points BP is larger than, for
   example, the width (tire width) of the vehicle wheel 26.
   [0090]    Further, when the dump trucks continuously pass
   through a specific switchback point BP among the plurality
   of switchback points BP even when the plurality of
30 switchback points BP are set, there is a possibility that a
   deep rut is generated.
   [0091]    Here, the travel track selecting unit 125 selects
   the switchback point BP through which the dump truck 2

                                              Docket No. PKOA-16300-PCT
                                25
   passes so that the plurality of dump trucks 2 do not
   continuously pass through the same switchback point BP
   among the plurality of switchback points BP among the
   plurality of switchback points BP.  For example, the travel
 5 track selecting unit 125 may sequentially or randomly
   select the switchback point BP through which the dump truck
   2 passes among the plurality of switchback points BP.         The
   travel track selecting unit 125 may select at least the
   target travel track RP so that the second dump truck 2 does
10 not pass through the first switchback point BP through
   which the first dump truck 2 passes and passes through the
   second switchback point BP different from the first
   switchback point BP when the first dump truck 2 enters the
   loading place LPA and the dump truck 2 subsequently
15 entering the loading place LPA is the second dump truck 2
   different from the first dump truck 2.
   [0092]    Additionally, when the first dump truck 2 enters
   the same loading place LPA even when the first switchback
   point BPl is selected as the switchback point BP through
20 which the first dump truck 2 passes in a certain loading
   place LPA, a different switchback point BP may be selected.
   [0093]    As described above, according to the embodiment,
   the plurality of switchback points BP are set for one
   loading point LP, the plurality of target travel tracks RP
25 respectively connecting the plurality of switchback points
   BP to the loading point LP are generated based on the
   positions of the plurality of switchback points BP, and
   each of the plurality of dump trucks 2 travels to the
   loading point LP along the target travel track RP selected
30 among the plurality of target travel tracks RP.       For this
   reason, it is possible to suppress the dump truck 2 from
   continuously traveling along the same target travel track
   RP.  Thus, the generation of a deep rut in the loading

                                               Docket No. PKOA-16300-PCT
                                26
   place LP is suppressed.  Since the generation of the deep
   rut is suppressed, the ground leveling work is suppressed
   and hence deterioration in productivity of the mine is
   suppressed.
 5  [0094]   Further, in the embodiment, the travel track
   selecting unit 125 selects the switchback point BP so that
   the dump trucks 2 sequentially pass through the plurality
   of switchback points BP and controls the dump trucks 2 so
   that the dump trucks sequentially pass through the
10 plurality of switchback points PP.   Accordingly, for
   example, a period in which the dump truck 2 passes through
   the switchback point BPl and passes through the switchback
   point BPl again, a period in which the dump truck 2 passes
   through the switchback point BP2 and passes through the
15 switchback point BP2 again, and a period in which the dump
   truck 2 passes through the switchback point BP3 and passes
   through the switchback point BP3 again can be set to be
   substantially equal to one another.   Accordingly, since a
   deviation in the number of times in which the dump truck 2
20 passes through the plurality of switchback points BP and
   vice versa are suppressed, the generation of a deep rut is
   suppressed.
    [0095]   Additionally, in the embodiment, it is assumed
   that the travel control unit 126 outputs a control signal
25 so that the dump truck 2 sequentially passes through the
   plurality of switchback points BP  (BP1, BP2, and BP3).
   That is, it is assumed that the plurality of dump trucks 2
   are controlled so as to sequentially perform the first
   operation of causing the first dump truck 2 to travel along
30 the target travel track RP1 passing through the switchback
   point BPl and directed to the loading point LP, the second
   operation of causing the second dump truck 2 to travel
   along the target travel track RP2 passing through the

                                                Docket No. PKOA-16300-PCT
                                 27
   switchback point BP2 and directed to the loading point LP,
   and the third operation of causing the third dump truck 2
   to travel along the target travel track RP3 passing through
   the switchback point BP3 and directed to the loading point
 5 LP in such a manner that the first operation, the second
   operation, and the third operation are performed
   sequentially and the first operation, the second operation,
   and the third operation are performed sequentially again.
   The first operation, the second operation, and the third
10 operation may be changed in random whenever the dump truck
   2 travels.   As described above, the traveling of the dump
   trucks 2 may be controlled so that the dump trucks 2 do not
   continuously pass through the same switchback point BP.
   Further, the switchback point BP may be selected by using a
15 frequency map as below.
   [00963     <Second Embodiment>
        A second embodiment will be described.     The same
   reference signs will be given to the same or equivalent
   components of the above-described embodiment and the
20 description will be simplified or omitted.
   [0097]     FIG. 11 is a schematic diagram illustrating an
   example of a method of controlling the dump truck 2
   according to the embodiment.    As illustrated in FIG. 11,
   the switchback point setting unit 121 can set the plurality
25 of switchback points BP along a specific line AL at
   intervals within the loading place LPA.    In the example
   illustrated in FIG. 11, three switchback points BP (BP1,
   BP2, and BP3) are set along the specific line AL, but the
   switchback point BP can be set to any position on the
30 specific line AL.   The travel track selecting unit 125
   selects the position of the switchback point BP through
   which the dump trucks 2 pass.    As a specific travel track
   selecting method, for example, several predetermined

                                               Docket No. PKOA-1 6300-PCT
                                 28
   switchback points may be set and selected sequentially as
   in FIG. 11, the switchback point BP may be selected while
   being moved by the same interval in the right and up
   direction from the switchback point BP1 of FIG. 11, or the
 5 switchback point BP may be selected in random on the
   specific line AL.   Further, the switchback point BP may be
   selected by using a frequency map to be described below.
   In addition, any selection method can be employed.
    [00981    As described above, when the specific line AL is
10 set and the plurality of switchback points BP are set along
   the specific line AL, the generation of a deep rut in the
   loading place LPA is suppressed and hence deterioration in
   productivity of the mine is suppressed.
    [0099]    <Third Embodiment>
15       A third embodiment will be described.  The same
   reference signs will be given to the same or equivalent
   components of the above-described embodiment and the
   description will be simplified or omitted.
    [0100]    FIG. 12 is a schematic diagram illustrating an
20 example of a method of controlling the dump truck 2
   according to the embodiment.   As illustrated in FIG. 12,
   the switchback point setting unit 121 can set the plurality
   of switchback points BP within the specific area AR inside
   the loading place LPA at intervals.   In the example
25 illustrated in FIG. 12, three switchback points BP        (BP1,
   BP2, and BP3) are set in the specific area AR at intervals,
   but the switchback point BP can be set to any position on
   the specific area AR.   Whenever each dump truck 2 travels,
   the switchback point BP at a certain position through which
30 the dump truck passes is selected by the travel track
   selecting unit 125.   As a specific travel track selecting
   method, for example, several predetermined switchback
   points may be set and selected sequentially as in FIG. 12,

                                                 Docket No. PKOA-16300-PCT
                                 29
   the switchback point BP may be selected while being moved
   by the same interval from the switchback point BP1 of FIG.
   12 in a predetermined direction    (up, down, left/right, or
   obliquely), or the switchback point BP may be selected in
 5 random on the specific area AR.     Further, the switchback
   point BP may be selected by using a frequency map to be
   described below.   In addition, any selection method can be
   employed.   The specific area AR may be set to any position
   inside the loading place LPA.
10 [0101]    As described above, when the specific area AR is
   set and the plurality of switchback points BP are set in
   the specific area AR, the generation of a deep rut in the
   loading place LPA is suppressed and hence deterioration in
   productivity of the mine is suppressed.
15 [0102]    <Fourth Embodiment>
        A fourth embodiment will be described.      The same
   reference signs will be given to the same or equivalent
   components of the above-described embodiment and the
   description will be simplified or omitted.
20 [0103]     In the embodiment, a method will be described in
   which the travel track selecting unit 125 selects the
   switchback point BP through which the dump truck 2 passes
   among the plurality of switchback points BP so that the
   generation of a rut in the loading place LPA is suppressed
25 based on the frequency map.    A method of selecting the
   switchback point BP and the target travel track RP using
   the frequency map can be applied to, for example, the
   examples of the first to third embodiments.      In the
   embodiment, the travel track selecting unit 125 changes the
30 position of the switchback point BP so that the generation
   of a rut in the loading place LPA is suppressed.          The
   travel track generating unit 123 changes the position
   (route) of the target travel track RP so that the

                                                Docket No. PKOA-16300-PCT
                                30
   generation of a rut in the loading place LPA is suppressed.
   [0104]    FIG. 13 is a schematic diagram illustrating an
   example of a method of controlling the dump truck 2
   according to the embodiment.    In the embodiment, an example
 5 will be described in which the specific area AR described
   in the above-described third embodiment is used.         The
   travel control unit 126 defines a predetermined area AS of
   the loading place LPA including the plurality of switchback
   points BP and the loading point LP by a plurality of grids
10 GR.  The specific area AR is set as a part of the
   predetermined area AS.  The travel control unit 126
   specifies the grid GR through which the vehicle wheel 26 of
   the dump truck 2 passes based on the absolute position data
   of the dump truck 2 detected by the position detector 35.
15 The travel control unit 126 counts the number of times in
   which the vehicle wheel 26 of the dump truck 2 passes
   through the grid in each of the plurality of grids GR.
   That is, when the number of times of counting a certain
   grid GR is largely different from the number of times of
20 counting the peripheral grid GR, it is thought that a rut
   is generated in that area.   The switchback point setting
   unit 121 automatically changes the position of the
   switchback point BP so that the number of times in which
   the vehicle wheel 26 of the dump truck 2 passes through the
25 grid GR does not become larger than the number of times in
   which the vehicle wheel passes through the peripheral grid
   GR in each of the plurality of grids GR set in the
   predetermined area AS while the position of the loading
   point LP is fixed.  Further, the travel track generating
30 unit 123 changes the route of the target travel track RP so
   that the number of times in which the vehicle wheel 26 of
   the dump truck 2 passes through the grid GR does not become
   larger than the number of times in which the vehicle wheel

                                               Docket No. PKOA-16300-PCT
                                 31
   passes through the peripheral grid GR in each of the
   plurality of grids GR set in the predetermined area AS
   while the position of the loading point LP is fixed.
   Accordingly, the generation of a deep rut is suppressed.
 5  [0105]    In the example illustrated in FIG. 13, it is
   determined that the number of times in which the vehicle
   wheel 26 of the dump truck 2 passes through the grid GRb
   including the target travel track RP2 and the switchback
   point BP2 is larger than the number of times in which the
10 dump truck passes through the peripheral grid GR of the
   grid GRb.   In this case, the switchback point setting unit
   121 changes the position of the switchback point BP in the
   specific area AR from the switchback point BP2 to, for
   example, the switchback point BPl or the switchback point
15 BP3.
   [0106]     Additionally, in the embodiment, a case has been
   described in which the number of times of counting the grid
   located on the target travel track RP increases, but the
   number of times of counting the grid located on the tire
20 travel track of the actual travel track may be increased.
   [0107]     As described above, in the embodiment, the
   frequency map representing the frequency of the passage of
   the vehicle wheel 26 of the dump truck 2 in the
   predetermined area AS of the loading place LPA is made and
25 the switchback point BP and the target travel track RP are
   set so that the vehicle wheel 26 does not travel highly
   frequently only in the specific area of the predetermined
   area AS with reference to the frequency map.     Thus, the
   generation of a rut in the loading place LPA is suppressed
30 and hence deterioration in productivity of the mine is
   suppressed.
   [0108]     <Fifth Embodiment>
         A fifth embodiment will be described.  The same

                                  32
   reference signs will be given to the same or equivalent
   components of the above-described embodiment and the
   description will be simplified or omitted.
    [0109]     FIG. 14 is a schematic diagram illustrating an
 5 example of a method of controlling the dump truck 2
   according to the embodiment.     As illustrated in FIG. 14,
   the travel track generating unit 123 can generate the
   plurality of target travel tracks RPi in the first
   transportation track H11.    In the example illustrated in
10 FIG. 14, five target travel tracks RPi are generated in the
   first transportation track Hli.     The travel control unit
   126 controls the dump truck 2 so that the dump truck 2 in
   the first transportation track H11 passes through each of
   the plurality of target travel tracks RPi.     Accordingly,
15 the generation of a deep rut in the first transportation
   track HL1 is suppressed.
   [0110]      In the embodiment, the travel track generating
   unit 123 sets the plurality of target travel tracks RPi in
   the first transportation track HL1 so that the switchback
20 point BP is connected to each of the plurality of target
   travel tracks RPi of the first transportation track HLI.
   Further, FIG. 14 illustrates an example in which the
   switchback point BPl is connected to each of five target
   travel tracks RPi of the first transportation track HL1.
25 Although not illustrated in the drawings, the travel track
   generating unit 123 generates the plurality of target
   travel tracks RPi in the first transportation track HLi so
   that the switchback point BP2 is connected to each of five
   target travel tracks RPi of the first transportation track
30 H1.     Further, the travel track generating unit 123
   generates the plurality of target travel tracks RPi in the
   first transportation track HL1 so that the switchback point
   BP3 is connected to each of five target travel tracks RPi

                                                 Docket No. PKOA-16300-PCT
                                  33
   of the first transportation track HL1.
    [0111]     As described above, according to the embodiment,
   since the plurality of target travel tracks RPi are
   generated even in the first transportation track HL1, the
 5 generation of a rut in the first transportation track H11
   is suppressed.    Further, the generation of a rut is
   suppressed in a wide range in the loading place LPA.
    [01123     <Sixth Embodiment>
         A sixth embodiment will be described.    The same
10 reference signs will be given to the same or equivalent
   components of the above-described embodiment and the
   description will be simplified or omitted.
    [0113]     FIG. 15 is a schematic diagram illustrating an
   example of a method of controlling the dump truck 2
15 according to the embodiment.     As illustrated in FIG. 15,
   the switchback point setting unit 121 can set the plurality
   of switchback points BP at intervals.     In the example
   illustrated in FIG. 15, five switchback points BP are set
   at the same interval along the specific line AL.
20 [0114]      Further, as illustrated in FIG. 15, the travel
   track generating unit 123 can generate the plurality of
   target travel tracks RPo in the second transportation track
   HL2.    In the example illustrated in FIG. 15, five target
   travel tracks RPo are generated in the second
25 transportation track HL2.    The travel control unit 126
   controls the dump truck 2 so that the dump truck 2 passes
   through each of the plurality of target travel tracks RPo
   in the second transportation track HL2.     Accordingly, the
   generation of a deep rut in the second transportation track
30 HL2 is suppressed.
   [0115]      In the embodiment, the travel track generating
   unit 123 generates the plurality of target travel tracks RP
   in the second transportation track HL2 so that the loading

                                                Docket No. PKOA-16300-PCT
                                 34
   point LP is connected to each of the plurality of target
   travel tracks RPo of the second transportation track HL2.
    [0116]    As described above, according to the embodiment,
   since the plurality of target travel tracks RPo are
 5 generated even in the second transportation track HL2, the
   generation of a rut even in the second transportation track
   HL2 is suppressed.   Further, the generation of a rut is
   suppressed in a wide range even in the loading place LPA.
   [0117]     The dump truck 2 which leaves from the loading
10 place LPA and travels along the second transportation track
   HL2 has a load loaded thereon.    The total weight of the
   dump truck 2 having a load thereon is larger than the total
   weight of the empty dump truck 2.    For that reason, when
   the dump truck 2 travels along the second transportation
15 track HL2, a rut is easily generated in the second
   transportation track HL2.   In the embodiment, since the
   plurality of target travel tracks RPo are generated in the
   second transportation track HL2, the generation of a rut
   can be effectively suppressed.

   [0122]     As described above, according to the embodiment,
   since the plurality of loading points LP   (LP1, LP2, and
20 LP3) are set in the loading place LPA, the generation of a
   rut in a wide range of the loading place LPA from the
   switchback point BP to the loading point LP is suppressed.
   [0123]     Additionally, the components set in the plurality
   of loading points LP as in the embodiment can be
