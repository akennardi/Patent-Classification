ABSTRACT
Exemplary methods and systems can be provided for resurfacing of skin that include
formation of a plurality of small holes, e.g., having widths greater than about 0.2 mm
and less than about 0.7 mm or 0.5 mm, using a mechanical apparatus. Compressive
and/or tensile forces can then be applied to the treated region of skin as the damage
heals to facilitate hole closure, and provide enhanced and/or directional shrinkage of
the treated skin area.

   [00021          The present disclosure relates to cosmetic methods and systems for improved
   fractional resurlacing of skin tissue and similar procedures, specifically, such methods and
   systems that facilitate enhanced and/or directional reduction in skin area or reduction of
 0 wrinkles.
                                             BACKGROUND
   100031          There is an increasing demand for repair of or improvement to skin defects, which
   can be induced by aging, sun exposure, dermatological diseases,. trauma, surgical procedures,
   heredity, and the like. Skin loses its tone and smooth texture as it ages, commonly developing
 5 wrinkles and laxity. This can be further compounded by photodamage and other effects such as,
   e.g, scarring from trauma, age-related rhytides, and striae. Aged skin is characterized by a
   flattened dermal-epidermal junction, thinning epidermis and dennis. less fibrous collagen, and
   alterations in elastin organization. Skin rejuvenation therapies work to remove these damaged
   tissues and/or and stimulate the growth of new, healthy collagen, elastic fibers and skin cells and
20 thereby improve the appearance of the skin.
   [0004]          Reduction in the appearance of wrinkles is an objective of many dermatological
   procedures and treatments. For example, a face lift operation is a standard surgical procedure in
   which skin is removed from in front or behind the ears, which pulls and lifts adjacent skin from
   the face and neck that has sagged during aging. However, the result of this procedure is often an
25 unnatural stretched appearance, If skin on the face or neck itself could be removed in a way that
   decreases the area of skin, with preference to one or more given directions for reduction of skin
   area, and without visible scarring, the result would be a more natural appearance while still
   removing unwanted sagging or redundant skin.

        WO 2014/008470                                                             PCT/US2013/049445
   [0005]           Certain treatments may be used to improve skin defects by irradiatirg the skin
   with electromagnetic energy, which can lead to beneficial responses to improve the treated skin
   condition. A. common procedure for skin rejuvenation, ielaser resurfacing, uses light energy to
   heat and damage the upper dennis. HIowever, laser resurfacing has a poor side effect profile,
 5 with many patients experiencing prolonged erythema, scarring and dyspigmentation.
   [00061           Recently, the development and use of fractional skin therapy has achieved better
   results. Fractional damage can include forming small regions of damage in tissue (e.g., ablation
   or thermal damage) that are surrounded by healthy tissue. A small size of the damaged regions
   (e.g., generally less than about I nm) and proximity of healthy tissue can facilitate a rapid
 0 healing of the damaged regions, as well as other desirable effects such as tissue shrinkage.
   Laser-based fractional resurfacing techniques and devices involve the use of expensive and
   potentially dangerous lasers or other sources of intense optical energy to damaged tissue. Such
   optical systems can be expensive, present safety hazards and require a skilled physician or
   cinician for their operation. Further, fractional resurfacing treatments tend to produce general
 5 tightening of the skin that has no directional preference or bias.
   100071           However, iany wrinkles tend to present on certain parts of the body with a
   general orientation, such as wrinkles extending laterally from the corners of the eyes or mouth,
   or along the neck beneath the jaw. Directional shrinkage of skin can be achieved by removing
   elongated areas of skin in an appropriate shape, and then joining the edges of remaining skin
 0 (e.g. with sutures) to "ull" the skin back iii. a particular direction. Such procedures, as used in
   conventional facelifts, create large scars that must be carefully located, and may generate some
   unnatural-look ing shrinkage in response to the large-scale removal and repositioning of the skin.
   [0008]           It has been proposed to remove smaller portions of skin, e.g. on the order of a few
   millimeters wide, and to close the resulting holes with sutures or the like to produce amore
25 controlled. reduction of skin area. Such holes should be elongated (e.g. lenticular or elliptical in
   shape) to facilitate their closure by approximating their longer edges and avoid the formation of
   dog-ears when they are collapsed. However, such holes are still large enough to produce visible
   markings when healed., and full healing time may require up to a few weeks. Further, closure of
   such holes is a skill-intensive procedure that would require manipulation such as individual
30 suturing or manual, even approximation followed by application of an adhesive coating such as a
                                                       -

  cyanoacrylate adhesive to keep the holes closed antil they heal Such hole closure procedures
  would be time-intensive and prone to visible scarring.
  *0009            Accordingly, there may be a need for a relatively simple, inexpensive, robust and
  safe cosmetic method and system that can be mechanical in nature, and would overcome at least
5 some of such exemplary deficiencies described above, and that can be configured to produce
  fractional damage in biological tissue that leads to directional reduction of skin surface area
  without causing visible scarring.
                                               SUMMARY
  10001.0]         The present disclosure relates to exemplary embodiments of simple, inexpensive,
0 and safe cosmetic methods and systems for mechanical generation of a plurality of small holes,
  e.g., microregions of damage, in biological tissue, such as skin, and for manipulating the treated
  skin to generate a cosmetically desirable reduction of skin area that can be enhanced and/or that
  has aparticular or preferred direction, Such exemplary holes can have a width or diameter that
  is, e.g., between about 0-2 mm and 0.7 mm, or preferably between about 0.2 mm and 0.5 mm as
5 measured along the tissue surface. Such holes can extend into or preferably through the entire
  thickness of the dermis. The fractional area of skin removed by formation of such holes in a
  treatment region can be between about 5% and 50%, or between about 10% and 30%. Formation
  of holes in this sub-millimeter size range and areal coverage is well-tolerated by the body, with
  minimal risk. of scarring, infection, or other complications.
o [000 11          An exemplary embodiment of a cosmetic method according to the present
  disclosure can be provided that can include a formation of a plurality of holes in a region of skin
  as described above, and then an application of tensile and/or compressive stresses in adirection
  generally along the surface of the skin to the treated region during subsequent healing process.
  Such stresses can enhance overall reduction in the treated region and/or provide a directional bias
5 to the resulting shrinkage. The applied stresses can be maintained in the treated region until the
  holes have substantially closed and/or tissue regrowth has been effectively modified, e.g..
  between about 4-6 days or longer. In certain exemplary embodiments, this time period may be
  much shorter, e.g, on the order of several minutes or hours, if a tissue adhesive, glue, or the like
  is used to facilitate hole closure.

        WO 2014/008470                                                            PCT/US2013/049445
   1000 121         In one exemplary embodiment, a pre-stretched or heat-shrinkable film can be
   adhered to the surface of the treated region after the holes are formed. The resulting compressive
   stresses can enhance hole closure in the direction. of the applied stresses and/or affect the
   orientation of collagen or other structures that grow or evolve as part of a healing response in the
 5 tissue surrounding the small holes. A rigid film, plate, or other object can optionally be adhered
   over the stretched fili to provide mechanical stability and maintain deformation of the treated
   region during the primary healing process.
   1000131         In further exemplary embodiments, compressive stresses can be generated in the
   treated region of skin by applying one or more surgical staples and/or sutures to the area. The
 0 staples and/or sutures are preferably large, such that they span several of the formed holes, and
   optionally the entire treated region. In certain embodiments, aplurality of staples or sutures can
   be applied to a single area at different orientations, to provide omnidirectional compressive
   stresses that can enhance hole closure and overall shrinkage of the treated region as compared to
   a similarly-treated region without the applied stresses,
 5 [000141          In other exemplary embodiments, compressive stresses can be generated by
   applying a shrinkable material to the skin surface after the holes are formed thereiT. The
   shrinkable material can include, e.g, a heat-shrink film adhered to the skin surface and then
   heated, a liquid layer that can polymerize or react to form an adherent filIn that reduces in size as
   it forms, cures or ages. etc.
 0 [00015           In other exemplary embodiments, aphotoactivated adhesive can be applied to the
   surface of the treated region, and a compressive or tensile stress can be generated in the region
   while directing alight energy onto the region to activate the adhesive, The photoactivated
   adhesive can include, e.g. rose bengal or any other photoactivated biological adhesive known in
   the art,
25 [000161          In still further exemplary embodiments, tensile stresses can be generated in the
   treated region of skin by stretching the treated region in one or more directions along the skin
   surface, which can facilitate hole closure and shrinkage in a direction orthogonal to the direction
   of the applied tensile stress. Such tensile stresses can be manually generated and then
   maintained, eg, by adhering a rigid film, plate, or other object to the stretched area of skin,

   [0001 7          According to further exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, a system
   can be provided for generating a plurality of holes in a region of skin that includes one or more
   coring needles that can remove small cores of tissue by inserting and withdrawing the needles
   from the skin. A plural ity of such needles can be affixed to a substrate to facilitate motion and
 5 positioning of all of the needles simultaneously. Insertion and withdrawal of the needles can be
   controlled by an actuator, which can control the positioning of the needles and/or the substrate, if
   present, via a mechanical coupling or actuation of an electrical or pneumatic translator or the
   like.
   1000181          The exemplary system can further include a compression arrangement capable of
 0 or confi gured for applying a compression device or substance to deform the treated region after
   the holes are forced therein. For example, the compression arrangement can include a surgical
   stapler, a suturing device, an applicator capable of applying a stretched film or a
   curable/shrinkable liquid to the skin surface, etc.

 5 apparatus. It shall further be noted that the herein described cosmetic method has been tested,
   and is a safe and routine procedure that can be practiced in beauty parlors or other settings. The
   presented method is aminimally-invasive amethod, Moreover, the exemplary method is safe as

                    DETAILED DFSC RIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
   100044j          Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure relate to cosmetic methods and
   systems for generating a plurality of small holes in skin tissue and then manipulating or
   compressing the treated region in a particular direction, which can result in a locally directional
 5 reduction of skin surface area without visible scarring
   [000451          According to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, a plurality of
   small holes 100, such as the hole shown in the top view of FIG I A, can be formed mechanically
   in skin tissue, e.g., by a coring procedure as described in more detail below. The width or
   diameter of the holes 100 can be between 200 microns and 700 microns, or preferably between
 0 200 microns and 500 microns. The small sizes of such holes can avoid the formation of visible
   markings or scars after the surrounding tissue heals. Forming holes in this size range is also
   wel-tolerated and safe, because of the very small size of the damaged regions formed and the
   presence of undamaged adjacent tissue to promote rapid healing.
   [000461          The holes 100 can be substantially round as shown in'FIG. IA. A plurality of
 5 such holes 100 can be formed in a treatment region of skin or other tissue, e.g, as shown in FIG.
    113 to promote a general healing reaction over the treated region. Such a healing reaction may,
   for example, stimulate contraction of existing collagen and/or growth of new collagen in the
   treated region in response to the mechanical damage generated by formation of the holes 100
   [000471          For example, the holes 100 can be formed using a pronged hollow needle 200
30 such as that shown in FIG, 2. This exemplary needle 200 has 2 pointed prongs, and can be
                                                     - 8-

       WO 2014/008470                                                             PCT/US2013/049445
   formed, e.g, by abrading opposite sides of the distal end of a hollow needle at an angIe relative
   to the axis of the needle. Other needle geometries can also be used, e.g, the needles 200 having
   more than 2 pointed prongs. Such pronged needle 200 (as opposed to, eg, aconventional
   biopsy-type needle having a circular getting end) can facilitate penetration of the end of the
 5 needle 200 into the skin and removal of small cores of tissue to form the holes 100 without
   rotating the needle 200. These needles 200 can be formed, e.g., from conventional syringe
   needles having a gauge between about 19 and 27, e.g, having an internal diameter between
   about 700 microns (0.7 mm) and about 200 microns (0.2 mm). Preferably, the needle gauge can
   be between 21 and 27, corresponding to an internal diameter between about 0.5 mm and about
 0 0.2 mm Coring needles 200 can also be formed from other types of hollow tubes having an
   internal diameter corresponding to the desired hole width,
   [000481          Insertion of the needle 200 into skin tissue, and subsequent withdrawal therefrom,
   can remove a core of tissue and form a microscopic hole 100. The needle 200 can be inserted to
   a depth that extends at least partially into the underlying dermal layer, or preferably through the
 5 entire dernnal layer to the underlying subcutaneous fat layer. Inserting the needle 200 to at least
   the depth of the subcutaneous fat can facilitate removal of the tissue core within the needle
   lumen from the surrounding tissue, e.g., because the tissue core will be severed from the adjacent
   deal tissue and the bottom of the tissue core isnot strongly held by the underlying fat. Such
   mechanical coring procedures used to generate holes 100 may be accompanied by some minor
 0 bleeding, which is not significant and may tend to stop quickly because of the small hole sizes.
   j00049]          The hole 100 formed by a 2-pronged needle 200 may be somewhat elongated in
   shape, as shown in FIG. IC. This non-circular shape can result frorn the slightly asymmetrical
   tissue stretching and cutting that can occur when the 2 prongs of the needle 200 pierce the tissue
   and advance within it. For example, the hole 100 formed using a 2-pronged coring needle 200
25 can have an aspect ratio (e.g., atio of length to width in cross-section) of about 3:2 at or near the
   tissue surface.
   1000501          Other hole shapes can be formed in accordance with certain exemplary
   embodiments of the present disclosure, such as the lenticular-shaped hole 100 shown in FIG. 1D.
   For example, the aspect ratio of the lenticular hole 100 in FIG. ID can be, e.g., about 3:1, and the
30 angle at which the curved sides meet can be about 30 degrees. This ratio (or an aspect ratio close
   to this) and geometry can facilitate closure of the hole 100 by reducing associated stresses or

5 critical, because the small size scale facilitates approximation of the hole edges in any desired
  direction without generating unwanted effects such as "dog ears" or misalignments when they
  close and heal together. Needles 200 having more prongs, e.g., 3 or 4 prongs, can be used in
  further embodiments, where such needles 200 may tend to produce rounder holes 100 such as
  those shown in FIG. 1A,
0 1000521         In further exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, formation of microscopic
  holes 100 in tissue that are asymmetric or noncircular, such as the hole 100 shown in FIG, 1C,
  can be desirable for generating closure of holes 100 that is locally and/or macroscopically
  directional, Such holes 100 that are asymmetric may be closed more easily, e.g, by compressing
  the tissue such that the narrow width is further narrowed and opposite sides of the hole 100 are
5 brought into proximity or contacted with each other, Asymmetric holes 100 can be formed using
  a variety of techniques and apparatuses in accordance with embodiments of the present
  disclosure,
  [000531         In one exemplary embodiment, elongated holes 100 can be formed in tissue by
  stretching the tissue in a direction, and then forming the holes 100 in the tissue, eig., using a
0 mechanical coring needle 200, or another mechanical device. Upon allowing the tissue to relax,
  the hole 100 will tend to be somewhat elongated, such as the hole 100 shown in FIG. IC.

  various shapes, eg., having, an elongated non-circular cross section, such that the holes 100
  formed in the skin or other tissue by inserting and withdrawing the needle 200 will be elongated

  [00055]          In general, the shape of a microscopic hole 100 formed in soft skin tissue may not
  have precisely smooth edges and a well-defined shape, and the precise shape of the holes 100
  may not significantly affect the subsequent directional shrinkage or closure behavior because of
  their small size (e.g., 0,7 mm or less),

   [00056]         The holes 100 can be formed mechanically such that the fraction of surface area
   removed in the treated region is between about 5%and 50%, e.g, between about 10% and 30%.
   Such area fractions of removed tissue can be small enough to promote healing or recovery of the
   mechanically damaged skin by retaining a sufficient amount of healthy tissue around each hole
 5 100, while being large enough to generate a cosmetioal ly desirable amount of shrinkage in a
   single exemply procedure performed on the treated region as described herein. The particular
   area fraction of holes 100 can be selected based on factors such as, e.g,. the desired extent of
   shrinkage, the location of the treated regi(e.g. face, neck, arms, etc.), general skin
   characteristics, etc.
 0 [000571         The distribution of the holes 100 can be substantially random, or formed in any of
   various patterns. For example, a plurality of holes 100 can be formed in the skin or other tissue
   in a generally square or rectangular array. In further embodiments, the holes J00 can be formed
   in aI array of staggered rows, or in a random pattern The particular arrangement or pattern of
   the holes 100 may not be particularly important with respect to shrinkage behavior, e.g. because
 5 of the large number and small size of the holes 100 in the treated region.
   [00058]          A pattern of the holes 100, such as that shown In. e.g.. FlI IB, cai be formed
   using a variety of techniques. For example, the holes 100 can be formed mechanically, e.g,
   using a reciprocating mechanism that traverses the tissue to form the patteim The mechanisII
   can include one or more rows of the coring needles 200, such that staggered rows of the holes
 0 100 can be generated in the skin tissue. In further exemplary embodiments, the holes 100 can be
   formed in other patterns that may not be rows, e.g. in spatially random arrangements, which can
   be achieved by repeated manual insertion and withdrawal of one or more needles 200 at various
   locations in the treated region,
   1000591          The density or proximity of the holes 100 can also be varied in different regions
25 of the tissue being treated. For example, the holes can be spaced further apart in the peripheral
   areas or edges of a particular treated region. Such "feathering" of the removed tissue volume can
   facilitate a smoother or gradual transition between the shrunken or tightened skin within the
   treatment region and the untreated region of tissue surrounding it. However, such "feathering
   or density gradients of the holes 100 may not be particularly important for obtaining a
30 continuous directional shrinkage over the treated region, because the large nuniber of small holes
    100 can adjust to gradients in skin deformation during the subsequent healing process. For
                                                    ~-11 -

   example, the large number and moderate to high density of microscopic holns 100 can
   accommodate macroscopic gradients in shrinkage with only very minor local differences in the
   closure and healing behavior of each individual hole 100. Such gradients and directionality can
   be produced, e.g. by the exemplary manipulation of the treated region after the holes 100 are
 5 formed, as described herein below.
   [00060]         The particular shape and size of the treated region in which the holes 100 are
   formed is arbitrary, and can be selected based on the areas of skin that may benefit from the
   exemplary methods described herein. Such methods can be effective over both small regions
   (eg. on the order of a square cm or less) and larger regions, because of the large number of sub
 0 millimeter holes 100 used to achieve cosmetic effects as described herein. For example, the
   small size of the holes 100 generated at an areal fraction between about 5% and 50% can provide
   a substantially uniform dispersion of such holes 100 when viewed at size scales of about I cm or
   larger. Accordingly, the exemplary methods described herein can include directional closure of
   a large number of small holes 100, which can well accommodate any gradients in shrinkage that
 5 may result within or adjacent to aparticular treatment region, and which may be applied in
   treatment regions having arbitrary shapes and extents.
   [000611         After the holes 100 are formed in skin or other tissue, as described above, it is
   possible to promote closure of the holes 100 by applying appropriate lateral forces (e.g,
   compressive or tensile forces) to the tissue in the treated region as it heals. Such forces can
 0 facilitate contact between opposite edges of the holes 100, particularly near the tissue surface,
   and increase overall shrinkage of the tissue as the holes 100 heal in a closed configuration.
   Further, anisotropy or directionality of the overall skin shrinkage in the treated region following
   formation of the holes 100 can be achieved by application of such forces in a particular direction
   during the subsequent healing or recovery processes.
25 1000621         In one exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, a stretch filh 300 can be
   used to provide a compressive surface force to the tissue surface in the treated region and
   promote hole closure. For example, as shown in FIG. 3A, the film 300 can be pre-stretched in
   the direction of the arrows. The stretch film 300 can then be adhered to the tissue surface, as
   shown in the exemplary cross-sectional view of the treated region in FIG. 3B. The pre-stretched
30 film 300 can then generate a directional compressive force along the tissue surface, as shown by
   the arrows in FIG, 3B. This force can pull together the edges of the holes 100, particularly near
                                                   - 12  -

   healing process. For example, the stretch film 300 can be applied such that the direction of
   compressive forces at the tissue surface (indicated by the arows in FIG. 3.1B) is in the preferred
   direction of shrinkage Hole closure resting from such compressive forces can result in a
 5 closed-hole configuration similar to the exemplary configuration shown in the top view of the
   treated region of FIG. 3C, where the arrows represent the direction of compressive forces, and
   the small vertical lines 310 represent the approximated edges of the holes 100 at the skin surface,
   1000631          Materials that can be used to fom1 the film 300 include Tegadernd1T, another
   stretchable polymer, or the like. For example, TegadermTM has adherent properties and can be
 0 stretched up to about 30-40% and then applied to the tissue surface. Other film materials can
   also be used in further embodiments. Such films can be provIded with an adhesive surface, or
   alternatively can be adhered to the tissue surface using any appropriate biocompatible glue,
   cement, or adhesive.
   1000641          For example, the compressive film 300 can be maintained on the tissue surface fr
 5 several days, e.g. about 4-6 days. to facilitate sufficient healing or modification of the skin tissue
   while it isheld in a compressed state, e.g., to minimize or prevent re-opening of the holes 100 or
   collagen expansion in the compressive direction by external forces,
   [000651          In further exemplary embodiments, a stabilizing film 330 (shown in FIG. 3D),
   e.g., a non-stretching film or rigid plate or the like, can be adhered to the upper surface of the
 0 film 300 after it has relaxed and compressed the tissue surface. This stabilizing film 330 can
       vide mechanical stability to the compressed tissue surface to maintain the compressive state
   and constrain further displacement e.g. relaxation) of the compressed tissue during the healing
   process, for example, to prevent relaxation of the film 300 during the recovery process or prevent
   detachment of the film 300 from the skin surface. In certain exemplary embodiments, the
25 stabilizing filn can be adhered directly to the skin surface surrounding the treated region, e.g.,
   beyond the edges of the stretch film 300, instead of or in addition to being adhered to the top of
   the stretch film 300,

   positioned over the treated region in FIG. 4A. FIG. 4B shovs the compressive defornation of
   the treated region by the inserted staple 400. The exemplary staple 400 can be used to provide a
   general compression of the treated region of ski, thereby approximating the edges of a plurality
 5 of holes 100, as shown in FIG. 4B, rather than approximating two opposing edges of a single
   incision or wound (as is typically done with conventional applications of surgical staples). Such
   exemplary use of one or more surgical staples 400 may provide increased compression of the
   skin below the surface of the treated region as compared to that provided by application of a
   stretch filn 300 to the skin surface (shovn in FIG, 3BM), because of the anchoring and pulling
 0 together of tissue below the surface by the staple 400.
   1000671          In another exemplary embodiment, a tensioning clip 450 as shown in FIG. 4C can
   be used to apply and maintain a compressive stress in the treatment region, The clip 450
   includes two prong arrangements 460 capable of being inserted into skin The prong
   arrangements 460 can have a sharp point or edge at their distal ends to faci litate penetration into
 5 the skin, and can be made from any material sufficiently rigid or strong to support a stress as
   described below without breaking or deforming significantly (e.g., ametal or rigid plastic or the
   like). The prong arrangements 460 can be connected by an elastic material 470, which can be
   provided as a strap, cord, or the like (e.g., similar to arubber band, small bungee cord, or the
   like). The elastic material 470 can be stretched and the prong arrangements460 then inserted into
 0 skin within and/or adjacent to the treatment region that contains holes formed as described
   herein. The stretched elastic material 470 can then cause the prong arrangements 460 to exert a
   compressive force between then, as shown by the arrows in FIG. 4C In this manner, a
   compressive stress can be generated and maintained over at least a portion of the treatment area
   using atensioning clip 450 that can be easily inserted into and removed from the skin. The size
25 of the prong arrangements 460 and elastic material 470 can be selected based on the size of the

   skin tissue while it is held in a compressed state. Further, the staples 400 and/or tensioning clips
   450 can be small or thin in at least one direction, to avoid formation of visible markings upon
   their removal. In certain exemplary embodimems, staples 400 and/or tensioning clips 450 can be
   used that are thin and/or that include several prongs configured to pierce the skin. Such staples
 0 400 and/or tensioning clips 450 can provide compressive forces comparable to a single large
   staple 400 or clip 450 while allowing the individual prongs to be smaller in size to reduce or

   1000771          Various additional procedures can be used to promote hole closure and healing of
   the holes 100 after they are formed in the tissue. For example, the holes 100 can be exposed to
   saline or other solutions after they are formed, to promote hydration and softening of the tissue

   cyanoacrylates, can be used to glue the holes 100 together afier they are formed and compressed,
   stretched and/or closed. It may be preferable to limit application of such glue to the tissue
   surface and avoid introduction of them within the holes 100, to avoid fillirn them with unwanted
 0 material that may inhibit subsequent hole closure and shrinkage. The use of any conventional
   tissue-bonding techniques or tissue glues, including, those described herein, can reduce the
   amount of time that the compressive film 300 or other dressings are maintained over the treated
   tissue area as it heals, while preventing re-opening of the closed holes 100 during the gradual
   healing process.
25 1000821          As described herein, the shape, density or spacing, and patter spatial
   distribution of the holes 100, and/or the orientation of an applied compressive or tensile force to
   the surface of the treated region, can provide a directionally-oriented shrinkage of the tissue as it
   heals. Such directionality can be utilized to achieve improved cosmetic results by generating
   increased shrinkage in a preferred local direction in a mechanical fractional resurfacing
30 procedure. A plurality of such procedures can be applied to a particular treated region to obtain
   greater overall shrinkage of the skin or other tissue, preferably allowing sufficient healing time

   between subsequent trea tents on a particular area- The compressive and/or tensile directions
   can be varied in different treatments of a single area to obtain a more homogenous shrinkage of
   tissue in the area, The sizes and preferred shrinkage directions of adjacent treated regions can
   also be selected and varied to achieve desirable overall shrinkage patterns for the skin or other
 5 tissue,
   [00083]           Application of a tensile or compressive force to the tissue to promote hole closure
   can also affect the characteristics of collagen that may be formed during the hole closure and
   tissue healing processes that occur after the holes 100 have been formed. For example, collagen
   may grow and/,or align in particular directions when forming in tissue that is deformed by
 0 application of external forces after the formation of the holes 100, as described herein. Such
   modification of collagen growth and/or alignment in the treated tissue may provide further
   desirable cosmetic effects.
   [000841          In further exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, a system can be
   provided to generate a plurality of the holes 100 in a treated region of skin, and then apply a
 5 compressive or tensile force to the treated region. For example, an exemplary system 700 can be
   provided that includes a handpiece 710 having alower surface 715, a plurally of retractable
   coring needles 200, an actuator handle 720, and a compression arrangement 730, as shown in
   FIG. 7. The needles 200 can, e.g, be affixed to a movable substrate 725 as aneedle array or the
   like to facilitate their controllable motion and positioning relative to the lower surface 715.
 0 According to certain exemplary embodiments, the needles 200 and the substrate 725 can be
   provided together as a single unit or cartridge, which can be disposable or reusable/sterilizable.
   The lower surface 715 can be configured and/or structured to be placed on the surface of a
   treated region, and the actuator handle 720 can be capable of positioning and/or maintaining the
   needles 200 and/or the substrate 725 at one or more locations relative to the lower surface 715.
25  .00085]          A number of the needles 200 and area of the needle array can be selected based on
   various factors. For example, a number of the needles 200 can be large enough to facilitate rapid
   treatment of large areas of skin, but not so large that the cost and. complexity of the needle array
   becomes prohibitive. Further, it may be difficult to insert a large number of the needles 200 into
   the skin simultaneously. For example, such number of the needles 200 can be between, e.g., 1
30 and 50, or between about 6 and 25. In certain exemplary embodiments, a larger number of the
   needles 200 can be provided in the system 700. The average spacing between the needles 200

   can be selected based on the mner diameter of the needles 200 and the desired fractional area of
   skin to be removed by a single insertion and withdrawal of the needles 200, using simple
   geometric calculations.
   [000861          In an exemplary configuration, the system 700 can (eg., initially) be configured
 5 such that the distal ends of the needles 200 protrude a particular distance below the lower surface
   715. Such exemplary distance can be, eg., the approximate depth of the local dermis of the
   treated region. In certain embodiments, such distance can be adj ustable (for example, using a
   threaded adjuster or stop, a plurality of stepped settings or the like, not shown) such that the
   system 700 can be used to treat skin having various thicknesses,
 0 [000871          The exemplary system 700 can be applied onto a treated region until the lower
   surface 715 of the system 700 contacts the skin surface, such that the needles 200 penetrate the
   skin tissue to the particular distance into the skin, e.g., through the entire thickness of the dermis,
   The actuator handle 720 can then be squeezed to retract the needles from the skin, pulling the
   distal ends of the needles 200 above the lower surface 71 5and forming a plurality of holes 100 in
 5 the skin. The actuator handle 720 can he further capable of activating the compression
   arrangement 730 (not shown) to apply a compression element to the treated region after the
   needles 200 have been withdrawn from the treated region.
   [00088]          In one exemplary embodiment, the compression arrangement 730 can include a
   surgical stapler configured to be mechanically or electrically actuated by the actuator handle 720,
 0 such that squeezing the actuator handle 720 will first withdraw the needles 200 from the
   treatment site and then apply one or more large staples 400 and/or tensioning clips 450 across at
   least a portion of the treated region as described herein above,
   [00089]          According to another exemplary embodimwent, the compression arrangement 730
   can include a suture needle (e.g, a curved needle) and suture thread. The compression
25 arrangement 73.0 can be capable of or configured for introducing one or more lengths of suture
   thread below the surface of the treated region, e g with the ends of the thread protruding from
   the surface of the skin, when it is actuated by the actuator handle 720, after the needles 200 are
   withdrawn from the treatment site. The ends of the suture thread can then be tied together to
   form a suture 500 that can apply a compressive force to the skin tissue in the treated region as

   configured for tying off the suture thread when actuated, e.g., at a preselected tension.
    000901         In yet another exemplary embodiment, the compression arrangement 730 can
   include a stretch film applicator that is capable of and/or configured for adhering a stretch film
 5 300 or the like over the treated region after the needles 200 are withdrawn from the skin. For
   example, the compression arrangement 730 can include a small roll of stretch film 300
   configured similar to a packing tape dispenser, The system 700 can be translated over the treated
   region after the needles 200 are withdrawn, to apply the film 300 over the holes 100 just formed.
   The film 300 can also be provided in pre-cut pieces that are sized to fit over the treated region.
 0 f[000911        According to a further exemplary embodiment, the compression arrangement 730
   can include a reservoir of a curable coating material, as described herein above, and it can be
   capable of applying such coating material to the surface of the treated region after the needles
   200 are withdrawn ftom the skin. In another embodiment, the compression arrangement 730 can
   be con figured or adapted to apply a photoactivated material (or precursor of such material), as
 5 described herein above, to at least a portion of the treated region, and directing light energy onto
   the region to activate the material. Embodiments of the system 700 in which the compression
   arrangement 730 is capable of applying other types of compression or tensioning elements to the
   treated region after the holes 100 are formed also fall within the scope of the present disclosure.
   Example
 0 [000921         An exemplary procedure in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments of
   the present disclosure was performed on the lower abdomen of a swine animal model to
   demonstrate the ability to produce directional shrinkage. Six test sites, each approximately a 3
   cm by 3 cm square, were tattooed onto the animal at Day 0, Seven control sites of the same size
   were also marked between the test sites. The control sites were included to account for net
25 growth of the animal over the course of observations,
   [000931         For example; 1.44 uniformly-distributed holes were made through the depth of the
   skin in each test site using a specially designed vacuum-assisted 19 gauge coring needle. The
   holes were formed in a substantially random array by manually inserting and withdrawing the
   coring needle 144 times at arbitrary locations within the test sites. The width of the holes formed
30 was approximately the same as the inside diameter of the needle, e,g., about 0.69 mm. This

  corresponds to a fractional surface area removal within each test site of about 6%. This
  corresponds to a relatively low fractional amount of skin tissue removed within the preferred
  ranges described herein.
  [000941          A pre-stretched sticky dressing (Tegadentry) was then adhered onto the test sites
5 and allowed to retract towards its original size, thus compressing the tissue as described herein
  above, Test sites 12,4,5 and 6 were compressed along the langer lines that run approximately
  horizontally from head to tail (e.g, in the X direction). Test site 3 was compressed across the
  langer lines (in the vertical or Y direction), No stretched film was applied to the seven control
  sites.
0 [000951          The dressing was left in place on each test site for seven days and then removed.
  The animal was observed, photographed and the width and height of each test and control site
  were measured until day 28.
  1000961          Photographic images of test site 6 taken at Day 0 (pre-treatment), Day 7 (when
  the dressing was removed), and Day 28, are shown in FIGS. SA, SB and 8C, respectively. The
5 sizes of these images were adjusted such that the ruler length is the same in each. The overall
  shape of the test site changed from substantially square to rectangular from Day 0 to Day 28,
  with the width of the test site (inthe direction of compression, along the langer lines) being about
  12% smaller at the end of observation compared to the initial size of the test site. The height of
  the test site (orthogonal to the compression direction) increased by about 17% by Day 28 as
0 compared to the pre-treatment height on Day 0. Further, no apparent scarring or markings are
  evident in these images, consistent with the expected cosmetic advantages of reducing skin area
  by formation of many very small holes.
  100097]          Table 1below shows the measured width and height (X and Y, respectively) of
  each test site on Day 0, Day 7. and Day 28. The data suggest that the width of sites 1,2, 4, 5 and
5 6 decreased slightly over the course of the observations, and that they tended to widen a bit
  between Day 7 (when the compressive dressing was removed) and Day 28., which may be
  partially attributed to relaxation of the unconstrained skin. The width of test site 3 increased
  between Day 0 and Day 7 because this site was compressed in the vertical direction, orthogonal
  to the other test sites. Similarly, the height of the test sites (except for site 3), orthogonal to the

0 noralized by the average width and height, respectively, of the control sites measured on the
  same day. This provides a rough correction for overall growth of the animal subject (i.e general
  increase in skin area) between measurements of the test site dimensions. Table 2 below includes
  the width and height of each control site as measured on Day 0, 7, and 28.

   the initial treatment, when overall growth of the animal subject was accounted for, There also
 5 appears to also be a slightly less-marked decrease. in the height of these test sites (orthogonal to

   embodiments of the present disclosure.
      I000100J      The observed effects (and differences in behavior between the X and Y
 0 directions) are somewhat modest in this exemplary study. A few factors should be noted when
   assessing these measured results. First, there are qualitative differences between human. and
   swine skin. It is expected that human skin, being thinner and less resilient, may be more affected
   under similar treatment conditions. Second, the fractional area of skin removed in each test area
   was only 6% which is relatively low. More marked results are likely to appear if a larger
 5 number of holes was forced within each test area (corresponding to a larger .fraction of skin
   removed, e.g., up to 25-30% or more), Also, the dressing did not always adhere very well to the.
   skin of the aninial subject, and tends to adhere more strongly to human skin, thus providing more
   effective compressive forces. Further, net growth of the animal subject during the observation
   period, although addressed in the data analysis, may still affect the normalized results, Such "net
 0 growTh" effects would not typical be present in mature human patients, so the actual skin
   shrinkage may be greater and associated directional differences may be greater
