   The      disclosure            relates         to     a   device          for       extracorporeal
   blood        treatment.            The      device        comprises             in      particular           a
   cassette          permitting             the     distribution                of     the       fluids       in
   order         to     carry         out       said       treatment,                and        means        for
10 improving           the     efficacy          of     said      device         that        can     be     used
   separately and/or with said cassette.
   Background
15
   The reference to prior art                            in this         specification is                    not
   and should not be taken as an acknowledgment or any form
   of    suggestion            that       the    referenced             prior         art       forms       part
   of    the      common       general          knowledge           in    Australia              or     in   any
20 other country.
   Prior art
   There        are     several           possible          reasons           why       a     person         may
25 suffer           from         renal           insufficiency,                     in        which          the
   temporary/permanent                      and     partial/total                  shutdown             forces
   this      person to use extracorporeal                            devices that               completely
   or partially replace the patient's own kidneys. Dialysis
   is   a technique            of blood purification.                        It    allows a patient
30 suffering           from       such       a   disease          to     eliminate              impurities
   such      as    urea      and excess             water       from the            organism,             which
   would          usually            have        been         eliminated                   by       normally
   functioning kidneys.
35 It     is     possible          to     differentiate                between            two      types      of
   renal insufficiency                    linked to the duration of the disease
   and          sometimes               requiring               considerably                      different
   treatments,            i.e.        chronic        renal         insufficiency                 and       acute

                                                    -2
   renal        insufficiency.               Chronic         renal       insufficiency             means
   that       the      patient          has     to    undergo        treatment            at    regular
   intervals            for      life.      For     this      purpose,          the     patient        can
   carry out this treatment at a medical center or at home
 5 using           an        apparatus            for        peritoneal              dialysis             or
   hemodialysis.               Acute       renal       insufficiency              is    a   temporary
   disease          in     which       the    patient         requires          an    apparatus          to
   temporarily replace the functions of his kidneys.                                            In   this
   case, the patient undergoes continuous renal replacement
10 therapy.             Peritoneal              dialysis           and      continuous             renal
   replacement               therapy         are      very       different,            as      are     the
   techniques and/or devices used:
        e    Peritoneal             dialysis        uses      the patient's peritoneum,
             which        is    the     natural        membrane         enclosing           the    walls
15           of      the      abdomen         and      the      organs        situated           in    the
             abdomen          (liver,        intestines,            etc.).         The    peritoneal
             membrane has a very large surface area and comprises
             a    very        large        number        of     blood       vessels.           It    thus
             performs            the      role       of      natural         filter.          Numerous
20           patents disclose                systems for carrying out peritoneal
             dialysis, some of which use cassettes                                    (EP 1 648        536
             A2,      EP 0 471         000    B1,     EP    1 195      171 Bl,        EP 1 648         536
             Bl)        for         injecting            fluid        into        the       patient's
             peritoneum and removing the fluid therefrom.
25      e    Continuous              renal      replacement           therapy          (CRRT)       is      a
             method in          which blood has to be removed continuously
             from the patient and treated by means of a                                         filter,
             generally a dialyzer, after which the treated blood
             is    re-injected            into the patient.                Two main principles
30           are used by virtue of the filter:
             -   Diffusion allows solute molecules to pass through
                    a      semipermeable                 membrane           according             to        a
                    concentration gradient.                     The solutes pass from the
                   more concentrated medium                        (the blood) to the less
35                  concentrated              medium         (the      dialysate)             and      are
                   distributed              uniformly            on      each        side       of     the
                   membrane of the filter.
             -     Convection permits                   the     simultaneous transfer                    of
                   water         and     of     its      solute       content          through         the

                                       -3
             semipermeable         membrane         by    virtue     of      the
             hydrostatic         pressure        gradient       across       the
             membrane. Thus, the solutes pass from the medium
             where the pressure is         highest      (blood compartment)
 5           to    the   medium     where     the     pressure    is    lowest
              (dialysate compartment).
   Various     techniques       of   continuous         renal    replacement
   therapy exist that use one or both of these principles:
10 slow    continuous       ultrafiltration            (SCUF),    continuous
   venovenous     hemofiltration        (CVVH),     continuous    venovenous
   hemodialysis           (CVVHD),           continuous           venovenous
   hemodiafiltration        (CVVHDF),     therapeutic plasma exchange
   (TPE)       and      hemoperfusion            (also       called      blood
15 detoxification) . At present,          no device is       able to provide
   all   of   these    treatments      without       the   intervention        of
   trained medical staff. In addition, these techniques are
   mainly       used      in      intensive          care      environments.
   Unfortunately,      these    techniques       make    use  of  cumbersome
20 appliances that can interfere with the proper conduct of
   other   treatments     carried     out on      the patient.     Moreover,
   these    appliances       are   complex       and     comprise    numerous
   consumables, and they require substantial changes to be
   made   in    order    to    carry     out    the    various    techniques
25 mentioned     above.   This    involves      the    personnel   receiving
   special training.
   General description
30 The   disclosure      relates     to    numerous       improvements       for
   medical    devices,    means    and/or methods         used for medical
   devices.
   The   present     application       claims      the    priority    of     the
35 application     bearing     the   number     PCT/IB2012/055972        filed
   on October 29, 2012 in the name of Debiotech, the entire
   content of which application must be regarded as forming
   part of the present application.

   In a first aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a
   linear        actuator          comprising           a    rotary          electric            motor,       a
   piston         and        means       which        are       interposed               between          the
   electric            motor      and       the      piston          for       transforming               the
 5 rotation          movement of the motor into a linear                                 displacement
   of the piston, said interposed means comprising:
           - at    least       one     peripheral           ramp       arranged            inside       said
               piston,
           - at      least       one      bearing         means          designed             so     as    to
10             cooperate with said peripheral ramp, and
           - at     least      one      guide      means         allowing            the      piston       to
               guide the translation movement,
   wherein         the      ramp      comprises          (i)     at      least        one      threshold
   located         at      the   summit        of    said      ramp        and      (ii)       a   passage
15 that       allows        the    piston        to    free       itself         of      the     stresses
   exerted by the ramp and said bearing means.
   The      may       additionally            comprise           compression                means       that
   exert a force against the piston in the main axis of the
20 rotor.          In this case, the ramp may be designed in such a
   way      as    to      allow      the     piston         to     maintain            at     least       two
   stationary positions                     of equilibrium without the                             need to
   power the electric motor:
           - a first position, in which the bearing means is                                               in
25             the passage, and
           -a    second        position,          in    which         the      bearing           means     is
               positioned on said threshold.
   In     the     first       position         of     equilibrium,               the       compression
30 means       may      force     said      piston        to    a    position            farther        away
   from the motor than to the                         second position.
   In     the     second        position          of    equilibrium,                the      interposed
   means may force the piston to a position                                      nearer the motor
35 than to the first position.
   The passage may extend below the lower part of the ramp.

                                                -5
   The      at   least      one     bearing         means       may    be    a   shaft        fixed
   perpendicularly to said rotor.
   The actuator may additionally comprise a position sensor
 5 for the piston.
   The interposed means may allow the piston to maintain in
   an    equilibrium           position         when       the     bearing       means        rests
   against        said     threshold           without         the   need      to    power        the
10 electric motor.
   The      threshold        may      be    a    substantially             planar       platform
   along an axis perpendicular to the main axis of the rotor.
15 The passage may extend from the summit of the ramp and/or
   in which the passage is                    juxtaposed to the threshold.
   The passage may be arranged in the                             same axis as the axis
   of linear movement of the piston.
20
   In   another aspect,             there is        disclosed an actuation system
   comprising          at    least        one     linear        actuator        as    disclosed
   above, a controller and at least one power supply means,
   said      system       being       designed           to    displace        at    least        one
25 piston from a            second position to                  a first position while
   consuming a small amount of energy.
   The power          supply      means       can be        an   external       power       supply

   one or all of the various techniques of continuous renal
   replacement              therapy:            slow       continuous             ultrafiltration
    (SCUF),         continuous             venovenous              hemofiltration                 (CVVH),
   continuous            venovenous            hemodialysis               (CVVHD),          continuous
 5 venovenous               hemodiafiltration                      (CVVHDF),              therapeutic
   plasma          exchange             (TPE)          and       hemoperfusion.                  In     one
   embodiment,             the    device         can     also      be    used      in    the     context
   of       peritoneal           dialysis,             where         some        elements          and/or
   features         might       not      be     used      or     could        be  used        for     other
10 functions,            such       as    taking        samples          or     the     like.       In    an
   embodiment,              the      cassette           is      partially           or      completely
   integrated            in    the     dialysis          apparatus,            or    some       of    these
   elements          form      part       of    said       apparatus            (for     example        the
   pumping         system,         the      sensors,          the     filter,         etc.)        or   are
15 physically            separate          from the          cassette           (for     example        the
   filter,        supply means,             reservoirs,             sensors,        heating means,
   etc.)       or are optional. Preferably, said cassette and the
   dialysis         apparatus           are      both       separate.           The    cassette         can
   be      discarded         whereas         the      apparatus          can be        reused.         This
20 means that           the cassette            can be replaced at each treatment
    (single use, replacement of the cassette after each use)
   and      that     the      apparatus           can      be    used      several          times      with
   different            cassettes.             Said       cassettes             are     designed          to
   cooperate             physically              and/or          mechanically                with       the
25 apparatus           and/or        vice     versa.         In    addition,          the      use     of   a
   single cassette makes it possible to simplify the use of
   said device, to reduce operator errors by virtue of this
   simplification,                to     automate           the      treatment           without        the
   intervention              of   medical          staff,         to    limit       the      number       of
30 cassette         types,        to     simplify          programming,             to     permit       the
   use of the device at the patient's home and/or to                                                  limit
   the space taken up by the device.
   According           to     a     second        aspect         of     the      disclosure,            the
35 device can comprise only 3 main pumps in order to                                                  carry

                  the patient            outlet          tube,        or farthest           upstream          in
                  the      cassette          by     virtue          of      a   connection           chamber
 5                that       allows        the       anticoagulant                 to   be    mixed       with
                  the blood (fluid                  of the second flow path),                          and/or
              -   A supply means by which a product inhibiting the
                  anticoagulant                is      injected            into      the     second       flow
                  path,        either         directly              into        the     patient         inlet

                  product to be mixed with the blood                                      (fluid of the
                  second flow path).
15 A third        aspect       of the disclosure                     relates         to the structure
   of the cassette, when a                          flow path              (coming, for example,
   from a liquid supply means)                              is connected to another flow
   path,        the      cassette          preferably                 comprises           a    connection
   chamber         permitting            the        intersection                 of     said      two     flow
20 paths. This connection chamber can thus permit mixing of
   the fluids coming from said flow paths.                                            In addition, at
   least        one      of     said       inlet          channels            of     said      connection
   chamber         can     comprise          a    valve,           such       that     the     controller
   can select the one or more defined fluids that will flow
25 into       the     connection           chamber            depending            on    the     treatment
   that is desired, programmed or controlled.
   According to a fourth aspect of the disclosure,                                               a heating
   means is         situated         in    the third             flow path between the main
30 pump of the dialysate and the distribution chamber. Said
   heating means is preferably a flexible bag supplied with
   positive           pressure          by     said         pump.        In      one     embodiment,            a
   second pump is               located between the distribution                                     chamber
   and      a   connection           chamber.             Preferably,               the    distribution
35 chamber         is     connected           to      a    first         and      second       connection
   chamber. The              first      connection chamber makes                             it    possible
   to carry out a pre-dilution                               of the fluid flowing in the
   second        flow path           (that        is     to      say     dilution         of     the    blood
   before the filtering means),                               while the second connection

                                                     -   10
   chamber         permits          a     post-dilution              of     the     fluid        of     said
   second        flow path            (that       is     to   say     dilution         of     the blood
   after       the filtering              means) . The first                pump is       a precision
   pump        by    which        it       is    possible          to     know      precisely             the
 5 quantity of fluid                  that     will       be mixed in           the blood at pre
   dilution          and     post-dilution.                 The     second        pump     is     located
   downstream of one of the                            two connection chambers, while
   the other connection chamber or both connection chambers
   can comprise             a valve.           This second pump                  is   a distributor
10 pump       by    which       it      is     possible         to     distribute            a    defined
   quantity of fluid                 between the first                  and second connection
   chambers.            This    type        of    system       can      comprise         one     or more
   other          connection               chambers.           Preferably,               the       system
   comprises            a pressure            sensor,        and      the     heating         means       can
15 serve as temporary storage means.
   To     optimize         the      function            of   the      treatment          system,          the
   following elements are disclosed, which can be used with
   or without the cassette described above:
20
             -     a means and a method for calibration                                 of the pumps
                   of the first and third flow paths,
             -     a pressure sensor offset from the flow path,
             -     an energy-saving linear actuator,
25           -     a drive device used for the peristaltic pumps,
             -     a means of damping the pressure peaks.
   Means        and method             for      calibration             of     the     pumps       and/or
   sensors of the first and third flow paths:
30
   In     certain         techniques             of      continuous           renal       replacement
   therapy,          it    is     essential             to   know      precisely           the     volume
   quantity injected                   into and withdrawn from the third and
   first        flow       paths.           The       devices         usually         comprise            two
35 balances,          namely a balance dedicated to the dialysate                                         and
   another          one     dedicated             to     the    filtrate.            The      presently
   disclosed             system          can       comprise           the        same       system          of
   balances,          but these balances are very sensitive                                   and bulky
    (since they have to be able to contain all                                     of the fluids).

                                             -  11
   Other devices have cavities of which the volume capacity
   is     known    with      precision.          These     cavities           are       located
   directly        on      the      first       and     third        flow        paths          (an
   intermediate         wall      being      used    so   as     not   to     mix      the     two
 5 fluids)      and    they      are    successively         filled       with       and     then
   emptied of the fluids               of said flow paths.             When the cavity
   fills      with   dialysate,          the    cavity     empties        itself         of    the
   filtrate previously contained in said cavity and/or vice
   versa.       These      devices         can    comprise          several        of      these
10 cavities.        However,         in    contrast       to     the    device          of     the
   present        disclosure,           these      devices         do    not       permit          a
   continuous        function,           and    instead        they     function            in     a
   succession of steps of filling                    and emptying of the fluids
   contained in said cavities.
15
   According        to     a    fifth       aspect     of     the     disclosure,              the
   treatment       system has          a means      for calibrating said pumps
   in     order    to    ensure       that     said     volumes        are       known       with
   precision. The system comprises:
20
            -   at least       two volume-measuring means                   (sensor,         mass
                flow      system,        volume       pump,        peristaltic             pump,
                balance,         etc.),        of    which        one     measures             the
                quantity of liquid             flowing through the third                     flow
25              path,      and     one     measures     the      quantity         of     liquid
                flowing through the first flow path;
            -   a   means       of   taking      samples        from     the      first        and
                third flow paths;
            -   a common means of measuring the sampled volumes.
30
   Said      common    measurement           means    measures        the     quantity           of
   fluid      sampled by the sampling means and makes it                             possible
   to     compare     the     sampled        volumes      and      to   calibrate            said
   pumps and/or said volume-measuring means.
35
   In      one   embodiment,          said      pumps     are       regarded          as     said
   volume-measuring             means      since    each    actuation          corresponds
   to a given volume.

                                                -   12
   In  another          embodiment,          the      volume       sensors        are     separate
   from     the      pumps        and    continuously              measure         the      volumes
   delivered by said pumps. In the event of drifting of the
   pumped      volumes,          the    controller           is     able     to     correct        the
 5 actuation of            said pumps in order to correct the volumes
   or the volume differential.
   A sixth aspect of the disclosure relates to a method for
   the   calibration            of   pumps        used to        deliver       the      fluids      of
10 the   first        and     third      flow       paths       and/or       of     the     sensors
   placed in        said flow paths.              The method additionally                      allows
   said     pumps        to   be    calibrated            before        and/or       during        the
   treatment.
15 Pressure sensor offset from the flow path:
   A seventh aspect of the disclosure                            relates       to a means for
   measuring the pressure of a fluid.                            In    one embodiment,             the
   treatment         system comprises                at least         one pressure sensor
20 in at least one of said flow paths. The present document
   discloses          a     fluid     distribution               system        (preferably            a
   cassette)          which        makes       it      possible          to    sample          and/or
   deliver a fluid Fll                and to measure the pressure of said
   fluid Fll.          The system comprises a rigid body composed of
25 at least      one flow path through which said fluid                               Fll      flows,
   at least        one channel           separate from said flow path. Said
   channel makes it possible to connect said flow path to a
   measuring         zone.        The    system         can     comprise         at    least       one
   opening        covered         by    a    flexible          membrane           forming         said
30 measuring         zone.       The    membrane          is    designed         to    receive        a
   pressure sensor.
   A fluid F12 different than the fluid F11 is                                     contained in
   said    measuring           zone.      The      fluid      F12      at   least       partially
35 fills the measuring zone and/or said channel. Said fluid
   F12   makes        it    possible        to     transmit         the     pressure          of   the
   fluid Fll to said membrane.

                                                    -    13
   The aim of this channel is that the fluid Fll                                            cannot come
   into contact with said membrane or that the fluid Fll                                                      at
   least     partially            wets said membrane.                   Thus,       the channel can
   be     designed        in      such      a    way      that       said     fluid       F11       limits,
 5 slows      and/or controls the flow of the fluid F11 through
   said channel.             It    has a shape and a length permitting this
   function and/or can                    comprise a means                  for containing the
   fluid      F11      (such       as    a    membrane,            a   hydrophilic             filter,           a
   hydrophobic filter,                   etc.).        Preferably,            the measuring zone
10 is     filled with both fluids F11 and F12 and/or the fluids
   F11 and F12 are in contact with the membrane.
   Energy-saving linear actuator:
15 In     one     embodiment,              the      treatment            system         comprises             at
   least       one      energy-saving                  linear         actuator.           The       present
   document             discloses               an         innovative              principle                 for
   controlling            a      linear          actuator           that      consumes             a     small
   amount       of energy             and     for      controlling           the      position             of    a
20 valve.        This       actuator            can       be    included          in     a    system          as
   described          above,         but     also        in    any     device        using       a     linear
   actuator.           In    particular,                the      actuator          must       offer          two
   basic      positions,             namely        valve        closed         (where        the       piston
   is    in  a first        position)           and valve opened                 (where the piston
25 is     in   a    second         position).              The     piston        can      also       have        a
   third      position            corresponding                to     a   state        in     which          the
   piston of the actuator is disengaged from the foot of the
   valve.
30 To ensure the function of linear actuator, two different
   techniques           are      normally          used:        the     electromagnet                 or     the
   brushless motor mounted with an endless screw and a nut.
   The      main     disadvantage                of    these        two    techniques              is      that
   they      consume         energy          in     order        to     maintain          a    position.
35 Thus,       there         is      further           disclosed           a      linear          actuator
   comprising            at     least       two       stationary           positions             with        low
   energy        consumption               and        a     rapid       return         to       a      safety
   position.           In     addition,            the       actuator          disclosed             by      the
   present        document does                not consume             any energy,             or only a

                                                  -   14
   small         amount         of     energy,          to     maintain          its      different
   positions.
   The      eighth        aspect       of    the     disclosure          thus      relates          to    a
 5 linear         actuator          comprising          a   rotary       electric          motor,         a
   piston,           and     means         which       are      interposed          between           the
   electric motor and the piston and transform the rotation
   movement of the motor                      into a linear displacement of the
   piston.           Said      interposed           means        comprise         at     least        one
10 peripheral           ramp arranged inside said piston,                            at least         one
   guide means allowing the piston to guide the translation
   movement, and at least                      one bearing means fixed directly
   or indirectly to                  the rotor of said electric motor. Said
   bearing means               is designed in such a way as                         to cooperate
15 with        said       peripheral           ramp.        In     one     embodiment,              said
   actuator additionally comprises at least one compression
   means        that      exerts         a   force       against       the      piston         in     the
   direction            of    the     distal        end     of     the    piston.          The      ramp
   comprises at              least one         threshold for            obtaining at              least
20 one       stationary           position          without        consuming           energy.         At
   least       one threshold is positioned at the                               summit of said
   ramp.         In     a    preferred           embodiment,           this       threshold            is
   followed by a passage allowing the piston to free itself
   of the        stresses exerted by the bearing means.
25
   According            to     a     ninth      aspect         of    the     disclosure,              the
   actuator is able to guarantee a given occlusion pressure
   when       the     valve      is    in    the    closed position.                The     position
   of     the valve          with      no    contribution           from the          actuator         is
30 preferably              a      closed         position.            To     guarantee              good
   occlusion,             the      actuator         has      a    compression            means        for
   ensuring           a   sufficient           occlusion          pressure         of    the      valve
   against its            seat when the piston is                  in  the first          position.
   Said compression means permits a third                                position          (when the
35 piston is not engaged with the valve) in which the piston
   is   located farther                away from the support of the actuator.
   The passage from the third                       position        to the first            position
   is     effected         when      the     piston       engages      with the           valve.       In
   other words, when the cassette                             is placed in the device.

                                              -    15
   Thus, the        compression means                compels the piston to                      exert
   an initial force against the valve, which transmits this
   force      against        the      seat    of     the     valve,         guaranteeing              an
   occlusion         of    the      flow    path      when      the      piston      is     in      the
 5 first position.
   In one embodiment,                 said compression means can                      be on the
   support of the actuator or in                      said piston.            In  other words,
   when said piston of the actuator is                            engaged with the foot
10 of the valve,            i.e.      in the       first position,               a compression
   means      ensures        prestressing            in    order       to     guarantee           good
   occlusion. Said compression means can be mounted in the
   actuator         or      on     the      support         of     the       actuator,            said
   compression         means        making      it    possible         to     obtain      a     third
15 position in which the piston of the                              actuator is            farther
   from the       support          of   the   actuator          than      in    the   first         and
   second positions.                The    occlusion pressure depends on the
   design       of     the       valve      and      on     the      dimensions             of      the
   compression means.

   Drive device used for the peristaltic pumps:
   A tenth aspect of the disclosure                        relates        to a drive device
   used for a pump.
25
   During the use of said treatment                           system, the cassette is
   inserted        in     a   cycler        which       comprises           sensors,         linear
   actuators        (for opening and closing the valves),                              and means
   for driving the rollers                  of the peristaltic                 pump.     In     order
30 to    guarantee         correct         functioning           of   the       system,        it     is
   important        that       all     the    elements          are     correctly          aligned
    (sensor, actuator, actuation means, etc.).                                 Now, there may
   be a difference between the theoretical central point of
   the head of the pump                   and the actual central point.                           This
35 difference          creates         problems          in    the      alignment           of      the
   actuators and of the sensors,                       respectively, on the valves
   and      the  measuring            zones     of      the    cassette.           Thus,        guide
   means      make       it     possible        to      overcome          this      problem           of
   alignment for the sensors and actuators but transpose the

                                                   -   16
   difference              to     the    pumping        system.          Thus,        stresses          of    a
   greater or lesser degree may be exerted on the                                                elements
   of      the      pump,         which      may      affect        the       precision            of    the
   peristaltic                pump.        The      phenomenon              is      all        the      more
 5 pronounced when the pumps are present                                      in large number.
   In     order        to    relax       the     manufacturing               tolerances             and    to
   guarantee the precision                        of the peristaltic pumps,                            there
   is     also       disclosed           a   drive       device         for      the      pumps        which
10 comprises a floating shaft driven by a drive means fixed
   to a rotor. The floating shaft comprises a rigid assembly
   of base and cover that forms                             a cavity inside which said
   drive         means        is      at    least       partially             circumscribed.               In
   addition,              said        drive      means        comprises              a     rigid        body
15 designed in such a way as to cooperate with the walls of
   said        cavity       in     order     to    permit        a    restricted             freedom       of
   the       floating           shaft      with      respect         to     the      shaft        of    said
   rotor. The floating shaft allows the axis of the pumping
   system          to     be     off-centered,            so     as     to     minimize           or    even
20 eliminate all                 stresses exerted by the shaft of the pump
   on the theoretical pumping shaft of the cassette.
   Means for damping the pressure peaks:
25 An eleventh aspect of the disclosure relates to                                                a means
   for damping the pressure peaks.
   The quantity of a pumped fluid can be                                       influenced by the
   constituent              elements         of   the      system.          These        elements        can
30 be the pumping mechanism,                        the valve mechanism,                     the liquid
   supply          means        (tubes,      reservoirs,             etc.).         In     particular,
   the      pumping          mechanism          of    a   peristaltic              pump        can     cause
   variations             in pressure. Thus,                 a pressure wave forms                       and
   spreads through the one or more flow paths each time the
35 rollers          come       into     contact        with      the      flexible          tube.       This
   spread is           attenuated or reinforced by a number of factors
   such as the type of liquid, the length of the flow path,
   the      restrictions,               the    type      of materials              of      the     system,
   the         quantity            of     liquid         delivered             by        the      pumping

                                                   -   17
    mechanism,           the     type     of pump,            the characteristics            of its
    components           (flexible         tube,      etc.),       the pressure downstream
    of the pump, etc.
  5 One     of    the      improvements            of    this      disclosed        aspect    is   to
    reduce        the       amplitude          of      the       pressure        peaks     and    the
    influence thereof on the quantity pumped. This reduction
    is    achieved by adding to the                           flow path a means designed
    to absorb the pressure peaks.
10
    Another         advantage            of   this        reduction         of     the    peaks    is
    likewise          that       of     obtaining            a   more   constant         pressure,
    which increases patient comfort. In this embodiment, the
    peaks       can     be     damped        downstream            of  the      pump     during    an
15  injection toward the patient, and upstream when the pump
    withdraws a fluid coming from the patient                                      (in particular
    during peritoneal dialysis).
    This       damping          means        can      be       a   cavity       filled      with      a
20  compressible             fluid       such      as    air.      This    damping       means    can
    be    a   flexible          element       that       is      deformed      by    the   pressure
    peaks        and       returns        to     a      state       of    equilibrium.           This
    flexible element can, for example, be a polymer membrane
    in the wall of the flow path.

   Detailed description
25
   In      the        present         document,          the       detailed         description
   includes embodiments                   of devices,          systems and methods that
   are      presented              by   way       of    illustration.              It    will     be
   appreciated              that     other      embodiments          are      conceivable        and
30 may be applied without departing from the scope or spirit
   of    the      disclosure.           Therefore,          the     detailed        description
   given below must not be taken in a restrictive sense.
   Unless otherwise indicated, the scientific and technical
35 terms         used         in     the     present         document           have     meanings
   currently              used     by   a    person        skilled         in    the    art.     The
   definitions             given in      this      document are mentioned in                   order
   to    facilitate              an  understanding            of    the     terms     frequently

   used       and    are    not       intended          to     limit        the       scope        of     the
   invention.
   The indications of direction used in the description and
 5 in      the    claims,        such      as     "up",       "down",         "left",           "right",
   "upper",         "lower",          and     other       directions             or     orientations
   are      mentioned         in     order       to    afford        greater           clarity          with
   reference          to    the        figures.          These        indications                are      not
   intended to limit the                     scope of the invention.
10
   In     the    present        document,           the     verbs       "have",           "comprise",
   "include"          or     equivalent             are      used       in       a     broad        sense,
   generally signifying "including but not limited to".
15 The      word     "or"      is     generally           employed          in      a    broad        sense
   covering         "and/or"         unless         the     context         clearly           indicates
   the contrary.
   In     the present           disclosure,            a   channel          can be         defined         as
20 being        a    flow       conduit          of     hollow         and        elongate            shape
   allowing the passage of a liquid                              and/or of a gas from one
   location to another.                    It    can take the             form of a flexible
   tube       or   tubing        or    of    a    cavity        inside        a    cassette.            Some
   channels have valves that can be                               actuated preferably by
25 means       of   a  linear         actuator         governed           by     a    controller           in
   order       to   close       or    open       the    channel.          Without           actuation,
   said       valves     are      preferably            closed.         A    chamber           can     be    a
   cavity or a channel having several inlets and/or outlets
   or      can    take    the       form      of     a   simple        intersection                of     two
30 channels. Each chamber has an inlet called inlet channel
   and an outlet called outlet channel.
   Principle of a blood treatment system as disclosed herein
35 The      embodiment           shown       schematically               in      Figure         27     is    a
   simplified          embodiment.               The     treatment            system          comprises
   three       pumps       (507,        508,       509),       three        flow        paths        and     a
   filtration          means        or    filter         (513).       The       first        flow       path
   starts from the filtering means                              (513) and reaches to the

                                                       -    28
   reservoir            (517),        also        called          the       fluid         recovery           means.
   The fluid flowing through the                                    first flow path                    is     called
   the      filtrate.             The       second             flow        path        starts           from         the
   patient,          passes through the                         filter          (513) and returns to
 5 the patient              (500).        The      fluid flowing through the                                  second
   flow      path       is     the     blood          of      the     patient.             The      third          flow
   path is supplied with a fluid generally called dialysate
    (although          the      disclosure               is      not     limited            to    this        fluid)
   which flows from the first liquid supply means, likewise
10 called dialysate                 reservoir               (514) . The dialysate                      initially
   flows through the                    third flow path, after which it flows
   into      one     or more           secondary               flow      paths          (in     diluted            form
   or     transformed) .               The      dialysate               (or       other        fluid         of      the
   third flow path) can:
15
   -        mix with the blood:
                  - before            the      filter            (513)        in     order        to     effect         a
                      pre-dilution, and/or
                  -    after        the      filter             (513)       in      order        to      effect         a
20                    post-dilution, and/or
                  -    supply the filter                        (513).
   In order to permit these different solutions and thereby
   perform any treatment technique by dialysis,                                                     the       system
25 requires           three         chambers              (501,         502,          503) .       The        second
   chamber          (502),        also       called            distribution                 chamber,            makes

                                                 -   32
   The treatment system additionally                            comprises,          in   the third
   flow path, a flow adjuster                       (13, P2')        located between said
   distribution               chamber         (Cl)      and     said     first         connection
 5 chamber         (C2).
   In one embodiment, the third flow path has an additional
   pump      (P2')      in     the    third      flow      path,      located        between       the
   distribution               chamber         (Cl)      and     said     first         connection
10 chamber         (C2).      Said additional pump (P2') has the complete
   or    partial         role      of   flow      adjuster.          The   aim      of    the    flow
   adjuster         is   to control the flow of the fluid                          passing from
   the distribution                 chamber        (Cl)     to the      connection          chamber
    (C2).      The adjuster thus makes                      it possible to             distribute
15 the quantity of fluid in the connection chamber                                         (C2) and
   at     least        one      other       connection            chamber       or     the     blood
   filtration means                 (3).
   In     one      embodiment,            one     or    more       flow    adjusters            (also
20 called         flow       restrictors)             can      be    placed        between         any
   chamber         or   element         (for     example        blood     filtration           means
    (3)).     A flow adjuster                (13) can be a pump, a proportional
   valve       and/or a set of channels                       with dedicated valve and
   different           diameters,           etc.    A     supplementary            safety      valve
25 can be added upstream or downstream of the flow adjuster
    (13 -     520).       A flow adjuster permits a 0% to 100%                              flow of
   the fluid,          at one moment or during a given period,                              through
   said      flow       means.       In     other     words,        the   flow        of   a   fluid
   coming        from       at    least       one     liquid        supply       means       can     be
30 distributed between the different                               channels        according to
   the requirements of the treatment.
   In one embodiment, the treatment system (14)                                      comprises a
   second        liquid         supply       means       (F2    -   515)     located         on    the
35 patient outlet tube                  (5) or in the cassette                   (2, 2' - 601).
   Said      second        supply       means       can      contain      an     anticoagulant
   such as citrate, heparin, danaparoid sodium or similar.

   In   one     embodiment,         said    system         (14)      comprises        a   third
   liquid      supply means           (F3   -    516)     located          on the      patient
   inlet      tube    (6)    or   in    the    cassette         (2,     2'   -    601).     Said
   liquid       supply      means      can    contain         calcium         or     an   agent
 5 inhibiting the anticoagulant.
   On the patient inlet tube (6) and/or in the cassette (2,
   2'   -    601),      the    system      comprises           at     least      one     safety
   element (7) for detecting air bubbles in the second flow
10 path     and/or      for    stopping the           circulation            of the       blood
   and/or a means for capturing said air bubbles.

   According to the operating principle disclosed by Figure
   31,    in    order      to   be    effective,          the      fluid      distribution
   system       (whether        for    a   cassette           as     described          in    the
   present document or for another distribution system) can
20 comprise a precision pump (702),                       a fluid supply means, a
   flexible       bag     (703)    and an       additional           distribution           pump
    (707) . The system additionally comprises a main flow path
    (701)     which      divides       into     at    least         two     secondary         and
   separate flow paths              (704,   704') . The precision pump (702)
25 and    the    flexible       bag     (703)     are positioned               in    the main
   flow      path      (701),      the    flexible           bag      being       positioned
   downstream of           said pump.        Thus,      all     the pumped fluid is
   known with precision and can at least in part be stored
   at least temporarily in the flexible bag. The additional
30 pump     (707)     is    positioned        in   one      of    the      secondary        flow
   paths      (704).     Preferably,         the other           secondary         flow path
    (704')     comprises        a   valve      (705).       In    one      embodiment,          at
   least      one   flow     path     comprises         a pressure            sensor       (706)
   positioned          downstream         of     the      precision           pump       (702).
35 Preferably, said pressure sensor                         (706)      is positioned in
   the     secondary         flow     path       (704),       which         comprises         the
   additional        pump      (707),     and     upstream          of     the    additional
   pump.      The    flexible        bag    (703)      is     preferably           a   heating
   means.

                                                    -   34
   Given          that         some           techniques              of        continuous                renal
   replacement therapy require heating the dialysate and/or
   substitution              liquid          during        its      injection,             said      heating
 5 means        (4)      can     be      located        at      various           locations            of     the
   third       flow path.              In    one    embodiment,               the      cassette          has      a
   heating          means       (4)      inside       the      distribution                chamber           (Cl)
   or upstream of the latter.
10 In    one     embodiment              according           to     the      principle           described
   above,        the      heating          means      (4)      is     a   flexible          bag      located
   between          the main pump                (P2)      of     said      third        flow path            and
   said distribution                    chamber        (Cl),         which makes             it    possible
   to create a constant positive pressure in said bag                                                        (4).
15 The     heating          means        is    supplied           continuously              by    the       pump
    (P2),      which        makes         it   possible,             among        other       things,          to
   guarantee proper                   control of the reheating of the                                   liquid
   of    the      third       flow        path.       Said      bag       (4)     is     then      directly
   connected to              the inlet            channel          (V9) of the distribution
20 chamber          (Cl).
   As     a    result         of      this       configuration,                  all      the      injected
   liquid         passes         through           a    single          pump         (P2).       The        pre
   dilution           pump      (P2')         (also     called          additional             pump)         only
25 distributes             the      liquid        before          and/or        after       the      filter.
   Thus, a single precision pump is necessary. The pump (P2)
   is    the precision pump and allows the                                     quantity of pumped
   fluid        to     be   known.           The    additional              pump       simply        permits
   distribution             between the pre-dilution                           (before the filter)
30 and the post-dilution                       (after the filter).                      The use of the
   pumps is           as follows:
             -     If     only       post-dilution                is     programmed:              the       pre
                   dilution          pump (P2')           is    stopped and all                 the liquid
35                 will be injected after the filter                                    (3).     The post
                   dilution          valve        (V8)      is     opened.         The pre-dilution
                   valve       (V5) is preferably closed.

                                          -    35
        -  If     only    pre-dilution               is   programmed:             the      post
           dilution         pump        (P2)       delivers        the        substitution
           volume.        The     post-dilution              valve         (V8)      prevents
           passage of the liquid after the                           filter. The pre
 5         dilution        pump       (P2')        also     makes       it     possible        to
           regulate        the     fluid        so    as   to   avoid         the    pressure
           in the heating means                    (4) becoming negative.
        -  If        pre-dilution                  and        post-dilution                   are
10         programmed:          the main pump               (P2) delivers              all the
           substitution volume required (pre and post).                                       The
           post-dilution             valve         (V8)     is    opened.           The     pre
           dilution        pump       (P2')       taps     some    of      the     liquid      in
           order      to    inject          it    before      the      filter          (3).    If
15         there       is       an       error          of     precision              in      the
           distribution             before         and     after        injection,            its
           seriousness          is     limited because the                    volume       is  in
           any case        injected into the patient.
20 Use of the cassette depending on the various treatments:
   -    Slow continuous ultrafiltration                         (SCUF):
        Figure     2  shows      the     use      of    the   cassette           applying         a
        treatment      of    slow continuous                ultrafiltration.                This
25      technique      is     used       to      eliminate        excess          liquid       by
        means of the convection principle.
        Thus, the controller opens only the valve V1 of the
        second     flow path         and       closes      the   valves         V5,      V7   and
30      V8 of the third flow path. The pumps P1 and P3 then
        function, while P2 and P2'                      do not function.
   -    Continuous venovenous hemofiltration                               (CVVH):
        Figure     3  shows      the     use      of    the   cassette           applying         a
35      treatment      of    continuous            venovenous          hemofiltration.
        This    technique         is     used       to    obtain       the      removal        of
        dissolved       substances              by    means     of      the      convection
        principle. A substitution solution is injected into

                                   - 36
     the      circuit     before      (pre-dilution)        and/or     after
      (post-dilution) the filtration means                  (3).
     Thus,      the   controller       opens    the   valves    V1   of  the
 5   second flow path and V5 and/or V8 of the third flow
     path, and the valve V7 is closed. The pumps P1, P2
      (optionally P2') and P3 function.
   - Continuous venovenous hemodialysis                  (CVVHD):
10   Figure      4  shows   the use of the cassette             applying    a
     continuous venovenous hemodialysis treatment.                      This
     technique is       used to obtain the removal of dissolved
     substances        (small    molecules:       urea,    creatinine,    K,
     etc.)      and   to   obtain      a  water     equilibrium      by  the
15   diffusion principle. The dialysate is injected into
     the filtration means            (3).
     Thus,      the   controller       opens    the   valves    V1   of  the
     second flow path and V7 of the third flow path, and
20   the valves       V5   and V8 remain closed.            The pumps    Pl,
     P2 and P3 function.
   - Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF):
     Figure      5  shows   the use of the cassette             applying    a
25   treatment              of           continuous             venovenous
     hemodiafiltration. This technique is used to obtain
     the      removal     of   dissolved        substances       (small   or
     medium-sized molecules) by means of the principles
     of diffusion and convection. The dialysate and/or a
30   substitution          solution       are      injected      into    the
     filtration       means    (3)   and into      the blood after       the
     filtration means          (3).
     Thus,      the   controller       opens     the    valve   V1   of  the
35   second      flow path and also the valves V7                and V8   of
     the third flow path.             The valve      V5   remains   closed.
     The       pumps    P1,    P2     and    P3     function.      In   this
     embodiment,        the    outlet      channels      V7   and   V8   are

                                            -   37
     proportional valves or another means of controlling
     the flow that passes through these valves.
     In     another          embodiment,              shown        in     Figure         5',  the
 5   cassette           comprises             a     supplementary               distribution
     chamber           (Cl.2)          and       a      supplementary               connection
     chamber          (Cl.1).            Said       supplementary               distribution
     chamber           (Cl.2)            is      supplied             directly           by   the
     additional                pump            (P2').            Said          supplementary
10   distribution               chamber          (Cl.2)        makes       it    possible      to
     distribute            the       dialysate             or   substitution              product
     either to the first connection chamber                                      (C2) for the
     pre-dilution               or     to     said       supplementary              connection
     chamber           (Cl.1).            Said         supplementary                connection
15   chamber         (C1.1)         is    also       supplied with              dialysate      or
     substitution               product           by       the     first        distribution
     chamber         (Cl)       by     means       of      the    outlet        channel      with
     dedicated               valve             (V7')     .       Said          supplementary
     connection chamber                   (Cl.1)        also has an outlet                channel
20    (V7'') connecting to the filter                               (3).      The benefit of
     such an arrangement is to increase the precision of
     the quantities               injected          into the filter              and into the
     second connection chamber                             for the post-dilution or

     pump      (P2')     ensures that              the quantities              of fluid      that
     are        to      be       distributed                 are      distributed            with
     precision.            In      this       embodiment,              for     a    continuous
     venovenous           hemodiafiltration treatment,                              the    valves

     Figure        6   shows        the     use      of     the   cassette          applying      a
     therapeutic plasma exchange. This technique permits
35   plasma           exchange              by        membrane             filtration.           A
     substitution                solution            is      injected          in     order    to
     replace the extracted plasma.

         Thus,       the    controller           opens       the     valve      V1   of     the
         second flow path and also the valve V8 of the third
         flow path. The valves V5                      and V7     remain closed. The
         pumps P1, P2 and P3 function. Preferably, F2 and F3

   -     Hemoperfusion:
         Figure       7   shows     the    use      of    the   cassette        applying       a
         treatment         of hemoperfusion. This                   technique is          used
10       to eliminate the toxic substances from the blood of
         a  patient,         where      the    filtration          means      contains       an
         absorbent          substance.          A      substitution          solution         is
         injected in order to replace the extracted plasma.
15       Thus,       the    controller           opens       the     valve      Vl   of     the
         second flow path and also the valve V8 of the third
         flow path. The valves V5                      and V7     remain closed. The
         pumps P1 and P2 function, while the pump P3 does not
         function. Preferably, F2 and F3 deliver their fluid
20       in the       second flow path.

25          V10',       V10''),          the      first         being       connected           to    the
            patient            inlet         tube            (6),        the      second          being
            connected             to     an     inlet           channel          of     the      second
            connection              chamber           (C4),         and     the       third       being
            connected             either        to        a    recovery          means        (F5)      or

            means       (C6).
   This embodiment permits the following, for example:
   -    If  a problem             occurs,         the        controller           can     close       the
35      valve V10         in order, for example, to avoid injecting
        an air bubble               into the patient, or another element
        that may endanger the patient's life. In this case,
        the blood remaining in the cassette                                      and the         filter
        risks coagulating.                   It     is      therefore          imperative           that

   sensors of the first and third flow paths:
20 Some techniques            of continuous             renal replacement therapy
   require precise knowledge of the quantity of the volume
   injected and withdrawn via the third flow path and first
   flow path, respectively. The treatment system preferably
   comprises peristaltic pumps. This                            type of pump may have
25 a certain imprecision. Thus,                       according to Figure                     10,    in
   order    to     know with precision                 the     volume        quantity            added
   or withdrawn, the distribution system comprises at least
   two volume sensors, which are able to measure the volumes
   of the third and first                  flow paths.

   The first sensor            (15)      is arranged in the third flow path
   between the distribution                    chamber        (Cl)     and the main pump
    (P2)  and      measures        the     injected         volume        coming         from       the
   first     liquid       supply         means      (Fl,      Fl').       Preferably,               the
35 sensor      (15)    is   located after the heating means                               (4).      The
   second      sensor       (17)      is    placed        in      the    first        flow         path
   downstream of the pump and before any other chamber.                                            Said
   second      sensor      (17)     measures         the     volume       of     the      filtrate

                                          -    41
   withdrawn.     To    avoid      any    risk       of     contamination,               the     two
   sensors  are preferably located in the cassette.
   In   a  preferred             embodiment,               the        treatment            system
   comprises:
 5       -  a   third        volume       sensor          (16)       for       comparing         the
           volumes          measured         by      the      two       preceding          volume
            sensors         (15,    17),     said sensor               also being          called
            a reference sensor,
         -  a  means        of    sampling         the     fluids          coming     from the
10          first and          third flow paths.                  Said sampling means
            comprises a sixth connection chamber                                   (C8) having
            an    outlet         channel         directly           connected           to     said
           third       sensor        (16)     and      two     inlet         channels         (V19,

         -  optionally,            a   seventh           connection             chamber        (C9)
20          allowing         the     reference           sensors           (16)    to    discard
           the      liquids         measured          in     the      filtrate         recovery
           means       (F4).
   To avoid any risk          of contamination,                said third           sensor can
25 preferably be located in the cassette.
   The method comprises the following steps:
         -  calibration of the volume injected:
         -     opening of the valve                      (V21) and closure of the

            -         calibration of the first sensor                     (15) and/or of
                      the pump          (P2)
            -     calibration of the volume withdrawn:
            -         opening of the valve                  (V15) and closure of the
 5                    other valves,
            -         actuation of           the pump         (P3) of the     filtrate of

            -         measurement          of the volume           pumped by     said pump
                       (P3) via said second sensor                   (17)  of said first
10                    flow path,
            -         measurement            of    said      pumped     volume     via      the
                      reference sensor               (16),
            -         comparison of the two measurements,
            -         calibration of the first sensor                     (15) and/or of
15                    the pump          (P2).
   These steps can be performed at the time of priming and/or
   during the treatment.
20 The first and second sensors                        (15, 17)     are set to a common
   sensor called reference sensor                          (16)   for relative optimum
   precision.               Said         sensors,         although        inexact,          are
   sufficiently             effective,        since they are (relatively)               exact
   in comparison with the reference sensor                              (16).
25
   Said reference sensor (16) can be a balance, a volumetric
   pump, a mass flow sensor or any sensor by which a volume
   can be measured or deduced.
30 Preferably,              said       first      and    second      sensors      (15,      17)
   continuously              measure       the     liquids        passing    through        the
   third      and first          flow paths,        respectively.        By means of the
   continuous measurement of the volumes,                             it is possible to
   compensate for possible drifting.

   Pressure sensor offset from the flow path:
   According to Figures 11,                     12 and 13,        there is disclosed a
   fluid       distribution             system      (100)      (preferably     a   cassette

                                                     -    43
   as described above) by means of which it                                        is     possible to
   sample       and/or           deliver          a    fluid       Fll      from    and/or         to     the
   patient         and      to measure             the      pressure         of  said       fluid       Fll.
   The     system         comprises            a   rigid      body        (105)    composed          of      at
 5 least      one flow path                  (103),        through which said fluid Fll
   flows, and at least one channel                                (102).      Said channel             (102)
   is    separate from the flow path (103)                                and makes it          possible
   to connect said flow path to a measuring zone                                             (101).       The
   system additionally comprises at least one opening (106)
10 covered          by        a    flexible            membrane            (104)       forming          said
   measuring           zone.         The      membrane         is      designed        to     receive           a
   pressure sensor                  (107).
   A fluid F12 different than the fluid Fll is                                          contained in
15 said measuring zone                      (101) . The fluid              F12 extends at least
   in part into said channel                            (102).      Said fluid F12 makes                     it
   possible          to     transmit           the      pressure          of   the     fluid       Fll       to
   said membrane                (104) by contact.                   Said channel             (102)      is      a
   flow     restrictor              designed           in    such      a   way   that       said      fluid
20 F11     cannot          come       into        contact        with       said     membrane.            The
   length       and/or           the      shape        of    said       pressure        transmission
   channel         (102)        depends on the expansion capacity                                 of said
   fluid     F12 and/or on the range of pressure to be measured.
   Preferably,              the      channel            (102)      comprises          at     least        one
25 section that               is    sufficiently narrow to retain the                                 fluid
   F11 so that            said fluid             does not enter said measuring zone
    (101).
   In      one      embodiment,                  the       channel          (102)       comprises               a
30 hydrophobic             filter          (108) or a membrane.
   In    one    embodiment,                an interface             of membrane            (104)/fluid
    (Fl3)/cell of the sensor                          (107) is created so as to avoid
   friction by the membrane                           (104) on said cell, which could
35 create disturbances                       in the measurement. An interface                                of
   liquid         (Fll)/fluid               (Fl2)/membrane                (104)     is      created          in
   order      to     avoid         the      membrane          (104)       being      wetted        by     the
   liquid        (Fll)      .   The      transmission             of     the    pressures          of     Fll
   is    ensured          by     the      fluids         F12   and       F13    arranged          on    each

                                                      -44
   side of the membrane                      (104).        F12    and F13 preferably have
   the same physical properties.                             Preferably,          F12 and F13 are
   air.        Said      membrane            (104)       can     deform          with      equivalent
   stresses         on each side of these faces,                           so as to compensate
 5 for the variations in the volume of air, trapped between
   the       membrane          (104)       and      the      sensor        (107),        due       to    the
   temperature.
   In    another          embodiment,            the      fluid      Fll     is    aqueous,          while
10 F12      is   lipid, and F13 can be either lipid or aqueous.
   In     another          embodiment,             Figure         13'      discloses             a   fluid
   distribution              system         (100)       which      permits         the      flow       of     a
   fluid Fl            and makes          it possible to measure the pressure
15 of     said      fluid       Fll.        The     system        comprises          a    rigid         body
    (105)      composed of at least                      one flow path             (103),         through
   which        said      fluid       Fl       flows,         and     at    least       one       channel
    (102).       Said channel             (102) is          separate from the flow path
    (103) but communicates so that the fluid Fll can flow in
20 the       channel         (102) .        Thus,        the     channel          (102)       makes        it
   possible          to    connect         said      flow       path     to     a measuring             zone
    (101) .      The      system        additionally              comprises          at      least       one
   opening           (106)       covered          by       a    flexible          membrane            (104)
   forming         said      measuring           zone.        Said     opening         (106)        can    be
25 of     a    size     equal        to     or    different           than      the     size       of    the
   channel         (102).       In addition,               the membrane is               designed to
   receive         a   pressure          sensor         (107).      A    fluid      F12       different
   than       the    fluid       Fll     is    contained           in    said measuring                 zone
    (101).       The fluid F12 is contained at least in part in the
30 measuring zone and/or in the channel                                    (102).
   In     an    embodiment            again       illustrated             by     Figure        13',      the
   quantity and/or the volume of the fluid F12                                           is     constant
   or    can      decrease         over       the      course       of    time      such       that      the
35 fluid Fll           advances with               greater        or     lesser       speed         in the
   channel         (102) and/or the measuring zone                               (101).
   In    one     embodiment,             the     measuring           zone       (101)      and/or        the
   channel         (102) contain at least in part the fluid F12 and

                                                -  45
   the fluid           Fl.      The  fluid       Fll    can partially              wet   or be     in
   contact          with the       membrane         (104).        The    length        and/or     the
   shape of said pressure transmission channel                                     (102)    depends
   on the expansion capacity of said fluid                                F12 and/or on the
 5 range of pressure to be measured.
   The     channel          (102)    can    be    designed          in    such      a   way    as  to
   limit        and/or        slow   the     progress          of     the    fluid       Fll,     for
   example,            during      the     use      of      said       system.         The     fluid
10 distribution              system     (100)      can     be    adapted        in    such     a  way
   as     to     guarantee          that      the      membrane           (104)       and/or      the
   measuring zone               (101)    are not completely wetted by or                           in
   contact with the fluid                  Fll    during the use of said system.
15 Energy-saving linear actuator:
   There        is further disclosed a linear actuator                                (200) using
   a motor         (for example a direct-current motor                             (or DC motor)
   or another type of motor known to a person skilled in the
20 art)        (201)       coupled      to     interposed            means       that     make     it
   possible           to    transform       the     rotation           of   the      motor     shaft
   into       a   linear       movement.       Preferably,             the motor         can     also
   comprise a torque reducer.
25 In particular, the interposed means comprise:
        e    at     least one peripheral ramp                      (214) arranged             inside
             a piston          (207),
        e    at least         one bearing means                (209) fixed directly or
             indirectly          to the rotor          (208)      of said electric             motor
30            (201),       said    bearing        means       (209)      being       designed      in
             such a way as to cooperate with said peripheral                                     ramp
              (214),
        e    at     least      one   guide       means       (203,       216)      allowing       the
             piston         (207) to guide the translation movement.
35
   Said       ramp        (214)    comprises         at     least       one     threshold,         of
   which        one     threshold        (215)      is    located         at    the     summit     of
   said        ramp        (214).      In     one      embodiment,             at      least      one
   threshold can be designed in such a way as                                       to cooperate

                                                -    46
   with     the     bearing        means.       For     example,       the    threshold         can
   be    perfectly          flat      and     horizontal          with     respect         to   the
   vertical         movement of the piston. The                       threshold can           also
   have      a   specific        shape       for      ensuring      a   good     hold      of   the
 5 bearing means in order to guarantee that the position is
   maintained,            for    example        the     embodiment        on    the    right       in
   Figure 18'.            In addition, the threshold                      (215) located at
   the summit of said ramp                   (214)      can be followed by a passage
    (219)      allowing        the      piston        (207)   to    free     itself        of   the
10 stresses exerted by said bearing means                               (209).
   The piston can comprise                     one or more ramps and/or one or
   more passages. At least one ramp can have an inclination
   of between 0 and 90'.                  In   one embodiment,            said inclination
15 can be between 0 and 45',                       preferably between 10 and 30'.
   Said       piston        (207)       comprises          at  least       two       stationary
   positions:
20 -        a    first      position,           in     which    the      piston        (207)       is
            situated         at     a   distance         (d2)    equal      to     A.    In   this
           position, the bearing means                        (209) is located at the
            start of the ramp;
   -        a    second       position,           in    which     the    piston        (207)       is
25          situated         at     a   distance         (d2)    equal      to     B.    In   this
           position, the bearing means                        (209) cooperates with a
            threshold           allowing          the     piston       to    maintain         this
           position.
30 The system has several                    advantages:
       *   No      need     to    power       the     motor    in     order      to    keep     the
           valve opened              (3rd stable state).
       *    The      actuator          will       not     heat     when     maintaining               a
           position.
35     *    Low operating noise.
       *    Substantial travel.
   In a preferred embodiment such as is shown in Figure 16,
   the piston           (207) has at least one ramp                     (214)       (preferably

   two      or more)       and      the     bearing      means    can     be    a transverse
   shaft adapted to cooperate at least                          temporarily with said
   at    least       one   ramp.        Thus,      when    the   piston       comprises       two
   ramps positioned symmetrically with respect to the center
 5 of the        shaft of the rotor, for one                     complete turn of the
   rotor, the piston can on two                          occasions be at          the    second
   position          and   first        position.        The   piston        can  comprise       a
   passage          (219)     permitting            a   rapid    transition          from     the
   second position to the                      first position, and said passage
10 can       extend      below        the       first     position.          This   makes       it
   possible:
             -    to obtain two positions of the piston (first and
                  third        positions)             without       actuation          of     the
                  actuator,
15           -    to make assembly easier,
             -    to prevent the rotor                  (or the motor) from turning
                  when the piston is                  in the third position, which
                  makes impossible any change of position when the
                  cassette is not loaded in the apparatus.
20
   According to            one embodiment, the                ramp is        followed by at
   least one passage, preferably after a threshold.
   In one        embodiment, said actuator                    additionally comprises
25 at     least       one   compression             means    (205)      exerting       a   force
   against the piston                 (207).       The bearing means and the ramp
   cooperate          in   order       to move        the   piston      on    the   same     axis
   as the force exerted by the compression means, but in an
   opposite direction.
30
   In one embodiment,                  said compression means                 tends to push
   the piston back                (with respect to the               actuator)        (that is
   to    say     in    the    direction           (220)   of   the    distal      end    of the
   piston        (217))    while the bearing means and the ramp compel
35 the piston to move toward the                          actuator.        In this     case, A
   > B.      In another embodiment, said compression means tends
   to move the piston toward the actuator while the bearing
   means        and    the   ramp       compel       the   piston     to move       away     from
   the actuator. In this case, A < B.

                                                  -   48
   In  one      embodiment,            the     aim of        the    actuator          is     to     drive
   an element of an apparatus such as that described in the
   present        document.         This       can be,         for    example,           a   valve     of
 5 the cassette. The rest of the description describes this
   embodiment,            but       it       goes         without         saying           that       the
   disclosure is           not limited to this embodiment.
   Thus, said piston (207) comprises at least two positions:
10
   -      a     first     position,             in     which     the      stub      (211)        of   the
          piston          (207)           is      coupled         to      the       valve           (212)
           (illustration               in    Figure        15)    of    a   cassette            such    as
          that         described             above.         The       piston           (207),         not
15        constrained             by      the     bearing       means        (209),        maintains
          the       valve     (212)         in     a    closed      position          against         the
          seat of the valve                    (213).      Here, d2 is equal to A.
   -      a    second      position,             in     which     the     stub      (211)        of   the
          piston         (207)        is     coupled        to     the     valve         (212) .      The
20        piston         (207)       is     constrained            by     the    bearing            means
           (209),        moving           the       piston/stub            assembly             in    the
          direction            (221)         of      the     motor         (201).         When       said
          bearing means                (209)       arrives       at    the threshold                (215)
          situated         at the summit of the ramp,                         the piston            (207)
25        is      in the second position and the valve                                  (212) is        in
          the opened position. Here, d2 is equal to B.
   In  one      embodiment,             the piston          has     a   third       position,           in
   which     the      stub     (211)         of     the    piston       (207)       is      decoupled
   from the valve            (212).        A    compression means                (205) exerts a
30 force      against       the      piston,           moving       said      piston         toward       a
   third position farther from the motor than the first and
   second positions. This can be the same compression means
   as described above or a separate compression means.                                              Here,
   d2  is     equal      to    C.      In    this       embodiment,            C  >    A    >    B.   The
35 benefit          of   this        third          position          is     to      guarantee            a
   sufficient occlusion pressure when the piston is coupled
   to the valve in the first position. In other words, when

                                                    -   49
   the piston is              coupled to the valve, the piston exerts                                   a
   force      against         the       valve      in     order     to   ensure       the    closure
   of the valve when the piston is                               in the first position.
   In one embodiment, the actuator comprises an element for
 5 fixing       to     its      support,           comprising          a   compression            means
   exerting        a    force         in    the     direction        of    the    distal       end    of
   the      piston        and      having         the      same    function         as   described
   above.
   Said compression means                        (205) can be a spring, an elastic
10 blade,      an     elastic            material         or   a   shape-memory          material.
   Said compression means                        (205) can exert a force of 0 to 6
   N,    preferably of between 5 and 6 N.
   The      actuator           (200)        is     designed         with     the      aim     of     not
   consuming            energy            while          a     stationary           position          is
15 maintained. The bearing means                              (209) is designed to slide
   or roll       on the          ramp       in    order       to  reach      a position.           When
   the      bearing          means         (209)        stops      on    a    threshold,           said
   threshold is designed in such a way that the assembly is
   at equilibrium. The threshold                              (215) at the summit of the
20 ramp       (214)        is     directly            followed        by    a    passage          (219)
   allowing          the       piston           to     pass      rapidly       from       a    second
   position        to      a   first        position          while     consuming        a minimum
   amount of energy. Said passage makes it possible to pass
   from      one   position              to    the     other     with     a   small      amount       of
25 energy.        In       other         words,         the     energy      consumed          by     the
   actuator         for       passing           from       the    first      position         to     the
   second      position            is     greater         than    the    energy       consumed        by
   the actuator for passing from the second position to the
   first position. The passage                             (219) can be a ramp having a
30 high slope and/or oppositely directed                                 to the slope of the
   ramp. Thus, the bearing means travels a shorter distance
   to pass       from        the       second       position        to   the    first       position
   than the other way round.
   Optionally,           the piston (207)                  comprises several thresholds
35 in order to have intermediate rest positions.

                                                    -   50
   In one embodiment, the motor                              comprises a torque reducer
   between the motor and the rotor of the interposed means.
   Said       torque         reducer        can be        designed          in    such     a   way      that
   the motor             can     turn     the     rotor       but     the      rotor      cannot        turn
 5 the motor. In other words, the torque reducer, by virtue
   of its design, can prevent or limit or brake any movement
   of the rotor that                   is not       due to the motor.
   In one embodiment, the torque reducer can be designed in
   such       a   way      that     the      actuator          can maintain             any     position
10 when the motor is                  stationary            (powered or not).                 Thus, the
   actuator can               comprise a limited number of thresholds                                       as
   described             above,       but       an    unlimited           number        of    positions
   that       can      be maintained              by virtue           of the         torque       reducer
   without           the      actuator          being       fed     with        current.         Such       an
15 actuator can be adapted to cooperate with a proportional
   valve        of     a   fluid      distribution              cassette.            Thus,     by     means
   of     this       design,        the      actuator          can     permit         the    flow      of      a
   fluid       proportionally               to the requirement of the treatment.
   In    one embodiment,                the piston           (207)      does not comprise any
20 threshold             but     only     positions           that      can      be    maintained           by
   virtue         of      the     torque        reducer         as    described           above.        This
   piston         thus       comprises           at   least        one    ramp       and    optionally
   one      passage.           The    torque        reducer         allows         the    actuator          to
   maintain            a    given       position           permitting             the     0%     to     100%
25 opening of a valve                    (for example a proportional valve).
   In      one     embodiment,              the     piston         comprises           at    least        one
   lower ramp and upper ramp, said ramps being adapted such
   that       at     least       one    bearing         means        (209)       can move         between
   said ramps.              Said ramps can               at least          in part be parallel
30 with respect to each other.
   In      a    preferred           embodiment,              at     least        one     actuator           is
   arranged             in      an    actuation             system         which         comprises             a
   controller              and     at     least       one      power       supply        means.         Said
   system         is     designed          to move         at    least        one     piston        from       a
35 second position to a first position and vice versa while
   consuming             a   small       amount        of    energy.          Said      power       supply

                                               -   51
   means   can     be     an external            power       supply       and/or      an    energy
   storage means.             Said energy           storage means can be                  used by
   the system when said external power                               supply is        no    longer
   operative       or      is     inadequate.           Thus,       in    the     event      of   an
 5 outage, the valve will move from the                                open to the closed
   state by virtue of the use of said energy storage means,
   which can be          a supercapacitor, or a battery.
   According       to     an embodiment              disclosed          by    Figure      14,    the
10 actuator      (200) can be composed of:
      e  a motor         (201),
      "  a rigid envelope                  (202) inside which are arranged:

         -     a piston          (207)     in   which is        fixed an element              (206)

20       -     an    element           (210)     fixed      to    the     distal      end     (217)

   Control system, and control of an actuator

   In an embodiment disclosed by Figures 32,                                         32'      and     33,   a
   control            system          (800)       comprises              a     linear           actuator
   comprising            a   movable        part       (801)        and      a   stationary            part
    (804)       and     also       control        elements            (802,       803,       805) .      The
10 control         elements          are    adapted         to     establish           the      position
   of the movable part                    (801) with respect to the stationary
   part      (804) and to control the linear actuator.
   Figure 32           shows the actuator in a position A,                                  and Figure
15 32'      shows       the      actuator          in     a   position           B.     The       control
   element           (805)        controls          the      actuator,              of      which        the
   stationary           part       (804)     can      comprise         the drive means                  (for
   example         a motor) .         The movable part                  (801)      can be adapted
   to     cooperate           with,        for      example,           a    valve        of      a    fluid
20 distribution                system.           Thus,        the         position             A      could
   correspond            to     the       closed       position            of     the       controlled
   valve, and the position B could correspond to the opened
   position          of     said valve.           However,          the      disclosure            is    not
   limited to controlling                    the opening and closing of a valve
25 of     a     fluid        distribution              system,           and      the       number        of
   positions can be                 limited or unlimited.
   The      elements          1     (802)      and      2    (803)         of    the      sensor         are
   designed            to     cooperate            and       determine             at       least        one
30 position.            This       can     entail         a    capacitive             or      inductive
   displacement              sensor         (LVDT,         etc.),          an     electromagnetic
   sensor        (Hall effect sensor),                    ultrasonic sensor,                    infrared
   sensor,          optical         sensor,         laser-type             sensor,         mechanical
   sensor or microwave sensor                          (list not exhaustive).                       In our
35 example,           and    to     aid    understanding,                we     will      use      a   Hall
   effect sensor.               Thus, the element                  1    (802)      is    a permanent
   magnet        (in   this     case it       is    not connected to the processor)
    (805),       and the         element        2    (803)      is     a   Hall      effect         sensor
   connected to the processor. The permanent magnet creates

                                                  -   54
   an     electromagnetic                  field,        of    which         the       sensor           (803)
   measures          the     strength.          In    particular,              the      sensor          (803)
   makes it         possible to detect the variation                               of the magnetic
   field       induced          by     the     permanent           magnet          (802)        when       the
 5 latter moves.
   Preferably, the permanent magnet                                 (802)       is rigidly fixed
   in a definitive manner to                         the movable part                    (801) of the
   actuator,           and      the      sensor       (803)       is     rigidly           fixed        in      a
10 definitive            manner         to    the    stationary             part        (804)       of     the
   actuator          (or the other way round).                       Thus, when the movable
   part      moves,        the     permanent          magnet         (802)       moves         toward         or
   away       from        the      sensor         (803),        which          thus        measures             a
   variation          in     the      strength        of    the      magnetic           field       of     the
15 permanent           magnet           (802).      Ideally,            the       magnet         and       the
   sensor are aligned.
   The measurement data of the                           sensor       (802) are transmitted
   to      the      processor             in    order        to       process            the       signal.
20 Normally,          all      the      control       systems         have       to be         graded         in
   order to determine in advance the strength corresponding
   to    each      position.            In    other      words,        the      sensor         generally
   detects predetermined threshold values                                       corresponding to
   respective positions                    determined in             advance.          However,          this
25 grading work              (for example            calibration to be                     carried out
   on all the actuators)                      is lengthy and laborious. To avoid
   this       grading         work,        there      is       disclosed             the       use      of      a
   processor that              processes the signal in                       order to determine
   at     least       one       position          of     the      actuator.             Thus,        it       is
30 possible to avoid performing a calibration.
   The     upper      graph        in     Figure      33    reveals          that       the      absolute
   value        (strength            of     the     electromagnetic                  field         of      the
   magnet measured by the sensor)                            can be very different                       from
35 one actuator to                another. This              is because             the      sensors of
   the actuators              1 and 2 do not               show the           same strength                (in
   absolute          value)         although         their        position           is      identical.
   Thus,       it     would        be      difficult          and      unreliable,               or      even

                                                -   55
   impossible, to determine the position of these actuators
   as a function of a single threshold value.
   The      control       system        (800)       comprises            a     processor          (805)
 5 which      uses    a     mathematical             model       taking         account       of     the
   derivative          of     the        absolute           value.           In      the     present
   document,      the absolute value is                     the value measured by the
   sensor       (803)       and     corresponds             to     the       strength         of     the
   magnetic field. The curve of the absolute value is shown
10 by    the   upper       graph     in    Figure         33.     The      derivative          of    the
   absolute value is               the    director coefficient                       of the      curve
   plotted       by     the     absolute            value.         In     other        words,        the
   derivative       makes        it    possible           to    establish           the    slope       of
   the variation           of the magnetic field                    when the magnet moves
15 with respect to             the sensor.             This derivative                is   shown by
   the     curve   in      the middle           graph       of Figure            33.    Thus,      this
   derivative makes             it    possible to              establish the              direction
   of displacement of the movable part                              (801) of the actuator
   with respect to its stationary part                                (804).

   The     control       system       thus       comprises           a    processor          using       a
   mathematical           model that          takes        account         of the       derivative
   of the      signal. By virtue                  of this mathematical                    model,        it
   is     possible       to    know       when       the      actuator           has     reached         a
25 position       or     a   threshold            of    the     kind        described         in     the
   section disclosing the linear actuator. Indeed, when the
   actuator        moves        its       movable           part         (801),         the      first
   derivative         is     greater         or      less       than        0,    but     when       the
   actuator does not move its movable part                                     (801),     its first
30 derivative is            substantially equal to                      0.      In our example,
   and by preference, when the magnet                               (802) moves away from
   the sensor         (803),       the    first        derivative            is    negative        and,
   inversely,         when       the      magnet          moves         closer,         the      first
   derivative is positive.

   The system can additionally                       comprise a mathematical model
   for determining when the movable part moves and when                                                 it
   remains      immobile.           This     second         mathematical              model      takes
   account of the            second derivative of                      the absolute value.

                                                -    56
   By virtue of this                 second mathematical model,                              the     system
   knows when the movable part                        changes its              behavior           (movable
   or immobile).
 5 In       one      embodiment,          the      control             system           comprises            an
   actuator           comprising        at   least           one     ramp      and      at     least       one
   threshold             (for    example       a     linear           actuator           of      the     kind
   described             in    the    present          document),               and       a    processor
   adapted to control the actuator and to process the signal
10 according to at least one mathematical model.
   A     first       mathematical          model         takes        account           of     the     first
   derivative of the absolute value measured by the                                                  sensor
    (803) .        The     processor       can        use      this        first         mathematical
15 model          in     order     to    establish             in      which          direction            the
   movable          part      (801)    moves.        When        the    first          derivative            is
   close         to   0,    the   control       system knows                  that       the      actuator
   has reached a threshold.
20 A    second mathematical model                        takes account of the                        second
   derivative of the absolute value measured by the                                                  sensor
    (803) .        The     processor       can       use       the      second           mathematical
   model         in order to establish when a threshold                                      is reached
   and/or when the movable part                             is    immobile or moving. The
25 lower graph of Figure 33                     shows the              signal resulting from
   the second mathematical model. When the                                         signal         is   equal
   to       the      value       f,    this       signifies               that         the        actuator
   maintains a position                 or is     on a threshold.                   When the signal
   is      equal      to    the   value     d,    it       signifies            that       the     movable
30 part         (801)     is    moving.      Thus,           by    virtue          of     this       second
   mathematical               model,      the      system             has       no      need        of     the
   absolute            value.       When     the         control          system            powers         the
   actuator           in    order     to   move        its      movable          part        (801),        the
   second mathematical model makes it possible to establish
35 when the actuator has reached a position.                                        In    other words,
   when        the    actuator       continues             its     actuation             (for      example
   it     causes the bearing means                    (209)       to turn) but the movable
   part        no    longer      moves,     the       processor,               by     virtue         of    the
   first        and/or second derivative,                      is    able to establish                   that

                                               -    57
   the bearing means has reached a threshold.                                    Thus,    when the
   processor orders a change of position of the actuator, a
   mathematical model allows the processor to know when the
   threshold is reached and it thus                             orders the           actuator to
 5 stop.
   Thus,        said      control       system         is   adapted        to     determine        at
   least        one position reached by the movable part                                   (801) of
   the actuator independently of the characteristics of the
10 sensor used.            Said control system is                     adapted to          stop the
   actuator at at least one position reached by the movable
   part         (801)      of      the      actuator            independently               of    the
   characteristics of the sensor used.
15 In     one       embodiment,          the       control          system        comprises        an
   actuator comprising at least two separate positions. The
   actuator           comprises        at    least        one      threshold          defining        a
   position,           and    at   least      one       ramp     making       it    possible       to
   change         position.         The     actuator           is     driven        by     a    motor
20 designed to            turn preferably in a single direction, such
   that      it    goes     from     one    position          to     another       sequentially
   and in        a pre-defined order. Preferably, the                                actuator      is
   adapted to return to                  its starting position by executing
   at      least        one     partial        revolution.              In     addition,          the
25 processor           comprises         a    mathematical               model       that       takes
   account         of    the    second     derivative            of    the     absolute         value
   measured           by   said      sensor.          Said      processor           comprises         a
   memory which contains the sequence of the positions,                                          such
   that       said       system       does       not      need        to   know        the      first
30 derivative           of    the    absolute          value       in   order       to    know    the
   position          of   the    actuator.          It    suffices        for      the    actuator
   to execute one revolution in                         order to know with precision
   its      position,          for    example         during        the    start-up          of   the
   system.

   In    one      embodiment,         the    treatment           system       can     comprise        a
   drive device            used for        the peristaltic pumps. Said drive

   disclosure,          presented          in     Figures        22   and      23,     is     a   drive
   device        (300)      which        comprises           a    floating           shaft        (301)
   driven by a drive means                     (303)       fixed to a rotor                 (310) of
10 an electric motor                (not shown).            Said floating shaft                   (301)
   comprises a rigid assembly of base                               (311) and cover               (302)
   forming a cavity inside which said drive means                                           (303) is
   at least partially circumscribed. Said drive means                                             (303)
   comprises         a   rigid        body      designed          in    such       a    way      as  to
15 cooperate         with       the      walls        (309,      309')        of     said       cavity
    (313),      so as    to permit a limited freedom of the floating
   shaft       (301) with respect to the axis of said rotor                                      (310).
   A screw       (307) can permit fixing of the drive means                                       (303)
   to said rotor            (310).
20
   The     cavity       comprises          at     least      one     cooperation              element
    (312),      which allows said drive means                          (303) to transmit a
   rotation movement to said floating shaft.
25 Preferably, said cooperation element                                (312) is an opening
   limited       by    two     hard elements               (308)     and     through          which     a
   shaft       (306) is housed perpendicularly. The space between
   the    two     hard     elements          (308)      is    reasonably           greater         than
   the diameter of the shaft                        (306).

   The     hard     elements          (308)      and/or        the    shaft        (306)        can  be
   made from hard metals such as cobalt, tungsten, vanadium,

35 molybdenum,           strontium,           rubidium           or    palladium.              In   one
   embodiment,           the       hard      elements           (308)        have       a     greater
   hardness        than     the      shaft       (306) .      The    hard elements                (308)
   and/or the shaft                (306) can          be treated to increase                      their

   hardness,       for example with zirconium oxide or one of its
   alloys.
   In   one     embodiment,         the     body       (304)      of    said     drive       means
 5  (303) can be of a spherical shape that is perfectly round
   or partially flattened. In another embodiment, said body
    (304) forms a roller               comprising three faces.                     Two of the
   three        faces       lie        opposite             each       other         and         are
   interconnected          by way of the third                 face,     which is        curved.
10 On   the plane        X-Z,    said roller              forms     a   circle       formed        by
   said curved face. The connection between at least one of
   the    two    faces    lying      opposite          each      other      and    the     curved
   face     can   be    rounded       on    the     plane       X-Y.      The    faces       lying
   opposite       each     other      can      be    substantially             plane       and/or
15 substantially parallel with respect to each other.
   In    one     embodiment,          the      cavity         (313)      comprises           three
   smooth       walls     (309,      309').        Preferably,             the    upper        wall
    (309)    and/or the       lower       wall       (309')      of said        cavity        (313)
20 are of at least partially conical shape. The surfaces of
   the upper wall          (309) and of the lower wall                         (309') can be
   plane or curved.
   In   one     embodiment,         on    the      plane      X-Y,      the     cone      of     the
25 smooth      wall     (309)    is     defined         according          to   an     angle       of
   between 0 and 90',             preferably of between 5 and 30'.                               The
   cone      of   the     opposite          smooth         wall     (309')        is     defined
   according to an angle of between -0 and -90',                                   preferably
   of   between      -5    and   -30      .   The     angles       of     the    two     partial
30 cones can be equal or different.
   The    smooth     walls      (309,       309')        are    adapted        to    cooperate
   with     the   ends    of   the     body       (304)      such     that     the     floating
   shaft      (301)    can   move       on    at    least      three       axes     X,    Y or       Z
35 and/or      can   undergo       pitching          movements.           For    example,          on
   the     axis    Y,    the    floating           shaft         (301)      can     undergo          a
   pitching movement of +/-                  100,      preferably of +/-                5'.

   In     one    embodiment,            the     drive       means         (303)        comprises          a
   longitudinal             shaft      (305)      and     the       floating           shaft        (301)
   comprises a second cavity                     (313'),        which extends along the
   floating shaft. The longitudinal                             shaft       (305) fits inside
 5 the      second        cavity         (313')        in     order         to      restrict          the
   pitching movements of the floating shaft                                      (301).
   Generally speaking,                and preferably,                the dimensions of the
   elements         forming        the     drive       means          (303,       306,       305)     are
   reasonably smaller than the elements                                  forming the              inside
10 of the floating shaft                   (301, 302,           313,      312).
   In    one     embodiment,           the     drive       system          (300)       comprises          a
   drive shaft which is formed in one piece, extends on the
   axis Y and is adapted to drive at least one roller                                               (320)
15 of a peristaltic pump system.                            said roller is adapted to
   crush      a   flexible         tube      (not      shown)         against          a    wall     (not
   shown).       According to Figures                   22     and 23,          the     drive shaft
   is     represented          by    the      floating          shaft          (301) .       In     other
   words,       the drive         shaft      can     be the       floating            shaft       and/or
20 merged        with     a   part       of   the      drive        system.          According         to
   Figures       22 and 23,         the drive shaft can be of cylindrical
   shape and comprise a beveled free end (here the term free
   end      is    the       opposite         of     the       opposite            end       connected
   directly        or indirectly            to the motor) . The cylinder of the
25 drive shaft           forms a circle on a plane X-Z.
   In    one     embodiment,            said     drive        shaft        is     formed         in   one
   piece      composed of at              least two different cylinders                              that
   are     defined       by   the      same     axis      (in     other        words        center     of
30 the cylinder) but have different diameters. Thus, on the
   plane X-Z, the drive shaft can form at least two circles
   that      are parallel           but     of    different            sizes.         In    addition,
   the drive shaft can comprise three cylinders of which one
   alone      is    of    a  different          diameter.            The      cylinder          defined
35 by the smallest diameter can be arranged between the two
   cylinders         of     equal      diameter.         Said        cylinders           of     greater
   diameter can have surfaces that are treated in such a way
   as    to    improve       the     cooperation             with       the      rollers         of   the
   peristaltic pump.

                                                     -   61
   This construction of the drive shaft with three cylinders
   is particularly suitable and of advantage for the use of
   an    H-shaped          roller,          such       as    the     roller          (320)     of Figure
 5 23.     The roller             is    arranged in a peristaltic                           pump system
   and will crush a flexible tube.                                 The function of crushing
   is    preferably effected                   by a rigid            part      (322)      of the roller
    (320).      Said roller                (320) is         a cylinder             forming a        circle
   on the plane X-Z and comprises a shaft                                      (321)     at the center
10 of this cylinder that extends on the axis Y, a rigid part
    (322),       and      at      least       one      flexible           part        (323)     which      is
   deformable.             The       flexible          part       is     adapted          to   cooperate
   with the drive shaft.
15 Preferably,             the cylinders of greater                           diameter come              into
   contact with the flexible parts                                (323) of the roller                  (320)
   and     drive       the      roller         (320) .       When      the      drive       shaft     is   in
   contact        with       at      least      one      flexible           part,       said    flexible
   part     (323) can deform in order to improve the cooperation
20 between these two elements and/or to adjust the tolerance
   errors of each of these elements. Preferably, the roller
   comprises            a    rigid         part        (322)        at     its      center       and      two
   flexible parts                 (323) at the ends                  on the axis Y.
25 A   fluid distribution                     system comprising a floating shaft
    (301),      a drive shaft with three cylinders and/or a roller
   with       rigid        and        flexible           parts        makes         it     possible        to
   substantially improve the cooperation between roller and
   drive       shaft       and      to     correct         the     tolerance            errors     of     the
30 various elements of the system.
   Means for damping the pressure peaks:
   In     one     embodiment,               the      treatment            system          comprises        at
35 least one means for damping the pressure peaks.
   Figure        24     shows         the     pressure          signal         measured         near      the
   inlet      of     a    peristaltic              pump.      On     the      first       curve      (401),
   it      is     possible             to      observe          the       oscillation             of      the

                                          -   62
   pressure,         while    the    second      curve      (402)    represents           the
   mean value of this pressure. The aim of the damper is to
   reduce       the     amplitude     of   the    oscillations           of   the     first
   curve      (401).
 5
   Such a damping means can be installed in one or more flow
   paths       of     a   distribution         system       as    described          above.
   Preferably,           this     damping       means       is    integrated          in      a
   cassette.
10
   Whether         in    peritoneal       dialysis          or    continuous          renal
   replacement           therapy,     each      treatment         has    one      or    more
   possible configurations.               The phenomenon of pressure peaks
   can be       amplified or attenuated by various elements                             that
15 vary      according        to    said      configurations.             It     will       be
   recalled       that    one of the objects of the disclosed systems
   is     to    permit       simple     use     of    the      system.       Therefore,
   reproducibility             is   an    important          element,        since        the
   operator         (generally      the    nurse)      must     be   able     to     ensure
20 correct       operation       of the     system without           having        to   take
   into       account       the    characteristics              of    the      different
   elements.
   The distribution system as disclosed in this document is
25 a cassette         through which fluids          flow in       three flow paths.
   Preferably,           they    are   propelled         by    peristaltic           pumps.
   Reproducibility,             precision         and      patient       comfort          are
   important elements.             Thus,     at least        one damping means              is
   preferably           integrated       in      said      cassette.         To      be     as
30 effective as possible, said damping means must be placed
   as close as possible to the pumping system.
   In    an    embodiment       depicted       schematically          in    Figure        25,
   the flow path comprises walls                  (404)     delimiting said path.
35 These      walls      can  be   the   rigid      walls      of   the    cassette.         A
   section of the flow path is               covered by a flexible              membrane
    (403),     which then replaces said wall                   (404).     By virtue of
   the      elasticity        of   said     flexible         membrane       (403),        the
   pressure peaks are substantially attenuated, absorbed by

                                      - 63
   the deformation of the membrane (403).               The absorption of
   these     peaks       depends       on     the    size     and      elastic
   characteristics of the membrane.
 5 In another embodiment, depicted schematically in Figure
   26,  the   flow     path   likewise     comprises     walls      delimiting
   said path, but a section is replaced by a cavity filled
   with a compressible fluid such as air. This air may have
   been   trapped      (about    1   ml)   during    the   priming      of the
10 system. Thus, the volume of the air is                  compressed to a
   greater   or    lesser   extent during         the pumping,       absorbing
   the  energy      of  the   pressure      peaks.    This   embodiment      is
   particularly      effective      since    it   requires   little     energy
   for  its   operation,      and   said fluid very rapidly            absorbs
15 the pressure peaks. Preferably, the cavity or the inlet
   of the cavity is       designed to avoid the compressible fluid
   completely      escaping.       In   other     words,   the      cavity   is
   designed     to    ensure    that     the    flowing   fluid      does  not
   replace the compressible fluid.
20
   Preferably, said damping means is placed upstream of the
   pumping mechanism.

   10. The     actuator         of   any     one    of     claims      1   to   9,     wherein
       the      threshold         is    a    substantially             planar        platform
       along an axis perpendicular to the main axis of the
30     rotor.
   11. The actuator             of any one of claims                  1 to    10,      wherein
       said      passage        extends        from      the     summit      of      the    ramp
       and/or       in     which      the     passage         is   juxtaposed           to    the
35     threshold.
   12. The actuator             of any one of claims                  1 to    11,      wherein
       the passage is             arranged in          the same axis as the axis
       of linear movement of the piston.
