   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5                    The      present            disclosure            relates           to      a    method
   and        an       arrangement                 for        controlling               a      dewatering
   process           in     a    gravitational                   sedimentation                device.           In
   particular,                 the          present               disclosure               relates             to
   multivariable control of a gravitational sedimentation
10 process.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
                      Separation                 devices,              such       as         thickeners,
   clarifiers              and concentrators,                      are     used       for      separating
15 solids         from        suspensions                 (typically           containing              solids
   suspended             in     a     liquid)            and      are     often         found         in     the
   mining,           mineral            processing,                food       processing,                sugar
   refining, water treatment,                                sewage treatment, and other
   such       industries.                  These         devices        typically             comprise             a
20 tank       in    which         solids          are       deposited          from       a    suspension
   or      solution           and      settle          toward        the      bottom         as     pulp        or
   sludge         to     be     drawn         off       from below            and      recovered.                 A
   dilute         liquor         of     lower          relative         density           is     displaced
   toward          the        top       of       the        tank,       for      removal             via        an
25 overflow            launder.              The      suspension            to    be      thickened             is
   initially             fed      through            a     feed      pipe,       conduit            or     line
   into a feedwell disposed within the main tank.                                                      A rake
   assembly           is     conventionally                   mounted        for      rotation           about
   a    central          drive        shaft        and       typically          has      at     least        two
30 rake       arms       having          scraper            blades       to     move        the      settled
   material           inwardly            for      collection            through          an     underflow
   outlet.
                      In      its       application                to     mineral            processing,
   separation              and extraction,                    ground       ore     is     suspended             as
35 pulp       in     a    suitable            liquid          medium        such       as    water         at      a
   consistency                which          permits            flow,        and       settlement               in
   quiescent             conditions.                  The       pulp     is     settled           from       the

                                                  2
   suspension by a combination of gravity with or without
   chemical           or     mechanical           processes.               One      or      more
   separation           devices       may be      part      of   a   process        chain     so
   that the output of one device is provided as input                                        for
 5 another.
                    There       are      various       problems         preventing           the
   operators          from      running        the    separation          devices        in   an
   efficient          manner.        Long      process       response          times,       long
   process delays and variation in the incoming mass                                        flow
10 make       process         control         challenging.           Many       times       this
   leads to variation in the quality of the underflow, in
   the     quality        of    the     overflow        or   both.      This,       in    turn,
   may      affect       the     performance           of   subsequent            processes,
   i.e.        filtering,          tailings         handling,           and       water      re
15 circulation             systems.          Currently,           controls          for      the
   separation           devices       such     as   thickeners         are      implemented
   as     single       loop     controllers          (e.g.      PID    controllers)           in
   distributed             control          systems        (DCS)      or     programmable
   logic controller               (PLC) systems. Slow response dynamics
20 and      cross       actions       between       the     controlled            parameters
   can     make      the    tuning       of    the   PI-loops        very       challenging
   and require            compromises          between       system robustness               and
   desired          speed      of     response.          In     practical          operating
   situations,            this       may      result       in    need       for      repeated
25 operator          intervention            and    the      controller           being      run
   either          totally        or      partially          in     manual         mode.      In
   addition to reduced quality and increased variation in
   process          outputs,         also       the     expenditure             of     process
   chemicals may be increased.

                    In one aspect, an arrangement for controlling
   a     dewatering            process         is    disclosed.            A      dewatering

                                            3
   gravitational        sedimentation           device     comprising a tank,
   a lip for removing overflow from the tank and at least
   one   underflow        line     for    removing        underflow        from   the
   tank;    a   first      and    a   second        sensor    for   measuring        a
 5 first    and    a   second      operating          parameter     representing
   the   material       consistency         of      the   underflow        from   the
   gravitational         sedimentation          device      and the       inventory
   level     of     the      gravitational            sedimentation          device,
   respectively;           a     controller            for     monitoring         and
10 adjusting      operating         parameters         of   the   gravitational
   sedimentation           device;        and       at    least      one      memory
   comprising       computer       program         code.    The   at    least     one
   memory     and    the     computer      program        code   configured        to
   cause the controller to:               receive a first set of values
15 representing the first operating parameter                           input from
   the   first     sensor       and    a   second       input    set    of    values
   representing        the     second     operating        parameter       from the
   second     sensor;       then    use    at      least    the   first       set  of
   values     received       from    the    first       sensor   input       set  and
20 the   second      set     of   values       received       from    the      second
   sensor input set as input values                      for the a predictive
   multivariable         model         for     predicting          an     operating
   state    of   the    gravitational           sedimentation        device.      The
   operating state is at least partially dependent on the
25 operating       parameters.          The      predictive       multivariable
   model     may     be    uploaded        to      the    memory      before      the
   dewatering       process,        or   may      be    generated      during     the
   process.      The    at     least     one      memory     and   the      computer
   program      code      are    further        configured       to     cause     the
30 controller         to      determine,            using      the      predictive
   multivariable model, at least one predicted output for
   an     operating           parameter            of     the     gravitational
   sedimentation        device      for at least one future point                  in
   time;    obtain      a   set    of    one    or     more   reference       values

   sedimentation         device;         perform        a  comparison        between
   the   at    least     one    predicted         output     and   at    least    one

                                                 4
   reference        value    from the          set     of one     or more reference
   values;       and determine, based at least partially on the
   comparison,         at   least        one     set    of    one    or    more       control
   values         for    at    least       one       control      parameter            of  the
 5 gravitational          sedimentation              device.      The      at    least     one
   control parameter may at least partially determine the
   operating          state     of     the      gravitational             sedimentation
   device.        The    at    least        one      memory      and      the       computer
   program        code     are      further          configured          to     cause      the
10 controller         to  adjust,         using       the    at   least        one     set   of
   control       values,     at    least       one     control      parameter          of the
   gravitational          sedimentation              device.      A     set    of     control
   values may comprise a time series or point values, and
   it may be continually updated.
15                In       one           embodiment,              the           predictive
   multivariable           model         comprises           a   model          predictive
   control       (MPC) algorithm.

   and       the     computer         program           code     are        additionally
20 configured to cause the controller to determine a cost
   function         using     as     an       input      at     least       the       set    of
   reference         values     and      at    least      one    predicted            output;
   wherein       the    comparison          is    performed        to    determine         the
   value      of   the   cost     function,           and the      at    least       one   set
25 of     control      values       minimizes           the    value       of     the     cost
   function.
                  In   another       embodiment,            the    sets      of    measured
   values are time series values.
                  In    another       embodiment,           at   least        one      of  the
30 sets of measured values                   is    repeatedly updated and the
   at     least      one   set      of     control        values        is     updated       in
   response.
                  In     another          embodiment,           the       gravitational
   sedimentation          device         comprises         a   rake      for      directing
35 solid material towards the at least one underflow line
   by rotatory         movement        and the         arrangement          comprises        an

   disclosure          involves         using       a   predictive           multivariable
   model        which        may      in     turn       be      used        for     optimized
   determination               of     the       control           parameters           of     the
   dewatering            process.          In      comparison             to    traditional
10 rules-based           expert        systems,        this       approach       allows       the
   definition            of     process         constraints              in   a     new      way.
   Depending         on    the      operating        parameters           and the process
   constraints             used,        the       approach            may     improve         the
   efficiency of the process in various ways.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
                     Reference           will      now be        made       in     detail        to   the
   embodiments               of     the     present         disclosure,                examples         of
   which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
10                   The        dewatering            process            according             to     the
   disclosure             may be        considered         as      a    separation           process,
   in     which        fluid        is     separated          from        solid        matter.        The
   material to be                  separated in the process may be                                called
   process          slurry.         Typically,          the     carrier          fluid       is    water
15 but      other       fluids        may also         be   used.        In     particular,           the
   carrier           fluid        may     comprise         a     mixture           of      water      and
   process chemicals                    including for example acid/alkaline,
   metals,             salts           and        others.            To       accelerate              the
   sedimentation                 process,         chemicals           such       as     flocculants
20 or coagulants may be used.
                     Several           zones       or   layers          of     material           having
   different            overall         densities         gradually            form within            the
   tank.          At      the      bottom       of    the     tank,        the       pulp      forms      a
   relatively dense zone of compacted pulp or solids that
25 are       frequently             in    the      form     of       networked            aggregates
    (i.e.       the      pulp       aggregates           are      in     continuous             contact
   with       one     another).             This      zone     is     called         a    "pulp bed"
   or     a   networked layer of                    pulp.         Above the pulp bed,                     a
   hindered           zone       tends       to     contain         solids        that       have     not
30 yet      fully        settled         or    "compacted".             The      time       scale     for
   the settling                process may take               from several minutes to
   several               hours.            Consequently,                   process              control
   mechanisms according to the embodiments below can take
   into         account           the       slow       dynamics            involved             in    the
35 process.
                     Although a gravitational sedimentation device
   is disclosed in the following examples by reference to

                                            13
   a  thickener,       it     should be        noted    that      the   principles
   according      to       the      disclosure         can      be     implemented
   regardless     of the         specific       type   of   the     gravitational
   sedimentation        device,        e.g.    by using      a thickener          or   a
 5 clarifier.       A      thickener         may     be,     for      example,         a
   conventional         thickener,           a    paste      thickener          or     a
   tailings     thickener.           The    details      of     the    device       may
   depend    on    the       particular         phase     of     the    separation
   process   as    the      device      may    be  used     at    various      points
10 along   a  line      of    separation         devices     in    a  multi-phase
   separation process.
              Figure            1      illustrates          a       gravitational
   sedimentation        device       1  (hereafter       "a   thickener")         in   a
   schematic     manner.           The     figures      are       not    drawn        to
15 proportion,        and       many      of     the    components          of      the
   thickener        are        omitted         for      clarity.          Schematic
   directions      for      slurry      flow,     overflow,        underflow        and
   chemical feed are depicted by arrows.
              In    an embodiment            of   figure     1,    a thickener         1
20 comprises a tank 10             for containing the material to be
   separated.     In     the     figure,     the    dashed      line    represents
   the   upper    level        of    the    pulp    bed.     The     tank     may     be
   essentially cylindrical and it may additionally have a
   tapered bottom for guiding the solid material towards
25 the   center.      The      diameter       of   the    tank     may     be    5-100
   meters. The height of the tank may be 1-20 meters.
              Underflow of the thickener corresponds to the
   separated      solid,          i.e.     pulp,      flowing        out     of     the
   thickener. The water-solids ratio of the underflow may
30 vary depending on various factors such as the phase or
   efficiency of the separation process. The tank may be
   connected     to       one     or    more     underflow         lines      11     for
   removing    solid material             from the      tank.      The    receiving
   ends   of  the      underflow         lines     may    be    located       at    the
35 bottom of the          tank.     They    may additionally            be   located
   essentially at the center of the tank.

                                               14
                 Overflow        of     the   thickener            corresponds           to    the
   separated        fluid        flowing        out         of    the      thickener.            In
   addition,      the      water-solids            ratio        of    the    overflow          may
   vary depending on various factors                            such as the phase or
 5 efficiency of          the     separation process. The tank may be
   connected       to     an    overflow         lip        12    for     removing         fluid
   from the      tank.       The     overflow          lip     may    comprise         the     rim
   of    the   tank.      Additionally,             it      may    comprise         a    set     of
   teeth     spaced       from     each      other         around       the     rim     of     the
10 tank.     The    overflow         may     be     removed          from     the      tank      by
   allowing it to            flow across the overflow lip.                           The     tank
   may    also   be     connected         to   a    launder         13    for     collecting
   the overflow from the tank. The collected overflow may
   be    fed back      into     the      separation           process       at    a   suitable
15 phase.
                 The      thickener         may         additionally            comprise           a
   rake     14   for     guiding         the    solid         material         towards         the
   underflow       line       or     lines.       The        rake      may    comprise           at
   least      one     blade       rotating          around          a    vertical          shaft
20 located       in     the     middle        of        the     tank.       The       rake       is
   located, at least partially, inside the pulp bed.
                 The     thickener          may     also        comprise         a    chemical
   dispenser        15      for    dispensing              a    chemical         such       as     a
   coagulant or a flocculant                   into the tank. The thickener
25 may comprise a feedwell 16 where both the chemical and
   the     incoming        slurry        may     initially            be     directed          for
   mixing.
                 Figure            2        illustrates                 a         predictive
   multivariable           model        according            to    an    embodiment.             An
30 operating state of the thickener may be defined by its
   operating       parameters.             These        may      comprise         controlled
   parameters        21,     control        parameters            22    and     disturbance
   parameters 21 of the thickener. The control parameters
   of      the    thickener             may      be         directly          manipulated,
35 automatically            or     by      an     operator,             to     affect          the
   operating state of the thickener so that the values of
   the     controlled         parameters            may        change       in      response.

                                                   15
   Additionally,             parameters             which        cannot        directly              or
   indirectly           be     controlled           by     the     controller             of       the
   dewatering            process           are      considered            as       disturbance
   parameters.
 5                 A     predictive             multivariable               model          20        is
   constructed            and       used       for    predicting             the      operating
   state      of     the    thickener.            The    model      may      use      operating
   parameters of the thickener as input parameters. In an
   embodiment, the input parameters                             for the multivariable
10 predictive            model         may      include         measured            values           of
   controlled           parameters            21,    change       history          of     control
   variables             22,         measured          values           of         disturbance
   parameters           21.      The      predicted          control         variables             and
   controlled variables may also be used as input                                         for the
15 model. As          an   output,          the    model       produces        a    prediction
   of    the    operating           state      of   the     thickener         for      at     least
   one     future point            in time. Being a multivariable model,
   at     least       two    operating            parameters          are     required             for
   input.       These operating parameters may include at least
20 two     controlled         parameters.            The     actual       parametrization
   of    the    model,       which        determines          how    the     values        of      the
   input      parameters            determine         the      predicted         output,           may
   be     performed         using         process       tests,        simulations              or      a
   combination            of    them.        Consequently,            the     model         itself
25 may     be    defined        in     advance       and     stored       in     a   memory.           A
   predictive multivariable model may be used for process
   control        to provide            several effects            such as to             improve
   the     handling        of      slow      response        dynamics         or     the      cross
   actions             between              the        controlled                 parameters.
30 Additionally,             a     model-based            control        of     the      process
   allows          taking           into        account          various            types            of
   constraints,            including           min-max         constraints,             for        the
   operating            parameters              and       desired           prioritization
   between          the      operating             parameters,             including               the
35 control parameters.
                    The predictive multivariable model 30 may use
   measurement           values         of   the     operating         parameters             as     an

                                            16
   input. The measurement values may comprise time series
   values,     i.e.,       several        measurement           values       for   an
   operating     parameter        over     a period        of   time.     The model
   may also     be   configured         to provide         a predicted        output
 5 for   one   or    more    time       points       in    the    future.      In  an
   embodiment, an "horizon" or limits of the time series
   may be    determined       in    past     and     future,      and the     future
   prediction       may      be       shown        to     the      operator       The
   measurement      values      may be        repeatedly        updated     and the
10 predicted      output      may      be     updated       in     response.      The
   update frequency of the model and the predicted output
   may    be    different          from      that       of     the     measurement
   frequency.
               According       to an embodiment,              the model may be
15 a   dynamic      response         model.        It    may      comprise,       for
   example,    a step response model or an impulse response
   model.    The model may           also utilize          a model predictive
   control    (MPC) algorithm.
               In   the context          of the present           disclosure,      it
20 has  been    discovered         that     for efficient           multivariable
   control      of      the      dewatering           process         a    specific
   combination       of    operating         parameters        may     be   used   to
   create    a model      describing         the    operating        state    of the
   thickener.      The   model      may be        used by       a   controller     to
25 predict    the    future      operating          state     of   the    thickener
   and  to    determine       control         operations         that    guide    the
   process     towards       a      desired         state.       The    controlled
   parameters       may     represent            at     least      the     material
   consistency of the underflow of the thickener and the
30 inventory        level        of       the       thickener.          Additional
   controlled      parameters         may      be   used     including       one   or
   more of the following: the turbidity or solids content
   of the overflow of the thickener and a torque exerted
   on   a     rake      of    the       thickener.          Also       disturbance
35 parameters      such    as    the     mass     flow     into    the    thickener
   may  be    used.     As   a    control        parameter,         at   least    the
   underflow flow rate of the thickener is used. However,

                                                     17
   also     additional             control        parameters             such      as    a   chemical
   feed      rate       of     the     thickener          may      be     used.       It    has      been
   noted       that       the     minimum         set     of    two      controlled            and one
   control          parameter           including           the      material          consistency
 5 of the underflow, the inventory level of the thickener
   and     the       underflow           flow      rate       may      be    used        for      robust
   multivariable control of the thickener. Alternatively,
   a    combination               of    three        controlled             and      two       control
   parameters              including           additionally               the       turbidity            or
10 solids         content          of    the      overflow           and     a     chemical           feed
   rate      may      be     used      for     a   more        detailed          description             of
   the      operating             state       of     the       thickener.             In     general,
   using         more         than        one       controlled              parameter               in      a
   multivariable                 controller              may       allow         prioritization
15 between         the      controlled           parameters.             Accordingly,               using
   more       than       one      control         parameter             in    a    multivariable
   controller               may       allow         prioritization                  between            the
   control parameters.
                     Depending            on     the      measurement               configuration
20 suitable for any particular application, the operating
   parameters              introduced             above         may      be      determined              in
   practice in more than one way. Material consistency of
   the      underflow             may      be     determined,               for      example,            by
   measuring           the      solids       content          of    the     underflow            or    the
25 pumping          properties            of    the      underflow.            The     measurement
   can       be       performed.              The        former          measurement                maybe
   performed,             for     example,          by     measuring           the       density         of
   the      underflow,               and      the        latter,           for       example,            by
   measuring            the      viscosity           of     the       underflow.           When        the
30 material           consistency            of    the      underflow           is     included          in
   the     model,         the     controller            may     monitor         the      quality         of
   the     underflow             and/or       its       variation           in     time.        Due      to
   variations            in     the material             consistency,              the     underflow
   may     occasionally               become        too      dense,        resulting             in    the
35 underflow             lines        becoming           clogged.           By      reducing           the
   variation, the likelihood for clogging may be reduced.

                                            18
              The         inventory          level       of       the        thickener
   describes    the      size      of   the   pulp bed        in    the     tank.     The
   inventory    level       may be measured,             for     example,        as the
   level   or    height         of     the   pulp      bed     or     derived        from
 5 hydraulic    pressure           on   the   bottom      or     sidewall        of   the
   thickener.     When       the    inventory        level     of    the     thickener
   is  included      in    the model,         the     controller        may monitor
   the   state    of     the     pulp    bed    indicating          the     amount     of
   solid material inside the tank.
10            A      value          for     a      parameter           representing
   turbidity     or     solids        content     of    the     overflow        may    be
   measured    directly           from     the   overflow          fluid.       It    may
   alternatively         or    in    addition      be measured          indirectly,
   for  example      by measuring           the    fluid      in    the     tank.     The
15 measurements       may      also     comprise       optical       measurements,
   turbidity or        solids content measurement                    based e.g.        on
   water   transparency             (turbidity),        back       scattering         for
   example    by       IR-light,          ultra       sound,       microwave          and
   others.    When        the      turbidity        or    solids        content        is
20 included in the model, the controller may monitor the
   quality of the overflow fluid.
              A torque          exerted on the          rake may be measured
   at  any point        of    the    rake,     for example          at the       tip   of
   the blade.      Measurement           of torque       may be       derived        from
25 measuring hydraulic              pressure or        current,        depending       on
   the  design     of the         drive    system.      This measurement              may
   be performed in real time without pausing the process.
   When the torque exerted on the rake is included in the
   model,   the     controller           may    avoid      performing           control
30 operations     that      would       result    in    excess       forces      in   the
   rake.
              Mass         flow        into     the       thickener            may     be
   considered       as      a     disturbance         parameter,           since      any
   variances     in     the      consistency        of   the      slurry       may    not
35 necessarily be          controlled.        However,       in    the    event that
   at least    some control            over this parameter              is    possible
   also by the controller of the dewatering process, mass

                                          19
   flow    may     be     considered       as     one     of    the     controlled
   parameters.       The mass      flow may be          determined        as a dry
   mass     flow.      The     mass     flow       may,     for     example,       be
   determined by measuring the flow rate of the incoming
 5 slurry     into the thickener            using     a flow meter          and the
   density of the incoming slurry using a density meter.
   When the mass          flow into      the thickener           is   included     in
   the model, the controller may react to any changes in
   the   incoming        slurry    before      it    has     settled      into    the
10 bottom of the tank.
                For      a     thickener        having        more      than      one
   underflow        lines,       any     parameter           related        to    the
   underflow       may      be   determined,          for     example,        as   an
   average     of the      corresponding         parameter determined             for
15 the individual underflow lines.
                The    underflow        flow      rate    may     be    controlled
   using    flow    control      means     such     as   a pump      or   a valve.
   When   a pump      is    used,   the     underflow        flow    rate    may be
   included     in   the     model,    for    example,        as the     underflow
20 pump    speed.     By     using    the    underflow         flow    rate     as   a
   control parameter, the controller may speed up or slow
   down    the    removal       of  the     solids       from     the    thickener
   depending        on      the    state      of      the      thickener.         The
   controller      may also       optimize the way the              flow control
25 means are used,           for example by determining                an optimal
   state     for     the      flow   control         and     performing        other
   control     operations       so that the optimal              state     for flow
   control is maintained.
                The    chemical      feed    rate      describes       the    amount
30 of   chemicals          fed    into     the      thickener         during      the
   process. By using the chemical feed rate as a control
   parameter,       the      controller      may      optimize       the     use   of
   chemicals during the process.
                To     determine        values         for     the      controlled

                  Figure      3    illustrates               method       for      predictive
 5 multivariable          model      of     a   dewatering           process        according
   to    an   embodiment.        A    controller             may   also be         configured
   to    perform      the    operations            illustrated            in     the    figure.
   Even     though     the    operations            are presented              in   a   certain
   order,       the   actual       order        where        they    may      be    performed
10 may vary.
                  In   the    embodiment           of      figure     3,     values      for at
   least      two    operating         parameters              are   measured          31.      The
   set of measured operating parameters comprise at least
   the     material        consistency              of      the     underflow           of      the
15 thickener         and    the    inventory             level      of    the      thickener.
   The     measurement         results          for       each     measured         operating
   parameter         may    comprise          one       or     more     separate         values
   measured        at   separate         times.          The     measurement            results
   may also be updated by subsequent measurements. At any
20 phase      of   the   process,         a    set      of    one   or     more     reference
   values       is obtained        32    for      the operating parameters                       of
   the     thickener.         These       reference             values        may     comprise
   target values           (i.e. setpoint values) for the operating
   parameters.          They     may      also         comprise        limiting          values
25 such      as   minimum      or    maximum           values       for      the    operating
   parameters         of    the    thickener.              For    a   single        operating
   parameter        one    or   more      reference            values       may     be    given.
   It     is     also      possible           to       define        reference           values
   dependent        on   time     so that         an     operating parameter                  has,
30 for example,          more than          one     target       value        corresponding
   to     different        future       points           in     time.       The     reference
   values       may   be   pre-determined                or    they    may       be   provided
   or     updated       by     an      operator             at    any      phase       of       the
   dewatering          process.         They         may       also      be       dynamically
35 adjusted and the adjustment may depend on the state of
   the system.

                                                 21
                 At     least      a   part       of   the      measured        values         for
   operating        parameters           of    the    thickener          is     used      33     as
   input values           for a predictive multivariable model. The
   predictive          multivariable               model       may      use      the       input
 5 values     for predicting              a   future      operating          state      of     the
   thickener.          Since      the       operating          parameters           at     least
   partially          determine           the       operating           state         of       the
   thickener,          the      model       also      describes           the      operating
   state     up   to    certain       accuracy.         As     described         above,        the
10 exact     parametrization              of     the   model       may     be    performed,
   for    example,         by    using      process       trials       or     simulations.
   Depending        on     the    model       parameters,           the     model       may      be
   provide        34     predicted           outputs        for      any      or     all       the
   operating        parameters          at    one     or    more     future        points        in
15 time.      The     predicted           output       may       be   provided           to      an
   operator of the process.
                 At least one predicted output of the model is
   compared        35    to    at   least       one    of     the    reference          values
   obtained         to      determine,            how     the       predicted            output
20 relates      to     a    desired         output.       The      comparison          may       be
   separate        to     determining           the    output        of     the     model        so
   that    a   predicted          horizon         for    the      operating         state        is
   determined first and after that,                          the desired output as
   determined by one or more reference values                                   is compared
25 to the predicted output. The comparison may correspond
   to    calculating            the    deviation          between         the      predicted
   output     and a       reference         value.       The     comparison may              also
   correspond         to    using      any     mathematical            relationship              in
   determining how the predicted output relates to one or
30 more reference values. For example a                             step function may
   be    used    to    determine          whether       the      predicted         output        is
   smaller       than       larger        than      a    reference           value       or      an
   exponential            function         may      be     used       to      represent             a
   penalty      for     a   predicted         output      depending          on how        close
35 the predicted value is to a reference value.
                  The     comparison          may     be     used     to     determine           36
   control      values         for    control         parameters           for     directing

                                                    22
   the operating state of the thickener towards a desired
   operating state as determined by the reference values.
   The        determination                may         comprise            optimizing              the
   predicted           output      with       respect          to     control        values        for
 5 control           parameters.             This        may        be      performed,             for
   example,          by    determining           34     the     predicted          output       more
   than      once      using     as     an    input        different         control         values
   for one or more control parameters and by comparing 35
   each predicted output to reference values to determine
10 the     preferred          set    of    control values.                This      can be       done
   using        suitable         mathematical               optimization              techniques
   for      systems        having       a   set      of     control        variables           and       a
   set       of       constraints.             The        control           values        may        be
   determined as single values for a control parameter or
15 as     a    set      of    scheduled          values.          A     control       value        may
   correspond to any present or                          future point in time.
                    Control       parameters             are      adjusted         37   based         on
   the      control         values.       This       may      comprise,          for     example,
   adjusting           the    speed       of    an     underflow          pump      immediately
20 or    at a      time      determined          by an adjustment                 schedule.           It
   may also          comprise        adjusting          a    chemical        feed      rate      into
   the       tank       or    a   feedwell            of     the       thickener.           If     the
   control         parameters           comprise           an     adjustment           schedule,
   this       schedule        may    be     followed.           The      schedule       may      also
25 be    provided           to   an     operator           of     the      process.         It     is,
   however,         not     necessary         to     follow        this     schedule         but      it
   may     be    provided         only      for      informational             purposes.           For
   example,          the     operating         state        of    the     thickener          may     be
   predicted           and    displayed          for      an     extended        time       horizon
30 but       the      model      may       be     updated           before        any       control
   adjustments apart from the first are yet performed.
                    According         to     an    embodiment,             a    cost     function
   may      be    used       for    determining              the      control        values.          In
   such a        case,      the    cost      function          may use       as an       input        at
35 least       some of the predicted output values and at least
   some of         the     reference        values.          In    the     comparison phase
   35,     the     value      of    the     cost       function          may    be    determined

                                              23
   based      on  a   mathematical         relationship            between          at    least
   one     predicted       output      value     and at      least        one     reference
   value.       The   determination           may     involve        determining             the
   relationship           based      on   values        corresponding                to     more
 5 than one point in time, for example by integrating the
   difference        of    a   predicted       value     and a        reference          value
   for     an   operating         parameter       over     a   time       interval.          The
   control values used for adjustment 37 may be chosen to
   be    those     that      minimize       the     cost      function           under       the
10 conditions         determined        by   the     reference           values.         It    is
   noted       that      determining         the      set     of      control          values
   minimizing           the      cost    function         may       require           several
   rounds       of    determining         34      the    predicted             output        and
   comparing 35 that to reference values.
15                According         to  various        embodiments,             particular
   combinations            of     operating       parameters             and      reference
   values are given. Any set of these combinations may be
   used together.
                  According         to   an    embodiment,            a    target        value
20  (i.e.      set-point           value)      may      be     assigned             for      the
   material consistency of the thickener. In such a case,
   the      predicted        output     comprises         a    predicted            material
   consistency          of the underflow of              the thickener and the
   set     of   reference         values    comprises          a   target         reference
25 value      for   the     material      consistency            of     the     underflow.
   Being a set-point value, this target value may be used
   as    a   primary      control      value during most                of the        process
   running        time        as     long     as      other        constraints               are
   satisfied.
30                According         to   an    embodiment,            both       a    minimum
   and a      maximum value may be               assigned        for the          inventory
   level      of   the     thickener.        This      gives      more        freedom        for
   density          optimization,          because        measurement               of    exact
   inventory level is not necessary.                            According              to      an
35 embodiment,           a    maximum       value       may      be        assigned          for
   turbidity        or     solids      content       of    the      overflow           of    the
   thickener.

                                                   24
                According             to   an      embodiment,             a   maximum         value
   may be assigned for                  a torque         exerted on            a rake         of the
   thickener.        By     setting        a    limit       for     the maximum torque,
   control     parameters             may     be     adjusted          so    that       the     limit
 5 is not     exceeded in              such a way that the                    rake would get
   stuck or break.
                According               to     an       embodiment,               any       of      the
   control     parameters              may     also      be      assigned          one     or    more
   reference       values.           These      reference          values         may     comprise

                According              to     an      embodiment,             controlling               a
   dewatering        process          may be        performed           under       a    condition
   to  minimize          a   chemical          feed      rate.        In     such       a   case,       a
   condition         to     minimize          a     chemical           feed       rate       may      be
15 included       in      the     determination               36     of     control         values.
   This   may      be      done,       for     example,           by     including           a    term
   proportional            to     the     magnitude            of     the      chemical           feed
   rate in the cost function.
                 It       is     noted        that       since         the      typical           time
20 scales of the settling process in a thickener are very
   long,   it     may       often       not     be     advantageous              to     make      fast
   control      maneuvers.               Instead,          by      using        a      predictive
   model   to      estimate           the     future        operating            state       of     the
   thickener,         it    may      be possible            to    optimize          the     control
25 adjustments           over      a   long      time.        Additionally,               by    using
   the   model,         various         types        of    process          constraints             and
   conditions        for the constraints may be used.
