                                          BEVERAGE DISPENSING APPARATUS
Background of the Invention
[0001] The present invention relates to a beverage dispensing system, and in one particular
example, to a portable beverage system capable of dispensing beverages at different
temperatures.
Description of the Prior Art
[0002] The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived
from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an
acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that the prior publication (or
information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general knowledge
in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.
[0003] It is known to provide beverage dispensing systems for dispending chilled beverages
such as beer, wine, or the like from kegs. For example, larger venues in Australia almost
exclusively use expensive, specialised and time consuming-to-install, fixed or "hard piped"
installations (sometimes multi-level and below ground) to store and dispense beverages from
the kegs. This typically includes a walk-in cold-room chilled to 4'C, in-line ice-bank/glycol
chillers, fixed dispensing "fonts and taps", compressed gas cylinders and associated metal or
plastic pipes to deliver chilled beverages to the fonts. Such traditional arrangements require
long leads times for implementation and substantial infrastructure and are typically only
provided in static configurations in pubs or other similar venues.
[0004] This results in a number of drawbacks. For example, such systems are expensive to
install and tend to be inflexible, meaning that this limits the ability of a venue to introduce
additional "on-tap" beverages from kegs, and makes dispensing beverages from kegs outside
a venue problematic. A further issue is that this limits the ability of traditional systems to
selectively dispense at different intermediate temperatures from 2-20'C, for example most
conventional/traditional on-tap systems are limited to dispensing at either room (ambient)

temperatures or chilled to 4'C, which is unsuitable for some drinks, such as white and red
wines respectively.
[0005] Wine kegs used in Australia are predominately one-way, disposable (recyclable) 20
30L volume KeyKegs TMM, which use a rigid outer plastic shell and a separate, inner metallised
bag to store the wine, with wine being dispensed by pressurising the outer plastic shell to
thereby squeeze the bag. In this arrangement, no atmospheric air or gases come in actual
contact with the wine, avoiding oxidation and allowing the wine to be stored for 4-6 weeks
after opening without loss of freshness and discernible drinking quality, which reduces
wastage.
[0006] Whilst dispensing can be achieved using a traditional arrangement such as with
compressed, bottled gas, in one example a dispensing unit is provided which supplies
atmospheric air to the keg using an in-built compressor, with the dispensing unit also
operating to provide in-line cooling to cool the beverage to 4'C or lower as it is dispensed.
An example of such an arrangement is the LindrTM series of over-counter "dry" coolers using
the refrigerant R134a. Unfortunately, the cooling capacity of the smaller, lighter, more
portable and preferred over counter, systems is limited meaning it is not possible to dispense
cold (4'C) beverages at a rapid, repeat rate to the theoretical maximal flow capacity of the
LindrTM units, particularly in a hot climate such as Australia from kegs which are kept at
typical ambient summer room temperatures of 25'C or more. This is contrary to the claims in
the prior art for colder climates and much lower summer ambient temperatures in regions
such as the UK where the maximal cooling and flow capacities of LindrT M units can be more
easily utilised.
[0007] The relatively complex structural and equipment requirements of traditional
installations, their fixed nature and ongoing service/maintenance expenses are prohibitive for
                                                                                     TM
smaller venues and for outdoor functions where "beverages-on-tap" using KeyKegs         would
be very appealing to consumers and commercially appropriate to serve. However, the prior
art lacks appropriate specific teachings to achieve this.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
[0026] An example of a beverage dispensing system will now be described with reference to
Figure 1.
[0027] In this example, the beverage dispensing system 100 includes a refrigeration module
 110, configured to house at least one keg 120 containing a beverage to be dispensed, with
two kegs being shown in the example for the purpose of illustration only. The refrigeration
unit 110 is adapted to cool the keg(s), and hence the beverage, to a first temperature.
 [0028] A dispenser unit 130 is provided which is configured to dispense the beverage. The
dispenser unit 130 includes a cooling unit 131 designed to cool the beverage from a first
temperature to a second temperature, and a beverage outlet tap 133 configured to the control
beverage dispensing. Piping 140 is used to connect the dispenser unit to the kegs 120,
allowing beverage to be dispensed.
[0029] Accordingly, the above described arrangement operates to dispense beverages by
utilising a dual cooling configuration including a correctly sized refrigeration module,
typically including an insulated compartment and associated mechanical refrigeration unit, in
conjunction with a dispensing unit that then provides additional cooling. The use of the dual
cooling configuration enables beverages to be cooled to an initial first temperature, typically
in the region of between 100 C and 20'C and more typically between 15'C and 18'C, with
further cooling to a delivery temperature, typically to less than 100 C and more typically
between 4'C and 8'C, being provided by the dispenser unit 130.
 [0030] This allows the dispenser unit to operate and rapidly dispense cold beverage close to
its maximal flow rate and capacity without overloading the internal cooling unit 131, whilst
enabling the apparatus to maintain a sufficiently small size, enabling this to be implemented
in a portable manner, as will be described in more detail below.
 [0031] A number of further features will now be described.

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\ 599355 1.docx-13/11/2017
                                                              -6
[0032] The kegs 120 can be of any appropriate form, but in one example, include an outer
PVC body 121, housing a sealed bladder 122, within a cavity 123. The bladder contains the
beverage, so that pressurisation of the cavity 123 allows the beverage to be dispensed. Each
keg can include an interface 124, commonly referred to as a keg coupler, configured to allow
piping to be coupled thereto. In one example, the kegs are KeyKegs TM , although this is not
essential, and any suitable arrangement could be used.
[0033] In one example the dispenser unit 130 includes a dispenser air compressor 132, that
supplies compressed air to an air pipe 141, which splits into two separate pipes, typically via
a Y-shaped connector piece, so that air can be delivered to the interface 124 of each keg 120,
allowing air to be supplied into the keg cavity 123. A beverage pipe 142 extends from the keg
interface 124 to the dispenser unit 130, and in particular, the cooler 131, allowing beverage to
be delivered for additional cooling. The cooling unit 131 is coupled to the outlet tap 133 via
an internal feed line 133.4, allowing the beverage to be dispensed from a nozzle 133.2, with
control being affected via a tap including a lever 133.1, coupled to a control valve 133.3. In
one preferred example, the dispensing unit is a LindrTM PYGMY 25/K unit, or similar.
[0034] The refrigeration module 110 typically includes an insulated cabinet 111 having a
cavity 112 that houses the at least one keg. In the current example two kegs are shown
although it will be appreciated that any number of kegs could be provided dependent upon
the preferred implementation and chosen size of the insulated cabinet. A separate cooling
system is typically provided to cool the cavity which is generally an electric or gas powered
compressive cooling system as found in a typical refrigerator, albeit adapted to chill the
cavity to approximately 12'C to 18'C.                        The refrigeration module 110 could be of any
appropriate form, and in one example is a GamkoTM FK2-25/6R keg cooler which utilizes a
high efficiency R600a refrigerant as part of its cooling system, although this is not essential
and other suitable arrangements could be used.
[0035] As commercially available refrigeration modules 110 typically have a sealed
(essentially air tight), insulated cabinet 111, the system can also include an insulated bung
150, which is adapted to be inserted into an opening purpose cut in the wall of the insulated
cabinet 111, with the bung including one or more holes, allowing pipes 141, 142 to pass

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\ 599355 1.docx-13/11/2017
                                                             -7
through the bung and into the cavity 112. The bung may optionally include a cover to seal
the holes so that the cabinet remains chilled when pipes are not inserted therein, as will be
described in more detail below.
[0036] As mentioned above, in the current example, the refrigeration module 110 is
configured to house first and second kegs 120, containing respective first and second
beverages. The dispenser unit 130 includes first and second taps 133 (with one being shown
for clarity) that dispense the first and second beverages. In this example, the cooling unit in
the dispensing system can be configured to only cool the second beverage so the first
beverage is dispensed at the first temperature and the second beverage is dispensed at the
second temperature. This can be useful for example when dispensing wine as this allows red
wine to be dispensed at the first temperature, typically between 12'C and 18'C, whilst white
wine is dispensed at between 4'C and 6'C.
[0037] The beverage dispensing system can also include an in-line gasification system 143,
that gasifies at least one beverage before being dispensed. The gasification system is typically
located such that it gasifies either at ambient temperatures or between 2-18'C, depending on
the preferred implementation. In this example, the gasification system 143 is provided in the
beverage pipes 142, to gasify the beverage before it is delivered to the dispenser unit 130,
although this is not essential and other preferred configurations e.g. gasification within cavity
 112 could also be used. Such an arrangement is useful for dispensing sparkling wines, or
nitrogenised cold-brew coffee the like, which often require gasification at cold temperatures
                                                                  TM
and pressurisation beyond that achievable using the KeyKegs          . It will be appreciated that
whilst gasification is usually performed using C0 2 , this is not essential and other gases could
be used, such as nitrogen, hydrogen, helium, or the like.
 [0038] In one example, the above described arrangement example can be provided in a
portable configuration and an example of this will now be described with references to
Figures 2A to 2D.
 [0039] In this example, the portable configuration includes a mobile bar unit 260, having a
base 261 mounted on castor wheels 265 allowing the bar unit to be easily transported. A

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\ 5993551 _.docx-13/11/2017
                                                              -8
frame (not shown) is coupled to the base 261, which supports an upstanding front panel 271,
aligned with, and positioned above, a front edge of the base 261.                        The front panel 271
supports a counter 272 and a serving shelf 273, extending rearwardly from the front panel, so
that the counter 272 is spaced from and above the base 261, whilst the serving shelf 273 is
spaced from and above the counter 272. The base and frame can be made of any suitable
materials, such as wood, metal or the like.                     Similarly the panel, counter and shelf can be
made of any material, but in one example include acrylic polymer and alumina trihydrate
(ATH), which is particularly durable and easily to clean, whilst providing a pleasing aesthetic
appearance.               The front panel can also include a recess 274 adapted to receive and display
information, such as information regarding available drinks or the like.
[0040] The base 261 can also include a facia 266 extending downwardly from front and side
edges to hide the wheels 265, whilst a foot bar 267 extends outwardly from the front of the
unit allowing a customer to rest their foot on the bar whilst being served.
 [0041] In this example, the refrigeration module is a GamkoTM FK2-25/6R keg cooler
including an insulated cabinet having doors 211.1, 211.2 and a mechanical cooling system
213, which can be positioned on the base 261, under the counter 272, whilst the dispenser
unit 230 is a LindrTM PYGMY 25/K unit positioned on the counter 272 and partially under
the shelf 273. This allows a server to dispense drinks, and place these on the serving shelf
273 for collection.
[0042] As previously mentioned, the system can include a bung, inserted in a purpose cut
hole within counter 272 and allowing pipes to pass through a wall of the refrigeration cabinet.
An example bung is shown in more detail in Figures 3A to 3F.
[0043] As shown the bung includes a generally cylindrical body 351 including a number of
outer ribs 351.1 extending circumferentially round the body 351, and which are spaced along
the length of the body. The bung includes a flange 352 at an upper end, which is coupled to a
cover 353 via a hinge 354, allowing the cover 353 to move between open and closed position
shown in Figures 3B and 3C respectively.

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\ 599355 1.docx-13/11/2017
                                                                 -9
[0044] The body 351 includes four openings 352.1, 352.2, extending therethrough, with these
being adapted to receive the air pipes 341 and beverage pipes 342, respectively. The lid 353
includes plugs 353.1, 353.2, which engage with ends of the openings 352.1, 352.2 to seal the
openings and prevent airflow therethrough. In this regard, sealing engagement is facilitated
by ridges 354.1, extending circumferentially round the plugs 353.1, 353.2, which engage with
corresponding recesses 354.2 extending circumferentially round an upper end of the holes
352.1, 352.2. The bung is typically made of a thermally insulating material, such as rubber
or the like.
[0045] In use, the bung 351 attached to a refrigerator cabinet by simply drilling a suitably
sized hole in the cabinet body 311, and optionally lining this hole with a suitably sized piece
of stainless steel or plastic or similar smooth piping 355, and then inserting the bung therein
so that the ridges providing sealing engagement with the pipe or hole. In a further example,
the hole extends through both the refrigerator cabinet wall 311 and the counter 372, allowing
piping to be fed directly into the refrigerator cavity, through the counter, as shown in Figure
3F. Additionally the flange 352 abuts against the outer surface of the counter 372 to provide
further sealing.
[0046] Whilst the above described implementation includes four openings 352.1, 352.2, two
for air pipes and two for beverage pipes, it will be appreciated that any suitable number of
openings could be used. For example, single air and beverage holes could be provided if
only a single keg is used to dispense a single beverage, whilst a single air hole might be
required if the air pipe splits to feed each keg within the refrigeration cavity.
[0047] Accordingly, the above described arrangement provides a solution for beverage
dispensing and in particular, allows beverages to be dispensed on-demand and chilled to a
target temperature, with the option of allowing different drinks to be dispensed at respective
different temperatures.                        Additionally, the system avoids the need for heavy/expensive
compressed gas cylinders to operate, making this suitable for use in a wide range of
circumstances.

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\ 599355 1.docx-13/11/2017
                                                               - 10
[0048] The system can be used to dispense a wide range of different beverages, but is
particularly suited for dispensing wine, including red and white wine, chilled to respective
drinking temperatures. Alternatively, however, this can be used to dispense a wide range of
different beverages, including, but not limited to beer, cider, cocktails, cold-brew coffee or
the like with or without gasification.
[0049] Furthermore, in one example, this is provided in a portable or mobile arrangement,
allowing this to be transported to a venue and used as required. In particular, the beverage in
kegs can be pre-chilled off-site, and then transported and set-up, allowing chilled drinks to be
supplied almost immediately and with high repeat customer volume after delivery to the
venue and during elevated, external, summer temperatures.                      The system can be manufactured
from materials allowing for ease of cleaning and durable, allowing this to be deployed in
outdoor environments, such beer gardens, or the like.
[0050] The system can also be used indoors, allowing dual stage cooling to be used instead
of fixed/hard piped traditional installations, allowing this system to be deployed faster and
providing a cheaper, compact and easier to operate systems, than typical traditional solutions.
[0051] Throughout this specification and claims which follow, unless the context requires
otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be
understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers or steps but not the
exclusion of any other integer or group of integers. As used herein and unless otherwise
