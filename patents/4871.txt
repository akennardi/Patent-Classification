A device with touch-sensitive surface and display is configured to: display a page of a multi
page interface; and detect an input that includes a contact and movement of the contact on the
touch-sensitive surface. The device is further configured to, in response to detecting the input: if
the input meets next-page display criteria, where the next-page display criteria include a criterion
that is met when the contact moves by more than a predefined amount in a first predetermined
direction, replace display of the page with display of a second page of the multi-page interface;
and if the input meets search-interface display criteria, where the search-interface display criteria
include a criterion that is met when the contact moves by more than the predefined amount in a
second predetermined direction that is perpendicular to the first direction, display a search
interface that includes a search input field for inputting search terms.

            Device, Method, and Graphical User Interface for Providing
                          Navigation and Search Functionalities
                                    RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]         Incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety, is PCT/US2014/040408 (published
as WO2014/200733), filed on 30 May 2014.
                                        TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001A]       This relates generally to electronic devices with touch-sensitive surfaces, including
but not limited to electronic devices with touch-sensitive surfaces that provide navigation and
search functionalities.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0002]        The use of touch-sensitive surfaces as input devices for computers and other
electronic computing devices has increased significantly in recent years. Exemplary touch
sensitive surfaces include touch pads and touch screen displays. Such surfaces are widely used to
manipulate and navigate user interfaces.
[0003]        Users can use touch inputs to navigate user interfaces and perform searches. But
methods for performing these operations are cumbersome and inefficient. In addition, these
methods take longer than necessary, thereby wasting energy. This latter consideration is
particularly important in battery-operated devices.
                                             SUMMARY
[0004]        Accordingly, there is a need for electronic devices with faster, more efficient
methods and interfaces for providing navigation and search functionalities. The embodiments
described herein provide better integration of these functionalities, for example by making a
search input interface available on different pages of a multi-page application launch interface,
while also enabling a user to easily navigate between different pages in the multi-page
application launch interface. Such methods and interfaces optionally complement or replace
                                                   1

conventional methods for providing navigation and search functionalities. Such methods and
interfaces reduce the cognitive burden on a user and produce a more efficient human-machine
interface. For battery-operated devices, such methods and interfaces conserve power and
increase the time between battery charges.
[0005]        The above deficiencies and other problems associated with user interfaces for
electronic devices with touch-sensitive surfaces are reduced or eliminated by the
                                                1A

meets next-page display criteria, where the next-page display criteria include a criterion that
is met when the first contact moves by more than a predefined amount in a first
predetermined direction on the touch-sensitive surface, replacing display of the first page of
the multi-page application launch interface with display of a second page of the multi-page
application launch interface that includes a second plurality of application icons that are
different from the first plurality of application icons; and in accordance with a determination
that the first input meets search-interface display criteria, where the search-interface display
criteria include a criterion that is met when the first contact moves by more than the
predefined amount in a second predetermined direction that is perpendicular to the first

                             DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[00201           Many electronic devices allow users to navigate user interfaces and perform
navigation and search functionalities. The electronic devices described below improve on
these methods by providing faster, more efficient, and better integrated methods and
interfaces for users to navigate a multi-page application launch interface and search for
content. For example, the devices make a search input interface directly accessible from a
plurality of different pages of a multi-page application launch interface, while also enabling
a user to easily navigate between different pages in the multi-page application launch
interface. The devices also enable a user to use simple touch inputs to directly navigate to
additional functionatities from the multi-page application launch interface, such as a
notifications interface, a multitasking interface, and/or a settings interface.

                                    EXEMPLARY DEVICES
100221           Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which
are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description,
numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the
various described embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the
art that the various described embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.
In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, circuits, and networks
have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the
embodiments.
100231           It will also be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. are, in
some instances, used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be
limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another.
For example, a first contact could be termed a second contact, and, similarly, a second
contact could be termed a first contact, without departing from the scope of the various
described embodiments. The first contact and the second contact are both contacts, but they
are not the same contact.
[00241           The terminology used in the description of the various described
embodiments herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not
intended to be limiting. As used in the description of the various described embodiments
and the appended claims, the singular forms " a," an" and "the" are intended to include the
plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be
understood that the term "and/or" as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all
possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. It will be further
understood that the terms "includes," "including," "comprises," and/or "comprising," when
used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations,
elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more
other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.
100251           As used herein, the term "if" is, optionally, construed to mean "when" or
"upon" or "in response to determining" or "in response to detecting," depending on the
context. Similarly, the phrase "if it is determined" or "if [a stated condition or event] is
detected" is, optionally, construed to mean "upon determining" or "in response to
                                                     6

  WO 2014/200733                                                           PCT/US2014/040408
determining" or 'upon detecting [the stated condition or event]" or "in response to detecting
[the stated condition or event]," depending on the context.
100261          Embodiments of electronic devices, user interfaces for such devices, and
associated processes for using such devices are described. In some embodiments, the device
is a portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also contains other
functions, such as PDA and/or music player functions. Exemplary embodiments of portable
multifunction devices include, without limitation, the iPhone@, iPod Touch@, and iPad®
devices from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California. Other portable electronic devices, such as
laptops or tablet computers with touch-sensitive surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays and/or
touch pads), are, optionally, used. It should also be understood that, in some embodiments,
the device is not a portable communications device, but is a desktop computer with a touch
sensitive surface (e.g., a touch screen display and/or a touch pad).
100271          In the discussion that follows, an electronic device that includes a display
and a touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however, that the
electronic device optionally includes one or more other physical user-interface devices, such
as a physical keyboard, a mouse and/or a joystick.
[00281          The device typically supports a variety of applications, such as one or more
of the following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word processing
application, a website creation application, a disk authoring application, a spreadsheet
application, a gaming application, a telephone application, a video conferencing application,
an e-mail application, an instant messaging application, a workout support application, a
photo management application, a digital camera application, a digital video camera
application, a web browsing application, a digital music player application, and/or a digital
video player application.
100291          The various applications that are executed on the device optionally use at
least one common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface. One
or more functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information
displayed on the device are, optionally, adjusted and/or varied from one application to the
next and/or within a respective application. In this way, a common physical architecture
(such as the touch-sensitive surface) of the device optionally supports the variety of
applications with user interfaces that are intuitive and transparent to the user.

[00301          Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable devices with
touch-sensitive displays. Figure 1A is a block diagram illustrating portable multifunction
device 100 with touch-sensitive displays 112 in accordance with some embodiments.
Touch-sensitive display 112 is sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience, and is
sometimes known as or called a touch-sensitive display system. Device 100 includes
memory 102 (which optionally includes one or more computer readable storage mediums),
memory controller 122, one or more processing units (CPU's) 120, peripherals interface
118, RF circuitry 108, audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, microphone 113, input/output (I/O)
subsystem 106, other input or control devices 116, and external port 124. Device 100
optionally includes one or more optical sensors 164. Device 100 optionally includes one or
more intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of contacts on device 100 (e.g., a touch
sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system 112 of device 100). Device 100
optionally includes one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating tactile outputs
on device 100 (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch
sensitive display system 112 of device 100 or touchpad 355 of device 300). These
components optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines
103.
100311          As used in the specification and claims, the term "intensity" of a contact on a
touch-sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a contact (e.g.,
a finger contact) on the touch sensitive surface, or to a substitute (proxy) for the force or
pressure of a contact on the touch sensitive surface. The intensity of a contact has a range of
values that includes at least four distinct values and more typically includes hundreds of
distinct values (e.g., at least 256). Intensity of a contact is, optionally, determined (or
measured) using various approaches and various sensors or combinations of sensors. For
example, one or more force sensors underneath or adjacent to the touch-sensitive surface
are, optionally, used to measure force at various points on the touch-sensitive surface. In
some implementations, force measurements from multiple force sensors are combined (e.g.,
a weighted average) to determine an estimated force of a contact. Similarly, a pressure
sensitive tip of a stylus is, optionally, used to determine a pressure of the stylus on the
touch-sensitive surface. Alternatively, the size of the contact area detected on the touch
sensitive surface and/or changes thereto, the capacitance of the touch-sensitive surface
proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto, and/or the resistance of the touch-sensitive
                                                     8

  WO 2014/200733                                                             PCT/US2014/040408
surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto are, optionally, used as a substitute
for the force or pressure of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface. In some
implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are used directly
to determine whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold
is described in units corresponding to the substitute measurements). In some
implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are converted to
an estimated force or pressure and the estimated force or pressure is used to determine
whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is a pressure
threshold measured in units of pressure).
[00321          As used in the specification and claims, the term "tactile output" refers to
physical displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical
displacement of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to another
component (e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the component relative to a
center of mass of the device that will be detected by a user with the user's sense of touch.
For example, in situations where the device or the component of the device is in contact
with a surface of a user that is sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm, or other part of a
user's hand), the tactile output generated by the physical displacement will be interpreted by
the user as a tactile sensation corresponding to a perceived change in physical
characteristics of the device or the component of the device. For example, movement of a
touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch-sensitive display or trackpad) is, optionally, interpreted
by the user as a "down click" or "up click" of a physical actuator button. In some cases, a
user will feel a tactile sensation such as an "doxvn click" or "up click" even when there is no
movement of a physical actuator button associated with the touch-sensitive surface that is
physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the user's movements. As another example,
movement of the touch-sensitive surface is, optionally, interpreted or sensed by the user as
"roughness" of the touch-sensitive surface, even when there is no change in smoothness of
the touch-sensitive surface. While such interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to
the individualized sensory perceptions of the user, there are many sensory perceptions of
touch that are common to a large majority of users. Thus, when a tactile output is described
as corresponding to a particular sensory perception of a user (e.g., an "up click," a "down
click," "roughness"), unless otherwise stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to
                                                    9

physical displacement of the device or a component thereof that will generate the described
sensory perception for a typical (or average) user.
100331           It should be appreciated that device 100 is only one example of a portable
multifunction device, and that device 100 optionally has more or fewer components than
shown, optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has a different
configuration or arrangement of the components. The various components shown in Figure
1A are implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both hardware and
software, including one or more signal processing and/or application specific integrated
circuits.
100341           Memory 102 optionally includes high-speed random access memory and
optionally also includes non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage
devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid-state memory devices. Access to
memory 102 by other components of device 100, such as CPU 120 and the peripherals
interface 1 18, is, optionally, controlled by memory controller 122.
100351           Peripherals interface 118 can be used to couple input and output peripherals
of the device to CPU 120 and memory 102. The one or more processors 120 run or execute
various software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in memory 102 to perform
various functions for device 100 and to process data.
100361           In some embodiments, peripherals interface 118, CPU 120, and memory
controller 122 are, optionally, implemented on a single chip, such as chip 104. In some
other embodiments, they are, optionally, implemented on separate chips.
100371           RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also called
electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from electromagnetic
signals and communicates with communications networks and other communications
devices via the electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 optionally includes well-known
circuitry for performing these functions, including but not limited to an antenna system, an
RF transceiver, one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one or more oscillators, a digital signal
processor, a CODEC chipset, a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, memory, and so
forth. RF circuitry 108 optionally communicates with networks, such as the Internet, also
referred to as the World Wide Web (WWW), an intranet and/or a wireless network, such as

 100381          Audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, and microphone 113 provide an audio
interface between a user and device 100. Audio circuitry 110 receives audio data from
peripherals interface 118, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and transmits the
electrical signal to speaker 111. Speaker 111 converts the electrical signal to human-audible
sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 also receives electrical signals converted by microphone
 113 from sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 converts the electrical signal to audio data and
transmits the audio data to peripherals interface 118 for processing. Audio data is,
optionally, retrieved from and/or transmitted to memory 102 and/or RF circuitry 108 by
peripherals interface 118. In some embodiments, audio circuitry 110 also includes a headset
jack (e.g., 212, Figure 2). The headset jack provides an interface between audio circuitry
 110 and removable audio input/output peripherals, such as output-only headphones or a
headset with both output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears) and input (e.g., a
microphone).
 [0039]          I/O subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100, such as
touch screen 112 and other input control devices 116, to peripherals interface 118. I/O
subsystem 106 optionally includes display controller 156, optical sensor controller 158,

intensity sensor controller 159, haptic feedback controller 161 and one or more input
controllers 160 for other input or control devices. The one or more input controllers 160
receive/send electrical signals from/to other input or control devices 116. The other input
control devices 116 optionally include physical buttons (e.g., push buttons, rocker buttons,
etc.), dials, slider switches, joysticks, click wheels, and so forth. In some alternate
embodiments, input controller(s) 160 are, optionally, coupled to any (or none) of the
following: a keyboard, infrared port, USB port, and a pointer device such as a mouse. The
one or more buttons (e.g., 208, Figure 2) optionally include an up/down button for volume
control of speaker 111 and/or microphone 113. The one or more buttons optionally include
a push button (e.g., 206, Figure 2).
100401            Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output
interface between the device and a user. Display controller 156 receives and/or sends
electrical signals from/to touch screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the
user. The visual output optionally includes graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination
thereof (collectively termed "graphics"). In some embodiments, some or all of the visual
output corresponds to user-interface objects.
100411            Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor or set of sensors that
accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen 112 and
display controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions in
memory 102) detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the contact) on touch screen
112 and converts the detected contact into interaction with user-interface objects (e.g., one
or more soft keys, icons, web pages or images) that are displayed on touch screen 112. In an
exemplary embodiment, a point of contact between touch screen 112 and the user
corresponds to a finger of the user.
[00421            Touch screen 112 optionally uses LCD (liquid crystal display) technology,
LPD (light emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting diode) technology,
although other display technologies are used in other embodiments. Touch screen 112 and
display controller 156 optionally detect contact and any movement or breaking thereof
using any of a plurality of touch sensing technologies now known or later developed,
including but not limited to capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave
technologies, as well as other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for determining one

or more points of contact with touch screen 112. In an exemplary embodiment, projected
mutual capacitance sensing technology is used, such as that found in the iPhone@, iPod
Touch@R), and iPad@ from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California.
[00431          Touch screen 112 optionally has a video resolution in excess of 100 dpi. In
some embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately 160 dpi. The
user optionally makes contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable object or appendage,
such as a stylus, a finger, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user interface is designed
to work primarily with finger-based contacts and gestures, which can be less precise than
stylus-based input due to the larger area of contact of a finger on the touch screen. In some
embodiments, the device translates the rough finger-based input into a precise
pointer/cursor position or command for performing the actions desired by the user.
100441          In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100 optionally
includes a touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular functions. In some
embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch
screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad is, optionally, a touch-sensitive surface
that is separate from touch screen 112 or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed
by the touch screen.
100451          Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various
components. Power system 162 optionally includes a power management system, one or
more power sources (e.g., battery, alternating current (AC)), a recharging system, a power
failure detection circuit, a power converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a light
emitting diode (LED)) and any other components associated with the generation,
management and distribution of power in portable devices.
100461          Device 100 optionally also includes one or more optical sensors 164.
Figure 1A shows an optical sensor coupled to optical sensor controller 158 in I/O subsystem
106. Optical sensor 164 optionally includes charge-coupled device (CCD) or
complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) phototransistors. Optical sensor 164
receives light from the environment, projected through one or more lens, and converts the
light to data representing an image. In conjunction with imaging module 143 (also called a
camera module), optical sensor 164 optionally captures still images or video. In some
embodiments, an optical sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen

display 112 on the front of the device, so that the touch screen display is enabled for use as
a viewfinder for still and/or video image acquisition. In some embodiments, another optical
sensor is located on the front of the device so that the user's image is, optionally, obtained
for videoconferencing while the user views the other video conference participants on the
touch screen display.
[00471          Device 100 optionally also includes one or more contact intensity sensors
165. Figure 1A shows a contact intensity sensor coupled to intensity sensor controller 159
in I/O subsystem 106. Contact intensity sensor 165 optionally includes one or more
piezoresistive strain gauges, capacitive force sensors, electric force sensors, piezoelectric
force sensors, optical force sensors, capacitive touch-sensitive surfaces, or other intensity
sensors (e.g., sensors used to measure the force (or pressure) of a contact on a touch
sensitive surface). Contact intensity sensor 165 receives contact intensity information (e.g.,
pressure information or a proxy for pressure information) from the environment. In some
embodiments, at least one contact intensity sensor is collocated with, or proximate to, a
touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112). In some embodiments, at
least one contact intensity sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen
display 112 which is located on the front of device 100.
100481          Device 100 optionally also includes one or more proximity sensors 166.
Figure 1A shows proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately,
proximity sensor 166 is coupled to input controller 160 in I/O subsystem 106. In some
embodiments, the proximity sensor turns off and disables to ich screen 112 when the
multifunction device is placed near the user's ear (e.g., when the user is making a phone
call).
100491          Device 100 optionally also includes one or more tactile output generators
167. Figure IA shows a tactile output generator coupled to haptic feedback controller 161 in
I/O subsystem 106. Tactile output generator 167 optionally includes one or more
electroacoustic devices such as speakers or other audio components and/or
electromechanical devices that convert energy into linear motion such as a motor, solenoid,
electroactive polymer, piezoelectric actuator, electrostatic actuator, or other tactile output
generating component (e.g., a component that converts electrical signals into tactile outputs
on the device). Contact intensity sensor 165 receives tactile feedback generation instructions
                                                  14

from haptic feedback module 133 and generates tactile outputs on device 100 that are
capable of being sensed by a user of device 100. In some embodiments, at least one tactile
output generator is collocated with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch
sensitive display system 112) and, optionally, generates a tactile output by moving the
touch-sensitive surface vertically (e.g., in/out of a surface of device 100) or laterally (e.g.,
back and forth in the same plane as a surface of device 100). In some embodiments, at least
one tactile output generator sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch
screen display 112 which is located on the front of device 100.
100501          Device 100 optionally also includes one or more accelerometers 168. Figure
1A shows accelerometer 168 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately,
accelerometer 168 is, optionally, coupled to an input controller 160 in 1/O subsystem 106. In
some embodiments, information is displayed on the touch screen display in a portrait view
or a landscape view based on an analysis of data received from the one or more
accelerometers. Device 100 optionally includes, in addition to accelerometer(s) 168, a
magnetometer (not shown) and a GPS (or GLONASS or other global navigation system)
receiver (not shown) for obtaining information concerning the location and orientation (e.g.,
portrait or landscape) of device 100.
100511          In some embodiments, the software components stored in memory 102
include operating system 126, communication module (or set of instructions) 128,
contact/motion module (or set of instructions) 130, graphics module (or set of instructions)
132, text input module (or set of instructions) 134, Global Positioning System (GPS)
module (or set of instructions) 135, and applications (or sets of instructions) 136.
Furthermore, in some embodiments memory 102 stores device/global internal state 157, as
shown in Figures 1A and 3. Device/global internal state 157 includes one or more of: active
application state, indicating which applications, if any, are currently active; display state,
indicating what applications, views or other information occupy various regions of touch
screen display 112; sensor state, including information obtained from the device's various
sensors and input control devices 116; and location information concerning the device's
location and/or attitude.

  WO 2014/200733                                                            PCT/US2014/040408
components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g., memory
management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and facilitates
communication between various hardware and software components.
[00531          Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other devices
over one or more external ports 124 and also includes various software components for
handling data received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124. External port 124 (e.g.,
Universal Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to other
devices or indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some
embodiments, the external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or
similar to and/or compatible with the 30-pin connector used on iPod (trademark of Apple
Inc.) devices. In some embodiments, the external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 8-pin) connector
that is the same as, or similar to and/or compatible with the 8-pin connector (e.g., Lightning
connector) used on iPhone and iPod (trademark of Apple Inc.) devices.
100541          Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects contact with touch screen 112
(in conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch sensitive devices (e.g., a
touchpad or physical click wheel). Contact/motion module 130 includes various software
components for performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as
determining if contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an
intensity of the contact (e.g., the force or pressure of the contact or a substitute for the force
or pressure of the contact), determining if there is movement of the contact and tracking the
movement across the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging
events), and determining if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a
break in contact). Contact/motion module 130 receives contact data from the touch-sensitive
surface. Determining movement of the point of contact, which is represented by a series of
contact data, optionally includes determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude and
direction), and/or an acceleration (a change in magnitude and/or direction) of the point of
contact. These operations are, optionally, applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger
contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts (e.g., "imultitouch"/multiple finger contacts).
In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 and display controller 156 detect contact
on a touchpad.
                                                   16

  WO 2014/200733                                                           PCT/US2014/040408
[00551           In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 uses a set of one or more
intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user (e.g.,
to determine whether a user has "clicked" on an icon). In some embodiments at least a
subset of the intensity thresholds are determined in accordance with software parameters
(e.g., the intensity thresholds are not determined by the activation thresholds of particular
physical actuators and can be adjusted without changing the physical hardware of device
100). For example, a mouse "click" threshold of a trackpad or touch screen display can be
set to any of a large range of predefined thresholds values without changing the trackpad or
touch screen display hardware. Additionally, in some implementations a user of the device
is provided with software settings for adjusting one or more of the set of intensity thresholds
(e.g., by adjusting individual intensity thresholds and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity
thresholds at once with a system-level click "intensity" parameter).
100561           Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects a gesture input by a user.
Different gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns (e.g.,
different motions, timings, and/or intensities of detected contacts). Thus, a gesture is,
optionally, detected by detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger
tap gesture includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (lift
off) event at the same position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event
(e.g., at the position of an icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the
touch-sensitive surface includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or
more finger-dragging events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off)
event.
100571           Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for
rendering and displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including
components for changing the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation,
contrast or other visual property) of graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the term
"graphics" includes any object that can be displayed to a user, including without limitation
text, web pages, icons (such as user-interface objects including soft keys), digital images,
videos, animations and the like.
100581           In some embodiments, graphics module 132 stores data representing
graphics to be used. Each graphic is, optionally, assigned a corresponding code. Graphics

generating instructions used by tactile output generator(s) 167 to produce tactile outputs at
one or more locations on device 100 in response to user interactions with device 100.

module 132, provides soft keyboards for entering text in various applications (e.g., contacts
137, e-mail 140, IM 141, browser 147, and any other application that needs text input).
100611           GPS module 135 determines the location of the device and provides this
information for use in various applications (e.g., to telephone 138 for use in location-based
dialing, to camera 143 as picture/video metadata, and to applications that provide location
based services such as weather widgets, local yellow page widgets, and map/navigation
widgets).

respective instant message (e.g., using a Short Message Service (SMS) or Multimedia
Message Service (MMS) protocol for telephony-based instant messages or using XMPP,
SIMPLE, or IMPS for Internet-based instant messages), to receive instant messages and to
view received instant messages. In some embodiments, transmitted and/or received instant
messages optionally include graphics, photos, audio files, video files and/or other
attachments as are supported in a MMS and/or an Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS). As
used herein, "instant messaging" refers to both telephony-based messages (e.g., messages
sent using SMS or MMS) and Internet-based messages (e.g., messages sent using XMPP,
SIMPLE, or IMPS).

[00811          Each of the above identified modules and applications correspond to a set of
executable instructions for performing one or more functions described above and the
methods described in this application (e.g., the computer-implemented methods and other
information processing methods described herein). These modules (i.e., sets of instructions)
need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus
various subsets of these modules are, optionally, combined or otherwise re-arranged in
various embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 optionally stores a subset of the
modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore, memory 102 optionally stores
additional modules and data structures not described above.
100821          In some embodiments, device 100 is a device where operation of a
predefined set of functions on the device is performed exclusively through a touch screen
and/or a touchpad. By using a touch screen and/or a touchpad as the primary input control
device for operation of device 100, the number of physical input control devices (such as
push buttons, dials, and the like) on device 100 is, optionally, reduced.
100831          The predefined set of functions that are performed exclusively through a
touch screen and/or a touchpad optionally include navigation between user interfaces. In
some embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates device 100 to a
main, home, or root menu from any user interface that is displayed on device 100. In such
embodiments, a "menu button" is implemented using a touchpad. In some other
embodiments, the menu button is a physical push button or other physical input control
device instead of a touchpad.

[00841          Figure 1B is a block diagram illustrating exemplary components for event
handling in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 (in
Figures 1A) or 370 (Figure 3) includes event sorter 170 (e.g., in operating system 126) and a
respective application 136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137-13, 155, 380
390).
[00851          Event sorter 170 receives event information and determines the application
136-1 and application view 191 of application 136-1 to which to deliver the event
information. Event sorter 170 includes event monitor 171 and event dispatcher module 174.
In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes application internal state 192, which
indicates the current application view(s) displayed on touch sensitive display 112 when the
application is active or executing. In some embodiments, device/global internal state 157 is
used by event sorter 170 to determine which application(s) is (are) currently active, and
application internal state 192 is used by event sorter 170 to determine application views 191
to which to deliver event information.
[00861          In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes additional
information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application 136-1
resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates information being
displayed or that is ready for display by application 136-1, a state queue for enabling the
user to go back to a prior state or view of application 136-1, and a redo/undo queue of
previous actions taken by the user.
[00871          Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals interface
118. Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch
sensitive display 112, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface 118 transmits
information it receives from I/O subsystem 106 or a sensor, such as proximity sensor 166,
accelerometer(s) 168, and/or microphone 113 (through audio circuitry 110). Information
that peripherals interface 118 receives from I/O subsystem 106 includes information from
touch-sensitive display 112 or a touch-sensitive surface.
100881          In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the peripherals
interface 118 at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals interface 118 transmits
event information. In other embodiments, peripheral interface 118 transmits event
                                                  24

  WO 2014/200733                                                           PCT/US2014/040408
information only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a
predetermined noise threshold and/or for more than a predetermined duration).
100891          In some embodiments, event sorter 170 also includes a hit view
determination module 172 and/or an active event recognizer determination module 173.
100901          Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for
determining where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views, when touch
sensitive display 112 displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and other
elements that a user can see on the display.
100911          Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of
views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which
information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a
respective application) in which a touch is detected optionally correspond to programmatic
levels within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For example, the lowest
level view in which a touch is detected is, optionally, called the hit view, and the set of
events that are recognized as proper inputs are, optionally, determined based, at least in part,
on the hit view of the initial touch that begins a touch-based gesture.
[00921          Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to sub
events of a touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized in a
hierarchy, hit view determination module 172 identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the
hierarchy which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the
lowest level view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (i.e., the first sub-event in the
sequence of sub-events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is identified
by the hit view determination module, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related
to the same touch or input source for which it was identified as the hit view.
100931          Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which view or
views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some
embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that only the
hit view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, active
event recognizer determination module 173 determines that all views that include the
physical location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that
all actively involved views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other
                                                  25

  WO 2014/200733                                                          PCT/US2014/040408
embodiments, even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with
one particular view, views higher in the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved
views.
[00941          Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an event
recognizer (e.g., event recognizer 180). In embodiments including active event recognizer
determination module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to
an event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination module 173. In
some embodiments, event dispatcher module 174 stores in an event queue the event
information, which is retrieved by a respective event receiver module 182.
100951          In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170.
Alternatively, application 136-1 includes event sorter 170. In yet other embodiments, event
sorter 170 is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory 102, such
as contact/motion module 130.
100961          In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event
handlers 190 and one or more application views 191, each of which includes instructions for
handling touch events that occur within a respective view of the application's user interface.
Each application view 191 of the application 136-1 includes one or more event recognizers
180. Typically, a respective application view 191 includes a plurality of event recognizers
180. In other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers 180 are part of a separate
module, such as a user interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object from which
application 136-1 inherits methods and other properties. In some embodiments, a respective
event handler 190 includes one or more of: data updater 176, object updater 177, GUI
updater 178, and/or event data 179 received from event sorter 170. Event handler 190
optionally utilizes or calls data updater 176, object updater 177 or GUI updater 178 to
update the application internal state 192. Alternatively, one or more of the application views
191 includes one or more respective event handlers 190. Also, in some embodiments, one or
more of data updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a
respective application view 191.
100971          A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g., event
data 179) from event sorter 170, and identifies an event from the event information. Event
recognizer 180 includes event receiver 182 and event comparator 184. In some
                                                  26

  WO 2014/200733                                                            PCT/US2014/040408
embodiments, event recognizer 180 also includes at least a subset of: metadata 183, and
event delivery instructions 188 (which optionally include sub-event delivery instructions).
100981           Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170. The
event information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch
movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional
information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a
touch, the event information optionally also includes speed and direction of the sub-event.
In some embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to another
(e.g., from a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the event
information includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also called
device attitude) of the device.
100991           Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined event or
sub-event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event, or
determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event
comparator 184 includes event definitions 186. Event definitions 186 contain definitions of
events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (187-1), event 2
(187-2), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event 187 include, for example,
touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one
example, the definition for event 1 (187-1) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double
tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, a first lift-off (touch end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch
(touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, and a second lift-off (touch
end) for a predetermined phase. In another example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a
dragging on a displayed object. The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact)
on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch
sensitive display 112, and lift-off of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event
also includes information for one or more associated event handlers 190.
1001001          In some embodiments, event definition 187 includes a definition of an event
for a respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator 184 performs
a hit test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event. For
example, in an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on
                                                  27

  WO 2014/200733                                                           PCT/US2014/040408
touch-sensitive display 112, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display 112, event
comparator 184 performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is
associated with the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated with a
respective event handler 190, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to
determine which event handler 190 should be activated. For example, event comparator 184
selects an event handler associated with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit test.
1001011         In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event 187 also includes
delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been
determined whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event
recognizer's event type.
[001021         When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of sub
events do not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective event
recognizer 180 enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it
disregards subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event
recognizers, if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process sub
events of an ongoing touch-based gesture.
[001031         In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes metadata
183 with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery
system should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
how event recognizers interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.
1001041         In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates event
handler 190 associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are
recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 delivers event
information associated with the event to event handler 190. Activating an event handler 190
is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and
event handler 190 associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined
process.

[001051          In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub-event
delivery instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an
event handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the
event information and perform a predetermined process.
1001061          In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used in
application 136-1. For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number used in
contacts module 137, or stores a video file used in video player module 145. In some
embodiments, object updater 177 creates and updates objects used in application 136-1. For
example, object updater 176 creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a
user-interface object. GUI updater 178 updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater 178
prepares display information and sends it to graphics module 132 for display on a touch
sensitive display.
[001071          In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to data
updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments, data updater
176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single module of a
respective application 136-1 or application view 191. In other embodiments, they are
included in two or more software modules.
1001081          It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event handling
of user touches on touch-sensitive displays also applies to other forms of user inputs to
operate multifunction devices 100 with input-devices, not all of which are initiated on touch
screens. For example, mouse movement and mouse button presses, optionally coordinated
with single or multiple keyboard presses or holds; contact movements such as taps, drags,
scrolls, etc., on touch-pads; pen stylus inputs; movement of the device; oral instructions;
detected eye movements; biometric inputs; and/or any combination thereof are optionally
utilized as inputs corresponding to sub-events which define an event to be recognized.
1001091          Figure 2 illustrates a portable multifunction device 100 having a touch screen
112 in accordance with some embodiments. The touch screen optionally displays one or
more graphics within user interface (Ul) 200. In this embodiment, as well as others
described below, a user is enabled to select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture

on the graphics, for example, with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure)
or one or more styluses 203 (not drawn to scale in the figure). In some embodiments,
selection of one or more graphics occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more
graphics. In some embodiments, the gesture optionally includes one or more taps, one or
more swipes (from left to right, right to left, upward and/or downward) and/or a rolling of a
finger (from right to left, left to right, upward and/or downward) that has made contact with
device 100. In some implementations or circumstances, inadvertent contact with a graphic
does not select the graphic. For example, a swipe gesture that sweeps over an application
icon optionally does not select the corresponding application when the gesture
corresponding to selection is a tap.
1001101         Device 100 optionally also includes one or more physical buttons, such as
"home" or menu button 204. As described previously, menu button 204 is, optionally, used
to navigate to any application 136 in a set of applications that are, optionally executed on
device 100. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the menu button is implemented as a soft
key in a GUI displayed on touch screen 112.
1001111         In one embodiment, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu button 204,
push button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device, volume adjustment
button(s) 208, Subscriber Identity Module (SIMI) card slot 210, head set jack 212, and
docking/charging external port 124. Push button 206 is, optionally, used to turn the power
on/off on the device by depressing the button and holding the button in the depressed state
for a predefined time interval; to lock the device by depressing the button and releasing the
button before the predefined time interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock the device or
initiate an unlock process. In an alternative embodiment, device 100 also accepts verbal
input for activation or deactivation of some functions through microphone 113. Device 100
also, optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of
contacts on touch screen 112 and/or one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating
tactile outputs for a user of device 100.
1001121         Figure 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a

educational device (such as a child's learning toy), a gaming system, or a control device
(e.g., a home or industrial controller). Device 300 typically includes one or more processing
units (CPU's) 310, one or more network or other communications interfaces 360, memory
370, and one or more communication buses 320 for interconnecting these components.
Communication buses 320 optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that
interconnects and controls communications between system components. Device 300
includes input/output (1/0) interface 330 comprising display 340, which is typically a touch
screen display (e.g., touch screen display 112). I/O interface 330 also optionally includes a
keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 350 and touichpad 355, tactile output
generator 357 for generating tactile outputs on device 300 (e.g., similar to tactile output
generator(s) 167 described above with reference to Figure IA), sensors 359 (e.g., optical,
acceleration, proximity, touch-sensitive, and/or contact intensity sensors similar to contact
intensity sensor(s) 165 described above with reference to Figure 1A). Memory 370 includes
high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random
access solid state memory devices; and optionally includes non-volatile memory, such as
one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory
devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory 370 optionally includes
one or more storage devices remotely located from CPU(s) 310. In some embodiments,
memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures analogous to the programs,
modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of portable multifunction device 100
(Figure 1A), or a subset thereof. Furthermore, memory 370 optionally stores additional
programs, modules, and data structures not present in memory 102 of portable multifunction
device 100. For example, memory 370 of device 300 optionally stores drawing module 380,
presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation module 386, disk
authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102 of portable
multifunction device 100 (Figure I A) optionally does not store these modules.
1001131         Each of the above identified elements in Figure 3 are, optionally, stored in
one or more of the previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above identified
modules corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above. The
above identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as
separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these
modules are, optionally, combined or otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments. In

[001141          Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces ("UI") that
is, optionally, implemented on portable multifunction device 100.
[001151          Figure 4A illustrates an exemplary user interface for a menu of applications
on portable multifunction device 100 in accordance with some embodiments. Similar user
interfaces are, optionally, implemented on device 300. In some embodiments, user interface
400 includes the following elements, or a subset or superset thereof:
     .   Signal strength indicator(s) 402 for wireless communication(s), such as cellular and
         Wi-Fi signals;

     .   Battery status indicator 406;
     .   Tray 408 with icons for frequently used applications, such as:
             o   Icon 416 for telephone module 138, labeled "Phone," which optionally
                 includes an indicator 414 of the number of missed calls or voicemail
                 messages;
             o   Icon 418 for e-mail client module 140, labeled "Mail," which optionally

             o  Icon 444 for notes module 153, labeled "Notes"; and
             o  Icon 446 for a settings application or module, which provides access to
                settings for device 100 and its various applications 136.
[001161         It should be noted that the icon labels illustrated in Figure 4A are merely
exemplary. For example, icon 422 for video and music player module 152 are labeled
"Music" or "Music Player." Other labels are, optionally, used for various application icons.
In some embodiments, a label for a respective application icon includes a name of an
application corresponding to the respective application icon. In some embodiments, a label
for a particular application icon is distinct from a name of an application corresponding to
the particular application icon.
[001171         Figure 4B illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device
300, Figure 3) with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, Figure 3)
that is separate from the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Device 300 also,
optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors (e.g., one or more of sensors 357)
for detecting intensity of contacts on touch-sensitive surface 451 and/or one or more tactile
output generators 359 for generating tactile outputs for a user of device 300.
1001181         Although some of the examples which follow will be given with reference to
inputs on touch screen display 112 (where the touch sensitive surface and the display are
combined), in some embodiments, the device detects inputs on a touch-sensitive surface that
is separate from the display, as shown in Figure 4B. In some embodiments the touch
sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Figure 4B) has a primary axis (e.g., 452 in Figure 4B) that
corresponds to a primary axis (e.g., 453 in Figure 4B) on the display (e.g., 450). In
accordance with these embodiments, the device detects contacts (e.g., 460 and 462 in Figure
                                                  33

  WO 2014/200733                                                            PCT/US2014/040408
4B) with the touch-sensitive surface 451 at locations that correspond to respective locations
on the display (e.g., in Figure 4B, 460 corresponds to 468 and 462 corresponds to 470). In
this way, user inputs (e.g., contacts 460 and 462, and movements thereof) detected by the
device on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Figure 4B) are used by the device to
manipulate the user interface on the display (e.g., 450 in Figure 4B) of the multifunction
device when the touch-sensitive surface is separate from the display. It should be
understood that similar methods are, optionally, used for other user interfaces described
herein.
1001191         Additionally, while the following examples are given primarily with
reference to finger inputs (e.g., finger contacts, finger tap gestures, finger swipe gestures), it
should be understood that, in some embodiments, one or more of the finger inputs are
replaced with input from another input device (e.g., a mouse based input or stylus input).
For example, a swipe gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click (e.g., instead of a
contact) followed by movement of the cursor along the path of the swipe (e.g., instead of
movement of the contact). As another example, a tap gesture is, optionally, replaced with a
mouse click while the cursor is located over the location of the tap gesture (e.g., instead of
detection of the contact followed by ceasing to detect the contact). Similarly, when multiple
user inputs are simultaneously detected, it should be understood that multiple computer
mice are, optionally, used simultaneously, or a mouse and finger contacts are, optionally,
used simultaneously.
                  USER INTERFACES AND ASSOCIATED PROCESSES
[001201         Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces ("UI") and
associated processes that may be implemented on an electronic device with a display and a
touch-sensitive surface, such as device 300 or portable multifunction device 100.
1001211         Figures 5A-5R illustrate exemplary user interfaces for providing access to
different functionalities including navigation and search functionalities in accordance with
some embodiments. The user interfaces in these figures are used to illustrate the processes
described below, including the processes in Figures 6A-6D.
1001221         Figure 5A illustrates user interface 503 displayed on touch screen 112 of
portable multifunction device 100 (sometimes herein also called "device 100"). User

interface 503 includes a plurality of user interface objects (sometimes herein called
"affordances" or "selectable user interface objects") including application icons 501 and
tray 408 which, optionally, includes one or more selectable user interface objects. Figure 5A
further illustrates: input 502 including a contact and movement of the contact to the right
that starts away from an edge of touch screen 112, in response to which the device,
navigates from a first page of a multi-page application launch interface to a second page
(e.g., as shown in Figures 5B-5D); input 504 including a contact and movement of the
contact downward, in response to which the device displays a search interface that includes
a search input field (e.g., as shown in Figures 5E-5G); input 506 including contact at the top
edge of touch screen 112 and movement downward, in response to which the device,
optionally, displays a notification center interface (e.g., as shown in Figure 5J-5L); input
508 including contact at the right edge of touch screen 112 and movement to the right, in
response to which the device, optionally displays a multitasking interface (e.g., as shown in
Figures 5M-50); and input 510 including contact at the bottom of touch screen 112 and
movement upward, in response to which the device, optionally displays a settings interface
(e.g., as shown in Figures 5P-5R).
1001231          Figures 5B-5D illustrate an example of navigating from a first page of a
multi-page application launch interface to a second page. Figure 5B shows user interface
503 (e.g., page 1) and detection of input 502. Input 502 includes a contact and movement of
the contact to the right. Figure 5C illustrates input 502 at position 502-b and the
corresponding transition between user interface 503 (e.g., page 1) and user interface 505
(e.g., page 2). Figure 5D shows user interface 505 (e.g., page 2) with a different plurality of
application icons 501 (e.g., application icons 501-17 through 501-29) (e.g., the device
switches to a next page of a multi-page application launch interface in response to detecting
a horizontal swipe gesture that starts at a location that is away from an edge of touch screen
112).
1001241          Figures 5E-5G illustrate an example of displaying a search interface that
includes a search input field. Figure 5E shows user interface 503 and detection of input 504.
Input 504 includes a contact and movement downward. Figure 5F illustrates input 504 at
position 504-b and the corresponding transition between user interface 503 and search
interface 507, including search field 514. Figure 5G shows search interface 507 including
search field 514 and keyboard 516 (e.g., the device displays a search interface in response to
                                                   35

detecting a downward swipe gesture that starts at a location that is away from a top edge of
touch screen 112 and was detected while a first page of the multi-page application launch
interface was displayed on the display).
[001251           Figures 5H-51 illustrate another example of displaying a search interface that
includes a search input field. Figure 5H shows user interface 505 and detection of input 518.
Input 518 includes a contact (away from the top edge of touch screen 112) and movement
downward. Figure 51 shows search interface 509 including search field 514 and keyboard
516 (e.g., the device displays a search interface in response to detecting a downward swipe
gesture that starts at a location that is away from a top edge of touch screen 112 and was
detected while a second page of the multi-page application launch interface was displayed
on the display). Thus, in some embodiments, the search interface for searching documents,
applications and other content stored at device 100 is directly accessible in any of a plurality
of different pages in a multi-page application launch interface in response to detecting a
downward swipe gesture that starts at a location that is away from a top edge of touch
screen 112.
1001261           Figures 5J-5L illustrate an example of displaying a notification center
interface. Figure 5J shows user interface 503 and detection of input 506. Input 506 includes
a contact detected at the top edge of touch screen 112 and movement of the contact
downward. Figure 5K illustrates input 506 at position 506-b and the corresponding
transition between user interface 503 and notification interface 511, including events
content 520 and done affordance 522. Figure 5L shows notification interface 511 including
events content 520, email content 524, weather forecasting content 526, and done
affordance 522 (e.g., the device displays a notification center in response to detecting a
downward swipe gesture that starts at a top edge of touch screen 112).
[001271           Figures 5M-50 illustrate an example of displaying a multitasking interface.
Figure 5M shows user interface 503 and detection of input 508. Input 508 includes a
contact detected at the right edge of touch screen 112 and movement of the contact to the
left. Figure 5N illustrates input 508 at position 506-b and multitasking interface 513,
including a representation of a web browser application 528 and browser application icon
420 either of which, when activated, cause the device to display the browser application
(e.g., in a full-screen mode of operation). Figure 50 illustrates input 508 at position 506-c

and multitasking interface 515 including continuing to display the representation of a web
browser application 528 and browser application icon 420, and additionally, displaying a
representation of an email application 530, and email application icon 418 either of which,
when activated, cause the device to display the email application (e.g., in a full-screen mode
of operation). Thus, in some embodiments, the device displays a multitasking interface in
response to detecting a horizontal (e.g., leftward or rightward) swipe gesture that starts at a
vertical edge of touch screen 112). In some embodiments, the row of application icons (e.g.,
icons 420 and 418) is configured to slide horizontally on the display in response to
horizontal swipe inputs on the row of application icons. In some embodiments, the row of
application representations (e.g., representations 528 and 530) is configured to slide
horizontally on the display in response to horizontal swipe inputs on the row of application
icons.
1001281         In some embodiments, if the reduced scale representation 531 of a page of
multi-page application launch interface is activated (e.g., in response to detecting a tap
gesture at a location on touch screen 112 that corresponds to the reduced scale
representation 531 of the page of the multi-page application launch interface), the device
ceases to display the multitasking interface and redisplays the corresponding page in the
multi-page application launch interface (e.g., Figure 5M).
1001291         Figures 5P-5R illustrate an example of displaying a settings interface. Figure
5P shows user interface 503 and detection of input 510. Input 510 includes a contact
detected at the bottom edge of touch screen 112 and movement of the contact upward.
Figure 5Q illustrates input 510 at position 510-b and the corresponding transition between
user interface 503 and settings interface 517 (e.g., a control center interface), including
device icons 534 and brightness slider 536. Figure 5R shows settings interface 517
including device icons 534, brightness slider 536, music controls 538 and application icons
540 (e.g., the device displays a settings interface in response to detecting an upward swipe
gesture that starts at a bottom edge of touch screen 112).
1001301         Figures 6A-6D are flow diagrams illustrating a method 600 of providing
access to different functionalities including navigation and search functionalities in
accordance with some embodiments. Method 600 is performed at an electronic device (e.g.,
device 300, Figure 3, or portable multifunction device 100, Figure I A) with a display and a
                                                  37

  WO 2014/200733                                                          PCT/US2014/040408
touch-sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the display is a touch screen display (e.g.,
touch screen 112) and the touch-sensitive surface is on the display. In some embodiments,
the display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface. Some operations in method 600 are,
optionally, combined and/or the order of some operations is, optionally, changed.
1001311         As described below, method 600 provides an intuitive way to provide direct
access to multiple functionalities from a multi-page application launch interface. The
method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when using navigation and search
functionatities, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery
operated electronic devices, enabling a user to navigation and search faster and more
efficiently conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.
[001321         An electronic device that includes a display and a touch-sensitive surface
displays (602) a first page of a multi-page application launch interface that includes multiple
(separately displayed) pages of application icons for launching applications, where the first
page includes a first plurality of application icons.      In some embodiments, the touch
sensitive surface described herein is part of a touch screen display. In some embodiments,
the touch-sensitive surface described herein is a sub-region of a larger touch-sensitive
surface, and the "edges" of the touch-sensitive surface described below correspond to edges
of the sub-region of the larger touch-sensitive surface. For example, a device includes a
larger touch-sensitive surface that is co-incident with a display of the device and also
extends onto a bezel of the device and the "touch-sensitive surface" described herein is a
sub-region of the larger touch-sensitive device that is co-incident with the display, so that
the edges of the touch-sensitive surface also correspond to edges of the display (sometimes
called a touch screen display). In some embodiments, the one or more pages of the
application launch interface include one or more bookmark icons, widgets, folder icons
and/or other controls for controlling various functions of the device in addition to the

accordance with a determination that the first input meets next-page display criteria, where
the next-page display criteria include a criterion that is met when the first contact moves by
more than a predefined amount (e.g., 10, 20 , 30, 50, or 100 pixels) in a first predetermined
direction (e.g., right to left) on the touch-sensitive surface, the device replaces (608) display
of the first page of the multi-page application launch interface with display of a second page
of the multi-page application launch interface that includes a second plurality of application
icons that are different from (or distinct from) the first plurality of application icons. For
example, Figures 5B-5D illustrate device 100 detecting input 502 on touch screen 112 and
replacing of user interface 503 (e.g., page 1) with user interface 505 (e.g., page 2). Figure
5D further illustrates user interface 505 including a plurality of application icons 501 (e.g.,
application icons 501-17 through 501-29) that are distinct from the plurality of application
icons 501 (e.g., application icons 501-1 through 501-16) included in user interface 503
(Figure 5B).
1001351          In some embodiments, in response to detecting the first input (606), in
accordance with a determination that the first input meets notification-interface display
criteria, where the notification-interface display criteria include a criterion that is met when
the first input starts a first edge (e.g., a top) of the touch-sensitive surface, the device
displays (610) a notification interface that includes recently received notifications. In some
embodiments, the notification-interface criteria include a criterion that is met when the first
input starts proximate to the first edge of the touch-sensitive surface, such as within a
predefined distance (e.g., 0.1-1.0 mm) or a predefined number of pixels (e.g., 1-20 pixels)
of the first edge of the touch-sensitive surface. For example, Figure 5J illustrates device 100
detecting input 506, including a contact on the top edge of touch screen 112 and subsequent
downward movement of the contact. Figures 5K-5L illustrate device 100 replacing display
of user interface 503 (e.g., page 1) with display of notification interface 511.        Figure 5L
further illustrates notification interface 511 including email content 524 (e.g., providing

accordance with a determination that the first input meets multitasking-interface display
criteria, where the multitasking-interface display criteria include a criterion that is met when
the first input starts (e.g., the first contact is initially detected) at a second edge of the touch
sensitive surface that is different from the first edge of the touch-sensitive surface, the
device displays (612) a multitasking interface that includes representations of a plurality of
open applications. In some embodiments, the multitasking-interface display criteria include
a criterion that is met when the first input starts proximate to the second edge of the touch
sensitive surface, such as within a predefined distance (e.g., 0.1-1.0 mm) or a predefined
number of pixels (e.g., 1-20 pixels) of the second edge of the touch-sensitive surface. In
some embodiments, the multitasking interface can be used to switch between open
applications and/or close open applications. In some embodiments, the multitasking
interface includes a reduced scale representation of a respective page of the multipage
application launch interface (e.g., at one end of a row of representations of a plurality of
open applications) that, when selected, causes the device to display the respective page of
the multipage application launch interface. For example, Figure 5M illustrates device 100
detecting input 508, including detecting a contact on the right edge of touch screen 112 and
subsequent movement of the contact to the right on touch screen 112.                 Figures 5N-50
illustrate device 100 replacing display of user interface 503 (e.g., page 1) with display of
multitasking interface 513 in Figure 5N and display of multitasking interface 515 in Figure
50. Figure 50 further illustrates multitasking interface 513 including a plurality of open
applications (e.g., browser window 528 and email window 530).
1001371          In response to detecting the first input on the touch-sensitive surface (606), in
accordance with a determination that the first input meets search-interface display criteria,
where the search-interface display criteria include a criterion that is met when the first
contact moves by more than the predefined amount (e.g., 10, 20, 30, 50, or 100 pixels) in a
second predetermined direction (e.g., down) that is perpendicular to the first direction, the
device displays (614) a search interface that includes a search input field for inputting
search terms. For example, Figure 5E illustrates device 100 detecting input 504, including
detecting a contact and subsequent movement of the contact downward on touch screen 112
(e.g., perpendicular to the movement of input 502 shown in Figure 5B). Figures 5F-5G

with display of search interface 507, including search field 514 (e.g., sliding wallpaper and
application icons 501 downward to reveal search field 514. In some embodiments search
field is pulled out from "under" a device status bar that includes a current time and battery
status and other device status information. Figures 5H-51 illustrate a similar example.       In
Figures 5H-5I, device 100 detects input 518 and at least partially replaces display of user
interface 505 (e.g., page 2) with display of search interface 509.
1001381         In some embodiments,        displaying the search interface     includes (616)
displaying a keyboard for entering text into the search input field. In some embodiments,
the keyboard and the search input field are both displayed in response to detecting the first
input.   In some embodiments,        the keyboard    is displayed    in response to   detecting
selection/activation (e.g., with a tap gesture) of the search input field. For example, Figure
5G shows device 100 displaying search interface 507 including keyboard 516.
1001391         In some embodiments,        displaying the search interface     includes (618)
translating a set of application icons from the first page away from a respective edge of the
display in the second predefined direction, and displaying the search input field in between
a respective edge (e.g., a top edge) of the display and the application icons. For example,
Figures 5E-5G illustrate device 100 transitioning from user interface 503 to search interface
507 including translating application icons 501 downward and displaying search field 514
above them.
1001401         In some embodiments, displaying the search interface includes (620) ceasing
to display at least a subset of the application icons on the first page. In some embodiments,
all of the application icons fade out, are covered up, or are otherwise removed from the
display. In some embodiments, some of the application icons are covered by a keyboard or
other portion of the search interface, while other application icons continue to be displayed
on the display concurrently with the search interface. For example, Figures 5E-5G illustrate
device 100 transitioning from user interface 503 to search interface 507 including ceasing to
display application icons 501-13 through 501-16 in Figure 5G.
1001411         In some embodiments, in response to detecting the first input (606), the
device maintains (622) display of one or more of the application icons from the first page of
the multi-page user interface while displaying the search interface. For example, Figures

5E-5G illustrate device 100 transitioning from user interface 503 to search interface 507 and
maintaining display of application icons 501-1 through 50 1-12 in search interface 507.
1001421         In some embodiments, the multi-page application launch interface includes
(624) a fixed icon region (e.g., an application dock) that includes a plurality of application
icons, and the fixed icon region (e.g., the same fixed icon region with the same icons
contained therein) is concurrently displayed with each page of the multiple pages of
application icons.   In some embodiments, displaying the search interface in response to
detecting the first input includes ceasing to display the fixed icon region (e.g., sliding the
application dock off of the display in the second direction as the search input field is sliding
onto the display in the second direction). For example, Figures 5E-5G illustrate device 100
transitioning from user interface 503 to search interface 507. Figure 5E illustrates device
100 displaying user interface 503 including tray 408 (e.g., an application dock) and Figure
5G illustrates device 100 displaying user interface 507 and ceasing to display tray 408. In
some embodiments, tray 408 is covered when keyboard appears (e.g., slides up from a
bottom of touch screen 112).      In some embodiments, tray 408 slides down off of touch
screen 112 while search field 514 is sliding down onto touch screen 112 (e.g., from under
the device status bar that includes the current time and battery status).
1001431         In some embodiments, while displaying the search input field (626): the
device receives (628) text input in the search input field (e.g., text that corresponds to a
plurality of character key press operations or a cut and paste operation); retrieves (630)
search results that correspond to the text input; and displays (632) one or more of the
retrieved search results on the display. In some embodiments, the search results are search
results that correspond to applications and content stored on the device. In some
embodiments, the search results are search results that correspond to content stored remote
from the device (e.g., webpages or media streams that are available for streaming to the
device). In some embodiments, the search results are retrieved automatically in response to
receiving the text input. In some embodiments, the search results are retrieved in response
to detecting selection of a search execution affordance displayed in the search user interface
(e.g., a "Search" button on a keyboard used to enter the text input in the search field).     In
some embodiments, in response to detecting selection of a respective search result, the
device displays content that corresponds to the respective search result (e.g., the device

search result).
1001441          In some embodiments, in response to detecting the first input (606), in
accordance with a determination that the first input meets settings-interface display criteria,
where the settings-interface display criteria include a criterion that is met when the first
input starts (e.g., the first contact is initially detected) at a third edge of the touch-sensitive
surface that is different from the first edge of the touch-sensitive surface and the second
edge of the touch-sensitive surface, the device displays (634) a settings interface that
includes controls for changing a plurality of device settings. In some embodiments, the
settings-interface display criteria include a criterion that is met when the first input starts
proximate to the third edge of the touch-sensitive surface, such as within a predefined
distance (e.g., 0.1-1.0 mm) or a predefined number of pixels (e.g., 1-20 pixels) of the third
edge of the touch-sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the settings interface can be used
to change frequently used device settings such as screen brightness, volume, airplane mode,
and turning on/off wireless communication. For example, Figure 5P illustrates device 100
detecting input 510, including a contact on the bottom edge of touch screen 112 and
subsequent movement of the contact upward on touch screen 112. Figures 5Q-5R illustrate
device 100 at least partially replacing display of user interface 503 (e.g., page 1) with
display of settings interface 517 (e.g., a control center interface).            Figure 5R further
illustrates settings interface 517 including a plurality of controls for changing device
settings (e.g., brightness slider 536. music controls 538, and device icons 534).
1001451          In some embodiments, the search-interface display criteria include (636) an
additional criterion that is met when the first input starts (e.g., the second contact is initially
detected) away from a first edge (e.g., a top) of the touch-sensitive surface. For example, the
search-interface display criteria include at least a first criterion that is met when the contact
moves by more than the predefined amount in the first direction and a second criterion that
is met when the contact starts away from the first edge of the touch-sensitive surface. In
some embodiments, the first input is determined to start "away from" the first edge when
the first input starts (e.g., the contact in the first input is initially detected at a location that
is) more than a predefined distance away from the first edge (e.g., 0.1-1.0 mm) or more than
a predefined number of pixels away from the first edge (e.g., 1-20 pixels). In some
embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the first input meets notification

that is met when the first input starts (e.g., the first contact is initially detected) at the first
edge (e.g., a top) of the touch-sensitive surface, the device displays a notification interface
that includes recently received notifications (e.g., instant messages, e-mails, social network
messages, application status updates, etc.). In some embodiments, the notification-interface
display criteria include a criterion that is met when the first input starts proximate to the first
edge of the touch-sensitive surface, such as within a predefined distance (e.g., 0.1-1.0 mm)
or a predefined number of pixels (e.g., 1-20 pixels) of the first edge of the touch-sensitive
surface. For example, Figure 5 shows device 100 detecting input 506 starting at the top
edge of touch screen 112.       Consequently, Figures 5K-5L illustrate device 100 replacing
display of user interface 503 with notification interface 511. In a contrasting example,
Figure 5E shows device 100 detecting input 504 starting away from the top edge of touch
screen 112. Consequently, Figures 5F-5G illustrate device 100 replacing display of user
interface 503 with search interface 507.

application launch interface, the device detects (638), on the touch-sensitive surface, a
second input (e.g., finger gesture) that includes detecting a second contact (different from
the first contact) and detecting more than a predefined amount of movement (e.g., 10, 20,
30, 50, or 100 pixels) of the second contact in the second direction (e.g., downward).

within a predefined distance (e.g., 0.1-1.0 mm) or a predefined number of pixels (e.g., 1-20
pixels) of the first edge of the touch-sensitive surface. For example, in response to detecting
a first input (e.g., movement of contact 502 in Figure 5B that meets the next-page display
criteria), the device replaces the first page of the multi-page application launch user
interface with a second page of the multi-page application launch user interface as shown in
Figures 5B-5D; and after detecting the first input, the device detects a second input (e.g.,
downward movement of contact 518 that starts away from an edge of touch screen 112 and
meets search-interface display criteria), the device displays the search input interface as
shown in Figures 5H-51.

away from a respective edge of the display unit in the second predefined direction; and
enabling display of the search input field in between a respective edge of the display unit
and the application icons.
[001601          In some embodiments, enabling display of (e.g., with display enabling unit
708) the search interface includes ceasing to display at least a subset of the application icons
on the first page.
1001611          In some embodiments, processing unit 702 is further configured to, in
response to detecting (e.g., with detecting unit 704) the first input, maintain display of (e.g.,
with display enabling unit 718) one or more of the application icons from the first page of
the multi-page user interface while enabling display of (e.g., with display enabling unit 708)
the search interface.

respect to Figures 1A and 3) or application specific chips.
1001651           The operations described above with reference to Figures 6A-6D are,
optionally, implemented by components depicted in Figures 1A-i B or Figure 7. For
example, displaying operations 602 and 614, detecting operation 604, and replacing
operation 608 are, optionally, implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and
event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch
sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to
application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the
event information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact
at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface (or whether rotation of the device)
corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a user
interface, or rotation of the device from one orientation to another. When a respective
predefined event or sub-event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler
1100 associated with the detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally
uses or calls data updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the application internal state
192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to
update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear to a person having
ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be implemented based on the components
depicted in Figures lA-1B.
