                   Yersinia outer protein M (YopM) in the treatment of psoriasis
        1. Field of the invention
 5 The present invention relates to the use of Yersinia outer protein M (YopM) in the prevention
   and/or treatment of psoriasis by cutaneous, intradermal or subcutaneous administration.
       2.  Background art
   The YopM protein consists of two amino terminal helices followed by variable numbers of an
   approximately 20 amino acid leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif (12-20 LRR among different
 0 Yersinia strains), forming a horseshoe-shaped protein. The LRR, which have been implicated
   in protein-protein interactions, make up most of YopM (Fig.1).
   Besides protein-protein interactions with serum proteins such as a-thrombin and al
   antitrypsin (Hines et al., 2000; Heusipp et al., 2006) and a scaffolding function of YopM with
   two cytoplasmic kinases, RSK1 and PRK2 (McDonald et al., 2003) the molecular function of
 5 YopM during infection is only poorly understood.
   The fact that yopM mutants of Y. enterocolitica and Y. pestis cannot establish a systemic
   infection in infected mice (Trulzsch et al., 2004; Kerschen et al., 2004) indicates that YopM is
   important for full virulence and resistance to innate immunity during infection (Leung et al.,
   1990). Interestingly, Kerschen etal. showed that YopM of Y. pestis caused a global depletion
 0 of natural killer (NK) cells (Kerschen et al., 2004). In association with this NK cell depletion,
   the spleen/liver tissues of infected mice and in the same manner the macrophages/NK cells
   isolated from those tissues showed a decreased expression of several proinflammatory
   cytokines including TNF-a, IFN-y, IL-1p, IL-12, IL-15, IL-15Ra and IL-18.
   How YopM interferes with the signalling pathways of the proinflammatory cytokines is just
25 speculative and has not been investigated. Specifically, it remains elusive how YopM as a
   locally delivered, bacterial host-cell-contact dependently translocated protein can have a
   global effect on the host response (Kerschen et al., 2004).
   According to a model of Y. enterocolitica infection, YopM is translocated through the T3SS
   into the host cell cytoplasm. However, other studies also suggest an additional extracellular
30 role of YopM, like binding to the acute-phase protein al-antitrypsin, and binding of YopM to
   serum protein a-thrombin which ist supported by a humoral immune response to YopM after
   infection of mice (Benner et al., 1999, Heusipp et al., 2006; Huck et al. 1998). Furthermore,
                                                                                                   1

   an apolar secretion (7%) of YopM during in vitro infection has been described by Cheng and
   Schneewind (Cheng & Schneewind, 2000).
   Patent Application having publication number W02009/115531 reports an additional delivery
   function of YopM which is independent from the direct delivery of the effector protein by
 5 T3SS into the cytoplasm of host cells. In particular, W02009/115531 discloses Yersinia
   outer protein M (YopM), a YopM fragment or a YopM variant which are capable of auto
   penetrating the cell membrane and integrating into the cell cytosol without the requirement of
   additional factors. The use of this function for delivering a cargo molecule across the
   membrane to the cytosol of a cell is described therein. W02009/115531 further discloses
 0 that once YopM is integrated into the cell cytosol, YopM is capable of effectively
   downregulating cytokines, in particularly pro-inflammatory cytokines.
   Psoriasis is one of the most common immune-mediated chronic inflammatory skin disorders
   affecting approximately 2-3% of the population. It is considered as an incurable, life-long skin
   condition that affects all races, age groups and both sexes. The pathogenesis of psoriasis is
 5 complex and not clearly understood. Ongoing research indicates that immune T-cells appear
   to play a dominant role for the development of this disease. These cells release TNF-a, IFN
   a and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that lead to vasodilation, leukocyte migration, and
   activation of keratinocytes. This further activates dendritic cells which in turn leads to
   inflammation.
 o Psoriasis appears in a variety of forms with distinct characteristics. Typically, an individual
   has only one type of psoriasis at a time.
   Plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) is the most prevalent form of the disease. About 80
   percent of those who have psoriasis have this type. It is characterized by raised, inflamed,
   red lesions covered by a silvery white scale. It is typically found on the elbows, knees, scalp
25 and lower back.
   Guttate psoriasis is a form of psoriasis that often starts in childhood or young adulthood. This
   form of psoriasis appears as small, red, individual spots on the skin. Guttate lesions usually
   appear on the trunk and limbs. These spots are not usually as thick as plaque lesions.
   Guttate psoriasis often comes on quite suddenly. A variety of conditions can bring on an
30 attack of guttate psoriasis, including upper respiratory infections, streptococcal throat
   infections (strep throat), tonsillitis, stress and injury to the skin.
   Inverse psoriasis is found in the armpits, groin, under the breasts, and in other skin folds
   around the genitals and the buttocks. This type of psoriasis appears as bright-red lesions that
                                                                                                  2

    are smooth and shiny. Inverse psoriasis is subject to irritation from rubbing and sweating
    because of its location in skin folds and tender areas. It can be more troublesome in
    overweight people and those with deep skin folds.
    Primarily seen in adults, pustular psoriasis is characterized by white blisters of noninfectious
  5 pus (consisting of white blood cells) surrounded by red skin. It may be localized to certain
    areas of the body, such as the hands and feet, or covering most of the body. It begins with
    the reddening of the skin followed by formation of pustules and scaling.
    Erythrodermic psoriasis is a particularly inflammatory form of psoriasis that affects most of
    the body surface. The reddening and shedding of the skin are often accompanied by severe
  0 itching and pain, heart rate increase, and fluctuating body temperature.
    Erythrodermic psoriasis causes protein and fluid loss that can lead to severe illness. The
    condition may also bring on infection, pneumonia and congestive heart failure.
    Several drugs have been used in the treatment of psoriasis. The four most commonly
    prescribed systemic medications to treat psoriasis are Methotrexate, Ciclosporin, Acitretin
  5 and Hydroxycarbamide. Methotrexate, Ciclosporin and Hydroxycarbamide all work by
    suppressing the immune system, whereas Acitretin is a Vitamin A derived treatment.
    A common disadvantage (besides their side effects) of all drugs currently available for
    treating this primarily cutaneous disease is that they are only effective when given
    systemically but are largely ineffective when applied topically because of poor absorption.
.0  Systemic medications are prescription medications that affect the entire body. The systemic
    treatments that are available to treat psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are associated with
    significant short- and long-term side effects. The benefits of psoriasis clearance or
    improvement must be balanced against the risk of these side effects.
    There is therefore the need of an effective therapeutic agent useful in the prevention and/or
25  treatment of psoriasis having a good patient compliance and reduced side effects.
    It must be noted that as used herein, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the", include plural
    references unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a
    reagent" includes one or more of such different reagents and reference to "the method"
    includes reference to equivalent steps and methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art
30  that could be modified or substituted for the methods described herein. Unless otherwise
    indicated, the term "at least" preceding a series of elements is to be understood to refer to
    every element in the series. At least one includes for example, one, two, three, four, or five or

 5     3.  Description of the invention
   The present inventors have surprisingly found that Yersinia outer protein M (YopM) when
   administered via cutaneous, intradermal or subcutaneous route prevents and/or treats
   psoriasis. Even more surprisingly, it has been found by the present inventors that the
   cutaneous, intradermal, or subcutaneous routes of administration provide an improved
 0 method of prevention and/or treatment of psoriasis when compared to the intra-peritoneal
   route. Interestingly, in contrast to sub-cutaneous treatment, epicutaneously applied YopM did
   not enter systemic distribution, mainly remained in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutis, and
   couldn't be found in local lymph nodes. As sub-cutaneous injected YopM was also found in
   local lymph nodes, an epicutaneous treatment with YopM is clearly advantageous and
25 favoured to avoid unwanted side effects. The cutaneous administration route is therefore the
   preferred administration route of the present invention.
   It has been found that Yersinia outer protein M (YopM) when administered via cutaneous,
   intradermal or subcutaneous route is able to treat psoriasis in a patient affected by this
   disease. A "patient" thereby includes mammals like for example mouse, rat, cat, dog, apes
30 and humans, humans being preferred.
   In particular, the Yersinia outer protein M (YopM) is able to treat plaque psoriasis, guttate
   psoriasis, inverse psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis, arthritis psoriasis.
   In one aspect of the invention, Yersinia outer protein M (YopM) is selected from YopM of the
   species Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis or Yersinia pestis.
                                                                                                   4

   YopM is administered in a dose effective to prevent and/or treat psoriasis. The dose for
   cutaneous administration ranges from 1 Lg/cm 2 to 20mg/cm 2 , preferably 1 Lg/cm 2 to
   2 O Lg/cm 2, more preferably about 2 Lg/cm 2.
   The term "Yersinia outer protein M (YopM)" according to the invention relates to a Yersinia
 5 outer protein M. The term includes the Yersinia outer protein M full-length amino acid
   sequence, YopM fragments and YopM variants thereof. The term includes a Yersinia outer
   protein M as described in Boland A, et al. EMBO J. 1996 Oct 1 ;15(19):5191-201 ; Cornelis

   In a preferred embodiment, Yersinia outer protein M (YopM) is a Yersinia outer protein M of a
 0 Yersina strain naturally comprising a YopM encoding virulence plasmid. The term "YopM
   encoding virulence plasmid" relates to plasmid pYV or pCD1 as described to be present, for
   instance, in Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersina pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia pestis (Cornelis
   et al., Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 62:1315-1352 (1998)).
   In a further preferred embodiment, the Yersinia outer protein M (YopM) is a Yersinia outer
25 protein M selected from the species Yersinia enterolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and
   Yersinia pestis. More preferably, Yersinia outer protein M (YopM) is a Yersinia outer protein
   M selected from Yersinia enterolitica 8081 v, serotype 0:8.
   In a further embodiment of the invention, a YopM fragment is used in the prevention and
   treatment of psoriasis. In the context of the present invention, the term "YopM fragment"
30 means that the fragment is a therapeutically active fragment of the YopM full length protein.
   The term "therapeutically active" means that the fragment has the above mentioned
   therapeutically activities of YopM full length amino acid sequence protein, i.e. a fragment of
   the invention has the capability of preventing and/or treating psoriasis. Hence a "YopM
   fragment" according to the present invention is a YopM fragment that retains the property of
35 the full length YopM protein to preventing and/or treating psoriasis. In particular, a YopM
                                                                                                5

   fragment of the invention is able to treating psoriasis in the mouse model used in Example
   paragraph 5.2 below. In a particular embodiment, the fragment retains or comprises or
   consists of the "immunomodulatory domain" of the YopM full length protein or the fragment
   retains or comprises or consists of a part of the "immunomodulatory domain" of the YopM full
 5 length protein. An "immunomodulatory domain of YopM" comprises at least one leucine-rich
   repeat (LRR) of YopM, i.e. one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or eight LRRs up to 20
   LRRs. In an embodiment, the YopM fragment may also retain the property of YopM full
   length protein to allow translocation into the cytosol and/or to and/or into the nucleus of a
   target cell. Translocation of a YopM fragment into the cytosol and/or nucleus of the target cell
 0 can be permitted if the fragment of YopM retains the domain or part of the domain of the
   YopM full length protein which permits translocation. Alternatively, the translocation function
   can be performed by a "cell penetrating peptide" (CCP) which is heterologous to Yersinia.
   Preferably, the YopM fragment of the invention is able to distribute in the cells of the
   epidermis and/or dermis and/or hypodermis, and/or is able to distribute in the cells present in
 5 the epidermis and/or dermis and/or hypodermis. In particular, the YopM fragment of the
   invention is able to distribute in at least one kind amongst the cells of the epidermis and/or
   dermis and/or hypodermis, and/or is able to distribute in at least one kind amongst the cells
   present in the epidermis and/or dermis and/or hypodermis, wherein the term "distribute"
   means that the YopM fragment of the invention is able to enter in the cytosol of a cell and
 0 optionally to reach and/or optionally to enter the nucleus of said cell. The cells of the
   epidermis, dermis and/or hypodermis and/or the target cells for the prevention and/or
   treatment of psoriasis are for examples melanocytes, Langerhans' cells, Merkel's cells,
   keratinocytes, T helper cells, T suppressor cells, T killer cells, T memory cells, B cells,
   macrophages, mast cells or any other cells of the local immune system. Hence, preferably
25 the YopM fragment of the invention is able to distribute in at least one of the target cells of
   the epidermis and/or dermis and/or hypodermis, and/or is able to distribute in at least one of
   the target cells present in the epidermis and/or dermis and/or hypodermis to prevent and/or
   treat psoriasis. In addition, the YopM fragment of the invention is able to down-regulate at
   least one cytokine. A list of cytokines is disclosed below. In particular, the fragment of the
30 invention is able to down-regulating TNFa. The "YopM fragment" according to the invention
   is a fragment of the corresponding YopM full length protein of at least 100 aminoacids, more
   preferably is of at least 150 aminoacids, more preferable is of at least 150-300 aminoacids.
   In a further embodiment of the invention, a YopM variant is used in the prevention and/or
   treatment of psoriasis. In the context of the present invention the term "YopM variant"
35 includes that the variant is a therapeutically active full length YopM protein variant or a
   fragment thereof, preferably the term means that the variant has the therapeutic activities of
   full length YopM protein or fragment thereof. It is envisaged that a variant of the invention
                                                                                                 6

   has the capability of preventing and/or treating psoriasis. Hence a "YopM variant" according
   to the present invention is a YopM variant that retains the property of the full length YopM
   protein of preventing and/or treating psoriasis. In a particular embodiment, this variant retains
   or comprises or consists of the "immunomodulatory domain" of YopM full length protein or
 5 the variant retains or comprises or consists of part of the "immune-modulatory domain" of the
   YopM full length protein. An "immunomodulatory domain of YopM" comprises at least one
   leucine-rich repeat (LRR) of YopM, i.e. one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or eight LRRs up
   to 20 LRRs. The addition of further LRRs is also envisaged. Variants and fragments of said
   immunomodulatory domain are likewise envisaged. In a particular embodiment, the YopM
 0 variant may also retain the property of full length YopM protein to allow translocation into the
   cytosol and/or nucleus of a target cell. Translocation of a YopM variant into the cytosol of the
   target cell can be permitted if the variant of YopM retains the property of the protein which
   permits translocation. Alternatively, the translocation function can be performed by a "cell
   penetrating peptide" (CCP) which is heterologous to Yersinia. Such variants may include
 5 deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and substitutions selected according to general
   rules known in the art so as to have little effect on activity. For example, guidance concerning
   how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in Bowie et al.,
   (Science 247: 1306-1310 (1990)), wherein the authors indicate that there are two main
   strategies for studying the tolerance of an amino acid sequence to change. Preferably, the
 0 YopM variant of the invention is able to distribute in the cells of the epidermis and/or dermis
   and/or hypodermis, and/or is able to distribute in the cell present in the epidermis and/or
   dermis and/or hypodermis. In particular, the YopM variant of the invention is able to distribute
   in at least one kind amongst the cells of the epidermis and/or dermis and/or hypodermis,
   and/or is able to distribute in the cells present in the epidermis and/or dermis and or
25 hypodermis, wherein the term "distribute" means that the YopM variant of the invention is
   able to enter in the cytosol of a cell and optionally to reach and/or optionally to enter the
   nucleus of said cell. The cells of the epidermis, dermis and/or hypodermis are for examples
   melanocyte, Langerhans' cell, Merkel's cell, keratinocytes, T helper cells, T suppressor cells,
   T killer cells, T memory cells, B cells, macrophages, mast cells or any other cells of the local
30 immune system. Hence, the YopM variant of the invention is able to distribute in at least one
   of the target cells of the epidermis and/or dermis and/or hypodermis, and/or is able to
   distribute in at least one of the target cell present in the epidermis and/or dermis and/or
   hypodermis to prevent and/or treat psoriasis. In addition, the YopM variant of the invention is
   able to down-regulate at least one cytokine. A list of cytokines is disclosed below. In
35 particular, the variant of the invention is able to down-regulate TNFa. The term "YopM
   variant" includes the "YopM variant" as defined in patent application W02009/115531 which
   is incorporated herein by reference.
                                                                                                   7

   The invention also encompasses YopM polypeptides having a lower degree of identity but
   having sufficient similarity so as to perform one or more of the same functions performed by
   the YopM protein, fragment and variant as described herein above.
   Thus, in a further embodiment the full length YopM, YopM fragment, or YopM variant as
 5 described herein, is capable of autopenetrating the cell membrane and of integrating into the
   cell cytosol without the requirement of additional factors and is capable of downregulating
   cytokines i.e. the compounds            of the   invention comprise   in this embodiment the
   immunomodulatory domain(s) of YopM, particularly at least one leucine-rich repeat (LRR),
   i.e. one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or eight LRRs up to 20 LRRs. The addition of further
 0 LRRs is also envisaged.
   The term "cytokines" relates to soluble proteins and peptides that act as humoral regulators,
   which, either under normal or pathological conditions, modulate the functional activities of
   individual cells and tissues and also mediate interactions between cells directly and regulate
   processes taking place in the extracellular environment. The term encompasses type 1
 5 cytokines produced by Thi T-helper cells, type 2 cytokines produced by Th2 T-helper cells,
   interleukins, chemokines or interferons, e.g. IL-1 ra (antagonist), CNTF, LIF, OSM, Epo, G

   (http://www.copewith- cytokines.de). "Pro-inflammatory cytokines" are also contemplated.
   The term "proinflammatory cytokine" means an immunoregulatory cytokines that favours
   inflammation. Typically, pro-inflammatory cytokines comprise IL-1 -alpha, IL-1-beta, IL-6, and

   endothelial cells), stimulate the production of acute phase proteins, or attract inflammatory
                                                                                                   8

   cells. Preferably, the term "pro-inflammatory cytokine" relates to TNF-alpha, IL-15, IFN
   gamma, IFN-alpha, IL-1 -beta, IL-8, IL-16 and IL-22.
   The term "downregulates" or "downregulating" means that the mRNA levels of an expressed
   gene, e.g. of a cytokine gene, and/or the protein levels expressed by such mRNAs is
 5 reduced in the presence of YopM as described herein. The downregulation of mRNA and/or
   protein expressed by that mRNA in the context of the YopM of the invention can be tested
   and determined by methods known to a person skilled in the art.
   In the context of the invention the term "cutaneous administration" sometimes also referred to
   as "epicutaneous administration" (e.c.) means the application of suitable drug dosage forms
 o directly onto the skin for either local (topical) or systemic effects. According to the present
   invention, cutaneous administration is preferred. Cutaneous topical administration is likewise
   preferred. The cutaneous administration is preferably repeated in constant intervals such as
   for example every 12 hours, i.e. after 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, 60 hours etc.
   In a preferred embodiment the cutaneous administration is repeated every 24 hours (i.e.
 5 daily administration).
   Any pharmaceutical composition suitable for cutaneous administration is encompassed by
   the present invention. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions are e.g., cream, lotion, gel,
   paste, ointment, patch, spray, solution. Creams are semi-solid emulsions, that is mixtures of
   oil and water. They are divided into two types: oil-in-water (O/W) creams which are
 o composed of small droplets of oil dispersed in a continuous phase, and water-in-oil (W/O)
   creams which are composed of small droplets of water dispersed in a continuous oily phase
   - both types are specifically included into the scope of the present invention. Creams,
   lotions, gels and ointments are preferred. The aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions
   comprise in a preferred embodiment cetearyl alcohol, paraffinum liquidum, glycerol,
25 dimethicone,sodium      cetearyl   sulfate,  phenoxyethanol,    methylparaben,    ethylparaben,
   propylparabenand sodium hydroxide.
   Any pharmaceutical composition suitable for sub-cutaneous administration is encompassed
   by the present invention. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions are e.g. solutions for
   subcutaneous injection. The solution may be administered for example in a pre-filled, multi
30 dose pen that delivers the effective dose of the YopM of the invention.
   Any pharmaceutical composition suitable for intradermal administration is encompassed by
   the present invention. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for intradermal administration
   are known in the art.
                                                                                                 9

   Further non-limiting examples of dosage forms include dispersions, liquid dosage forms
   suitable for cutaneous or intradermal or subcutaneous administration such as suspensions
   (e.g. aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspensions, oil-in-water emulsions or a water-in-oil
   liquid emulsion), solutions, liquid dosage forms suitable for intradermal or subcutaneous
 5 administration to a patient.
   In a further embodiment of the invention, the active ingredient of the invention may be
   delivered   by    a  vehicle  such   as   vesicles,  biopolymers,    liposomes,   nanoparticles,
   microspheres, micelles, or virus incorporated. Biodegradable needles can also be used for
   the delivery of the YopM active ingredient via intradermal or subcutaneous administration.
 o The pharmaceutical composition can be used in the preparation of individual, single unit
   dosage forms. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can further
   comprise one or more carriers, excipients or diluents.
   The composition, shape and type of dosage forms of the invention will typically vary
   depending on their use. For example, a dosage form used in the acute treatment of psoriasis
 5 disease may contain larger amounts of the active ingredients than a dosage form used in the
   chronic treatment of the same disease.
   The pharmaceutical formulations can also be delayed release or controlled release
   formulations. YopM of the invention can be administered by delayed or controlled release
   means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

 o     5.  Examples
   To investigate whether YopM might be functional as an immune-modulator for the treatment
   of psoriasis, the murine imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis model has been utilized. In this
25 model, daily topical application of imiquimod (IMQ), a TLR7/8 ligand and potent immune
   activator, on shaven mouse back skin induces and exacerbates a psoriasis-like condition (
   (Van der Fits L, et al. (2009) Imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice is
   mediated via the IL-23/IL-17 axis. J. Immunol. 182: 5836-5845). Therefore, this model might
   serve for the analysis of pathogenic mechanisms in psoriasis-like dermatitis. Nestle and
30 Nickoloff (Nestle, F. 0., and B. J. Nickoloff. (2006) Animal models of psoriasis: a brief
   update. J. Eur. Acad.Dermatol. Venereol. 20(Suppl. 2): 24-27) defined several criteria for an
   ideal psoriasis model: 1) epidermal changes based on keratinocyte hyperproliferation and
   altered differentiation; 2) papillomatosis; 3) presence of inflammatory cells including T cells,
                                                                                                12

   DC, and neutrophils; 4) a functional role for T cells; 5) and altered vascularity. As the
   Imiquimod-induced psoriasis like skin model fulfils these criteria, it might serve for the
   analysis of pathogenic mechanisms in psoriasis-like dermatitis (Van der Fits L, et al. (2009)
   Imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice is mediated via the IL-23/IL-17
 5 axis. J. Immunol. 182: 5836-5845). For this, we applied YopM either epicutaneously (e.c.) as
   a component of a specific cream (e.c.) or by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection (every 48 h) over a
   period of two weeks to groups of mice suffering from Imiquimod-induced psoriasis.
   Furthermore,     an    additional   group  of  psoriasis-mice      was   treated  with YopM      by
   intraperitoneally injection (i.p.).

        5.1 Expression and purification of recombinant YopM in E. Coli BL21
   For the expression of recombinant YopM (rYopM), the pET24b(+) expression vector which
   also provides the coding sequence for a C-terminal 6 x His-tag has been chosen. Protein
 5 purification    was     performed     by  nickel-nitrilotriacetic   acid   (Ni-NTA)   metal-affinity
   chromatography under native conditions. After purification, fractions of highest purity were
   pooled and dialyzed in PBS or H2 0 bidest.. The protein solution was applied to a dialysis
   tube (pore size: 6-10 kDa) and dialyzed overnight in 2 I PBS or H2 0 bidest. at 40C with gentle
   stirring. After dialysis, the protein was concentrated using centrifugal filters at 500 x g and
 0 40C.    The expressed and purified        recombinant       proteins were quantified using      the
   bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Smith et al., 1985). Successful purification was confirmed by
   SDS-PAGE analysis. Proteins were separated on a 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel and
   subsequently silver stained (exemplified in Fig. 1a). Furthermore, the LPS content in elution
   fractions of recombinant YopM was determined by Limulus amebocyte lysate Toxin sensor
25 assay (exemplified in Fig. 1b, approx. 0.33 EU/mg).
        5.2 Effects of YopM on an imiquimod (IMQ)- induced murine psoriasis model
   The impact of rYopM applied topically (balmed and s.c.) and i.p. on inflammation linked to
   psoriasis-like conditions induced by imiquimod (Figure 2) was investigated.
30 Daily epicutaneous (e.c.), topical application of imiquimod (IMQ) (5% Aldara Creme
   Sachets), a TLR7/8 ligand and potent immune activator, on mouse back skin (Balb/c)
   induces and exacerbates psoriasis. After induction of psoriatic skin by IMQ, injections (i.p.
   and s.c.) of YopM (in PBS) into IMQ-treated Balb/c mice were performed every 48 h.
   Furthermore, YopM (in H2 0 bidest.) was emulsified in a cream (150 pg YopM per 1 g cream).
                                                                                                    13

   Said cream contained cetearyl alcohol, paraffinum liquidum, glycerol, dimethiconesodium
   cetearyl sulfate, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben,and sodium
   hydroxide. Mice were balmed with 200 mg YopM-containing cream (approx. 30 pg of YopM)
   every 48 h.
 5 In order to determine the beneficial effects of YopM on epidermal proliferation, abnormal
   differentiation, epidermal infiltrates consisting of CD4+ T cells, and papillomatosis induced by
   IMQ, we visually inspected the development of the psoriasis-like skin conditions. Pictures of
   the back skin of mice were taken after a period of two weeks (Fig. 3).
   Further, immunohistochemistry staining on cryosections of biopsy taken from back skin of
 0 treated mice and employing antibodies against YopM (Fig. 6) has been performed. In
   particular, the distribution of YopM in the epidermis and dermis after 48 h of application has
   been determined. YopM balmed: Epidermis (a), Dermis (b); YopM i.p. injected: Epidermis
   (c), Dermis (d); YopM s.c. injected: Epidermis (e), Dermis (f); negative control: Epidermis (g),
   Dermis (h). Actin was stained with Texas Red Phalloidin (red). DNA was stained with Draq5
 5 (blue).
   As further histological analyses of psoriatic and non psoriatic epidermis of back-skin tissue
   skin tissues was performed using a PAN Cytokeratin Antibody (green) in order to identify
   keratinocytes and to determine the beneficial effects of YopM on epidermal proliferation, and
   abnormal differentiation (Fig. 4). The epidermis of back-skin tissue sections (5 pm) was
 o stained using a PAN Cytokeratin Antibody (green). The nuclei were stained with Draq5
   (blue). Fig. 4a) is the negative control; Fig. 4b) is the IMQ-positive control; Fig. 4c) is the
   YopM intraperitoneally injected; Fig. 4d) refers to the placebo, Fig. 4e) is YopM balmed, and
   Fig. 4f) refers to the YopM subcutaneously injected.
   A further additional histological analysis of psoriatic and non psoriatic epidermis of back-skin
25 tissue sections of the treated mice was performed in order to determine the amount of
   epidermal infiltrates consisting of CD4+ T cells induced by IMQ (Fig. 5). The epidermis of
   back-skin tissue sections (5 pm) was stained using CD4+ (green) and IL17 (red) antibodies.
   The nuclei were stained with Draq5 (blue). Fig. 5a) is the negative control; Fig. 5b) refers to
   IMQ-positive control; Fig. 5c) refers to the YopM intraperitoneally injected and Fig. 5d) to the
30 YopM balmed.
   The results confirm the "self-delivering" abilities of YopM across the cutaneous barrier when
   applied epicutaneously (e.c.) as a cream (Fig. 6a), b)), and already indicated a remarkable
   dampening of overt inflammatory reactions (Fig. 3e), 4e), 5d)). Repression of disease
   symptoms was also found in the group of mice subcutaneously injected with YopM (Fig: 3f),
35 4f),  6e)    and 6f)),   whereas     no  significant phenotypic changes were observed in
                                                                                                 14

   intraperitoneally injected mice (Fig.; 3c), 4c), 5c), 6c) and 6d)). Interestingly, in contrast to
   s.c. treated mice, epicutaneously applied YopM did not enter systemic distribution, mainly
   remained in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutis, and couldn't be found in local lymph nodes.
   As s.c. injected YopM was also found in local lymph nodes, an epicutaneous treatment with
5  YopM is clearly advantageous and favoured to avoid unwanted side effects.
   These results clearly demonstrate a superior effect of the YopM-containing formulation or
   direct application of rYopM vs. control in cutaneous (e.c. and s.c.) vs. an i.p. application in
   reducing psoriasis-like conditions in a murine psoriasis model. Subsequent to cutaneous
   YopM application in the murine psoriasis model we observed nearly no detrimental epidermal
0  changes based on keratinocyte hyperproliferation, lack of papillomatosis, and depletion of
   inflammatory T cells.
