     SUBSTITUTED PYRAZOLO[1,5-a]PYRIMIDINE COMPOUNDS AS TRK KINASE
                                          INHIBITORS
[0001]          The present invention relates to novel compounds, to pharmaceutical
compositions comprising the compounds, to a process for making the compounds and to the
use of the compounds in therapy.          More particularly, it relates to certain substituted
pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine compounds        which exhibit Trk family protein tyrosine kinase
inhibition, and which are useful in the treatment of pain, inflammation, cancer, and certain
infectious diseases.
[0002]          The current treatment regimes for pain conditions utilize several classes of
compounds.      The opioids (such as morphine) have several drawbacks including emetic,
constipatory and negative respiratory effects, as well as the potential for addictions. Non
steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics (NSAIDs, such as COX-1 or COX-2 types) also have
drawbacks including insufficient efficacy in treating severe pain.         In addition, COX-1
inhibitors can cause ulcers of the mucosa. Accordingly, there is a continuing need for new
and more effective treatments for the relief of pain, especially chronic pain.
[0003]          Trk's are the high affinity receptor tyrosine kinases activated by a group of
soluble growth factors called neurotrophins (NT).         The Trk receptor family has three
members --TrkA, TrkB and TrkC. Among the neurotrophins are (i) nerve growth factor
(NGF) which activates TrkA, (ii) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NT-4/5
which activate TrkB and (iii) NT3 which activates TrkC.          Trk's are widely expressed in
neuronal tissue and are implicated in the maintenance, signaling and survival of neuronal
cells (Patapoutian, A. et al., Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 2001, 11, 272-280).
[0004]          Inhibitors of the Trk/neurotrophin pathway have been demonstrated to be
effective in numerous pre-clinical animal models of pain. For example, antagonistic NGF and
TrkA antibodies (for example, RN-624) have been shown to be efficacious in inflammatory
and neuropathic pain animal models and in human clinical trials (Woolf, C.J. et al. (1994)
Neuroscience 62,327-331; Zahn, P.K. et al. (2004) J. Pain 5, 157-163; McMahon, S. B. et
al.,  (1995) Nat. Med. 1, 774-780; Ma,     Q. P.  and Woolf, C. J. (1997) Neuroreport 8, 807
810; Shelton, D. L. et al. (2005) Pain 116, 8-16; Delafoy, L. et al. (2003) Pain 105, 489
497; Lamb, K. et al. (2003) Neurogastroenterol.Motil. 15, 355-361; Jaggar, S. I. et al.
(1999) Br. J. Anaesth. 83, 442-448).            Additionally, recent literature indicates after
inflammation, BDNF levels and TrkB signaling is increased in the dorsal root ganglion (Cho,
L. et al. Brain Research 1997, 749, 358) and several studies have show antibodies that

    WO 2010/048314                                                         PCT/US2009/061519
                                                2
decrease signaling through the BDNF/TrkB pathway inhibit neuronal hypersensitization and
the associated pain (Chang-Qi, L et al. Molecular Pain 2008, 4:27).
[00051           In addition, it has been shown that tumor cell sand tumor invading
macrophages directly stimulates TrkA located on peripheral pain fibers. Using various tumor
models in both mice and rats it was demonstrated that neutralizing NGF with a monoclonal
antibody inhibits cancer related pain to a degree similar or superior to the highest tolerated
dose of morphine. In addition, activation of the BDNF/TrkB pathway has been implicated in
numerous studies as a modulator of various types of pain including inflammatory pain
(Matayoshi, S., J. Physiol. 2005, 569:685-95), neuropathic pain (Thompson, S.W., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA 1999, 96:7714-18) and surgical pain (Li, C.-Q. et al., Molecular Pain, 2008,
4(28), 1-11).     Because TrkA and TrkB kinases may serve as a mediator of NGF driven
biological responses, inhibitors of TrkA and/or other Trk kinases may provide an effective
treatment for chronic pain states.
[0006]           Recent literature has also shown that overexpression, activation, amplification
and/or mutation of Trk's are associated with many cancers including neuroblastoma (Brodeur,
G. M., Nat. Rev. Cancer 2003, 3, 203-216), ovarian cancer (Davidson. B., et al., Clin. Cancer
Res. 2003, 9, 2248-2259), breast cancer (Kruettgen et al, Brain Pathology 2006, 16: 304
310), prostate cancer (Dionne et al, Clin. Cancer Res. 1998, 4(8): 1887-1898), pancreatic
cancer (Dang et al, Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology 2006, 21(5): 850-858),
multiple myeloma (Hu et al, Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics 2007,                  178: 1-10),
astrocytoma amd medulloblastoma (Kruettgen et al, Brain Pathology 2006, 16: 304-310)
glioma (Hansen et al, Journal of Neurochemistry 2007, 103: 259-275), melanoma (Truzzi et
al, Journal of Investigative Dermatology        2008, 128(8): 2031-2040, thyroid carcinoma
(Brzezianska et al, Neuroendocrinology Letters 2007, 28(3), 221-229.), lung adenocarcinoma
(Perez-Pinera et al, Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry 2007, 295(1&2), 19-26), large cell
neuroendocrine tumors (Marchetti et al, Human Mutation 2008, 29(5), 609-616), and
colorectal cancer (Bardelli, A., Science 2003, 300, 949). In preclinical models of cancer, Trk
inhibitors are efficacious in both inhibiting tumor growth and stopping tumor metastasis. In
particular, non-selective small molecule inhibitors of Trk A, B and C and Trk/Fc chimeras
were    efficacious   in both inhibiting     tumor growth    and stopping     tumor metastasis
(Nakagawara, A. (2001) Cancer Letters 169:107-114; Meyer, J. et al. (2007) Leukemia, 1
10; Pierottia, M.A. and Greco A., (2006) Cancer Letters 232:90-98; Eric Adriaenssens, E. et
al. Cancer Res (2008) 68:(2) 346-351) (Truzzi et al, Journal of Investigative Dermatology

    WO 2010/048314                                                          PCT/US2009/061519

2008, 128(8): 2031-2040. Therefore, an inhibitor of the Trk family of kinases is expected to
have utility in the treatment of cancer.
[00071           In addition, inhibition of the neurotrophin/Trk pathway has been shown to be
effective in treatment of pre-clinical models of inflammatory diseases.            For example,
inhibition of the neurotrophin/Trk pathway has been implicated in preclinical models of
inflammatory      lung   diseases    including   asthma   (Freund-Michel,    V;   Frossard,   N.;
Pharmacology& Therapeutics (2008), 117(1), 52-76), interstitial cystitis (Hu Vivian Y; et.
al. The Journal of Urology         (2005),    173(3),  1016-21), inflammatory bowel diseases
including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (Di Mola, F. F, et. al., Gut (2000), 46(5),
670-678) and inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Dou, Y.-C.; et. al.
Archives of Dermatological Research           (2006),   298(1),   31-37), eczema and psoriasis
(Raychaudhuri, S. P.; et. al. Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2004), 122(3), 812-819).
[0008]           The neurotrophin/Trk pathway, particularly BDNF/TrkB, has also been
implicated in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis,
Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (Sohrabji, Farida; Lewis, Danielle K. Frontiers
in Neuroendocrinology (2006), 27(4), 404-414). Modulation of the neutrophin/Trk pathway
may have utility in treatment of these and related diseases.
[0009]           The TrkA receptor is also thought to be critical to the disease process in the
infection of the parasitic infection of Typanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease) in human hosts (de
Melo-Jorge, M. et al. Cell Host & Microbe (2007), 1(4), 251-261). Thus, TrkA inhibition
my have utility in treating Chagas disease and related protozoan infections.
[0010]           Trk inhibitors may also find use in treating disease related to an imbalance of
the regulation of bone remodeling,        such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and bone
metastases.    Bone metastases are a frequent complication of cancer, occurring in up to 70
percent of patients with advanced breast or prostate cancer(1) and in approximately 15 to 30
percent of patients with carcinoma of the lung, colon, stomach, bladder, uterus, rectum,
thyroid, or kidney. Osteolytic metastases can cause severe pain, pathologic fractures, life
threatening    hypercalcemia,     spinal cord    compression,   and   other nerve-compression
syndromes. For these reasons, bone metastasis is a serious and costly complication of cancer.
Therefore, agents that can induce apoptosis of proliferating osteoblasts would be highly
advantageous.       Expression of TrkA and TrkC receptors has been observed in the bone
forming area in mouse models of bone fracture (K. Asaumi, et al., Bone (2000) 26(6) 625
633). In addition, localization of NGF was observed in almost all bone forming cells (K.

   WO 2010/048314                                                          PCT/US2009/061519
                                                 4
Asaumi, et al.). Recently, it was demonstrated that a pan-Trk inhibitor inhibits the tyrosine
signaling activated by neurotrophins binding to all three of the Trk receptors in human hFOB
osteoblasts (J. Pinski, et al., (2002) 62, 986-989). These data support the rationale for the use
of Trk inhibitors for the treatment of bone remodeling diseases, such as bone metastases in
cancer patients.
[0011]          Several classes of small molecule inhibitors of Trk kinases said to be useful
for treating pain or cancer are known (Expert Opin. Ther. Patents(2009) 19(3)).
[0012]          International Patent Application Publications WO 2006/115452 and WO
2006/087538 describe several classes of small molecules said to be inhibitors or Trk kinases
which could be useful for treating pain or cancer.
[00131          Pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine compounds are known. For example, International
Patent Application      Publication WO 2008/037477         discloses pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine
compounds bearing an alkyl, aryl or heterocyclic group at the 3-position. These compounds
are asserted to be P13K and/or mTOR Lipid Kinase inhibitors.
[0014]          International Patent Application Publication WO 2008/058126 discloses
pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine compounds bearing a phenyl group at the 3-position.              These
compounds are asserted to be Pim-kinase inhibitors.
[00151          U.S.   Publication US      2006/0094699    discloses pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine
compounds       bearing       a    -C(=O)NH-phenyl,          -C(=O)(4-methylpiperidinyl)       or
-C(=O)NMe(CH 2-trimethylpyrazolyl) group at the 3-position for use in combination therapy
with a glucocorticoid receptor agonist.
[0016]          It has now been found that certain pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine compounds
bearing an aryl or heteroaryl-substituted heterocyclic group at the 5-position and a group
having the formula NR1 C(=O)R 2 at the 3-position, wherein R1 and R 2 are as defined herein,
are inhibitors of Trk kinases, in particular inhibitors of TrkA and/or TrkB, which are useful
for treating disorders and diseases which can be treated by inhibiting TrkA and/or TrkB
kinases, such as pain, including chronic and acute pain, or cancer. Certain compounds which
are dual inhibitors of TrkA and TrkB may be useful in the treatment of multiple types of pain
including inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain, surgical pain, and pain associated with
cancer, surgery and bone fracture. Selectivity for TrkA and/or TrkB is particularly desirable
in compounds for use in treating pain.        In addition, compounds of the invention may be
useful for treating cancer, inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and certain infectious
diseases.

the assays described in Examples A and B.         The ability of compounds to act as TrkB
inhibitors may be demonstrated by the assay described in Example B.
[00241]         Compounds of Formula I are useful for treating chronic and acute pain,
including pain associated with cancer, surgery, and bone fracture. Certain compounds which
are inhibitors of TrkA and/or TrkB may be useful in the treatment of multiple types of pain
including inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain, and pain associated with cancer, surgery, and
bone fracture.
[00242]         Compounds of Formula I are also useful for treating cancers including

[002471         Compounds of Formula I may be of therapeutic value for the useful in the
treatment of bone-related diseases (such as those involving bone resorption). Examples of
bone-related diseases include metastatic bone disease, treatment-induced bone loss,
osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Paget's disease, and periodontal
disease. The osteoporosis may be attributed to (1) menopause in women, (2) aging in men or
women, (3) suboptimal bone growth during childhood and adolescence that resulted in failure
to reach peak bone mass, and/or (4) bone loss secondary to other disease conditions, eating
disorders, medications and/or medical treatments.
[00248]         Other osteolytic diseases that can be treated according to the present invention
are more localized. A particular example is metastatic tumor-induced osteolysis. In this
condition, bone cancers or bone metastases induce localized osteolysis that causes pain, bone
weakness and fractures. Such localized osteolysis also permits tumors to grow larger by
creating more space for them in the bone and releasing growth factors from the bone matrix.
Cancers presently known to cause tumor-induced osteolysis include hematological
malignancies (e.g., myeloma and lymphoma) and solid tumors (e.g., breast, prostate, lung,
renal and thyroid), all of which the present invention contemplates treating.
[00249]         As used herein, the term treatment includes prophylaxis as well as treatment of
an existing condition.
[002501         Accordingly, another aspect of this invention provides a method of treating
diseases or medical conditions in a mammal, wherein said disease or condition is treatable
with an inhibitor of TrkA and/or TrkB, comprising administering to said mammal one or
more compounds of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in an amount
effective to treat or prevent said disorder. In a particular embodiment, the invention provides
a method of treating pain, cancer, inflammation, neurodegenerative disease or Typanosoma
cruzi infection in a mammal, which comprises administering to said mammal a
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof.
[002511         In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating osteolytic
disease in a mammal, which comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutically
effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
[00252]         The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with one
or more additional drugs that work by the same or a different mechanism of action. Such
conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate

    WO 2010/048314                                                          PCT/US2009/061519
                                                  32
administration of the individual components of the treatment.            Examples include anti
inflammatory      compounds,     steroids  (e.g.,  dexamethasone,   cortisone  and fluticasone),
analgesics such as NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and ketoprofen), and
opioids (such as morphine), and chemotherapeutic agents.
[00253]          In the field of medical oncology it is normal practice to use a combination of
different forms of treatment to treat each patient with cancer. In medical oncology the other
component(s) of such conjoint treatment in addition to compositions of the present invention
may be, for example, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, signal transduction inhibitors
and/or monoclonoal antibodies.
[00254]          Accordingly,    the compounds of Formula          I may be     administered in
combination with one or more agents selected from mitotic inhibitors, alkylating agents, anti
metabolites, antisense DNA or RNA, intercalating antibiotics, growth factor inhibitors, signal
transduction inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, enzyme inhibitors, retinoid receptor modulators,
proteasome     inhibitors,   topoisomerase    inhibitors, biological response   modifiers,  anti
hormones, angiogenesis inhibitors,        cytostatic agents anti-androgens, targeted antibodies,
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and prenyl-protein transferase inhibitors.
[002551          The phrase "effective amount" means an amount of compound that, when
administered to a mammal in need of such treatment, is sufficient to (i) treat or prevent a
particular disease, condition, or disorder which can be treated with an inhibitor of TrkA
and/or TrkB, (ii) attenuate, ameliorate, or eliminate one or more symptoms of the particular
disease, condition, or disorder, or (iii) prevent or delay the onset of one or more symptoms of
the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein.
[00256]          The amount of a compound of Formula I that will correspond to such an
amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease condition
and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the mammal in need of treatment, but can
nevertheless be routinely determined by one skilled in the art.
[002571          As used herein, the term "mammal" refers to a warm-blooded animal that has
or is at risk of developing a disease described herein and includes, but is not limited to,
guinea pigs, dogs, cats, rats, mice, hamsters, and primates, including humans.
[00258]          Compounds of the invention may be administered by any convenient route,
e.g. into the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. rectally or orally), the nose, lungs, musculature or
vasculature, or transdermally or dermally.           Compounds may be administered in any
convenient administrative form, e.g. tablets, powders, capsules, solutions, dispersions,

suspensions, syrups, sprays, suppositories, gels, emulsions, patches etc. Such compositions
may contain components conventional in pharmaceutical preparations, e.g. diluents, carriers,
pH modifiers, sweeteners, bulking agents, and further active agents.                   If parenteral
administration is desired, the compositions will be sterile and in a solution or suspension
form suitable for injection or infusion.         Such compositions form a further aspect of the
invention.
[002591         According to another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical
composition, which comprises a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt thereof, as defined hereinabove. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition
includes the compound of Formula I together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or
carrier.
[00260]         According to another aspect, the present invention provides a compound of
Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in therapy, such as the
treatment of a condition treatable with an inhibitor or TrkA and/or TrkB, such as a TrkA
and/or TrkB mediated condition, such as one or more conditions described herein.
[00261]         According to a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of a
compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the treatment of a
condition that can be treated with an inhibitor of TrkA and/or TrkB, such as a TrkA and/or
TrkB mediated condition, such as a condition as defined hereinabove. In one embodiment,
the invention provides a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof, for use in the treatment of pain, cancer, inflammation, neurodegenerative disease or
Typanosoma cruzi infection.

                                            Examples
[003701        The following examples illustrate the invention. In the examples described
below, unless otherwise indicated all temperatures are set forth in degrees Celsius. Reagents
were purchased from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich Chemical Company, Lancaster,
TCI or Maybridge, and were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated.
Tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM, methylene chloride), toluene, and dioxane
were purchased from Aldrich in Sure/SealTM bottles and used as received.
[003711        The reactions set forth below were done generally under a positive pressure of
nitrogen or argon or with a drying tube (unless otherwise stated) in anhydrous solvents, and
the reaction flasks were typically fitted with rubber septa for the introduction of substrates
and reagents via syringe. Glassware was oven dried and/or heat dried.
[00372]        Column chromatography was done on a Biotage system (Manufacturer: Dyax
Corporation) having a silica gel or C-18 reverse phase column, or on a silica SepPak
cartridge (Waters).

                                       TrkA ELISA assay
[00374]         An enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) was used to assess TrkA
kinase activity in the presence of inhibitors.     Immulon 4HBX 384-well microtiter plates
(Thermo part #8755) were coated with a 0.025 mg/mL solution of poly (Glu, Ala, Tyr; 6:3:1;
Sigma P3899). Various concentrations of test compound, 2.5 nM TrkA (Invitrogen Corp.,
histidine-tagged recombinant human TrkA, cytoplasmic domain), and 500 gM ATP were
incubated for 25 minutes at ambient temperature in the coated plates while shaking. The
assay buffer consisted of 25 mM MOPS pH 7.5, 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 5 mM
MgCl 2 . The reaction mixture was removed from the plate by washing with PBS containing
0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The phosphorylated reaction product was detected using 0.2 gg/mL of
a phosphotyrosine specific monoclonal antibody (clone PY20) conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase in conjunction with the TMB Peroxidase Substrate System (KPL).           After the
addition of IM phosphoric acid, the chromogenic substrate color intensity was quantitated
via absorbance at 450 nm.       IC 50 values were calculated using either a 4 or 5-parameter
logistic curve fit.
[003751         In this assay, compounds of the invention had an average IC 50 below 1000
nM. Certain compounds had an average IC 50 below 100 nM. Table 1 provides specific IC 50
values for compounds of this invention when tested in this assay.

[00376]        Trk enzymatic selectivity was assessed using Omnia       Kinase Assay reagents
from Invitrogen Corp.      Enzyme (either TrkA or TrkB from Invitrogen Corp.) and test
compound (various concentrations) were incubated for 10 minutes at ambient temperature in
a 384-well white polypropylene plate (Nunc catalog# 267462). Omnia Tyr Peptide #4 (for
TrkA) or #5 (for TrkB), as well as ATP, were then added to the plate. Final concentrations
were as follows: 20 nM enzyme, 500 gM of ATP for TrkA assay or 1 mM ATP for TrkB
assay, 10 gM peptide substrate. The assay buffer consisted of 25 mM MOPS pH 7.5, 0.005%
(v/v) Triton X-100 and 5 mM MgCl 2 .         The production of phosphorylated peptide was
monitored continuously for 70 minutes using a Molecular Devices FlexStation                11384
microplate reader (excitation  =   360 nm; emission  = 485 nm). Initial rates were calculated
from the progress curves. IC 50 values were then calculated from these rates using either a 4
or 5-parameter logistic curve fit.

(-)sparteine (32.9, 140 mmol) in MTBE (360 mL) was cooled to -78 'C, and sec-BuLi (100
mL, 140 mmol, 1.4 M in cyclohexane) was introduced dropwise via cannula, keeping the
internal temperature under -70 'C. The resulting solution was stirred for 3 hours at -78 'C,
followed by addition of a solution of ZnCl 2 (93.4 mL, 93.4 mmol, IM in Et 2 0) drop-wise
with rapid stirring, keeping the internal temperature below -65 'C.        The resulting light
suspension was stirred at -78 'C for 30 minutes and then warmed to ambient temperature.
The resulting mixture was charged with 2-bromo-1,4-difluorobenzene (14.5 mL, 128 mmol),
followed by Pd(OAc) 2 (1.31 g, 5.8 mmol) and t-Bu 3P-HBF 4 (2.03 g, 7.0 mmol) in one

brine. The organic layer was filtered and concentrated, and the crude product was purified by
silica column chromatography, eluting with 5-10% EtOAc/hexanes to give product (R)-tert
butyl 2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate as yellow oil (23.9 g, 72% yield).
[003791         Step B:   Preparation of (R)-2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)yrrolidine:      To (R)-tert
butyl 2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate    (23.9 g, 84.4 mmol) was added 56.2
mL 4N HCl (dioxane). After stirring at ambient temperature for 2 hours, 200 mL of ether
was added and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes.        The resulting slurry was filtered,
yielding the hydrochloride salt of the product as a white solid (17.2 g). To obtain the free
base, the HCl salt product was dispersed in a mixture of EtOAc (200 mL) and NaOH solution
(100 mL, 2 N aq.)      The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with
EtOAc. The combined organic extracts were filtered and concentrated to give the desired
product as a liquid (13.2g, 85% yield).

mixture of MeOH/DCM (30 mL/30 mL) was added Zn dust (4.36 g, 66.6 mmol) [<10
micron, Aldrich] while stirring. Saturated NH 4Cl aqueous solution (30 mL) was added drop
wise to this suspension with rapid stirring. After NH 4Cl addition was complete, the reaction
mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature and stirred for another 15 minutes. The
reaction was diluted with DCM (50 mL) and filtered through a GF/F paper, rinsing the wet
cake with DCM. The organic layer of the filtrate was separated, and the aqueous layer was
extracted with DCM (2 x 50 mL). The organic layers were combined, washed with brine
(100 mL), dried over Na 2 SO 4 , and concentrated, to provide the basically pure product as a
brownish foamy solid (2.08 g, 99% yield), which was used without further purification.

a round-bottomed flask was charged tert-butyl 2-oxopyrrolidine-1-carboxylate (2.2 g, 11.9
mmol) and THF (25 mL). The mixture was cooled down to -78 'C first, followed by slow
addition of (3-fluorophenyl)magnesium bromide (17.8 mL, 17.8 mmol, 1.0 M solution in
THF) over 15 minutes.       The mixture was stirred for 3 hours, during which time the bath
temperature rose from -78 'C to -10 'C. The reaction was quenched by drop-wise addition of
IN HCl (2 mL) and warmed up to ambient temperature, followed by addition of EtOAc and
water. After separating the organic layer, the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc three
times. The combined organic layers was dried over Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated to yield the
product as a clear oil.

followed by addition of 10 mL 4N HCl (dioxane).           The reaction was stirred at ambient
temperature for 4 hours and filtered, giving the HCl salt of the desired product as a white
solid (~ 2 g). To obtain the free base product, EtOAc and saturated NaHCO 3 (aq.) solution
were added to the HCl salt of the product. After separating the organic layer, the aqueous
layer was extracted with EtOAc three times. The combined organic extracts was dried over
Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated to yield 5-(3-fluorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole (1.46g, 75%).

5-(3-fluorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole (6.1 g, 37.4 mmol) in 100 mL THF was cooled to
-78 'C, and boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (9.47 mL, 74.8 mmol) was added drop-wise
over 5 minutes. The resulting cloudy reaction mixture was stirred at -78 'C for 40 minutes.
MeLi (1.6 M in diethyl ether, 46.7 mL, 74.8 mmol) was added drop-wise over 10 minutes.
The mixture was stirred at -78 'C for another 2 hours, then warmed up to ambient
temperature overnight. For workup, water and EtOAc were added to the reaction mixture,
and the aqueous layer was acidified with HCl solution. After separating and discarding the
organic layer, the aqueous layer was basified with NaOH (6 N, aq.) to pH     = 12 and extracted
twice with EtOAc. The combined organic extracts was dried over Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated
to get a mixture of the desired product (2-(3-fluorophenyl)-2-methylpyrrolidine) and starting
material (4.3 g, 1.3:1 of the desired product:starting material, 37% yield). The crude product
was used in the next step without any further purification.
