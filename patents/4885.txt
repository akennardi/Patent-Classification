                                          ABSTRACT
An automatic injector includes a housing having a guide, a drive control mechanism, a
transmission assembly, a motor, and an energy source. The housing may further include a
cartridge cover. A drive control mechanism includes a drive screw, a cartridge carrier, a
plunger carrier and one or more control transfer instruments such as a puck or cylinder. The
drive screw interfaces and connects with the plunger carrier. The automatic injector is
configured to accept a variety of syringes as cartridges for drug delivery. The cartridges may
be ejected from the injector and safely disposed after use, making the injector a reusable
automatic injector. The reusable automatic injector may further include one or more sensors,
such as a cartridge sensor and a patient sensor. The novel incorporation of the drive control
mechanisms into the automatic injectors of the present invention enables a single motor and
transmission assembly to drive the function of multiple components, which may include the
steps of: preparation and alignment of a cartridge for injection, removal of a safety cap or
needle shield, needle injection, drug dose delivery, and syringe and/or needle retraction.
Methods of manufacture and methods of use are also disclosed.

                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]      The present invention relates to reusable automatic injection devices. More
specifically, the embodiments of the present invention relate to electro-mechanical automatic
injection devices which utilize motor-driven drive mechanisms, incorporate replaceable
injection syringes, and perform one or more of the steps of: preparation and alignment of the
syringe for injection, removal of the safety cap, needle injection and drug dose delivery, and
needle and/or syringe retraction. The present invention also relates to drive mechanisms for
reusable automatic injection devices, methods for manufacturing such devices, and their
methods of use.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]      Manually activated pre-filled cartridges are commercially available from a variety
of manufacturers, including the owner and assignee of the present invention. The owner and
assignee of the present invention has developed a syringe which offers a unique and elegant
integrated mechanism for retraction of the needle and/or syringe. Currently visual, tactile or
audible indicators are generally linked to the end of stroke or some other mechanical
mechanism and not to the end of dose. The integrated needle retraction syringe retracts the
needle into the barrel, removing it from the patient's skin, once the dose is complete.
[0004]      Pre-filled cartridges are used in the administration of drug solutions, drug
suspensions, vaccines, medicinal therapies, and any other liquid medicament by parenteral
injection. Such pre-filled cartridges include a primary drug chamber, a hypodermic needle
permanently affixed to and in fluid communication with the drug chamber, and a piston

slidably received in the drug chamber. The pistons of the pre-filled cartridges often include a
plunger sub-assembly, which may include a plunger inner and a plunger outer, to force the
liquid medicament from the needle. Pre-filled cartridges are typically prepared by
pharmaceutical companies or sterile filling contractors in a sterile filling room in which the
drug and the cartridge are brought together in a sterile manufacturing environment wherein
all components and drug solutions are isolated from microbial contamination.
[0005]       In contrast to manually activated pre-filled cartridges, automatic injection devices,
commonly known as "auto-injectors," are also available. Such auto-injectors, once triggered
by the user, use an automatic mechanism to insert a hypodermic needle into the recipient's
flesh at the injection site and force the liquid medicament out of a medicine compartment,
through the hypodermic needle, and into the recipient. In addition to automatic needle
insertion and dose delivery, some auto-injectors also incorporate retraction mechanisms to
automatically retract the needle after use. Auto-injectors have proven particularly useful in
allowing the medically untrained user to administer a parenteral injection, and can provide
both psychological and physical advantages to patients.
[0006]       Patients needing to inject medication for chronic disease management have used
auto-injectors since the first reusable auto-injector was introduced in the 1990s. An auto
injector provides protection for the primary container, generally a pre-filled syringe, and
offers an easy way for automatic injection of medication. These devices offer increased
convenience and autonomy for patients as well as providing a competitive advantage to the
pharmaceutical partner through device differentiation and increased sales through compliance
of the patient to their therapy. Auto-injectors may also be beneficial in delivering large
volumes (up to 1mL currently) and viscous drugs. Auto-injectors also work to prevent needle
stick injuries by housing the needle within a chamber, inserting the needle into the patient for
drug introduction, then retracting the needle back into the housing utilizing, for example,
reverse drive mechanisms.
[0007]       Some auto-injectors have been designed to accept commercially available,
manually activated pre-filled cartridges. Such configurations may be made in the form of
cartridges for auto-injectors (e.g., reusable auto-injectors) or single-use auto-injectors. The
syringes developed and manufactured by the owner and assignee of the present invention
offer unique and elegant integrated retraction mechanism for needle safety. A number of

different pre-filled syringes and cartridge configurations may be utilized in such auto
injectors, including those sold by the assignee and owner of the present invention under the
trade name "Unifill" and covered by one or more of the following: U.S. Patent Nos.

                           BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0008]       The present invention relates to novel automatic injection devices for drug
delivery with incorporate a multifunctional drive control mechanism. The components of the
automatic injection devices are configured for repeatable functionality. Accordingly, the
automatic injectors of the present invention may be single-use devices but are, preferably,
utilized as reusable automatic injectors. Accordingly, a number of single-use syringes may
be employed as cartridges with the automatic injectors of the present invention. The reusable
auto-injectors of the present invention could be adapted for use with any type of retractable or
safety syringe, but for simplicity, the invention is described when using a syringe similar to
those sold by the owner and assignee of the present invention under the trade name "Unifill."
The automatic injectors are also designed to accept a variety of syringes as drug-container
cartridges.
[0009]       The novel incorporation of the drive control mechanisms into the automatic
injectors of the present invention enables a single motor and gear to drive the function of
multiple components, which may include the steps of: preparation and alignment of a
cartridge for injection, needle injection, drug dose delivery, and syringe and/or needle
retraction. Optionally, the automatic injector may also perform the step of, before needle
injection, removal of a safety cap or needle shield from the cartridge. Furthermore,
optionally, the automatic injector may be configured to adjust the dose volume, such as by
expending a portion of the drug dosage to a reservoir, prior to needle injection and drug dose
delivery into a user. Utilizing a single drive control mechanism to control multiple device
stages greatly simplifies the functionality of the automatic injector and improves the
reliability, operation, and manufacturing cost of the reusable automatic injector.

Additionally, the novel automatic injectors of the present invention are capable of repeatedly
performing these tasks, making them reusable automatic injectors. Embodiments of the novel
automatic injectors of the present invention may be capable of accomplishing all of these
advantages while also maintaining an appearance and size comparable to existing products in
the market. The simplicity and reusability of these automatic injectors facilitate ease-of-use
and patient acceptance, both critical metrics for overall patient care and at-home use of the
automatic injectors.
[0010]      In one embodiment, the present invention provides a drive control mechanism for
an automatic injector which includes a drive screw, a cartridge carrier, a plunger carrier, and
one or more control transfer instruments. A motor with a gear train, including one or more
gears, connected, either directly or indirectly, to the drive screw may be used to control the
motion of the cartridge carrier and the plunger carrier.
[0011]      The control transfer instruments may be, for example, a spherical ball, a cylinder,
a disc or chip, or similar instruments that may freely move between the other components of
the drive control mechanism. The control transfer instrument may preferably be cylinders
(e.g., "pucks"). For simplicity, the control transfer instruments may be referred to herein as
the "puck" or "pucks," though the actual shape and dimensions may vary from that of
standard cylindrical objects. The transfer instrument functions to control the action of the
components of the drive control mechanism by locking between two objects and causing
them to move, or stay in a fixed position, as one unit. The transfer instrument may be
retained in an annular space within, or between, the components of the drive control
mechanism. In an embodiment, the plunger carrier contains a plunger carrier recess, while
the cartridge carrier contains a channel, within both of which the transfer instrument may
movably reside to control the operation of the drive control mechanism. Optionally,
additional components may be utilized to retain the transfer instrument in a position from
which it can control the control transfer function. For example, a guide having a guide recess
may be employed for this purpose.
[0012]      In an embodiment, the drive control mechanism for an automatic injector includes
a drive screw, a cartridge carrier, a plunger carrier, a guide, and two control transfer
instruments. The control transfer instruments may be a number of different shapes including,
for example, pucks. The transfer instruments may be retained in annular spaces within, or

between, the components of the drive control mechanism. The plunger carrier contains
plunger carrier recesses, the cartridge carrier contains channels, and the guide has guide
recesses for each transfer control instrument to interact with to control the operation of the
drive control mechanism.
[0013]      For example, in an initial stage, the components of the drive control mechanism
are aligned such that the one or more control transfer instruments are allowed to freely pass
between the guide recess and the plunger carrier recess through the channel of the cartridge
carrier. When there are two or more control transfer instruments, there are corresponding
guide recesses, channels, and plunger carrier recesses for each control transfer instrument.
The plunger carrier recess and the guide recess can be a number of different configurations.
In one embodiment of the present invention, the plunger carrier recess and the guide recess
are symmetrical carve-outs of their respective components. Each of the recesses may be, for
example, ramped to force the motion of the transfer instrument "out" into the guide recess or
"in" into the plunger carrier recess. As the drive screw is caused to move axially, by
operation of the motor and interaction with a gear or transmission assembly, the transfer
instrument may be forced out from the plunger carrier recess into position between the guide
recess and the channel of the cartridge carrier. At another stage of operation the guide recess
may align with the channel of the cartridge carrier. By interaction of other aspects of the
guide and the cartridge carrier, as described further below, the transfer instrument may be
caused to move out of the guide recess and into position between the plunger carrier recess
and the channel of the cartridge carrier. This alignment may cause the plunger carrier and the
cartridge carrier to move as one unified unit. While the plunger carrier and the cartridge
carrier are movable objects, the guide remains a fixed object throughout the operation of the
drive control mechanism.
[0014]      In another embodiment, the present invention provides an automatic injector
which includes a housing having a guide, a drive control mechanism, a transmission
assembly, a motor, and an energy source. The automatic injector may also contain certain
standard features such as, for example, a microprocessor or similar control system which are
known to an ordinarily skilled artisan. The housing may further include a cartridge cover.
The drive control mechanism may include a number of components, including a drive screw,
a cartridge carrier, a plunger carrier, and one or more control transfer instruments. The

cartridge carrier interfaces and connects with a cartridge, such as a syringe, which holds a
drug treatment for delivery to a patient. More particularly, a cartridge connection feature of
the cartridge carrier connects with a corresponding aspect of the cartridge. This can be, for
example, a tongue-and-groove connection as is known in the art. The cartridge connection
feature and cartridge carrier may be separate components which are connected or are one
unified component. The automatic injector may further comprise certain optional components
such as, for example, a cartridge sensor and a patient sensor, which are described further
below.
[0015]       The motor may be an electric motor that is coupled with and powered by the
energy source. The energy source may be, for example, a disposable battery or a
rechargeable battery. The motor, drive control mechanism, and other components of the
automatic injector may be employed to provide the force required for multiple injections over
an extended period. A commercially available electric motor with both forward and reverse
output shaft rotation may be used with a programmable controller, such as a microprocessor,
to control the stages of operation required to perform the injection of the medicament and the
retraction of the needle and/or syringe.
[0016]      The reusable auto-injector could be adapted for use with any type of retractable or
safety syringe, but for simplicity, the invention is described when using a syringe similar to
those sold by the owner and assignee of the present invention under the trade name "Unifill."
Because the components of the automatic injector and the drive control mechanism are able
to repeatedly load, inject, and eject drug cartridges for injection of drug treatments to a
patient, they are considered reusable automatic injectors.
[0017]      In another embodiment, the present invention relates to the method for
manufacturing automatic injectors. The method includes the steps of assembling a drive
control mechanism which includes a drive screw, a plunger carrier, a cartridge carrier, and
one or more control transfer instruments. The drive control mechanism may further include a
guide having one or more guide recesses, one or more recess on the plunger carrier, and one
or more channels within the cartridge carrier. The one or more control transfer instruments
may be, for example, a spherical ball, a cylinder, a disc or chip, or similar instruments that
may freely move between the other components of the drive control mechanism, but are
preferably cylindrical pucks. These components are sized and configured such that the

control transfer instrument is retained within the drive control mechanism and the guide. For
example, the cartridge carrier may be a thin object having rectangular bores through it as
channels. The transfer instruments may reside within the channels, but would be prevented
from moving laterally along the axial plane of the carrier because they are retained on all four
sides. The dimensions of the transfer instruments are such that the transfer instruments are
always removably engaged with two components of the drive control mechanism and/or
guide simultaneously. The method further includes the step of attaching a guide and a
housing to the drive control mechanism. The method may further include the steps of
attaching one or more of: an energy source, a motor, a transmission assembly, and a control
system such as a microprocessor, wherein the transmission assembly is made to contact the
drive screw. An injector or cartridge cover may also be attached to the automatic injector to
facilitate loading and ejection of the cartridges.
[0018]       In yet another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of use for an
automatic injector. The method includes the steps of: inserting a cartridge into a cartridge
carrier contained in a housing of the automatic injector and activating the automatic injector
to initiate, optionally, one or more of: removal of a needle shield, injection of a needle into a
patient, delivery of drug through the needle to the patient, retraction of the needle from the
patient into the housing, and removal of the cartridge from the cartridge carrier. Furthermore,
optionally, the method of use may include the step of expending a portion of the drug dosage
to a reservoir or to the environment, prior to needle injection and drug dose delivery into a
user, in order to reduce or adjust drug volume. The method may further include the steps of
opening a cartridge cover to access an interior of the automatic injector prior to the insertion
of a cartridge into the cartridge carrier, and the step of closing the cartridge cover after the
cartridge has been loaded into the cartridge carrier. The method may similarly include the
step of opening the cartridge cover to access an interior of the automatic injector after the
retraction of the needle to remove the used cartridge. The user may optionally reattach the
needle shield to the cartridge after the syringe has been used (i.e., drug delivery has
completed). After the used syringe has been removed from the cartridge carrier of the
automatic injector, the automatic injector is reset and ready to accept another cartridge.
[0019]       The embodiments shown and detailed herein disclose only a few possible
variations of the present invention; other similar variations are contemplated and incorporated

within the breadth of this disclosure. As would be readily appreciated by an ordinarily skilled
artisan, a number of parameters, shapes, and dimensions described above may be modified
while remaining within the breadth and scope of the present invention.
[0020]       An automatic injector is adapted to receive a cartridge that includes a barrel, a
needle, and a plunger assembly including a plunger seal. The cartridge defines a longitudinal
axis. The automatic injector includes a housing, a cartridge carrier, and a plunger carrier.
The cartridge carrier is adapted to receive at least a portion of the cartridge. The cartridge
carrier is disposed for movement relative to the housing in a direction parallel to the
longitudinal axis of the cartridge. The plunger carrier is disposed for movement relative to
the cartridge carrier. The plunger carrier is disposed to confront and impart movement at
least a portion of the plunger assembly. At least one transfer instruments is disposed to
selectively couple the cartridge carrier to the plunger carrier for movement therewith. An
elongated drive device is coupled to the plunger carrier. The elongated drive device is
disposed to provide movement of the plunger carrier in a direction parallel to the longitudinal
axis of the cartridge.
[0021]       A method of operating an automatic injector to inject a fluid from a cartridge
includes disposing the cartridge in the automatic injector with at least a portion of a barrel
disposed within a cartridge carrier, and a plunger assembly disposed for confrontation with a
plunger carrier, a needle end of the cartridge defining a distal end of the automatic injector
and the opposite end of the cartridge defining a proximal end of the automatic injector,
coupling the cartridge carrier to the plunger carrier, utilizing a single drive mechanism to
move the plunger carrier and the cartridge carrier to advance the cartridge in an axial
direction toward the distal end, decoupling the cartridge carrier from the plunger carrier,
utilizing the drive mechanism to move the plunger carrier in the axial direction toward the
distal end to dispense the fluid, and retracting the plunger carrier in an axial direction toward
the proximal end.
[0022]       A method of operating an automatic injector includes disposing a first cartridge in
a housing of the automatic injector, actuating the automatic injector to dispense fluid from the
first cartridge, removing the first cartridge from the housing, disposing a second cartridge in
the housing, and actuating the automatic injector to dispense fluid from the second cartridge.

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0050]      The embodiments of the present invention relate to automatic injection devices for
drug delivery. The components of the automatic injection devices are configured for
repeatable functionality, and the automatic injectors are designed to accept a variety of drug
containers, such as syringes, as cartridges. For the purposes of this disclosure, the term
"cartridge" will refer generically to both syringes, which include a plunger rod for

administration of a medicament from a barrel by movement of a plunger seal, and
medicament containing barrels that do not include a plunger rod for activation of a plunger
seal.
[0051]       The automatic injectors of the present invention may be single-use devices but
are, preferably, utilized as reusable automatic injectors. More specifically, the embodiments
of the present invention relate to electro-mechanical automatic injection devices which utilize
motor-driven drive mechanisms, incorporate replaceable injection syringes, and perform one
or more of the steps of: preparation and alignment of a cartridge for injection, removal of a
safety cap or needle shield, needle injection, drug dose delivery, and syringe and/or needle
retraction. The novel incorporation of the drive control mechanisms into the automatic
injectors of the present invention enables a single motor and transmission assembly to drive
the function of multiple components, thereby simplifying the functionality of the device and
improving the reliability, operation, and manufacturing cost of the reusable automatic
injector. The present invention also relates to drive mechanisms for automatic injection
devices, methods for manufacturing such devices, and their methods of use. Furthermore,
optionally, the automatic injector may be configured to adjust the dose volume, such as by
expending a portion of the drug dosage to a reservoir, prior to needle injection and drug dose
delivery into a user.
[0052]       As used herein to describe the drive mechanisms, automatic injectors, cartridges,
or any of the relative positions of the components of the present invention, the terms "axial"
or "axially" refer generally to a longitudinal axis "A" around which reusable automatic
injector is preferably positioned although not necessarily symmetrically there-around. The
terms "proximal," "rear," "rearward," "back," or "backward" refer generally to an axial
direction in the direction of the plunger rod or transmission assembly. The terms "distal,"
"front," "frontward," "depressed," or "forward" refer generally to an axial direction in the
direction of the needle or rigid needle shield. The term "laterally" refers to a direction in a
plane normal to a longitudinal axis "A." The term "radial" refers generally to a direction
normal to axis A.
[0053]       As used herein, the term "glass" should be understood to include other similarly
non-reactive materials suitable for use in a pharmaceutical grade application that would
normally require glass. The term "plastic" may include both thermoplastic and thermosetting

polymers. Thermoplastic polymers can be re-softened to their original condition by heat;
thermosetting polymers cannot. As used herein, the term "plastic" refers primarily to
moldable thermoplastic polymers such as, for example, polyethylene and polypropylene, or
an acrylic resin, that also typically contain other ingredients such as curatives, fillers,
reinforcing agents, colorants, and/or plasticizers, etc., and that can be formed or molded
under heat and pressure. As used herein, the term "plastic" does not include either glass or
elastomers that are approved for use in applications where they are in direct contact with
therapeutic liquids that can interact with plastic or that can be degraded by substituents that
could otherwise enter the liquid from plastic. The term "elastomer," "elastomeric" or
"elastomeric material" refers primarily to cross-linked thermosetting rubbery polymers that
are more easily deformable than plastics but that are approved for use with pharmaceutical
grade fluids and are not readily susceptible to leaching or gas migration.
[0054]       "Fluid" refers primarily to liquids, but can also include suspensions of solids
dispersed in liquids, and gasses dissolved in or otherwise present together within liquids
inside the fluid-containing portions of cartridges. The terms "drug," "medicine," and
"medicament" are used to refer to any substance that is administered from a cartridge through
a needle or cannula, and is not limited to pharmaceutical substances, but may include, for
example, vitamins or minerals.
[0055]       As used herein, the terms "automatic injector" and "auto-injector" are meant to
refer to the same reusable devices, which may also be referred to by the acronym "RAT".
"Puck" is used herein to describe a component of the drive control mechanism, but the term
is not limited to such a shape and, in one or more embodiments of the present invention, may
be a spherical ball, cylinder, conoid, or other functional shape that can be caused to move
freely when acted upon by one or more adjacent surface(s).
[0056]       Turning first to FIGS. 1 and 2, there is shown an automatic injector 50 according
to the invention. The automatic injector 50 includes a housing 52 adapted to receive and
support a syringe or cartridge 54 for injection, as well as various components of the injection
system. A variety of cartridges 54 may be utilized in the reusable automatic injector 50 of the
present invention, including those having automatic retraction features. For example, a safety
syringe with integrated needle retraction may be used with the reusable automatic injector 50.
One example of such a cartridge 54 in the form of a safety syringe is illustrated in FIG. 2 and

in FIGS. 11A-15B, and includes a barrel 56, a needle 58, a rigid needle shield 60, and a
plunger assembly 62 including a plunger seal 64, a plunger rod 66, and a plunger head 68.
The cartridge 54 includes a longitudinal axis A. In the illustrated embodiment, the barrel 56
of the cartridge 54 includes an enlarged finger flange 70, such as is commonly used in
standardized barrel 56 designs. The cartridge 54 can be pre-filled with a drug or filled at
time-of-use by a user, that is, just prior to placement within the reusable automatic injector
50. Alternate embodiments of cartridges 54 may include, by way of example only, cartridges
54 having a barrel 56 sealed by a plunger seal 64, but having no plunger rod 66 (see, e.g.,
FIG. 21 and explanation below).
[0057]       The housing 52 may optionally be covered by a cartridge cover 72, which may
likewise be of any appropriate design. In order to allow the user to view the status of the
automatic injector 50, the cartridge cover 72 may be entirely or partially translucent or
transparent. Alternately, it may be entirely or partially opaque. The cartridge cover 72 of
FIGS. 1 and 2 includes a window 74 that is disposed substantially adjacent the barrel 56 of a
supported cartridge 54, allowing the user to view the status of drug delivery. Optionally, the
window 74 or portion of the cartridge cover 72 adjacent the window may have dose
indication markings to allow the user to identify the drug dose volume contained in the
cartridge 54 prior to, during, and/or after drug delivery.
[0058]       In the illustrated embodiment, the cartridge cover 72 is hinged to the housing 52,
although an alternate arrangement may be provided. For example, the either the cartridge
cover 72 or the housing 52 may include mating protrusions and the other of the cartridge
cover 72 or the housing 52 may include detents for receiving the protrusions. Such
protrusions and detents may be provided alone, or in conjunction with a hinge arrangement,
and may be provided at any appropriate location between the housing 52 and the cartridge
cover 72. In one such embodiment, as shown in FIG. 3, a distal detent 76 with mating
protrusion 78 may be disposed at or substantially near the distal end of the automatic injector
50 to ensure that the distal end of the cartridge cover 72 is held rigidly to the housing 52, and
provide secure closure along substantially the entire contacting surface between the cartridge
cover 72 and the housing 52. While the housing 52 and cartridge cover 72 may be formed as
separate components, the cartridge cover 72 and the housing 52 may alternatively be formed
as a single unit, coupled by a so-called living hinge (not illustrated).

[0059]        The automatic injector 50 may further include a casing body 80, which provides a
smooth outer appearance to the housing 52. The casing body 80 may be formed as a separate
structure from the housing 52 that presents an internal chamber that receives the housing 52,
or the housing 52 and the casing body 80 may be formed as a single unit. It will be
appreciated that, when the automatic injector 50 includes a cartridge cover 72, the cartridge
cover 72 may be coupled to the housing 52 by way of the casing body 80. That is, the
cartridge cover 72 may be coupled to the casing body 80, which receives the housing 52. As
with the housing 52 and the cartridge cover 72, the casing body 80 and the cartridge cover 72
may be formed separately, or as a single unit, connected, for example, by a living hinge (not
illustrated).
[0060]        In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the cartridge cover 72 is held in a
closed position over the housing 52 by a selectively actuable latch 86. In the illustrated
embodiment, the cartridge cover 72 includes a protrusion 88 that is received by a recess 90 in
the housing 52. A latch release 92 may be slid to the side or depressed to allow the cartridge
cover 72 to be latched to or unlatched from the housing 52.
[0061]        The automatic injector 50 may further include a user interface 96 with features
such as a release actuator 98 that may be depressed to initiate operation of the automatic
injector 50 or selection of other operative features. Other operative features may include, by
way of example only, an identification of the adjustments based upon the needle 58 utilized
in the cartridge 54, or volume of medicament carried in the cartridge 54 and the volume to be
dispensed, as will be explained in greater detail below. The automatic injector 50 may
further include one or more lights 100, or the like, indicating the state of operation of the
automatic injector 50.
[0062]        The housing 52 may be of any appropriate design, and may be formed as a unitary
structure, or it may include a plurality of components. Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, the
housing 52 is an elongated frame 102 adapted to removably support a cartridge 54 along the
upper surface or along structure associated with the housing 52. The housing 52 may further
support one or more of the structures associated with the operation or usage of the automatic
injector 50. More specifically, in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5, the housing 52
additionally supports a drive control mechanism 104 that controls movement of components
of the cartridge 54 within the housing 52. The drive control mechanism 104, which will be

described in greater detail below, may be operated by motor 106 powered by an energy
source 108. While the motor 106 and energy source 108 are illustrated as being supported on
the housing 52, they could alternately be otherwise supported, for example, within a casing
body 80. The energy source 108 may be in a number of different configurations and a variety
of sources including, for example, disposable batteries, or rechargeable and reusable
batteries. A transmission assembly 110 couples the rotary motion of the motor 106 to the
drive control mechanism 104.
[0063]       The reusable automatic injector 50 may also contain certain standard features such
as, for example, one or more control systems, such as a microprocessor (not specifically
illustrated), may be used to control the timing and parameters of operation of the automatic
injector 50. Operation of the control systems may optionally be based upon feedback from
one or more sensors, or input received from the user by way of the user interface 96. For
example, the automatic injector 50 may include features that are associated with the closure
of the cartridge cover 72 to the housing 52, or the position of the latch release 92. In order to
minimize the opportunity for inadvertent actuation of the automatic injector 50, an optional
sensor may be utilized to signal whether the cartridge cover 72 is open or closed, allowing a
control system associated with the automatic injector 50 to prevent actuation if the cartridge
cover 72 is not closed. Similarly, structure of the automatic injector 50 or the control system
may be designed to prevent opening of the cartridge cover 72, that is, movement of the latch
release 92, unless the internal components are in one or more particular positions.
[0064]       The microprocessor may be configured to receive feedback from the individual
sensors, and to cause certain activity of the motor 106 and transmission assembly 110 based
on varying feedback from one or more sensors. The attached figures exclude such control
systems, as a number of different systems or configurations may be employed, but a control
system should be understood as being optionally included. The control system, as would
readily be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art, would accept some user activity
at one or more system controls and interpret such activity by the user to activate the features
of the reusable automatic injector 50. In at least one embodiment, the control system is a
microprocessor located at the proximal end of the automatic injector 50 adjacent the
transmission assembly 110 and the user interface 96 (shown in FIG. 2-10).

[0065]       According to an aspect of embodiments of the invention, the automatic injector 50
provides predicable movement for actuation of a loaded cartridge 54. In some embodiments,
the automatic injector 50 provides repeatable movement, such that the automatic injector 50
may be utilized repeatedly with a plurality of cartridges 54. In order to inject a patient, the
automatic injector 50 proceeds through a plurality of stages that include movement of the
needle 58 into a target tissue, and administration of an injection by movement of the plunger
seal 64.
[0066]       In order to provide longitudinal movement of components of the cartridge 54
relative to the housing 52, the housing 52 supports the drive control mechanism 104 that
interfaces with the motor 106 via the transmission assembly 110. The transmission assembly
110 may have a number of configurations which enable it to transfer motion and energy from
the motor 106 to the drive control mechanism 104. An exemplary transmission assembly 110
is shown in greater detail in FIGS. 5-8. FIGS. 7-8 show the components of the drive control
mechanism 104 and transmission assembly 110 illustrated in the isometric views of FIGS. 5
6 from top and bottom viewing angles. The transmission assembly 110 includes a gear train
112 that transmits rotary motion from the motor 106 to an elongated drive device, here, a
drive screw 114, that interfaces with the drive control mechanism 104. The elongated drive
device, here, the drive screw 114, is disposed to impart movement to at least a portion of the
plunger assembly 62 by way of the drive control mechanism 104. The drive control
mechanism 104 will be described in greater detail below.
[0067]       It will be appreciated that the gear train 112 may have a number of configurations
which enable it to transfer motion and energy from the motor 106 to the drive screw 114. For
example, the gear train 112 may be a simple gear or a pair of bevel gears that transfer motion
from a motor 106 to a drive screw 114. Referring to FIGS. 5-8, in particular, in at least one
embodiment of the present invention, the transmission assembly 110 includes a pinion gear
116 connected to the motor 106, a compound gear 118, and a drive gear 120. The compound
gear 118 may have a primary gear surface 122 which engages the pinion gear 116, and a
secondary gear surface 124 which engages the drive gear 120. The drive gear 120 is
connected to the drive screw 114. It will be appreciated that as the motor 106 rotates the
pinion gear 116 in a clockwise direction, for example, the teeth of the pinion gear 116 engage
the teeth of primary gear surface 122 of the compound gear 118, rotating the compound gear

118 in a counterclockwise direction. As a result, the teeth of secondary gear surface 124
engage with the teeth of the drive gear 120 to rotate the drive gear 120, as well as the
connected drive screw 114 in a clockwise direction.
[0068]       This configuration of the transmission assembly 110 enables motion of the motor
106 to control motion of the drive screw 114 in a manner which minimizes the internal
volume of the automatic injector 50 because both the motor 106 and drive screw 114 can be
positioned in an axial alignment. As would be readily appreciated by a skilled artisan,
motion of the drive screw 114 by the transmission assembly 110 is caused by the interaction
between the teeth of the gears of the transmission assembly 110. The teeth of one or more of
these gears may be radial to the center point of each gear, commonly referred to as "spur
gears," or they be a number of other gear types known to one having ordinary skill in the art.
[0069]       An exemplary drive control mechanism 104 is shown in more detail in FIGS. 6-9.
The drive control mechanism 104 includes a cartridge carrier 126, a plunger carrier 138
disposed to provide longitudinal movement relative to the cartridge carrier 126, and a transfer
instrument 150 disposed to control relative movement between the plunger carrier 138 and
the cartridge carrier 126.
[0070]       The cartridge carrier 126 includes an elongated frame 128 having a cartridge
connection feature 130. In the illustrated embodiment, the elongated frame 128 includes a
pair of rails 132 with the cartridge connection feature 130 disposed at a distal end thereof
The cartridge connection feature 130 is adapted to interface with and support a proximal end
of the barrel 56 of the cartridge 54. In the illustrated embodiment, the cartridge connection
feature 130 includes an internal channel 134 adapted to receive the enlarged finger flange 70
of the cartridge 54. The cartridge connection feature 130 may include, for example, a tongue
and-groove connection or any other removably engaging connection feature known in the art.
It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that an alternate coupling may be provided at
the illustrated or an alternate position, so long as the movement of the cartridge carrier 126 in
the proximal or distal direction results in a corresponding movement of the barrel 56 of the
cartridge 54.
[0071]       In order to provide for movement of the cartridge 54 to facilitate, for example,
insertion of the needle 58 into target tissue, the cartridge carrier 126 is mounted for axial
movement relative to the housing 52. In the illustrated embodiment, the housing 52 includes

a pair of longitudinally extending rails 136 along which the elongated frame 128 of the
cartridge carrier 126 ride. It will be appreciated, however, that the relative axial movement
may be facilitated by any appropriate structural arrangement. In this way, during one or more
stages of the operation of the automatic injector 50, such as the insertion and removal of a
needle 58 from target tissue, the cartridge carrier 126 may move the barrel 56 of the loaded
cartridge 54 in the proximal or distal direction relative to the housing 52.
[0072]       To allow for administration of a medicament, the drive control mechanism 104
provides for the longitudinal movement of the plunger seal 64 within the barrel 56 of the
cartridge 54. In the illustrated embodiment, the drive control mechanism 104 includes a
plunger carrier 138 that receives the plunger head 68 connected to the plunger rod 66. The
illustrated plunger carrier 138 includes an interface feature 140 that confronts at least a
portion of a proximal end of the plunger assembly 62, here, the plunger head 68. In this way,
movement of the plunger carrier 138 in the distal direction causes the plunger head 68 and the
plunger rod 66 causes the plunger seal 64 to move in a distal direction within the barrel 56 to
administer a medicament.
[0073]       Returning to the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 6-8, to dispense
medication from the cartridge 54, the plunger carrier 138 is mounted such that operation of
the motor 106 by way of the transmission assembly 110 and drive screw 114 results in
longitudinal movement relative to the housing 52. As may best be seen in FIG. 4, the plunger
carrier 138 includes an internally threaded bore 142 that is complimentary to the externally
threaded drive screw 114. In the illustrated embodiment, the internally threaded bore 142
extends through a portion 144 of the plunger carrier 138 that is disposed between the rails
132 of the cartridge carrier 126 such that the a cradle 146 of the plunger carrier 138 rides
along an upper surface of the rails 132 while portion 144 rides between the rails 132.
[0074]       As the drive screw 114 rotates, the plunger carrier 138 travels in a longitudinal
direction dependent upon the direction of the rotation of the drive screw 114 as well as the
configuration of the threads on the externally threaded drive screw 114 and in the internally
threaded bore 142. The interaction and rotation of the gears of the gear train 112, driven by
the motor 106, drive the operation of the automatic injector 50 as they rotate the drive screw
114. For example, based upon the illustrated thread configuration and viewing the automatic
injector 50 from the proximal end, clockwise rotation of the motor 106 causes the drive screw

114 to move the plunger carrier 138 of the injector 50 in the proximal direction relative to the
housing 52 as the drive screw 114 rotates in a clockwise direction; conversely,
counterclockwise rotation of the motor 106 causes the drive screw 114 to rotate in a
counterclockwise direction to move the plunger carrier 138 in the distal direction relative to
the housing 52. Should the drive screw 114 and the internally threaded bore 142 of the
plunger carrier 138 each have an opposite thread configuration to that illustrated, the
direction of movement of the plunger carrier 138 in the proximal or distal direction relative to
the housing 52 would be the opposite.
[0075]       In other words, operation of the motor 106 rotates the drive screw 114 by way of
the transmission assembly 110, and rotation of the drive screw 114 moves the plunger carrier
138 in the longitudinal direction within the housing 52. In the illustrated embodiment, this
movement of the plunger carrier 138 is likewise utilized to provide selective longitudinal
movement to the cartridge carrier 126 to allow for movement of the needle 58 into and out of
target tissue. In order to transmit this movement from the plunger carrier 138 to the cartridge
carrier 126, one or more transfer instruments 150 are provided. As will be explained in
greater detail below, the transfer instrument 150 may be moved selectively between a first
position wherein the transfer instrument 150 engages only one of the either the cartridge
carrier 126 or the plunger carrier 138, and a second position wherein the transfer instrument
150 engages both of the cartridge carrier 126 and the plunger carrier 138, in effect,
connecting the cartridge carrier 126 and the plunger carrier 138 together for contemporaneous
movement.
[0076]       To provide this selective engagement, the transfer instrument 150 is moveably
disposed within a channel 152 of the cartridge carrier 126 (see FIG. 9). The transfer
instrument 150 is adapted to move laterally partially into detents or recesses 154, 156 in the
plunger carrier 138 and guides 158 of the longitudinally extending rails 136 of the housing
52, respectively. In this way, when the transfer instrument 150 is disposed within the channel
152 of the cartridge carrier 126 and the recess 154 of the plunger carrier 138, the cartridge
carrier 126 will be coupled to the plunger carrier 138 for movement with the plunger carrier
138 along the drive screw 114. Conversely, when the transfer instrument 150 is disposed
within the channel 152 of the cartridge carrier 126 and the recess 156 of the guide 158, the

cartridge carrier 126 will not travel with the plunger carrier 138; rather, in the illustrated
embodiment, the cartridge carrier 126 will not move relative to the housing 52.
[0077]      It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that each of the recesses 154, 156
and the channel 152 could be described as openings. Further, it will be appreciated that,
while the transfer instrument 150 is described herein as moving between a first position
within the channel 152 of the cartridge carrier 126 and the recess 156 of the guide 158 to a
second position within the recess 154 of the plunger carrier 138 and the channel 152 of the
cartridge carrier 126, in an alternate embodiment, the transfer instrument 150 could disposed
for movement between a first position within the recess 154 of the plunger carrier 138 to a
second position within the recess 154 of the plunger carrier 138 and the channel 152 of the
cartridge carrier 126.
[0078]      Further, while the transfer instrument 150 may be described as being disposed or
engaged in the channel 152 and one or the other of the recesses 154, 156, the transfer
instrument 150 may be slightly larger than the combined the channel 152 and the one or the
other of the recesses 154, 156. For the purposes of this disclosure and the appended claims,
however, when the transfer instrument 150 is described as being disposed or engaged in one
or the other of the recesses 154, 156 or in the first or second position, it will be understood
that the terminology encompasses a structural relationship wherein the transfer instrument
150 is predominately disposed one way or the other such that the associated structures are
substantially coupled together. That is, when the transfer instrument 150 is predominately
disposed within the channel 152 and the recess 154, the plunger carrier 138 and the cartridge
carrier 126 are coupled together; conversely, when the transfer instrument 150 is
predominately disposed within channel 152 and the recess 156, the cartridge carrier 126 and
the guide 158 are coupled together.
[0079]      For clarity, FIGS. 10A-10E show components of the drive control mechanism
104, and their relative positions as they move during stages of actuation of the automatic
injector 50. The illustrated embodiment includes two control transfer instruments,
specifically two transfer instruments 150 that move through respective channels 152 in the
cartridge carrier 126 between respective recesses 154, 156 in the plunger carrier 138 and the
guides 158.

[00801       While the transfer instruments 150, channel 152, and recesses 154, 156 may be of
any appropriate design, in the illustrated embodiment, the transfer instruments 150 have the
shape of a cylinder, disc or puck, allowing it to move smoothly within the channel 152.
Moreover, the transfer instruments 150 may be of any appropriate material. By way of
example only, the transfer instruments 150 may be formed of a polymer, stainless steel, or a
silicone or rubbery material.
[0081]        The dimensions of the transfer instruments 150 are such that the transfer
instrument is always removably engaged with at least two components of the drive control
mechanism 104 simultaneously. In some stages of operation each transfer instrument 150 is
removably engaged with the corresponding recess 156 of the guide 158 and channel 152
(visible in FIG. 9) of the cartridge carrier 126. In other stages of operation, each transfer
instrument 150 is removably engaged with the channel 152 of the cartridge carrier 126 and
the recess 154 of the plunger carrier 138. This novel configuration enables a single motor
106 and transmission assembly 110 to drive the function of multiple components, thereby
simplifying the functionality of the automatic injector 50 and improving the reliability,
operation, and manufacturing cost of the reusable automatic injector 50.
[0082]       Likewise, the recesses 154, 156 of the plunger carrier 138 and the guides 158 can
be a number of different configurations. In one embodiment of the present invention, the
recesses 154, 156 of the plunger carrier 138 and the guides 158 are symmetrical within the
respective components. The recesses 154, 156 have an arcuate shape that is ramped on either
side to facilitate movement of the transfer instrument 150 as the transfer instrument 150 rides
along the ramped surfaces. In this way, an at least partially rounded outer surface of the
transfer instrument 150 may smoothly ride along the ramped surfaces.
[0083]       Operation of the transfer instruments 150 and the respective movements of the
cartridge carrier 126 and plunger carrier 138 may be better understood with respect to
exemplary stages of operation of the automated injector 50. FIGS. 10A-10E and 11 A-I lB
through 15a-b show the positioning of components of an embodiment of the automated
injector 50 through the stages of cartridge 54 loading (FIGS. 10A and 11 A- 11B), removal of
the rigid needle shield 60 (FIGS. 10B and 12A-12B), needle 58 injection (FIGS. 1OC and
13A-13B), drug dose delivery (FIGS. 1OD and 14A-14B), and needle retraction (FIGS. IOE
and 15A-15B). FIGS. 11 A, 12A, 13A, 14A, and 15A show the automatic injector 50 from a

side view (cross-sectional lines having been eliminated in the interest of clarity), while FIGS.
1 IB, 12B, 13B, 14B, and 15B show automatic injector 50 from a top plan view. FIGS. 1OA
1OE show enlarged fragmentary top views of the operation of the transfer instruments 150
relative to the cartridge carrier 126, plunger carrier 138, and guides 158. For the sake of
clarity, the plunger carrier 138 is broken away below the cradle 146, illustrating only the
portion 144 of the plunger carrier 138 that rides between the rails 132 of the cartridge carrier
126.
[0084]       A cartridge 54 is replaceably inserted into a cartridge carrier 126 of the reusable
automatic injector 50 and held in place throughout the needle 58 injection and retraction
process, as shown in FIGS. 11-15. The cartridge 54 may be held in place within the cartridge
carrier 126 by, for example, one or more cartridge 54 connection features 130.
[0085]       A cartridge sensor 160 positioned within the cartridge carrier 126 may optionally
be utilized to sense when a cartridge 54 has been placed within the cartridge carrier 126 of
reusable automatic injector 50. In the illustrated embodiment, the cartridge sensor 160 is
disposed at the bottom of the housing 52, although it may be alternately positioned.
Placement of the cartridge 54 within the cartridge carrier 126 such that the cartridge sensor
160 senses the presence of the cartridge 54 may provide an indication that permits the
reusable automatic injector 50 to be activated.
[0086]       The cartridge sensor 160 may be of any appropriate design. For example, the
cartridge sensor 160 may be a mechanical sensor, such that placement of a cartridge 54 into
the cartridge 54 carrier causes the displacement of the mechanical sensor. Alternatively, or
additionally, the cartridge 54 sensor may be an electrical sensor.
[0087]       Further, actuation of the cartridge sensor 160, whether electrical or mechanical,
may be tied to operation of the automatic injector 50 such that actuation of the cartridge
sensor 160, for example, allows the cartridge cover 72 to close and latch, or provides a signal
to a processor allowing actuation of the automatic injector 50. Upon activation, the motor
106 may cause the transmission assembly 110 to drive the drive screw 114 into the correct
position where the plunger interface feature 140 of the plunger carrier 138 is in contact with,
or adjacent to, the proximal end of the plunger rod 66 of the cartridge 54.
[0088]       In order to facilitate removal of the rigid needle shield 60, the automated injector
50 may include structure that engages the rigid needle shield 60 such that movement of the

cartridge 54 in the proximal direction results in removal of the rigid needle shield 60. As
may be seen in FIGS. 11 A and 11B, the cartridge 54 may be positioned such that the rigid
needle shield 60, which covers the needle 58 prior to injection for safety purposes, is
removably locked into needle shield stripper features 162 of support housing 52. The needle
shield stripper features 162 may be of any appropriate design. In the illustrated embodiment,
for example, the needle shield stripper features 162 include one or more flanges 164 disposed
along a proximally disposed edge of rigid needle shield 60. In this way, as the flanges 164
confront the rigid needle shield 60 during movement of the cartridge 54 in a proximal
direction, the rigid needle shield 60 is disengaged from the distal end of the cartridge 54.
Alternatively, the reusable automatic injector 50 may be configured such that the needle
shield stripper features 162 of support housing 52 lock onto the barrel 56 between the barrel
56 and the rigid needle shield 60.
[0089]      The function of the drive control mechanism, its components, and the automatic
injector 50 may be better understood with reference to FIGS. 4, 6-8, and 10A-10E as they
relate to FIGS. 11A-15B. In a first stage, typically for loading of a cartridge 54 into the
automatic injector 50, the components of the drive control mechanism 104 are as shown in
FIGS. 10A and 11 A- 11B. The guide 158 contains the recess 156, while the plunger carrier
138 similarly contains recess 154. As described herein, the guide 158 may be a separate
component or a pre-formed aspect of the housing 52. Regardless of whether the guide(s) 158
are separate components or pre-formed aspects of the housing 52, they are considered as a
part of the housing 52 for the purposes of this disclosure. The cartridge carrier 126 contains
at least one channel 152. The drive control mechanism 104 may include a recess 156 within
the guide 158, a recess 154 within the plunger carrier 138, and a channel 152 through the
cartridge carrier 126 for each control transfer instrument 150 utilized by the automatic
injector 50. For example, when two puck-shaped control transfer instruments are utilized in
the automatic injector 50, as is shown in FIGS. 10A-10E, the drive control mechanism 104
includes two guide recesses 156, two plunger carrier recesses 154, and two channels 152
which are positioned and interact with the control transfer instruments 150, respectively.
When the reusable automatic injector 50 is in the first stage for cartridge 54 loading, the
components of the drive control mechanism 104 are aligned such that each transfer

instrument 150 is allowed to freely pass between the guide recess 156, through the channel
152 of the cartridge carrier 126, and the plunger carrier recess 154, as illustrated in FIG. 10A.
[0090]       To move the reusable automatic injector 50 into a second stage, generally
considered the stage for removal of the rigid needle shield 60 from the needle 58, motor 106
and transmission assembly 110 cause the components of the drive control mechanism 104 to
move in the proximal direction. This arrangement is shown in FIGS. 12A and 12B. While
the rigid needle shield 60 is retained at the distal end of the reusable automatic injector 50,
such as by interaction with the needle shield stripper features 162 of the support housing 52
for example, the components of the drive control mechanism 104 and the cartridge 54 are
caused to move in the proximal direction. This action separates the rigid needle shield 60
from the needle 58. In an embodiment, the rigid needle shield 60 may be configured to "pop
off' of the cartridge 54, such that the rigid needle shield 60 may be ejected from the reusable
automatic injector 50, if desired. The cartridge 54 and the automatic injector 50 are now
ready for injection into a patient.
[0091]       FIG. 1OB further details the interaction of the components of the drive control
mechanism 104 as the automatic injector 50 moves from the loading stage (shown in FIGS.
11 A and 1 IB) to the removal of the rigid needle shield 60 stage (shown in FIGS. 12A and
12B). While the guide 158, and accordingly the guide recesses 156, is a fixed position
component, the cartridge carrier 126, plunger carrier 138, and drive screw 114 are all
movable components. In the transition from the loading stage to the removal of the rigid
needle shield 60 stage, the motor 106 and transmission assembly 110 cause the drive screw
114 to rotate such that the plunger carrier 138 is caused to move in the proximal direction,
that is, from the respective positions illustrated in FIG. 1OA to the respective positions
illustrated in FIG. 10B. As the plunger carrier 138 moves rearward and the channel 152 of
the cartridge carrier 126 becomes aligned with the recesses 154 of the plunger carrier 138, the
transfer instruments 150 move inward, ensuring that the transfer instruments 150 are out of
guide recesses 156 and into position between the channels 152 of the cartridge carrier 126
and the recesses 154 of the plunger carrier 138, as shown in FIG. 10B.
[0092]       When the transfer instrument 150 is formed of a rubbery material and is slightly
wider than the combined depth of the channel 152 and the guide recess 156, the transfer
instrument 150 will protrude slightly into the recess 154 of the plunger carrier 138 when the

recess 154 aligns with the recess 156 and the channel 152. As the plunger carrier 138
continues to move relative to the guide 158, the cartridge carrier 126 may move slightly with
the plunger carrier 138 as a result of the force of the transfer instrument 150 acted upon by
ramped surface of the recess 154 of the plunger carrier 138. The continued force of the
ramped surface of the recess 154, the force of the ramped surface of the recess 156 in the
opposite direction along an opposite side of the transfer instrument 150, creates a moment
that causes the transfer instrument 150 to move from the recess 156 of the guide 158 into the
recess 154 of the plunger carrier 138. With the placement of the transfer instrument 150 in
the channel 152 of the cartridge carrier 126 and the recess 154 of the plunger carrier 138, the
cartridge carrier 126 and plunger carrier 138 are coupled together for further movement.
[0093]      This positioning of the transfer instruments 150 causes the cartridge carrier 126
and the plunger carrier 138 to move as one unified component. That is, as rotation of the
drive screw 114 causes movement of the plunger carrier 138 in the proximal direction, the
positioning of the control transfer instruments 150 with the recesses 154 of the plunger carrier
138 and the channels 152 of the cartridge carrier 126 couples the cartridge carrier 126 to the
plunger carrier 138 so that the cartridge carrier 126 to also move in the proximal direction. In
this way, motion of the plunger carrier 138 and the cartridge carrier 126 in the proximal
direction moves the transfer instruments 150 away from the recesses 156 of the fixed position
guide 158.
[0094]      As stated above, one or more control transfer instruments 150 may be used in the
drive control mechanisms and automatic injectors of the present invention. In at least one
embodiment, however, two puck-shaped control transfer instruments are utilized to, for
example, provide stronger connections, more even distribution of force on the components,
and control the motion of the components.
[0095]      Because the needle shield 60 of the cartridge 54 is removably confronted by the
needle shield stripper features 162 of the housing 52 (shown in FIGS. 11 A-1 IB), the rigid
needle shield 60 is removed from the needle 58 by the proximal movement of the cartridge
carrier 126 and the cartridge 54. This is shown in the transition between FIGS. 11 A-1 lB and
12A and 12B, as well as the transition between FIGS. 10A and lOB. The reusable automatic
injector 50 can now be placed in contact with target tissue of a patient to inject the needle 58
and deliver a drug contained within the cartridge 54.

[0096]       Moving to FIGS. 13A-13B, during the injection stage, the cartridge carrier 126
and the plunger carrier 138 are caused to move in the distal direction, moving the now
exposed needle 58 at the distal end of the reusable automatic injector 50 into an injection
position in the target tissue of the patient. As described further herein, an optional patient
sensor 165 (shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 5) may be utilized to sense contact with the patient prior
to operation of the injection stage. The patient sensor 165 may be positioned at the distal end
of the reusable automatic injector 50, adjacent to and on the exterior side of the needle shield
stripper feature 162 of the support housing 52. Upon contact with a patient, the patient sensor
165 may signal a control system that the patient is ready for injection, if one or more control
systems are utilized to control the timing and parameters of motion. Alternatively, or
additionally, the patient sensor 165 may be mechanically coupled to an arrangement that
prevents administration of the drug from the cartridge 54 unless the patient sensor 165 is
depressed.
[0097]       As the cartridge carrier 126 and the plunger carrier 138 move in the distal
direction, the components move from the position shown in FIG. 1OB to the position shown
in 10c. As shown in FIG. 1OC, at the position wherein the needle 58 has been inserted into
the target tissue, the channels 152 again align with the recesses 156 in the guides 158. As a
result, the transfer instruments 150 are able to move freely between the plunger carrier
recesses 154, the channels 152, and the guide recesses 156. The transfer instruments 150
may be in the "out" position (i.e., in the guide recesses 156) or in the "in" position (i.e., in the
plunger carrier recesses 154). As the cartridge carrier 126 is moved into the furthest distal
position as illustrated in FIGS. 13A and 13B, however, the plunger carrier 138 continues
forward movement as a result of the rotation of the drive screw 114. With continued motion
of the plunger carrier 138, the transfer instruments 150 ride along ramped edges of the
recesses 154 of the plunger carrier 138, urging the transfer instruments 150 outward through
the channels 152 in the stationary cartridge carrier 126 and toward the recesses 156 in the
guides 158. In this way, the continued motion of the plunger carrier 138 causes the transfer
instruments 150 to ride along the ramped sides of the recesses 154 of the plunger carrier 138
to move outward when the channels 152 of the cartridge carrier 126 are aligned with the
recesses 156 of the guide 158, disengaging the transfer instruments 150 from the recesses 154
in the plunger carrier 138 to engage the transfer instruments 150 in the recesses 156 in the

guide 158, that is, the position illustrated in FIG. 1OD. In the position of FIG. 1OD, the
plunger carrier 138 is free to continue forward movement for drug delivery.
[0098]       Depending on the desired injection parameters, the drug may be immediately
delivered upon injection of the needle 58 or there may be a momentary delay between the two
stages. Such parameters may be programmed into the control system or initiated by the user,
as may be desired for operation of the reusable automatic injector 50.
[0099]       For the drug delivery stage, the plunger carrier 138 may continue to move in the
distal direction while the cartridge carrier 126 is temporarily locked into place with the guide
158, as illustrated in FIG. 1OD. The locking occurs because the transfer instruments 150 are
forced out of the plunger carrier recesses 154 and into position between the channels 152 of
the cartridge carrier 126 and the guide recesses 156 of the guide 158. As the plunger carrier
138 continues to move in the distal direction, the plunger interface feature 140 of the plunger
carrier 138 applies force to, or pushes upon, the distal end of the plunger rod 66. The plunger
rod 66 relays that axial force in the distal direction to the plunger seal 64 within the barrel 56
of the cartridge 54, thereby forcing the drug fluid through the needle 58 and into the patient.
[00100]      Through the drug delivery stage, as the components of the automatic injector 50
the transfer instruments 150 remains in the "out" position between the channels 152 and the
guide recesses 156, as shown in FIG. 1Od. It will be appreciated, however, that as the plunger
carrier 138 moves to the position illustrated in FIGS. 14A and 14B, the portion 144 of the
plunger carrier 138 disposed between the guides 158 moves beyond the position wherein the
portion 144 causes an interference that would prevent the transfer instruments 150 from again
traveling radially inward, that is, out of the recesses 156 in the guides 158 and the channels
152 in the cartridge carrier 126.
[00101]      While any appropriate arrangement may be provided to retain the transfer
instruments 150 in position, in the illustrated embodiment, a retainer 166 is provided. The
retainer 166 may best be viewed in FIG. 4. By way of a retainer biasing element 168, such as
the illustrated spring, the retainer 166 is disposed and biased toward a position that at least
partially covers the channels 152 in the cartridge carrier 126 when the plunger carrier 138 is
moved distally to deliver a drug from the cartridge 54. In this way, the retainer biasing
element 168 and retainer 166 are configured to retain the transfer instruments 150 within the
channels 152 and the guide recesses 156. For example, as shown in FIG. 1OD, the retainer

biasing element 168 is positioned at the proximal end of, and axially around, the drive screw
114 between the proximal end of the cartridge carrier 126 and the proximal end of the
plunger carrier 138. The retainer biasing element 168 is initially in a compressed position,
but is permitted to expand along the axis of the drive screw 114 when the plunger carrier 138
has moved distally. The retainer biasing element 168 acts upon the retainer 166 and moves
the latter in the distal direction when the plunger carrier 138 has moved distally. As the
plunger carrier 138 moves in the distal direction along the axis of the drive screw 114 during
controlled drug delivery, the retainer 166, urged distally by the retainer biasing element 168,
functions to keep the transfer instruments 150 within the drive control mechanism 104.
[00102]      In order to provide controlled travel and function of the retainer 166 and retainer
biasing element 168, the cartridge carrier 126 may include structure that guides and limits
movement of the retainer 166. In the illustrated embodiment, a boss 170 including two
arcuate segments 172 that extend between the rails 132 of the cartridge carrier 126 (see FIG.
9). The arcuate segments 172 are separated by longitudinally extending channels 174 that
slidingly receive arms 176 extending from the retainer 166 (see FIG. 4). The arms 176 and/or
the channels 174 may include structure, such as the enlarged ends 180 of the arms 176, that
limit the movement of the retainer 166 in a distal direction. Those of skill will appreciate that
the structures, such as the boss 170 may be formed unitarily with the cartridge carrier 126, for
example, or may be formed as one or more separate components.
[00103]      After the drug delivery stage has completed, as shown in FIGS. 14A-14B and
FIG. 10D, the drive screw 114 may be caused to move in the proximal direction by the
transmission assembly 110 and the motor 106, that is, for example, to the position illustrated
in FIGS. 15A-15B and FIG. 10E. As the drive screw 114 causes motion in the proximal
direction of the plunger carrier 138, such as by rotation of the drive screw 114 in the reverse
or opposite direction from its earlier motion, the plunger carrier 138 engages the retainer 166
to return the retainer 166 its original position, again compressing the retainer biasing element
168 to the position shown in FIG. 10E. As the retainer 166 and plunger carrier 138 move in a
proximal direction, along the axis of the drive screw 114, transfer instruments 150 are again
permitted to move between the guide recesses 156 and channels 152 and into contact with the
plunger recesses 154. Once this occurs, the cartridge carrier 126 is also caused to move in
the proximal direction. Motion of the plunger carrier 138 and the cartridge carrier 126 in the

proximal direction moves the transfer instruments 150 away from the guide recesses 156 of
the fixed position guide 158. This motion causes the transfer instruments 150 to move
radially inward as explained above, ensuring that the transfer instruments 150 disengage the
guide recesses 156 and are positioned between the channels 152 of the cartridge carrier 126
and the recesses 154 of the plunger carrier 138. This positioning of the transfer instruments
150 causes the cartridge carrier 126 and the plunger carrier 138 to again move as one unified
component. Movement of these unified components in the proximal direction causes the
cartridge 54 to also move in the proximal direction.
[00104]     If a safety syringe is utilized as a cartridge 54 of the automatic injector 50, safety
mechanisms of the safety syringe may be triggered at the end of the drug delivery stage by
operation of the syringe. Accordingly, the cartridge 54 disposed in the cartridge carrier 126
of the automatic injector 50 will be safe for removal and disposal by the user. Optionally, the
user may reattach the rigid needle shield 60 to the distal end of the cartridge 54, such as to the
distal end of the barrel 56, after the syringe has been used (i.e., drug delivery has completed).
In the position illustrated in FIGS. 10e and 15a-15b, the automatic injector 50 is reset to its
original configuration and again ready to accept another cartridge 54, thereby constituting a
reusable automatic injector 50.
[00105]     As discussed above, one or more sensors may be utilized for safety or for other
reasons. For example, a patient sensor 165 may be utilized at a distal end of the reusable
automatic injector 50 to ensure that it is in contact with the patient prior to needle injection.
A cartridge sensor 160 may similarly be used to ensure that a cartridge 54 is correctly in
position within the cartridge carrier 126 prior to operation. Other sensors known in the art
may be utilized for this or other purposes and are contemplated and encompassed within the
breadth of the embodiments of the present invention. Similarly, other components may
optionally be utilized to enhance the safety and functionality of the automatic injector 50.
For example, a cartridge ejector assembly 182 may be utilized to removably lock and eject
the cartridge 54 during and after operation, respectively. One example of a cartridge ejector
assembly 182 is shown in FIGS. 2 and 5.
[00106]     Another embodiment of a cartridge ejector assembly 184, which is shown in
FIGS. 16A-16B, may alternately be provided to facilitate easy removal of the cartridge 54
from the housing 52. While the ejector assembly 184 may be of any appropriate design, in

the illustrated embodiment, an ejector prong 186 is disposed to slide from a loaded position
shown in FIG. 16A to the eject position shown in FIG. 16B as a result of movement of a
toggle switch 188 disposed on the upper surface of the housing 52. When loading the
cartridge 54 (not shown) into the housing 52, the toggle switch 188 may be manually moved
to a position that disposes the ejector prong 186 below the level of a loaded cartridge 54, or
the cartridge 54 may be utilized to depress the ejector prong 186 such that the ejector prong
186 is disposed subjacent the loaded cartridge 54, i.e., the position shown FIG. 16A. The
ejector prong 186 of this embodiment is coupled to the toggle switch 188 by a linkage 190
that pivots about axis 192 to toggle the ejector prong 186 between the loaded position shown
in FIG. 16A and the eject position shown in FIG. 16B. It will be appreciated, however, that
any appropriate design may be utilized. For example, a cartridge ejector assembly may be
configured to automatically eject a cartridge 54 upon completion of the drug dose delivery
and retraction of the cartridge 54 or the needle 58 and the cartridge 54.
[00107]      As mentioned above, there are various modifications which can be made within
the contemplation of the embodiments of the present invention. For example, alternate gear
trains and actuation arrangements may be provided. Referring to FIG. 17, in an alternate
embodiment, longitudinal movement of a plunger carrier 194 may be provided by a gear train
that includes a rack 196 and pinion gear 198 arrangement. In other words, the elongated
drive device in this embodiment includes the rack 196, with is coupled to the plunger carrier
194. It will be appreciated that rotation of the pinion gear 198 engaged with the rack 196
causes the rack 196 and associated plunger carrier 194 to move between proximal and distal
positions within a housing 200. The motion of the plunger carrier 194 may be selectively
combined with motion of a cartridge carrier 202 by way of transfer instruments 204,
illustrated, for example, in FIG. 18. The transfer instruments 204 shift between detents or
recesses 206, 208 in the rack 196 and the cartridge carrier 202, respectively, through channels
210 in the cartridge carrier 202.
[00108]      In order to provide rotary motion to the pinion gear 212, 214, a motor 216, 218
may be disposed at an appropriate angle to provide direct rotation to the pinion gear 212, 214
as shown, for example, in FIGS. 19 and 20, respectively. Those of skill in the art will
appreciate that the gear train may alternatively include additional gears that allow the motor

to extend longitudinally within the automatic injector while still utilizing a rack in order to
impart longitudinal motion to the plunger carrier (not illustrated).
[00109]      The reusable automatic injectors described above utilize a standard syringe.
However, the automatic injectors of the present invention, according to at least one other
embodiment, may utilize a permanent plunger rod 228, such as is illustrated in FIG. 21,
instead of a standard syringe plunger rod 66, such as is illustrated in FIGS. 11 A through 15B.
For example, the plunger interface feature 230 of plunger carrier 226, shown in FIG. 21, may
include an elongated projection in the form of an elongated rod 228 which during operation
would reside within the proximal end of the barrel 222 of cartridge 224 and with an interface
feature 230 that acts directly upon a plunger seal 220. This configuration eliminates the need
for the cartridge to include a plunger rod, thus enabling the use of various cartridges 224. In
one such embodiment, after the cartridge 224 is inserted into the reusable automatic injector,
the components of the drive control mechanism would cause the plunger interface feature 230
to directly engage the plunger seal 220 of the cartridge 224. Axial motion in the distal
direction by the plunger carrier 226 and elongated rod 228 would cause the interface feature
230 to enter the proximal end of the barrel 222 of the cartridge 224. After this step, the
function of the components of the drive control mechanism and the reusable automatic
injector are as described above for the steps of: removal of rigid needle shield, needle
injection, drug dose delivery, and needle retraction. In such embodiments, a final step may
be performed after needle retraction to ensure that the cartridge 224 is removable from the
elongated rod 228 and the plunger interface feature 230 and of the plunger carrier 226. Other
similar configurations may be utilized for this function while remaining within the breadth
and contemplation of the present invention.
[00110]      The automatic injector may also include a cover release safety mechanism that
prevents the cartridge cover from opening during certain stages of operation. According to at
least one embodiment of the present invention, a cartridge cover release safety mechanism
can be operated by the drive control mechanism as it progresses through the stages of:
syringe cartridge loading, removal of rigid needle shield, needle injection, drug dose delivery,
and needle and/or cartridge retraction. In other words, the cover release safety mechanism
permits opening of the cartridge cover only when the needle is not exposed to the user, i.e.,
during initial loading of the cartridge when the protective needle shield is in place and/or

after drug delivery and optional retraction or shielding of the needle. The cover release safety
mechanism prevents opening of the cartridge cover during other stages of operation, i.e.,
when the needle is exposed for drug delivery. In this way, the cover release safety
mechanism operates to inhibit the user's inadvertent exposure to the needle to reduce or
eliminate accidental needle stick injuries to the user, providing a highly desirable safety
feature.
[00111]      In the embodiment of FIGS. 22A-22E, for example, the cartridge cover release
safety mechanism 232 is configured to be operated by the function of the drive control
mechanism. The release actuator 234 is configured to slide in the proximal direction in order
to release to cartridge cover (not shown) from the housing 236. The cartridge cover release
safety mechanism 232 include a locking pin 238 that is adapted to move between an
obstructing position that prevents movement of the release actuator 234 in a proximal
direction (as shown in FIGS. 22B-22D), and a retracted position that allows movement of the
release actuator 234 in a proximal direction (as shown in FIGS. 22A and 22E).
[00112]      Movement of the locking pin 238 between the obstructing and retracted positions
is at least partially controlled by a teeter 240. Movement of the teeter 240 is at least partially
controlled by movement of the plunger carrier 242. In the illustrated views, and for the sake
of simplicity, only the portion of the plunger carrier 242 disposed between the guides 244 and
the plunger interaction feature 243 are illustrated. In this embodiment, the plunger carrier
includes a downwardly depending flange 245. The teeter 240 includes a channel 246 that
receives an aspect at the lower end of the locking pin 238 and a catch arm 248 that is
disposed to engage the flange 245 of the plunger carrier 242.
[00113]      In order to control movement of the teeter 240, a guide pin 250 and a fulcrum pin
252, both of which are fixed protrusions from the housing 236. The teeter 240 includes a pair
of channels 254, 256 disposed receive the guide pin 250 and fulcrum pin 252, respectfully, to
control movement of the teeter 240 as it slides in a plane. The teeter 240 adapted to move
along a predetermine path as the guide channel 254 travels over the guide pin 250, movement
of the slide channel 256 relative to the fulcrum pin 252 allowing the teeter 240 to slide and
pivot for angular changes of the teeter 240 relative to the fulcrum pin 252. As the guide pin
250 travels within the guide channel 254 during the operation of the cartridge cover release
safety mechanism 232, the guide pin 250 may be caused to removably rest within guide pin

recess 257 of the guide channel 254. Biasing elements 258, 260, such as springs coupled to
the housing 236 (for the sake of simplicity, specific sections of the housing 236 to which the
springs are coupled are not illustrated), may be utilized to direct the positioning of the
cartridge cover release safety mechanism 232, specifically, the teeter 240, during operation.
[00114]      FIG. 22A shows the locking pin 238 of the cartridge cover release safety
mechanism 232 in the initial retracted position, which allows the latch release to be
manipulated (e.g., slid axially) to open the cartridge cover for loading of the cartridge into the
automatic injector. In this position, the flange 245 of the plunger carrier 242 is not in contact
with the corresponding catch arm 248 of the teeter 240 of the cartridge cover release safety
mechanism 232.
[00115]      As the syringe cartridge is loaded into the automatic injector, and the automatic
injector is activated by the user, the flange 245 of the plunger carrier 242 is caused to
translate axially in the proximal direction to retract the cartridge for removal of a rigid needle
protector, for example. As the plunger carrier 242 moves proximally, the flange 245 comes
into contact with the corresponding catch arm 248 of the teeter 240 of the cartridge cover
release safety mechanism 232, thereby pulling the catch arm 248 of the teeter 240 in the
proximal direction (see FIG. 22B). As the teeter 240 is pulled proximally, the guide channel
254 shifts upon guide pin 250 and the slide channel 256 slides and pivots along the fulcrum
pin 252. Guide pin 250 is caused to removably move into position within guide pin recess
257, which causes the locking pin 238 to shift upwards into the obstructing position next to
latch release. This prevents latch release from being moved to unlock and open the cartridge
cover. The teeter 240 and locking pin 238 are retained in this position while the drive
mechanism moves the plunger carrier 242 to perform the steps of drug delivery, including
needle insertion and drug dosing to the user, as shown in FIG. 22C and FIG. 22d,
respectively.
[00116]      As shown in FIG. 22e, upon completion of drug dose delivery and, optionally,
needle and/or cartridge retraction, the plunger carrier 242 is caused to translate axially in the
proximal direction again. The plunger carrier 242 again comes into contact with the
corresponding catch arm 248 of the teeter 240 of the cartridge cover release safety
mechanism 232, thereby pulling catch arm 248 of the teeter 240 in the proximal direction.
This motion, along with the biasing force of the biasing elements 258, 260 causes guide pin

250 to move from the guide pin recess 257 of the guide channel 254 of the teeter 240, and
slide along the guide channel 254 to a final position where the angle of the teeter 240 pulls
locking pin 238 out of the obstructing position with latch release. At this time, the release
actuator 234 may again be freely operated to open the cartridge cover (e.g., to remove the
used syringe cartridge). In this way, by blocking the release actuator 234 and maintaining the
cartridge cover in a closed and locked position during operation of the reusable automatic
injector, the user is typically prevented from exposure to the cartridge until the cartridge has
been returned to a safe (e.g., retracted, shielded, sheathed) position for the user.
[00117]     As previously stated, the transfer instrument may be sized and shaped in a number
of different ways while maintaining its novel functional aspects. In at least one embodiment,
the transfer instrument may be a cylinder which functions to connect the components of the
drive control mechanism and facilitate the movement of the components through the various
stages described above. Also as described above, certain components may be individual
components or multiple components which work together. These components may be
separate parts which function together, for ease of manufacturing for example, or be a single
part that provides more than one function. The shapes and configurations described herein
are also merely exemplary and other similar shapes having the same functionality may be
utilized, within the breadth and contemplation of the present invention.
[00118]     In a further embodiment of the present invention, a drive control mechanism for a
reusable automatic injector 50 includes a drive screw 114, a cartridge carrier 126, a plunger
carrier 138, and two transfer instruments 150. The drive control mechanism may further
include, for each transfer instrument, a plunger carrier recess 154 on the plunger carrier 138,
a channel 152 within the cartridge carrier 126 28, and a guide recess 156 on the guide 158.
These components are sized and configured such that the control transfer instruments are
retained within the drive control mechanism and the guide. For example, the cartridge carrier
126 may be a thin object having a rectangular bore through it as a channel. The transfer
instrument may reside within the channel, but would be prevented from moving laterally
along the axial plane of the cartridge carrier 126 because it is retained on all four sides. The
dimensions of the transfer instrument 150 are such that the transfer instrument is always
removably engaged with two components of the drive control mechanism 104
simultaneously. For example, in some stages of operation the transfer instrument 150 is

removably engaged with the guide recess 156 of the guide 158 and the channel 152 of the
cartridge carrier 126. In other stages of operation, the transfer instrument 150 is removably
engaged with the channel 152 of the cartridge carrier 126 and the plunger carrier recess 154
of the plunger carrier 138. The drive control mechanism functions by forcing the transfer
instrument between the plunger carrier recess 154 of the plunger carrier 138, the channel 152
within the cartridge carrier 126, and the guide recess 156 of the guide 158, such that a single
motor 106 and transmission assembly 110 acting upon a drive screw 114 can control the
function of the multiple components, as described above.
[00119]     The reusable automatic injectors of the present invention are able to accommodate
partially or fully filled cartridges 54, 224 of varying capacity, including 1mL cartridges 54,
224. The reusable automatic injector could be used with retractable or safety syringes,
including prefilled syringes, as well as with non-safety syringes. When used with a non
safety syringe, the cartridge 54, 224 is fully withdrawn back into the reusable automatic
injector housing 52 after the injection to protect the user from exposed needles 58. Following
the injection complete signal, the user can re-cap the non-safety syringe whilst it remains in
the reusable automatic injector housing 52 with no risk of a needle 58 stick injury as the
needle 58 point is contained inside the housing 52. The reusable automatic injector or
cartridge cover 72 can then be opened and the used cartridge 54, 224 can be safely disposed
in a sharps container. The reusable automatic injector would therefore provide a safe injection
for non-safety syringes in addition to working with most retractable needle syringes. The
present invention also provides reusable auto-injectors which are ergonomic, easy-to-use and
aesthetically similar to products currently employed by self-administering patients. The
automatic injectors of the present invention provide sufficient force at suitable speeds to
simulate an injection by a nurse or doctor, yet provide the freedom of use for self
administering patients. The reusable automatic injectors of the present invention are also
configured to withstand frequent use, such as daily use, over an extended period of time. The
energy source which powers the reusable automatic injectors may similarly be replaceable,
rechargeable, or otherwise provide power for use of the injectors over an extended period of
time. The present invention thereby provides a reusable automatic injector with integrated
safety mechanisms, enabled by incorporating a retractable needle syringe within the reusable
automatic injector, in a convenient and easy-to-use package for patients.

[00120]     One or more of the embodiments described above may provide additional
desirable features to the patient. For example, the novel automatic injectors of the present
invention may utilize existing or additional components within the housing to limit the depth
of needle insertion. In one such embodiment, features located on the housing or the guide
may be utilized for this purpose. In another embodiment, mechanical limits may be
integrated into the drive control mechanism, the cartridge carrier, the plunger carrier, or the
drive screw to limit the range of travel of the syringe needle into the patient. Similarly, as
described above, one or more components may be employed to automatically remove the
needle shield from the syringe needle upon activation of the reusable auto-injector.
[00121]     In another embodiment, a single automatic injector according to the invention may
be adjusted to accommodate cartridges including needles of various lengths. In this way, a
single automatic injector may be utilized, for example, for intramuscular injections and
subcutaneous injections. In adjusting for various needle lengths, the automatic injector may
include a mechanical adjustment and/or an electrical adjustment, for example, by way of the
user interface. The depth of needle insertion may be adjusted based upon the movement of
the cartridge carrier within the housing, that is, as the cartridge and needle are moved to the
position illustrated in FIGS. 13A and 13B.
[00122]     According to another aspect of the invention, the processor of some embodiments
may be programmed to precisely control the dose of medication administered. For example,
when a cartridge includes a larger volume than required for administration, the automatic
injector may be directed to dispense the unneeded volume prior to placement on the target
tissue. The user interface may be utilized to program the automatic injector to dispense the
unneeded volume prior to administration, for example, so long as the patient sensor 165 is not
depressed. Accordingly, the automatic injector may be configured to expend a portion of the
drug dosage to a reservoir or to the environment, prior to needle injection and drug dose
delivery into a user, in order to reduce or adjust drug volume. The automatic injector may
then be placed against the target tissue, actuating the patient sensor 165 to allow for dose
administration. In another embodiment, the automatic injector may be programmed to insert
the needle, administer the programmed volume of medication, and then move the cartridge in
the proximal direction to retract the needle from the target tissue.

[00123]      In further embodiments, the automatic injector may include one or more
overrides. For example, the automatic injector may include an electronic override that may
be actuated by way of the user interface. Alternatively or additionally, the automatic injector
may include a manual override. For example, removal of the automatic injector from the
target tissue such that the patient sensor 165 is no longer activated may cause the plunger
carrier to cease progression and the cartridge carrier to retract the needle into the housing.
[00124]      In another embodiment, the present invention relates to the method for
manufacturing automatic injectors. The method includes the steps of assembling a drive
control mechanism which includes an elongated drive device, such as a drive screw 114 or a
rack 196, a cartridge carrier 126, a plunger carrier 138, and one or more control transfer
instruments 150. The drive control mechanism may further include one or more plunger
carrier recess(es) 154 within the plunger carrier 138, channels 152 within the cartridge carrier
126, and guide recess(es) 156 of the guide 158. These components are sized and configured
such that the control transfer instruments 150 (e.g., pucks) are retained within the drive
control mechanism and the guide. The method further includes the step of attaching a guide
and a support housing 52 to the drive control mechanism. The method may further include
the steps of attaching one or more of: an energy source, a motor 106, a transmission assembly
110, a control system such as a microprocessor, wherein the transmission assembly 110 is
made to contact the drive screw 114. A cartridge 54 or housing 52 cover 72 may also be
attached on the top side of the automatic injector.
[00125]      In yet another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of use for an
automatic injector. The method includes the steps of: inserting a cartridge 54 into the
carriage contained in a housing 52 of the automatic injector and activating the automatic
injector to initiate, optionally, one or more of: removal of a needle shield 60, injection of a
needle 58 into a patient, delivery of drug through the needle 58 to the patient, retraction of the
needle 58 from the patient into the housing 52, and removal of the cartridge 54 from the
cartridge carrier 126. Furthermore, optionally, the method of use may include the step of
expending a portion of the drug dosage to a reservoir or to the environment, prior to needle
injection and drug dose delivery into a user, in order to reduce or adjust drug dose volume.
Similarly, optionally, the method of use may include the step of adjusting the range of axial
translation of the drive mechanism (and therefore the syringe cartridge) to accommodate

different needle lengths and/or injection depths. The method may further include the steps of
opening a cartridge cover 72 to access an interior of the automatic injector prior to the
insertion of a cartridge 54 into the cartridge carrier 126, and the step of closing the cartridge
cover 72 after the cartridge 54 has been loaded into the cartridge carrier 126. The method
may similarly include the step of opening the cartridge 54 or housing 52 cover 72 to access
an interior of the automatic injector after the retraction of the needle 58 to remove the used
cartridge 54. The user may optionally reattach the needle shield 60 to the cartridge 54 prior
to removal of the cartridge 54 from the cartridge carrier 126. After the used cartridge 54 has
been removed from the cartridge carrier 126 of the automatic injector, the automatic injector
is reset and ready to accept another cartridge 54.
[00126]     The embodiments shown and detailed herein disclose only a few possible
variations of the present invention; other similar variations are contemplated and incorporated
within the breadth of this disclosure. As would be readily appreciated by an ordinarily skilled
artisan, a number of parameters, shapes, and dimensions described above may be modified
while remaining within the breadth and scope of the present invention. For example, the
distance that the cartridge carrier 126 moves in the distal direction may be adjusted to ensure
that a predetermined depth of needle 58 insertion is met. Additionally or alternatively, other
standard components such as stop members to prevent the travel of the carrier may be utilized
to achieve this or similar functions. Other features may similarly be adjustable. For example,
the automatic injector may be configured to accept different gear ratios and drive screw or
rack pitches to provide desired injection speeds for a range of drug viscosities and patient
requirements. The present invention provides drive control mechanisms, reusable automatic
injectors, methods of manufacturing such automatic injectors, and their methods of use. As
stated above, the drive control mechanisms and reusable automatic injectors may be utilized
in a number of different configurations and may themselves comprise of one or more
components. Other components may similarly be single components, unified components, or
multi-purpose components, as described in the embodiments discussed above. Such novel
automatic injectors may be employed by, for example, patients who are required to self-inject
their medication on a regular or long-term basis. Accordingly, similar to the examples
provided above, the novel reusable auto-injectors of the present invention may be configured,
modified, and utilized to initiate drug delivery and activate needle retraction in any number of

configurations while remaining within the breadth and scope of the present invention. Thus,
it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this
invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
[00127]      The incorporation of the syringe retraction or the integrated needle retraction
syringe into a reusable auto-injector enables patients to safely self-administer pharmaceutical
treatment in an easy-to-use manner. The incorporation of the novel safety syringe features
and designs into the reusable automatic injector provides a true end of dose indicator.
Additionally, a standard syringe may be utilized and retracted into the body of the automatic
injector to provide needle safety and to indicate that the dose is complete. While the syringes
described herein may have integrated safety features, the automatic injectors of the present
invention may be utilized with conventional syringes that lack such features.
[00128]      The incorporation of such syringes into a disposable or reusable automatic injector
extends the integrated safety mechanisms of the syringes into an automated drug delivery
device that is highly desirable by patients. More specifically, automatic injectors that employ
the integrated needle retraction safety syringes described herein may utilize the pre-filled
syringe's retraction mechanism instead of, or in addition too, other retraction mechanisms of
the automatic injector such as the reverse drive mechanisms. Additionally, such automatic
injectors also solve a significant unmet need is for an automatic injector with a true end of
dose indicator. Currently visual, tactile or audible indicators are generally linked to the end of
stroke or some other mechanical mechanism and not to the end of dose. The integrated
needle retraction safety syringe retracts the needle into the syringe barrel, removing it from
the patient's skin, once the dose is complete. Therefore, incorporating such integrated safety
syringes into an automatic injector incorporates this true end of dose indicator. The
embodiments of the present invention provide drive mechanisms, automatic injector
configurations, and methods for manufacturing and using reusable automatic injectors. Such
novel devices may be employed by, for example, patients who are required to self-inject their
medication on a regular or long-term basis.

the disclosure may differ in detail from the foregoing examples. All references to the
disclosure or examples thereof are intended to reference the particular example being
