   A LOAD CARRYING BAR
   TECHNICAL FIELD
   The present invention relates to a load carrying bar comprising a channel with an opening
 5 the channel is adapted for mounting a load carrying bar accessory to the load carrying
   bar, such as roof box. A cover is arranged in the channel to cover, or seal, the opening of
   the channel to reduce air turbulence around the channel and the intrusion of dirt in the
   channel.
10 BACKGROUND OF THE INVNTION
    Roof racks comprising load carrying bars mounted to the roof of an automobile via load
   carrier feet are commonly used to provide for an improved load capacity on automobiles.
    During recent years, a trend has been that the cross section of the load carrying bars has
    been improved to reduce wind resistance and noise. One type of improved load carrying
15 bars have a wing like cross section having a low wind resistance and low noise level.
   To attach load carrying bar accessories, such as roof box, to a load carrying bar having a
   wing like cross section, the load carrying bar is generally equipped with a channel. The
    channel extends along the length of the load carrying bar and permits a fastening member
20 to be slid along the channel and into position. The fastening member can be a screw for
    example. Such channels are however associated with numerous problems such as wind
    turbulence increasing the wind noise and wind resistance. They can also collect dirt or
    rubble, which in turn accidentally could damage the lacquer of the automobile.
25 To solve these problems, load carrying bars have been provided with covers also known
    as cover infills or sealing strips. One load carrying bar comprising a cover to reduce air
    turbulence around a channel in the load carrying bar is known from the US patent No. US
    6176,404 B1 in which a sealing strip is disclosed. The sealing strip is provided with cuts
    in its longitudinal direction enabling a user to remove a central part of the sealing strip in
30 order to allow fastening means to be fixed in the channel The solution is however not
    very sophisticated as it requires the user to measure and to remove parts of the sealing
    strip in order to allow the fastening means to fit in the channel Another cover infill is
    disclosed in the International application No. WO 2009/038479 A1. The cover infill

  WO 2014/184172                                                           PCT/EP2014/059721
                                                   2
   disclosed in this document is adapted to be deformed in a strict vertical direction to permit
   access to the channel of the load carrying bar. There is a risk that the cover infill may be
   pinched between the fastening means and the floor of the channel This can damage the
   cover infill when the fastening means is displaced along the length of the load carrying bar
 5 in the channel as the fastening means may rest on the cover infill instead of resting on the
   load carrying bar itself before being readily attached to the load carrying bar.
   It would have been advantageous to provide a cover which requires no or very little
   manipulation from the user in order to fit the fastening means and which properly seal or
10 cover the channel of the load carrying bar.
   SUMMARY
   It is an object of the present invention to provide for a solution, or to at least reduce some
   of the drawbacks of the known prior art, or to provide for a useful alternative. The objects
15 are at least partly met by a load carrying bar for a roof rack, the load carrying bar having a
   length a height and a width. The load carrying bar comprises a channel with an opening
   for receiving a fastening member of a load carrying bar accessory. A cover is arranged to
   seal at least a portion of the opening of the channel of the load carrying bar, e g. to reduce
   air turbulence around the channel The cover comprises an attachment portion for
20 attaching the cover to the load carrying bar and channel sealing portion adapted to
   substantially seal at least a portion of the opening of the channel of the load carrying bar.
   The cover is configured to have a direction of deformation along the width of the load
   carrying bar to provide space for the fastening member of the load carrying bar accessory.
25 During mounting of a load carrying bar accessory the fastening member can be slid into
   the channel and along the length of the channel of the load carrying bar. As the fastening
   member is moved, the cover will deform along the width of the load carrying bar,
   simultaneously as the fastening member is moved. The cover is thus adapted to be
   deformed in the proximity of the opening as the fastening member is slid along the length
30 of the channel. The cover can be made in a material which substantially returns to its
   original form if the fastening member is removed or displaced from the current deformed
   section. If the fastening member is moved away from a section, that section will retain its
   original form, sealing the opening eg. by abutting a side edge of the opening or an
   opposing portion of the cover, such as an opposing strip member as will be described
35 below. This also permits the cover to leave space for the fastening member without

  WO 2014/184172                                                             PCT/EP2014/059721
                                                    3
   having protruding parts or maintaining an unnecessary large area of the channel open.
   The cover does not need to be removed after being mounted, as the cover is adapted to
   structurally conform during mounting of the fastening member of a load carrying bar
   accessory.
 5
   It is of course possible that the cover is sold completely separately from the load carrying
   bar. At least some objects of the present invention could thus be met by the cover itself,
   without the load carrying bar.
10 The cover can be configured to have a main direction of deformation along the width of
   the load carrying bar to provide the space for the fastening member of the load carrying
   bar accessory. In an embodiment, the cover is configured to be deformed substantially
   only in along the width of the load carrying bar.
15 The channel of the load carrying bar comprises side walls and a floor and more precisely
   a front side wall and a back side wall. The floor of the side wall extends between the front
   and rear side wall. The main direction of deformation is directed towards at least one of
   the side walls, i.e. towards the front and/or the back side wall. Optionally the main
   direction of deformation is directed towards at least one of the side walls, i.e. towards the
20 front and/or the back side wall, and not towards the floor of the channel The cover may
    be attached to the front and/or the back side wal of the channel. Optionally the main
   direction of deformation is directed substantially perpendicular towards at least one of the
    side walls, i.e. towards the front and/or the back side wall. The cover when deformed may
    not have to about the floor of the cover, or if it abuts the floor of the channel, it only abuts
25 lightly without imparting the floor of the channel with any significant pressure.
    According to an aspect, the cover can be formed by a single strip member or be formed
    by a first and a second strip member. The strip members)         extends parallel with the
    channel of the load carrying bar and can be inserted by a user when mounting the load
30 carrying bar to an automobile or before being mounted to an automobile. When the cover
    comprises a first and the second strip member, the first and the second strip members are
    adapted to cooperate to seal the opening of the channel of the load carrying bar. As the
    strip members deform, they deform in opposite directions but still have a main direction of
    deformation along the width of the load carrying bar to permit space for the fastening
35 member.

   The cover can be attached to the load carrying bar in numerous ways. A channel of the
   load carrying bar has generally side walls and a floor. The channel can be defined by the
   frame work of the load carrying bar, or be formed by a separate insert in the load carrying
 5 bar. The side walls can be a front side wall or a back side wall with respect to the main
   direction of travel of the automobile.
   According to an aspect, the attachment portion of the cover is attached in the proximity of
   the opening of the channel, to retain the cover to the load carrying bar. Optionally the
10 attachment portion of the cover is attached in the opening of the channel, to retain the
   cover to the load carrying bar.
   To attach the cover, the load carrying bar can be provided with at least one groove. The at
   least one groove can be arranged in the opening of the channel, e g. one on either side of
15 the opening of the channel. The attachment portion of the cover is arranged in the groove
   to retain the cover to the load carrying bar by e.g being inserted by a user or optionally
   form-moulded directly into the grove.
   The at least one strip members) of the cover can be provided with a hollow interior. In an
20 embodiment, the channel sealing and/or the attachment portion can be hollow
   According to an aspect, a portion of the at least one strip member is configured to
   collapse into the hollow interior to enable the deformation along the width of the load
   carrying bar. The collapse to provide space for the fastening member of the load carrying
25 bar accessory while still permit the strip member to retain its original shape after the
   fastening member has be displaced from the relevant section
   According to a second aspect, it is an object to provide a cover for a load carrying bar for
   a roof rack with a length, a height and a width. The cover is configured to be positioned in
30 a channel of the load carrying bar, or is positioned in a channel of a load carrying bar to
   cover the opening of the channel. The cover comprises a channel sealing portion adapted
   to substantially seal the opening of the channel of the load carrying bar and a biasing
    portion adapted to bias or retain the channel sealing portion towards the opening of the
   channel of the load carrying bar.

   The biasing portion of the cover is formed by at least two separate flanges extending from
   the channel sealing portion of the cover The separate flanges are adapted to bias the
   channel sealing portion towards the opening by the resilience of the flanges. The
   resilience is a function of the form and the material of the flanges and should be adapted
 5 so that a user can insert a fastening member without difficulties but still seal the opening
   in an adequate manner on those portions not occupied by the fastening member.
   The flanges can extend and are attached to the channel sealing portion substantially
   along the full length of the cover. The flanges are either formed together with the channel
10 sealing portion as one unitary piece of material or attached as separate components
   thereto. It is also possible that the biasing portion comprises a plurality of flanges
   extending along the length of the cover which are aligned in a first and a second row, or in
   a plurality of rows,
15 It is optionally or additionally possible that the biasing portion comprises flanges  with
   extend and are attached to the channel sealing portion substantially along the full width
   the cover. The flanges extending substantially along the width of the cover, and along the
   width of the load carrying bar after being mounted thereto, are substantially perpendicular
   to the flanges extending along the length of the cover, although they all have an extension
20 along a height direction
   The biasing portion of the cover can be provided with at least 10 separate flanges e g.
   arranged on an equally spaced distance from each other and positioned along the length
   of the cover 10.

25 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED IMBODIMENTS
   Figure 1 shows a load carrying bar 1 for a roof rack. A roof rack is intended during use to
   be mounted to eg. the roof of an automobile such as a car or truck. A first and a second
   load carrier foot are generally positioned on each side of the automobile so that the load
   carrying bar 1 extends transversely across the roof Of the automobile. The load carrying
30 bar 1 is formed by extruded material such as aluminum and has a substantially oval cross
   section as can be seen in figures 1 and 3a-3b for example with openings at each end
   (only one end shown in figure 1). The ends of the load carrying bar 1 can be sealed if
   desired by a separate lid, plug or by parts of the load carrier foot for example.

                                                   7
   The load carrying bar 1 comprises a channel 5 for receiving a fastening member for a load
   carrying accessory. A load carrying accessory can be a roof box, a bicycle carrier, a
   luggage carrier, a ski carrier, or any other load carrier suitable to mount on a roof rack.
   The fastening member is generally the member which is used to attached the load carrier
 5 accessory to the load carrying bar 1 and can be a screw comprising a head for example
   as shown in figure 3a-3b.
   For the purpose of orientation, the load carrying bar 1, and the cover 10 as described
   herein, has a length L usually extending along the width of the automobile, a height H
10 usually extending along the height of the automobile, and a width W usually extending
   along the length of the automobile, when the load carrying bar 1 is mounted in the
   intended way to the automobile.
   The load carrying bar 1 comprises a channel 5 in which the fastening member is intended
15 to be introduced when mounting the load carrier accessory for example. The channel 5
   extends along the full length of the load carrying bar 1 and is defined by an opening 6, a
   first and a second side wall 7, 8 and a floor 9. The first and the second side wall 7, 8 and
   the floor 9 of the channel 5 forms parts of a frame work structure of the load carrying bar 1
   and significantly enhances the rigidity of the load carrying bar 1. A cover 10 is arranged to
20 substantially seal the opening 6 of the channel 5 to reduce the air turbulence which
   otherwise can be formed about such channel in a load carrying bar. The cover 10 also
   prevents the intrusion of dirt or rubble to the channel which could obstruct the free
   passage of a fastening member for a load carrier accessory and thereby make the
   fastening member slide less easy in the channel 5.
25
    Figure 2 shows the load carrying bar 1 as seen along the length L in figure 1. Figure 2
   shows the load carrying bar 1, the channel 5, the opening 6, the first and the second side
   walls 7, 8 and the floor 9 of the channel 5. The width W and the height H of the load
   carrying bar 1 are also indicated The cover 10 comprises an attachment portion 11 and a
30 channel sealing portion 12. The primary purpose of the attachment portion is to retain the
    cover 10 to the load carrying bar 1 and the primary purpose of the channel sealing portion
    is to seal the opening 6 of the channel 5 of the load carrying bar 1. The cover 10 shown in
    figure 1 is formed by a first and a second strip member 15, 16, however, it should be
    noted that the cover 10 can be formed by only one strip member if desirable Ifonly one

   strip member is used, the form or dimension of the single strip member is adapted, e.g. by
   having a channel sealing portion 12.
   The cover 10 in the shown embodiment comprises a first and the second strip member
 5 15, 16. Each strip member comprising an attachment portion 11 and a channel sealing
   portion 12. The attachment portion 11 of the first strip member 15 and the second strip
   member respectively, is intended to retain the strip member 15 to the load carrying bar 1,
   while the channel sealing portion 12 are adapted to seal the opening 6 of the channel 5 in
   a cooperative manner The channel sealing portion 12 of the first and the second strip
10 member 15, 16 are adjacently positioned to cover or seal the opening 6 of the channel 5
   of the load carrying bar 1. An openable slot 17 is thus formed between the first and the
   second strip members 15, 16.
   In the shown embodiment, the attachment portion 11 of the first strip member 15 has a
15 cross section which has a substantially spherical forn adapted to be inserted into a
   groove 20 with a corresponding cross section The attachment portion 11 can be formed
   in other ways dependent on the desired location and extension of the cover 10 and the
   strip member 15. The groove 20 is partly formed by a portion of the load carrying bar 1
   defining the opening 6 of the channel 5 of the load carrying bar 1 but could be attached to
20 the load carrying bar 1 in any other fashion. The portions of the load carrying bar 1
   defining the opening 6 is indicated in figure 2 as 6, 6".
   The channel sealing portion 12 of the first strip member 15 is formed by a portion of the
   first strip member 15 having a substantially quadric and hollow cross section. Other
25 suitable cross sections could be oval, oblong, rectangular or the like The channel sealing
   portion 12 could also be formed by a flap like member which cover or seal the opening 6
   of the channel 5 by overlapping the opening 6 of the channel 5 or by overlapping a portion
   of a second strip member.
30 The channel sealing portion 12 of the first strip member 15 adapted to be deformed. By
   permitting deformation, the cover 10 can permit access to the channel 5 of the load
   carrying bar 1 for a fastening member to a load carrying bar accessory. In the shown
   embodiment, the channel sealing portion 12 is hollow, i.e. has a hollow interior, which
   permits the first strip member 15 to be deformed into the void of the hollow structure
35 Optionally, or additionally, the deformation could be implemented by having another

   eg. formed by polyurethane, polyurethane, polypropylene, polystyrene or the like, or
   mixtures thereof.
 5 Figures 3a-3b show the load carrying bar 1 of figures 1 and 2 having a fastening member
   30 inserted into the channel 5 and the slot 17 formed between the first and the second
   strip member 15 16. The fastening member 30 is formed by a screw 31 having a
   threaded stern 32 and a screw head 33. The screw head 33 is inserted at the end of the
   load carrying bar 1 and slid into position along the length L of the channel 5 of the load
10 carrying bar 1. As is notable in figure 3b, the first and the second strip members 15, 16
   effectively seal the portion of the opening 6 of the channel 5 which is not occupied by the
   fastening member 30. Substantially only the portion in the close proximity of the stem 32
   of the screw 31 is not sealed
15 The arrows A and A' indicate a main direction of deformation for the cover 10, which in the
   shown embodiment is along the width W of the load carrying bar 1. As the cover 10
   comprises a first and a second strip member 15, 16, the cover 10 has in the shown
   embodiment two opposing deformation directions, however, both of the opposing
   deformation directions are along the width W of the load carrying bar 1. With specific
P0 reference to figure 3a, the first strip member 15 deform substantially from the center of the
   opening 6 of the channel 5 towards the left side of the opening 6 of the channel 5, while
   the second strip member 16 deforms substantially from the center of the opening 6 of the
   channel 5 towards the right side of the opening 6 of the channel 5. In an advantageous
   embodiment. the cover 10 is thus adapted to be deformed in two opposing directions
25 along the width of the load carrying bar to accommodate space for a fastening member for
   a load carrying bar accessory,
    It should be noted that it is possible that the first and the second strip members 15, 16
   also deform slightly in a vertical direction, ie. along the height H, but that is not the main
30 direction of deformation to provide space for the fastening member 30. Hence, a cover 10
    having a main direction of deformation along the width of the load carrying bar is
    advantageous. As can be noted, not only is the main direction of deformation along the
   width of the load carrying bar 1, but also along the width of the channel 5. It has been
   found that it is advantageous to have a cover 10 arranged in the proximity of the opening

   width of the load carrying bar 1
   The cover 10 can be formed by any suitable deformable but self-restoring material such
 j as a thermoplastic material combinations of aluminum and thermoplastic material or
   similar. The channel sealing portion 12 can be formed by a material different from the
   attachment portion 11 or from the same material, preferably as one unitary piece of
   material
10 Figure 4 shows an embodiment of a cover 10 for a load carrying bar 1 As described
   above, the load carrying bar 1 comprises a channel 5 in which the fastening member for a
   load carrying bar accessory is intended to be introduced, e g. when mounting the load
   carrier accessory. The channel 5 extends along the full length of the load carrying bar 1
   and is defined by an opening 6, a first and a second wall 7, 8 and a floor 9. The first and
15 the second wall 7, 8 and the floor 9 of the channel 5 forms parts of a frame work structure
   of the load carrying bar 1 adapted to enhance the rigidity of the load carrying bar 1.
   As can be noticed in figure 4, the cover 10 comprises only one strip member 15. The
   cover 10 is in this embodiment adapted to be deformed mainly in the horizontal direction,
20 ie. along the width W of the load carrying bar 1 as indicated by the arrow A in figure 4.
   Turning to figure 5, the arrow A indicate a main direction of deformation for the cover 10,
   which in the shown embodiment is along the width W of the load carrying bar 1. As the
   cover 10 in this embodiment only has one strip member 15' the cover 10 has in the
25 shown embodiment one deformation direction. With reference to figure 5, the strip
   member 15' deforms substantially from the side of the opening 6 of the channel 5,

   Figure 6 shows an embodiment of a cover 10 for a load carrying bar 1. The load carrying
   bar 1 is adapted to be connected with a first and a second load carrier foot (not shown).
   The cover 10 uses the principle of sealing the opening 6 of the channel 5 of the load
   carrying bar 1 by biasing a portion of the cover 10 towards the side edges of the opening
 5 6 of the channel 5 of the load carrying bar 1. It thus seals the opening 6 from the inside of
   the channel 5 of the load carrying bar 1. The cover 10 in the shown embodiment
   comprises a biasing portion 11 and a channel sealing portion 12. The biasing potion 11 of
   the cover 10 is adapted to bias, or retain, the channel sealing portion 11 of the cover 10
   against the opening 6 of the channel 5 of the load carrying bar 1, or more accurately
10 against the side edges of the opening 6 so that the opening 6 of the channel 5 is
   effectively sealed
   The biasing portion 11 of the cover 10 is formed by at least two flanges, preferably
   separated from each other although being connected via the channel sealing portion 12.
 5 The shown embodiment comprises a plurality of flanges 11' preferably 10 or more, more
   preferably 20 or more flanges 11
   A cross section of the load carrying bar 1 and the cover 10 along the length L is shown
   figure 7. Figure 5 shows flanges 11 arranged substantially perpendicular to the length L
20 of the cover 10 thus having an extension along the width W of the load carrying bar 1 after
   being mounted thereto.
   Figure 8 shows another embodiment of a cover 10 for a load carrying bar 1, The load
   carrying bar 1 is adapted to be connected with a first and a second load carrier foot (not
25 shown). The cover 10 used the principle of sealing the opening 6 of the channel 5 of the
   load carrying bar 1 by biasing a portion of the cover 10 towards the side edges of the
   opening 6 of the channel 5 of the load carrying bar 1. It thus seals the opening 6 from the
   inside of the channel 5 of the load carrying bar 1. The cover 10 in the shown embodiment
   comprises a biasing portion 11 and a channel sealing portion 12. The biasing portion 11 of
30 the cover 10 is adapted to bias, or retain, the channel sealing portion 11 of the cover 10

   The biasing portion 11 of the cover 10 is formed by at least two flanges 11", preferably
   separated from each other although being connected via the channel sealing portion 12.
   The shown embodiment comprises a first and a second of flange 11". It is however
   possible that the biasing portion 11 comprises more flanges although in such case those
 5 flanges are preferably aligned along the length L of cover 10. The first and the second
   flanges 11" can be formed by a number of individual flanges, as indicated by the dashed
   lines in figure 7 which together substantially have the same form as the first and the
   second flanges 11 " shown in figures 6 and 7. The number of flanges can be 2 or more, 5
   or more, optionally 10 or more flanges.
10
   A cross section of the load carrying bar 1 and the cover 10 along the length L is shown
   figure 9. Figure 5 shows flanges 11 " arranged with an extension substantially parallel to
   the length L of the cover 10 thus having an extension along the length L of the load
   carrying bar 1 after being mounted thereto.
   The reference 20' in figures 1-9 is used to illustrate how a portion of the cover 10 has
   been deformed after a fastening member has been inserted in the channel 5 of the load
   carrying bar 1. The fastening member (not shown) can be similar or identical to the
   fastening member 20 described with reference to figures 3a-3b.
20
   Figure 10 shows an embodiment in which the cover 10 comprises a weak section 40. The
   weak section 40 is in the shown embodiment formed by a cut out 41 in the cover 10. The
   cut out extends along the length L of the cover 10 and the load carrying bar I and is
   preferably arranged at the centre of the cover 10, as shown in figure 10. The cut out
25 preferably extends along the full length L of the cover 10 The weak section permits a user
   to run a fastening member, such as a screw and the one shown in figure 3a and figure 11
   along the length of the channel 5 so that a portion of the fastening member protrudes
   through the opening 6 of the channel 5. The fastening member will during such motion
   split the cover 10 at the weak section and deform the cover 10 in a horizontal and vertical
30 direction, as is illustrated in figure 11. This is advantageous as a large portion of the
    channel 5 can remain fully covered by the cover 10 even after a load carrying bar
    accessory has been mounted.
    Generally, cover 10 can be formed by any suitable deformable but self-restoring material
35 such as a thermoplastic material, combinations of aluminum and thermoplastic material or

                                                13
   similar. The channel sealing portion can be formed by a material different from the biasing
   portion 11 of the cover 10, or from the same material preferably as one unitary piece of
   material. In an embodiment, the channel sealing portion comprises a first thermoplastic
   material and the biasing portion comprises a second thermoplastic material different from
 5 the first thermoplastic material.
