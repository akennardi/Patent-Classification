                            BREATHING ASSISTANCE APPARATUS
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Technical Field
           The present invention relates to apparatus for treating sleep apnoea. More
 5 specifically, the present invention provides a nasal interface for the supply of respiratory
   gases, but most particularly positive pressure gases.
   Summary of the Prior Art
           In the art of respiration devices, a variety of respiratory masks which cover the nose
   and/or mouth of a human user in order to provide a continuous seal around the nasal and/or
10 oral areas of the face are well known. Masks that provide gas at positive pressure within
   the mask for consumption by the user are also well known. The uses for such masks range
   from high altitude breathing (i.e., aviation applications) to mining and fire fighting
   applications, to various medical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
           Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is a sleep disorder that affects up to at least 5% of
15 the population in which muscles that normally hold the airway open relax and ultimately
   collapse, sealing the airway. The sleep pattern of an OSA sufferer is characterised by
   repeated sequences of snoring, breathing difficulty, lack of breathing, waking with a start
   and then returning to sleep. Often the sufferer is unaware of this pattern occurring.
   Sufferers of OSA usually experience daytime drowsiness and irritability due to a lack of
20 good continuous sleep.
           In an effort to treat OSA sufferers, a technique known as Continuous Positive
   Airway Pressure (CPAP) was devised. A CPAP device consists of a gases supply (or
   blower) with a conduit connected to supply pressurised gases to a patient, usually through a
   nasal mask. The pressurised air supplied to the patient effectively assists the muscles to
25 keep the patient's airway open, eliminating the typical OSA sleep pattern.
           The procedure for administering CPAP treatment has been well documented in both
   the technical and patent literature. Briefly stated, CPAP treatment acts as a pneumatic
   splint of the airway by the provision of a positive pressure, usually in the range 4 to 20 cm
   H 20. The air is supplied to the airway by a motor driven blower whose outlet passes via an

                                                 -2
   air delivery hose to a nose, full face, nose and mouth, or oral mask that is sealingly engaged
   to a patient's face, preferably by means of a harness or other headgear. An exhaust port is
   usually also provided in the delivery tube proximate to the mask or on the mask itself
   More sophisticated forms of positive airway pressure devices, such as bi-level devices and
 5 auto-titrating devices, are described in US Patent No. 5,148,802 of Respironics, Inc. and
   US Patent No. 5,245,995 of Rescare Limited, respectively.
            One requisite of respiratory masks has been that they provide an effective seal
   against the user's face to prevent leakage of the gas being supplied. Commonly, in prior
   mask configurations, a good mask-to-face seal has been attained in many instances only
10 with considerable discomfort for the user. A common complaint of a user of CPAP
   therapy is pressure sores caused by the mask about the nose and face and in particular in
   the nasal bridge region of the user. This problem is most crucial in those applications,
   especially medical applications, which require the user to wear such a mask continuously
   for hours or perhaps even days. In such situations, the user will not tolerate the mask for
15 long durations and optimum therapeutic or diagnostic objectives thus will not be achieved,
   or will be achieved with great difficulty and considerable user discomfort.
            US Patent No. 5,477,852 of Airways Ltd, Inc. discloses a nasal positive airway
   pressure device that has a pair of nasal members each having a cannula tip to be inserted
   into the nares of the patient. Each cannula is tapered from a substantially circular cross
20 section outside the patient's nostril to a substantially oval cross section at the tip inserted
   into the nostril. An inflatable cuff surrounds each cannula with the interior space of the
   cuff communicating with the lumen of the cannula through at least one aperture in the
   sidewall of the cannula. The nasal members are connected to one or more flexible hoses
   that, in turn, are connected to a source of positive air pressure. In use, positive air pressure
25 is supplied to each cannula tip through the air hoses and nasal members. The positive air
   pressure inflates the cuffs to hold the nasal members in place and to effect treatment. The
   nasal device of US Patent No. 5,477,852 is attached to headgear that is located about a
   patient's head. This headgear could be considered by many patients as cumbersome and
   uncomfortable.
30          Conventional nasal masks used for administrating CPAP treatment are also
   considered uncomfortable and cumbersome, and prior art nasal masks can be noisy due to

                                                  -3
   air leaks. These disadvantages in many cases are a formidable obstacle to patient
   acceptance of such treatment. Therefore, a substantial number of patients either cannot
   tolerate treatment or choose to forego treatment. It is believed a number of such patients
   might benefit from a nasal positive airway pressure apparatus that is more convenient to
 5 use and comfortable to wear, thereby resulting in increased treatment compliance.
            Innomed Technologies, Inc. manufactures a nasal cannula device called the
   NASALAIRETM. In this device air or oxygen travels down a wide bore conduit to nasal
   cannula. The NASALAIRETM creates a physical seal between the nares and itself, and
   relies on the absence of leaks around the cannula and the nares to deliver pressure supplied
10 by a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) blower to the airway of the wearer.
            US6,119,694 of Respironics Georgia, Inc discloses a nasal mask having a nare seal
   and lateral support members to support the mask.
            W02004/073778 of ResMed Limited discloses a nasal mask including a frame
   where headgear is provided with rigid sections that extend to the nasal mask.
15          W004/041341 of ResMed Limited discloses headgear for a patient mask that
   includes a sewn on rigid section to the back area of headgear straps to provide rigidity to
   the straps.
            US6,907,882 of ResMed Limited discloses a nasal mask and headgear that is
   attachable to the frame of the nasal mask. The headgear straps have rigid sections integral
20 with the releasable connectors that attach the headgear to the mask.

   DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
            The breathing assistance apparatus of the present invention including masks and
 5 headgear as described in the preferred embodiments of this invention can be used in
   respiratory care generally or with a ventilator. It is described below with reference to use
   in a humidified CPAP system.
            A humidified Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) system is shown in
   Figure 1. A patient 1 is receiving humidified and pressurised gases through a patient
10 interface 2 connected to a humidified gases transportation pathway or inspiratory conduit 3.
    Alternative delivery systems may also be used such as, VPAP (Variable Positive Airway
   Pressure) and BiPAP (Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure) or numerous other forms of
   respiratory therapy. A nasal mask 2 is illustrated in Figure 7 but other masks such as oral,
   full face or nasal cannula may be used.
15          An inspiratory conduit 3 is connected to an outlet 4 of a humidification chamber 5
   that contains a volume of water 6. The inspiratory conduit 3 may contain heating means or
   heater wires (not shown) that heat the walls of the conduit to reduce condensation of
   humidified gases within the conduit 3.
            The humidification chamber 5 is preferably formed from a plastics material and
20 preferably has a highly heat conductive base (for example an aluminium base) that is in
   direct contact with a heater plate 7 of humidifier 8. The humidifier 8 is provided with
   control means or an electronic controller 9 that may comprise a microprocessor based
   controller executing computer software commands stored in associated memory.
            The controller 9 preferably receives input from sources such as user input means or
25 a dial 10 through which a user of the device may, for example, set a predetermined required
   value (preset value) of humidity or temperature of the gases supplied to patient 1. The
   controller 9 may also receive input from other sources, for example temperature and/or
   flow velocity sensors 11, 12, through a connector 13 and a heater plate temperature sensor
    14. In response to the user set humidity or temperature value input via the dial 10 and the
30 other inputs, the controller 9 determines when (or to what level) to energise the heater plate

                                                   -8
   7 to heat the water 6 within the humidification chamber 5. As the volume of the water 6
   within the humidification chamber 5 is heated, water vapour begins to fill the volume of
   the chamber above the water's surface and is passed out of the humidification chamber 5
   outlet 4 with the flow of gases (for example air) provided from a gases supply means or
 5 blower 15 that enters the chamber 5 through an inlet 16. Exhaled gases from the patient's
   mouth are passed directly to the ambient surroundings in Figure 1.
            The blower 15 is provided with variable pressure regulating means or variable
   speed fan 21 that draws air or other gases through a blower inlet 17. The speed of the
   variable speed fan 21 is controlled by an electronic controller 18 (or alternatively the
10 function of the controller 18 may be carried out by the controller 9) in response to inputs
   from the controller 9 and a user set predetermined required value (preset value) of pressure
   or the fan speed via dial 19.
            Figures 2 and 3 show a first embodiment of a patient interface of the present
   invention. This patient interface is a nasal mask 2. The nasal mask 2 is comprised of a
15 mask base 22 and body 23. The body 23 is substantially tubular with two nasal pillows 24,
   25 extending from it. The nasal pillows 24, 25 are preferably frustoconical in shape and in
   use rest against a patient's nares, to substantially seal the patient's nares. The body 23 has
   an external lip 28 that frictionally fits in a channel in the mask base 22.
            The body 23 and nasal pillows 24, 25 of the nasal mask of the present invention are
20 shown in further detail in Figures 6 and 7. The body and pillows are preferably integrally
   moulded in a substantially flexible plastics material. In the preferred form this material is
   silicone, but other appropriate materials, such as, rubber, thermoset elastomer or
   thermoplastic elastomer, such as Kratonsm may be used.
            The nasal pillows 24, 25 are preferably an elliptical cone and as such are tubular
25 and allow for a passage of gases to flow from the tubing 3 and through the mask body 23.
   The pillows 24, 25 are preferably angled toward one another and each have a preferably
   elliptical outlet 26, 27 that may be slightly offset from the centre of each pillow 24, 25, as
   shown in Figure 6.
            Figures 18 and 19a show a nasal pillow 24 with an offset outlet in more detail. The
30 pillow 24 has an outer profile 200 and inner profile 201 with respective centre points 202,

                                                 -9
   203. The inner profile 201 (outlet of the nasal pillow 24) is offset inward, by a horizontal
   spacing 204 and vertical spacing 205. Meaning the outlet 201 of the nasal pillow is offset
   horizontally 204 towards the middle of the nose and vertically 205 towards the user's upper
   lip. Offsetting the outlet 201 downwards in this manner allows the outlet to be inserted
 5 into a user's nostril without the outer profile 200 pushing the user's upper lip. Offsetting
   the outlet 201 inwards allows the pillow to better seal on the septum of the user's nose in
   use.
            The outlet 201 may also be angled compared to the outer profile 200. For example
   in Figure 18, there is a horizontal angle difference between the outer profile 200 and outlet
10 201 shown as 206. A similar vertical angle difference between the outer profile 200 and
   outlet 201 is shown as 207.
            With the outer profile and inner profile having different sections or offsets allows
   the gradient of the connecting surface between the profiles to be changeable. This is shown
   in the graphs of Figures 19b, 19c and 19d. The connecting surface between the inner 201
15 and outer 200 profiles can have differing gradients, 208, 209, 210. The different gradients
   208, 209, 210 of the connecting surface are possible due to the difference in offset
   difference 211, 212 (horizontal, vertical or angled) between the inner 201 and outer 200
   profiles.
            There may also be a difference in the rate of change of the gradient (as illustrated in
20 the difference between 208 and 210). This allows easier insertion of the pillow 24 into a
   user's nostrils due to more lead in and better sealing that may be achieved due to more
   ergonomic contouring of the connecting surface that contacts the user's nostril.
            Referring back to Figure 7, the external lip 28 on the mask body 23 is an area of
   reduced circumference around the tubular part of the body 23. A projection 47 may be
25 provided on the lip 28 that fits with a corresponding recess or channel (discussed below) on
   the mask base 22 to ensure correct assembly of the nasal mask.
            The mask base 22 is shown in further detail in Figures 4 and 5. The mask base 22
   is a ring or sleeve type attachment. The base 22 is preferably made from a substantially
   hard (rigid) plastics material, such as polypropylene, polycarbonate or acetyl. However,
30 other appropriate materials may be used. The base 22 has an internal circumferential

                                               - 10
   recessed area or channel 45 on one side and a semi-tubular projection 29 on its other side.
   When assembling the mask body 23 to the mask base 22 the channel 45 receives the lip 28.
    These parts are maintained together by friction fit, however other types of fitting may be
   provided for, such as a snap or bump fitted part or the body may be over moulded to a clip
 5 that causes the fitting to the mask body 23. In this form the friction fitting of the lip 28 to
   the recessed area 45 is assisted by elongate projections 49 extending along the central part
   50 of the mask base 22. The projection 47 on the mask body 23 allows for correct fitting
   or keying of the mask base to the mask body, such that when the lip 28 is fitted into the
   recessed area 45, the projection 47 enters the recess 48 formed in the mask base 22.
10         The semi-tubular projection 29 is curved in this embodiment such that a ball jointed
   connector end 46 such that a connector 30 can be fitted into it. The projection 29 forms a
   socket for the connector end 46 and the connector end can swivel within the socket. The
   connector 30 is attached to a tube 31 to allow for gases to be passed to the nasal mask 2.
   The tubing 31 may be attached to inspiratory conduit 3 or the tubing 31 may simply be the
15 inspiratory conduit 3.
           In alternative embodiments the projection 29 may not be semi-circular but the inner
   surface of the base 22 may be curved and form a socket for receiving the connector end 46.
           The base 22 has an extension or partial lip 32 extending beneath the semi-tubular
   projection (socket) 29. A slot 33 is created between the socket 29 and extension 32. The
20 extension and slot is used to fit the mask base 22 to the headgear 21. In this embodiment
   the extension 32 is substantially curved to follow the shaped of the projection 29.
   However, in other forms the extension may be substantially straight or otherwise shaped.
           In use, the nasal mask is assembled with headgear 21. The headgear 21 in the
   preferred form is comprised of headgear straps 35, 36, 37, 38 and a substantially curved
25 and elongate member 34. The member 34 is curved and substantially rigid, or at least more
   rigid than the headgear straps.
           The headgear straps 35, 36, 37, 38 are preferably made from a composite foam
   layered material, such as Breathoprene Tm. The headgear 21 preferably includes a first strap
   35 and a second strap 36. The first strap 35 extends in use over the forehead or top front
30 area of a patient's head. The second strap 36 extends around the back of the patient's head.

                                                 - 11
    The headgear 21 also has side straps 37, 38 that in use extend down the cheeks of a patient
   and the ends of the straps terminate in the upper lip area of the patient in use.
            Referring to Figure 2, the curved and elongate member 34 is comprised of a central
   section 42 and contoured side arms 41, 54. A substantial length of each of the side arms
 5 41, 54 overlaps and is attached to the side straps 37, 38. However, the side straps 37, 38
   only extend partially along the length of the side arms 41, 54 so as to terminate beneath the
   cheek or near the upper lip region. As the side straps 37, 38 are made from a soft foam
   type material they provide a comfortable fitting of the headgear and curved member 34,
   while the substantially rigid side arms 41, 54 provide rigidity and stability to the headgear
10 21 and nasal mask 2. The attachment between the side straps and rigid extension side arms
   may be made by gluing, sewing or other appropriate fastening.
            Preferably the side arms of the curved member 34 are integrally moulded with the
   central section 42. The curved member 34 is preferably three dimensionally moulded to a
   shape to substantially match the cheek contours of a human. The side arms 41, 54 are
15 preferably of thinner width (cross-section) than the central section 42. As the side arms 41,
   54 are moulded of a plastics material to be substantially thin they are capable of being bent
   or adjusted to allow for better and more comfortable fit to a patient. The side arms 41, 54
   may also include weakened or narrow areas 39 to allow for additional bending, moulding
   or twisting of the arms 41, 54 to better fit the headgear to individual patients. For example,
20 in the embodiment shown in Figures 2 and 3, the narrowed area 39 corresponds to the
   cheek bone area of a patient and allows for the side arms 41, 54 to easier bend or twist to
   fit the contours of the patient's face.
            In alternative embodiments the side arms may have weakened areas that are
   narrower in cross-section to that of the remainder of the side arms. A narrower cross
25 section area would also provide a weakened area that may be easily manipulated.
            In alternative embodiments of the present invention the side straps of the headgear
   may not extend under and along the length of the curved member but be attached to the
   distal ends of the straps. This attachment may be by hook and loop material, as is known
   in the art, or by other attachment methods as known in the art. In this form, the arms of the
30 curved member may have padding underneath them or no padding at all.

                                                 -  12
            Referring to Figure 3, the curved elongate member has a central section 42 that in
   an assembled form supports the mask base and body such that the pillows 24, 25 rest
   against the patient's nares. The central section 42 is a half circle that is integrally moulded
   with the side arms 41, 54. The central section 42 has a raised area 43 on its exterior, at the
 5 apex of the half circle. The raised area 43 is shaped to receive the mask base 22. To
   assemble, a patient merely needs to slide the mask base 22 into the central section 42 such
   that the raised area 43 fits into the slot 33 on the mask base 22.
           The side arms 41, 54 of the curved member 34 preferably have varying cross
   sectional thickness. The ends of the arms 41, 54 attached to the central section 42 are
10 thicker over the most curved parts 55, 56 of the arms, whereas the straighter parts of the
   arms 57, 58 have a narrow cross-section. Therefore, the thicker ends 55, 56 hold their
   shape better.
           In alternative embodiments, the mask base 22 may be formed integrally with the
   curved member 34. Therefore, the central section and base would be one and would not be
15 able to be separated from one another.
           An example of this is shown in Figures 20 to 22, the eighth embodiment of the
   patient interface and headgear 300. Here, the mask base 301 and the curved elongate
   member 302 are integrally formed, for example, by moulding or the like. The elongate
   member comprises arms 303, 304 similar to that described above. Also the mask body 305
20 has integral nasal pillows 306, 307 similar to that described above in relation to Figure 2.
           As can be seen in Figures 21 and 22 in this eighth embodiment the headgear straps
   308, 309 do not extend down the arms 303, 304 as with other embodiments. In this
   embodiment the headgear straps 308, 309 attach through recesses 310, 313 at the end of the
   arms 303, 304 extending along the arms are inner pads 311,312 that rest against the
25 patient's cheekbones in use and provide comfort to the patient's face. The pads 311, 312
   only extend up to near the attachment recesses 309, 310. The pads are preferably made
   from a foam type material, such as the laminated material that the headgear straps are made
   from. The pads 311, 312 preferably do not extend beyond the edges of the arms 303,304.
           Referring back to Figures 2 and 3, alternatively, the curved member 34 may be
30 formed as two separate pieces. That is, the central section 42 may be formed as two parts

                                                   - 13
   with a central split seam, the two left and right halves joined in use. The two left and right
   parts could either be joined along a seam as described above, with the base 22 slotting into
   the slot 33 as described above, or alternatively, each of the two left and right arms may be
   attached one to each side of the base 22.
 5          Where a "substantially continuous elongate member" or "curved member" is
   referred to in this specification, it refers to any of the options for the curved member 34
   outlined above.
           The side arms 41, 54 may also include a loop 40 or detached section. This is where
   a section of the side arms 41 is not attached to the strap 38, 37 lying underneath. Thus the
10 detached section 40 of the side arms forms a loop to which a tubing attachment 44 (such as
   that shown attached to another strap in Figures 2 and 3) may be looped to the side arms 41,
   54 and the tubing 31 attached to either of the side arms.
           The connector 30 in the preferred form is a ball and socket jointed connector to
   allow for the tubing 31 to swivel in the mask base 22. The tubing 31 may be attached to
15 any of the headgear straps. However, a tube attachment 44 is shown where the tubing is
   attached by fasteners, such as hook and loop fastener, to the first strap 35. In other
   embodiments the tubing 31 may be attached to either the side straps 37, 38 or merely
   allowed to fall freely from the nasal mask 2.
           Although a ball and socket joint, as described above, between the mask base 22 and
20 tubing 31 is preferred other connections may be utilised, such as a flexible piece of
   silicone, or other appropriate connection. The connection between the base and tubing
   must be able to be flexed or rotated to allow for the tubing to be moved without causing the
   dislodgement of the nasal mask 2 from the user's nares.
           The mask body 23 may be provided with nasal pillows of various different sizes,
25 such that user's may remove an existing mask body and simply attach a different sized
   body to the mask base 22.
           Alternative headgear may be used with the patient interface of the present
   invention. In particular, alternative headgear is shown in use with the first form of the
   patient interface (of Figure 2) in Figure 8. Here the headgear may include an additional
30 strap 53 extending from the cheek region of the side straps 41 and extending behind the

                                                 - 14
   user's head. This lower additional strap 53 may also include substantially rigid arms 51
   similar to the arms 41 described above. Any number of connecting straps 52 may also be
   provided between the upper strap 36 and lower strap 53. Again, the arms 51 would provide
   stability and rigidity to the additional strap 53.
 5          In the embodiment described above, when the patient interface of the first form is in
   use, the user's face causes the mask base 22 and body 23 to clip with the curved member
   34. This is due to the angle of the curved member 34 and fixing of the mask base 22 and
   body 23 to the curved member 34.
            Further, in all forms, the curved member 34 transfers the load of the patient
10 interface away from the user's nose and to the cheek regions of the user.
            A second form of the patient interface and headgear of the present invention is
   shown in Figures 9 and 10. In this embodiment a mouthpiece 100 is attached to the
   substantially tubular mask body 23 substantially below the nasal pillows 24, 25. The
   mouthpiece 100 is preferably a flap that is fittable within the patient's mouth. A gases
15 pathway extends through the mask body 23 and through the centre of the mouthpiece 100,
   such that in use a patient or user is supplied with gases via the nasal pillows 24, 25 and the
   mouthpiece 100. The flap 100 is preferably made from a silicone plastics material but
   other appropriate materials such as rubber, thermoset elastomer or thermoplastic elastomer,
   such as KratonTM may be used. The flap 100 is preferably integrally moulded with the
20 mask body 23 and nasal pillows 24, 25. In use the flap 100 sits within the user's mouth
   between the user's teeth and lips.
            In this second form the headgear and particularly the curved member 34 is
   substantially the same as that described in relation to the first embodiment.
            A third form of the patient interface and headgear of the present invention is shown
25 in Figure 11. In this embodiment a mouthpiece as well as a nose blocking device is
   attachable to the mask base 22. The mouthpiece 110 and nose blocking device 111 are
   preferably integrally formed. The mouthpiece 110 has an inner vestibular shield 112 that is
   similar to the flap 100 described above. Therefore the vestibular shield 112 in use sits
   within the patient's mouth between the patient's teeth and lips and provides an at least
30 partial seal between the user and the shield 112.

                                                 - 15
            A tubular extension 113 extends through the mouthpiece 110 to the mask base 22
   from the vestibular shield 112. The extension allows for gases to be passed to the patient
   from the conduit 31.
            The nose blocking device 111 in use rests under the user's nose and blocks the
 5 user's nares.
            In this third form the headgear and particularly the curved member 34 is
   substantially the same as that described in relation to the first embodiment.
            A fourth embodiment of the patient interface and headgear of the present invention
   is shown in Figure 12. In this embodiment a mouthpiece 120, 121 is attachable via a
10 tubular extension 122 to the mask base 22. The mouthpiece is made up of an outer
   mouthpiece flap 120 and an inner vestibular shield 121. The shield 121 is substantially the
   same as that described in reference to the third embodiment. The outer mouthpiece flap
    120 rests in use outside the user's mouth and substantially seals about the user's mouth.
   The outer mouthpiece flap 120 and an inner vestibular shield 121 are described in further
15 detail in United States patent number 6679257, the entire contents of which is herein
   incorporated by reference.
            In the fourth form of the headgear and particularly the curved member 34 is
   substantially the same as that described in relation to the first embodiment.
            A fifth form of the patient interface and headgear of the present invention is shown
20 in Figures 13 and 14. This embodiment is very similar to the fourth embodiment except
   the mouthpiece is simply an outer mouthpiece flap 130. This flap 130 is fittable to the
   mask base 22 by way of the tubular extension 131. Again, as above, the headgear and
   particularly the curved member 34 are substantially the same as that described in relation to
   the first embodiment.
25          A sixth form of the patient interface and headgear of the present invention is shown
   in Figure 15. In this embodiment the patient interface is a full face mask 140 that extends
   over a user's nose and mouth and under the user's chin in use. The mask 140 has a body
    142 made from a substantially rigid plastics material and a cushion 144 made from a
   substantially soft plastics material. The mask and cushion are preferably similar to that

                                                - 16
   described in more detail in United States patent application number 11/368004, the entire
   contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.
            A tubular inlet port 143 is formed in the mask body 142. The tubing 31 is
   attachable to the port 143 to provide gases to the user wearing the mask.
 5          The headgear is substantially similar to that described in relation to Figure 2 (the
   second form); however, the curved member 141 differs. The curved member 141 does not
   have a mask base similar to that described in the second form in which to attach to.
   Therefore, the curved member 141 has a central section 145 that curves under the inlet port
    143, effectively anchoring on the inlet port. The curved member 141 is moulded in
10 substantially the same manner as described with reference to the second form.
            A seventh form of the patient interface and headgear of the present invention is
   shown in Figures 16 and 17. Here, the headgear and curved member is similar to that
   described above in the sixth embodiment, where the curved member 141 has a central
   section that curves under and anchors onto an inlet port 151 on a patient interface 150. The
15 patient interface 150 is an integral mouth mask 152 and nasal pillows 153. The mouth
   mask 152 preferably extends under the user's 155 chin, as shown in Figure 17.
            The interface 150 has a substantially rigid body 154 that has substantially soft
   cushion 156 attached to it. The cushion 156 is preferably of the type disclosed in United
   States patent number 6951218 (the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by
20 reference) having an inner 157 and outer 158 cushions.
            Integrally formed in the outer cushion 158 are nasal pillows 153. Preferably two
   nasal pillows 159, 160 are formed in the cushion 158. These are substantially tubular and
   carry gases in use from the inside of the interface 150 to the user's 155 nares. The outer
   cushion 158 and nasal pillows 159, 160 are preferably made from a soft pliable plastics
25 material such as silicone but other appropriate materials such as rubber or KRATON"M
   may be used.
            A similar but slightly different embodiment to that of Figure 16 is a ninth
   embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Figure 23. Here the interface 400 is
   substantially the same as the interface 150 of Figure 16 and 17. The interface 400 has a
30 body 401 with integral nasal pillows 402, 403. The nasal pillows may be integrally formed

                                                -  17
   with the body or separately formed and simply assembled to the body before use. The
   nasal pillows 402, 403, as above, are substantially tubular and carry gases in use from the
   inside of the interface 400 to the user's nares. Again, nasal pillows are preferably made
   from a soft pliable plastics material such as silicone but other appropriate materials such as
 5 rubber or KRATONTM may be used.
           In this embodiment the body 401 may be made of a more rigid material than the
   nasal pillows or simply be made from a soft pliable plastics material as are the nasal
   pillows.
           Attached to an inlet 404 of the body 401 is an elongate member 405 similar to that
10 described in any of the embodiments detailed above, but particularly that of Figures 20 to
   22. The elongate member 405 has arms 406, 407 that extend along a user's cheekbones
   then up towards the user's ears when in use. The arms 406, 407 are preferably made from
   a substantially rigid material, preferably a plastics material. For the users comfort each of
   the arms 406, 407 have inner pads (only one pad 408 is shown in Figure 23) extending
15 along their inner sides, particularly where the arms are incident on the user's face.
           The arms 406, 407 have recesses 409, 410 at their ends to which headgear straps
   411, 412 are attached. The arms 406, 407 may also each have optional side hooks (of
   which only one side hook 413 is shown), again made out of a substantially rigid material,
   to which additional side headgear straps 414, 415 may be attached.
20         At the centre of the elongate member 405 is formed an integral inlet 416 that
   matches and attaches to the inlet 404 on the body. This integral inlet 416 receives a
   conduit or tube 417 that is connected in use to a supply of gases. Preferably the tube 417
   has a swivelable elbow 418 (for example, a ball joint socket similar to the one described
   above). Preferably on the elbow 418 are a number of holes 419 that provide an exhaust
25 vent for gases exhaled by the patient in use.
           In this ninth embodiment of the patient interface and headgear the interface is a
   mouth mask and nasal pillows. In alternative forms the patient interface may be a full face
   mask that is attached to an elongate member and headgear similar in form to those
   described above and particularly in relation to Figure 23.
