FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to toilet cleaning devices that allows for a practical and convenience way to place
and replace treatment and fragrance product in the toilet tank without having to physically remove the
top lid of the toilet tank to place and replace the treatment and fragrance product. With the dispenser
tube, treatment and fragrance product can be easily place and replace by lowering it into to the toilet
tank via the dispenser tube.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Cleaning toilet is not a job that everybody likes to do. People will try to find different ways to keep their
toilet clean and well fragrance with minimal effort and time to achieve that result.
There are many treatment and fragrance products available on the market that will clean and fragrance
the toilet. These products can take the form of liquid in a bottle or in a gel block and they can either be
placed in the toilet tank or be hung from the toilet bowl. The objective of these products is to clean and
fragrance the toilet each time the toilet is flushed.
Some people do not like the treatment and fragrance products to be hung from the toilet bowl because:
1.        they can be unsightly; and
2.        they do not adequately clean and fragrance the toilet due to the limited time that they are in
          contact with the water in the toilet bowl.
As a result a lot of people prefer the treatment and fragrance products that are placed directly in the
toilet tank itself and to replace the treatment and fragrance product when required - usually when the
colour of the treatment and fragrance product is quite diluted.
Some have pointed out that there are drawbacks to having treatment and fragrance products place
directly inside the toilet tank, namely:
1.        the inconsistency in the mixing rate of the treatment and fragrance product with the water. If
          the toilet is not used regularly then too much of the treatment and fragrance product will mix
          with the water when flushed. Although the toilet will be cleaned and well fragrance, the
          treatment and fragrance product will need to be replaced more often;
2.        when the toilet is flushed repeatedly, the time between each flushes does not allow for the
          treatment and fragrance product to adequately mix with the water resulting in the toilet not clean
          and fragrance properly; and
3.        difficulty is removing the top lid of the toilet tank to put the treatment and fragrance product into
          the toilet tank. In some styles of toilet, to remove the top lid of the toilet tank one has to
          completely dissemble the flushing mechanism and this is too hard and difficult for people to do.
In addition, there are other types of toilet dispenser that dispense and mix the correct amount of the
treatment and fragrance product by using external tanks and conduits that are attached to the toilet
tank, but they can be unsightly and too difficult to install and use.
Despite the various options that are available to clean and fragrance the toilet and even with its
drawbacks people still prefer just to place the treatment and fragrance products inside the toilet tank
when it comes to cleaning and fragrance the toilet. The reason for this is because the treatment and
fragrance product is placed inside the toilet tank and it is out of sight and they know when to replace a
new treatment and fragrance product by the colouration of the water.
The primary object of this invention is to allow an easy method to place and replace the treatment and
fragrance products to and from the toilet tank without having to physically remove the top lid of the toilet
tank, which can be quite difficult with some styles of toilet. By installing and fixing the dispenser tube
inside the toilet tank the treatment and fragrance product can be easily introduce inside the toilet tank
without having to remove the top lid of the toilet tank.
                                                          2

Installing and fixing the dispenser tube inside the toilet tank is an easy process and does not require a
trade person to so it. It is simply achieved by cutting a small hole to the same diameter of the dispenser
tube to the top lid of the toilet tank. Once the hole is cut, the dispenser tube can be secured installed
and fixed underneath the top lid of the toilet tank with the self-tightening mechanism forming part of the
dispenser tube.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The primary object of the invention is to allow a user-friendly way people can place and replace the
treatment and fragrance products from the toilet tank without having to physically remove the top lid of
the toilet tank each time the treatment and fragrance product is replaced.
The objective and features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description
taken from the accompanying diagrams.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE TOILET DISPENSER TUBE
Referring to Diaqram 1/2
The dispenser tube comprises of the following components:
1.        A lid covering the opening of the dispenser tube to blend in with the top lid of the toilet tank.
          The lid can be made from various material and in any colour so that once covered opening of
          dispenser tube it will blend in with the top lid of the toilet tank.
          (a)       Item 01 on Diagram 1/2 shows the top aerial view of the lid.
          (b)       Item 02 on Diagram 1/2 shows the side on view of the lid.
2.        A remomeble crossover bar with a hole in the middle can be manually slotted across the top of
          the dispenser tube to allow the treatment and fragrance products to be tied to. The remomeble
          crossover bar allows for easy placement and replacement of the treatment and fragrance
          product when needed. To replace the treatment and fragrance product you just simply lifted up
          the crossover bar and remove the old treatment and fragrance product. Then you just needed
          to tie a new treatment and fragrance product to the crossbar and lowered it down into the
          dispenser tube.
          (a) Item 03 on Diagram 1/2 shows the top aerial view of the opening of the dispenser tube with
               the crossover bar in position across the dispenser tube.
          (b) Item 04 on Diagram 1/2 shows the position of the crossover bar slotting into the opening of
               the dispenser tube.
          (c) Item 05 on Diagram 1/2 shows the side view of the crossover bar that can easily be slotted
               in or removed from the dispenser tube.
          (d) Item 06 on Diagram 1/2 shows the end side view of the crossover bar and showing how
               and where the crossover bar can be slotted in or removed from the opening of the dispenser
               tube.
          (e) Item 07 on Diagram 1/2 shows the side view of the opening of the dispenser tube with a
               slot that has been cut out on the side of the dispenser tube for the crossover bar to be
               slotted in and be in positioned.

3.        The dispenser tube can be installed and fixed onto the top lid of the toilet tank with the self
          tightening mechanism sitting below the top lid of the toilet tank and when tightened the
          dispenser tube will securely fixed to the top lid of the toilet tank - see items 08 and 10.
4.        An enclosed cylindrical tube to hold the treatment and fragrance product in place - see item
          11.
5.        There are openings in the cylindrical tube to allow the treatment and fragrance product to mix
          with the tank water - see Item 09.
Referring to Diaqram 2/2
Toilet Dispenser Diagram 2/2 shows a cross-sectional view of the dispenser tube in relation to other
existing toilet components in the toilet tank. The dispenser tube is installed and fixed to the top lid of the
toilet tank by first cutting a small hole to the same diameter as the dispenser tube. Then the dispenser
is secured to the top lid of the toilet tank with a self-tightening mechanism.
