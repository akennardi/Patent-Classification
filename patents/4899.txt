DESCRIPTION
TITLE
     A method for risk prediction and medication guidance of
osteoporosis based on exome analysis and panel design
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
     The present invention provides a method for risk prediction and
medication guidance of osteoporosis based on panel design and
exome analysis.    To be more specific, the invention provides a
wholesome     method   from   individual exome    variants  analysis,
osteoporosis related gene panel design to the identification of
possible osteoporosis related gene variants of the a individual, and
therefore, provides genetic information to help doctors predict the
risk of osteoporosis and select the suitable drugs for osteoporosis
patients.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
     Osteoporosis is a chronic disease which is higher risk at older
generation and women, especially in menopause (oestrogen strength
bones, lacking in it will cause bones brittle). Genetic factors are
recognized to play an important role in regulating bone mineral
density (BMD) and fracture risk so as to effect pathogenesis of
osteoporosis. Several candidate genes have been implicated including
                                  I

ACTN3. Cho J[1] studied the association of the ACTN3 polymorphism
with osteoporotic status in older Korean adults and claimed that the
ACTN3 R577X genotype may influence decline in muscle and bone
health phenotypes in older Korean adults. Huilin Jin [2] focused on
promoter and intron 1 polymorphisms of COL1A1 which interact to
regulate transcription and susceptibility to osteoporosis.   Based on
juvenile osteoporosis patients genetic study, Hartikka H[3] drew
conclution that heterozygous mutations in the LRP5 gene are
associated with primary osteoporosis in children. So by analyzing the
genetic information of an individual ,we can know his or her chance
of getting osteoporosis.
     Currently, the most effective way to prevent further bone loss is
to take medications. And there are some commonly used drug
treatments including Bisphosphate, Antibodies and Hormone therapy.
However, different drugs may suit different people because of the
gene polymorphism. Specially, the therapeutic effect of the drugs can
be effected by some factors such as targets, metabolic enzymes and
transporters. Calcitonin can inhibit bone resorption via its receptor
(CTR) on osteoclasts. JBeaudreuil[4] suggested that a specific isoform
and amounts of total hCTR mRNA are linked to increased bone
resorption in postmenopausal osteoporosis by effecting the effect of
Calcitonin. Estrogens play an important role in regulating bone
                                   2

homeostasis and preventing postmenopausal bone loss, which act
through binding to two different estrogen receptors (ERs), including
ESR1 and ESR2. M Sano [5] suggested that genetic variation at the ER
locus may be associated with some determinants for BMD and bone
metabolism      in   postmenopausal     women.     According     to  the
investigation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450), a common liver enzyme,
the changes in the susceptibility gene loci of CYP450 may play roles
in pathogenesis of non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head.
 [6] As CYP450 has many subtype, especially the CYP450 A4 makes up
1/3 of the liver enzyme. The low activity of CYP450 A3 may leads to
non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head, and enhance the
risk of osteoporosis. Many home researches also pointed out that
three locus mutation CYP3A4*4, CYP3A4*5, CYP3A4*6 may lower the
activity of CYP3A4, however, the relationship between CYP3A4 and
NONFH remains unknown. As for transporters, Zoledronate works
with the help of multidrug resistance-associated protein, but he
increase in MRP is responsible for drug resistance in cells [7].
      After collecting these data and looking up relevant materials, we
grasped the basic background knowledge, then we classified the main
drugs and arrange the acting enzyme, reaction receptor as we aimed
to design a panel that illustrates the relationship among factors
                                    3

above. So that the panel provides patients personalized medicine and
they avoid risks when accepting treatment.
      Referring to the panel we designed and individuals' genetic
variants, patients can easily get Personalized Medicine. With the
development of the Internet, by analyzing genetic big data, we can
find a proper way for treatment. Doctors can use these information to
tailor medical care to help patients individually.
      This panel brings up an emerging method for risk prediction and
medication guidance of osteoporosis. Admittedly, patients can locate
the relevant medicine       amount     hundreds   of thousands  drugs,
however, many of which may be not suitable for individuals or
someone affected with other disease. Our panel aims to provide
medicine    guidance as suggesting some specific drugs, picking
suitable prescription     for different   symptom such     as primary
osteoporosis and secondary osteoporosis .What's more, adolescent,
the old and postmenopausal women will gain different treatment by
referring our panel.
      Furthermore, nowadays       many medicines that are used in
hospital have side effects such as hypophosphatemia, arthralgia,
ostealgia, etc. For instance , taking corticosteroid hormone may lead
to irritable cough. Such effects may get in the way of treatments, or
                                     4

even do harm to patients' health. However, by reviewing the panel,
we can analysis the patients' gene and find the suitable drugs
precisely and effectively, which can help to avoid using the drugs
which may cause serious side effects.
     Finally, since different drugs may suit patients with different
genotypes, there is no recommendation for first line drug, which
means patients should try a variety of drugs before finding the drug
which suits him or her mostly. What's worse, unlike antihypertensive
drugs for hypertension that can cause an instant effect, the medicines
for osteoporosis come into force at a relatively slow rate. It may takes
months to find out whether the drug is effective or not. Thus it may
waste time on determining the proper medicine patients need under
the one-size-fits-all model of traditional medicine, or even miss the
optimal opportunity for treatment .Nevertheless, our invention is
advantageous for patients to detect disease and choose appropriate
medicine.    Specifically,  the program     can  detect  their   genetic
information and foresee the effect of medicine . This gives patients a
chance to find what they need directly , therefore get a better
respond to the treatment. Not only patients benefit from the
procedure, but doctors also gain easier access to evaluate the
condition   of patients    , then control    the disease    in case   of
deterioration and list useful prescription for personalized therapy.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
         This invention aims at establishing a tailored therapy method
for osteoporosis at genetic level. We searched on 6 main databases to
select 7 genes related to osteoporosis and 36 genes related to
treatment of osteoporosis and designed a panel including these genes.
Then with the tools including BWA, Picard-tools, GATK, and Annovar,
individuals' genetic variants can be found by the following steps:
      1.Mapping
                                         7

        Mapping is to map the reads against a reference sequence,
after which the reads would become clear to be processed
     2.Preprocessing
        Preprocessing is to calibrate the incorrectly matched reads by
marking duplicates, re-alignment and quality score recalibration.
     3.Variants calling
        Variants calling is to detect and identify SNPs and Indels.
     4.Variants filtration
        Filtration is to filter SNPs and Indels separately with different
criteria to calibrate the result of variant calling and exclude the
false-positive SNPs and Indels.
     5. Annotation
        Annotation is to annotate the location and the frequency of
the variants, which amino acids are affected, whether the variants
can cause protein coding changes, and whether the variants are
associated with a certain disease.
        Finally, by using a Perl program we designed to a Perl
program we designed can be used to select target region so that we
have an insight into genetic information related to osteoporosis of
the individual and help to achieve the tailored therapy. It can be
                                      8

found out that if the individual are vulnerable to osteoporosis and
which drugs suit him or her. As a result, the tailored therapy can be
achieved, which can help healthy people to prevent osteoporosis and
help patients to use drugs safely and appropriately.
DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING
     The following drawings are only for the purpose of description
and explanation but not for limitation, where in:
     Figure.1and Figure.2      show the     flow chart of panel     and
procedures.
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
Designing of the panel
   Osteoporosis is a serious public health concern worldwide, and
because of genetic polymorphism, some people are more vulnerable
than others. In order to get the susceptibility genes on which we would
focus and conduct gene annotation, we conducted search on the
following four databases:
1. webmed
2. eMedicine
                                    9

3. ncbi
4. Drugs
   As a result, we select 7 most important susceptibility genes related to
osteoporosis: PTH, COL1A1, HS6ST1, LMNB2, ACTN3, P2X7, LRP5.
   There are many kinds of drugs for treatment of osteoporosis.
However, since different drugs have different targets, metabolic
enzymes and transporters, different drugs may suit patients with
different genotypes and there is no recommendation for first line drug.
So when determining which drug a patient should use, the genes related
to the targets, metabolic enzymes and transporters of the drugs should
be taken into consideration.
   In order to find the main drugs of osteoporosis, we referred to 3
guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis:
1. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of primary osteoporosis
(2017)   [J] . Chinese General Practice, 2017, 20 (32): 3963 -3982.
2.   Brazilian   guidelines  for   the    diagnosis  and     treatment  of
postmenopausal      osteoporosis    [J]  revbrasreumatol   .    2017 ,  57
(2):452-466

management of osteoporosis [J]Osteoporosis and Sarcopenia.2016, (2):

   By integrating the information in these guidelines, we selected 7 main
kinds of drugs, which are used most commonly: Bisphosphonates,
Calcitonin,     PTHa,   SERMs,     Strontium,     Vitamin    D   analogue,
Menatetrenone
   And then we searched on 2 databases to find out the targets,
metabolic enzymes and transporters of these drugs and the related
genes of them:
1.drugbank
2.PharmGKB
   Finally, we found the location of these genes on Pubmed.(tablel)

Procedures of Genome Comparison
1. Mapping
Mapping is to achieve the alignment of the reads to a reference
sequence, i.e., the human genome in our case. This practice applies BWA
for efficient data disposal.
Step 1. Build an index file for the reference sequence
-> bwa index -a bwtsw pwd/database/humandb/hgl9_reorder.fa
Step 2. Sequence alignments and output the comparison results in the
SAM file.
                                       19

'@RG\tl D:osteoporosis\tLB:osteoporosis\tSM:osteoporosis\tPL: ILLU M IN
A' > mapping/osteoporosis.hgl9.sam
2. Preprocessing
Preprocessing is to calibrate the errors after mapping. Prior to the actual
variant calling, 5 parts for sort sam file, marking duplicates, re-alignment,
quality score recalibration and coverage assessment are applied.
Picard is used to perform the step and 2 for marking duplicates:
Part 1 Sort sam file
Step    1.   Input   the    osteoporosis.sam     file and    generate    the
osteoporosis_sorted.bam file, the alignments are sorted with respect to
their chromosomal position and convert to bam file.
-+java-jar /pwd/software/picard/picard.jar SortSam
I=mapping/ osteoporosis.hg19.sam
O=preprocess/ osteoporosissorted.bam
SO=coordinate
CREATEINDE=true
Part 2 Mark duplicates
                                       20

Step 2. Input file osteoporosissorted.bam, mark the duplicates which
are reads or read pairs in the same position have to many sequences as
a result of PCR amplifying, and output osteoporosismarked.bam.

I=preprocess/ osteoporosissorted.bam
O=preprocess/ osteoporosismarked.bam
M=preprocess/ osteoporosismetrics
CREATEINDEX=true
Part 3 Indel realignment
Realign the sequence in order to avoid errors due to insertions and
deletions. The purpose of this step is to perform a local re-alignment of
reads near indels region and minimize the error rate of the alignment. In
general, most of the required realigning areas are near the Indels region
because of base mismatch can easily be mistaken for SNP. GATK is used
to perform this part.
Step 3. Operate the RealignerTargetCreator to define intervals to target
for local realignment and output osteoporosisbam.intervals.

Step 4. Operate the IndelRealigner to perform local realignment of reads
around indels and output osteoporosis markedrealined.bam as the
final matched file.

                                    22

Part 4 Base Recalibration
This part is to detect and correct for patterns of systematic errors in the
base quality scores, which play an important role in weighing the
evidence for or against possible variant alleles during the variant
discovery process, so it's important to correct any systematic bias
observed in the data.
Step 5. Operate BaseRecalibrator to detect systematic errors in base
quality scores and output the osteoporosis _recal.table file.

                                     23

Step 6. Input osteoporosis _realigned.bam file and operate PrintReads to
write    out    sequence     read    data,   output   the    result   in
osteoporosis_recal.bam.

-o preprocess/osteoporosisrecal.bam
Part 5 Coverage Assessment
Step 7. Input osteoporosisrecal.bam, operate DepthOfCoverage to
assess sequence coverage by a wide array of metrics partitioned by
sample and output osteoporosis _libbase. The depth of coverage is an
important index to quantify the quality of sequencing and can act as
quality value recalibration.

-- includeDeletions
3. Variants calling
Variants calling is to detect and identify SNPs and Indels.
Step: Input osteoporosis _recal.bam , operate HaplotypeCaller to
simultaneously detect mutation sites such as SNP and Indel based on
de-novo splicing and HMM and output the Traw.vcf file including the
SNP, INDEL information.

4. Variants filtration
                                      25

Filtration is to calibrate the result after variant calling and exclude
false-positive snps and indels by filter snps and indels separately with
different criteria.
Step 1. Input osteoporosis _raw.vcf, select SNPs and output a new vcf
file osteoporosis _rawsnps.vcf containing snps.

-o filter/ osteoporosis _rawsnps.vcf
Step 2. Input osteoporosis _raw_snps.vcf, operate VariantFiltration to
achieve        filtration   by    certain     criteria    and     output
osteoporosisfilteredsnps.vcf.

-12.5 || ReadPosRankSum < -8.0"
--filterName "SNP_FILTER"
-o filter/ osteoporosis _filtered_snps.vcf
Step 3. Input osteoporosis _raw.vcf, select Indels and output a new vcf
file osteoporosis _rawsnps.vcf containing INDEL.
->  java -jar /pwd/software/GATK/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar
-T SelectVariants
-R /pwd/database/humandb/hgl9_recorder.fa
-V calling/osteoporosis_raw.vcf
-selectType INDEL
-o filter/osteoporosisrawindels.vcf
Step 4. Input osteoporosis _rawindels.vcf, operate VariantFiltration to
achieve     filtration by   certain  criteria and  output  osteoporosis
 _filteredindels.vcf.
->  java -jar /pwd/software/GATK/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar
-T VariantFiltration
                                     27

-V filter/ osteoporosis _rawindels.vcf
--filterExpression "QD < 2.0 || FS > 200.0 | ReadPosRankSum < -20.0"
--filterName "INDELDILTER"
-o filter/ osteoporosis _filteredindels.vcf
Step     5.   Input  osteoporosis   _filtered_snps.vcf and  osteoporosis
_filteredindels.vcf, operate CombineVariant to combine the two files
together and output osteoporosis.vcf.
->  java -jar /pwd/software/GATK/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar

-R /share/diskl/database/humandb/hgl9_recorder.fa
-V: snps filter/ osteoporosis _filteredsnps.vcf
-V:indels-filter/ osteoporosis _filteredindels.vcf
-o filter/ osteoporosis.vcf -genotypeMergeOptions PRIORITIZE
-priority indels, snps
Step 6. Input osteoporosis.vcf, operate SelectVariants to select all SNPs
and Indels set can be passed and output osteoporosis _pass.vcf.
->  java -jar /pwd/software/GATK/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar
                                      28

  -T SelectVariants

-V       filter/      osteoporosis      _.filtered.snps.indel.vcf    -select
"vc.isNotFilteredo"
-o filter/ osteoporosis _pass.vcf
5. Annotation
Variants annotation is to annotate the location of the variants, and the
frequency in different populations database, which amino acids are
affected, and identify whether the variants cause protein coding changes,
and whether the variants are associated with a certain disease.
Software Annovar, code annotatevariation.pl and tableannovar.pl are
used to perform the following steps:
Step 1. Convert vcf format to avinput format.
-4Perl    /pwd/software/An nova r/convert2an novar. pl     -format  vcf4old
filter/ osteoporosis _pass.vcf > annovar/ osteoporosis.avinput
Step    2. Input osteoporosis.avinput, operate Annovar to achieve
annotation and output osteoporosisrelatedsites.txt
-)+Perl          /pwd/software/annovar/table_annovar.pl            annovar/
osteoporosis.avinput /pwd/database/humandb/

-nastring .
6. Selecting target region
    After acquiring the gene related to osteoporosis, use Perl to compare
the gene we have known to the multiple annotation on exome of human
beings,     by  extracting   the  information   related   to  osteoporosis
susceptibility gene from database, all the data correlate to osteoporosis
are extracted.
     Firstly, open the file osteoporosis_relatedgene.txt and assign it to
GENE,      then   opening   the  file   downloaded    from   the   Internet
WES.hgl9_multianno.txt and assign it to SITE.
    Secondly, create an array and apply the while cyclic sentence to
assign each elements in GENE to the array after chomp the blank.
Another while cyclic sentence aims to compare the GENE and SITE and
select the all the information related to osteoporosis. To be specific,
splitting the SITE then chose the line 7 which displayed the gene, we
                                      30

match the osteoporosis susceptibility gene to the line 7 and pick out the
all the data in the suited row.
     Finally close the SITE and GENE, output the statistic to the file
osteoporosis_relatedsites.txt.
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
open GEN E,"osteoporosisrelated_gene.txt";
open SITE," osteoporosispass.txt";
open OUT,">osteoporosis relatedsites.txt";
my @genearray=();
while(<GENE>){

    foreach my $gene(@gene_array){
        if($Iine[6] eq $gene){
             print OUT "$_";
        }
    }
}
close SITE;
close OUT.
