SIDE-BY-SIDE VEHICLE
RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] The present application claims divisional application status from Australian
patent application 2014315278 having a filing date of 4 September 2014, the complete
disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002] The present invention generally relates to all-terrain and utility vehicles and,
more particularly, to side-by-side utility vehicles configured to carry at least an operator,
a passenger, and cargo.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003] Generally, all-terrain vehicles ("ATVs") and utility vehicles ("UVs") are configured
to carry one or two passengers and cargo over a variety of terrains. Side-by-side
vehicles, in which the driver and passenger are seated beside each other on laterally
spaced apart seats, have become popular because of the ability to allow the passenger
to share the driver's viewpoint and riding experience instead of being positioned behind
the driver.
[0004] ATVs and UVs are configured for various types of terrain and performances, and
as such, it may be desirable for the vehicle to have a low center of gravity. A lower
center of gravity may provide the ATVs and UVs with more stability on rugged terrain.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
[0063] Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the
several views. Unless stated otherwise the drawings are proportional.
[0064] The embodiments disclosed below are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit
the invention to the precise forms disclosed in the following detailed description. Rather,
the embodiments are chosen and described so that others skilled in the art may utilize
their teachings. While the present disclosure is primarily directed to a utility vehicle, it
should be understood that the features disclosed herein may have application to other
types of vehicles such as all-terrain vehicles, motorcycles, watercraft, snowmobiles,
people movers, and golf carts.
[0065] With reference to FIGS. 1-8, a utility vehicle 2 is shown. Vehicle 2 may include
light-weight components and/or may position heavier components lower on vehicle 2 in
order to lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2.
[0066] Vehicle 2 includes a front end 4 and a rear end 6. A plurality of ground engaging
members, including front wheels 8 and rear wheels 10, support utility vehicle 2 on a
ground surface. In one embodiment, front and rear wheels 8 and 10 may include tires
having an outer diameter of approximately 26-32 inches. When including 26-inch tires
on front and rear wheels 8, 10, the center of gravity of vehicle 2 may be lowered.
Illustratively, the width between the centers of the hubs of rear wheels 10 defines a
                                              6

width of vehicle 2, which may be approximately 45-55 inches. Illustratively, the width of
vehicle 2 at ride height and without any payload (e.g., cargo, driver, and/or passenger)
may be approximately 50 inches.
[0067] Rear end 6 of utility vehicle 2 supports portions of a powertrain assembly 250,
which, as shown in FIG. 38, includes at least an engine 252, a variable clutch assembly
254, illustratively a continuously variable transmission ("CVT"), a transmission 255, front
final drive unit 256, rear final drive unit 258, an exhaust assembly 280, and an air intake
assembly 260. Portions of powertrain assembly 250, such as engine 252, transmission
255, and variable clutch assembly 254, may be positioned on vehicle 2 such that the
weight distribution of vehicle 2 may be approximately 40/60 or approximately 35/65, as
measured from front end 4 to rear end 6 along longitudinal axis L. Additionally,
powertrain assembly 250 may be configured to lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2.
For example, the position of engine 252 may be lowered in order to lower the center of
gravity of vehicle 2. In one embodiment, engine 252 may be lowered by approximately
5-10 mm, and more particularly, by approximately 7 mm, in order to lower the center of
gravity of vehicle 2. Also, the position of variable clutch assembly 254 and/or
transmission 255 may be lowered by approximately 5-10 mm, and more particularly, by
approximately 7 mm in order to lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2.
[0068] In one embodiment, engine 252 is configured for at least approximately 60-75
hp. Additionally, front final drive unit 256 may be configured as a close-ratio drive unit.
By configuring front final drive unit 256 as a close-ratio drive unit, less slip is needed to
engage front wheels 8 when vehicle 2 operates in an all-wheel drive and/or four-wheel
drive mode. Furthermore, by configuring front final drive unit 256 as a close-ration drive
unit, vehicle 2 may include active descent control.
[0069] A frame assembly 20 extends between front end 4 and rear end 6 of utility
vehicle 2 and is supported on front wheels 8 and rear wheels 10. Frame assembly 20
supports a cargo box 12 at rear end 6 and an operator area 14 between front end 4 and
rear end 6. As shown in FIG. 5, in one embodiment, cargo box 12 includes a first side
wall 12a, a second side wall 12b, and a removable panel 13, which provides access to
an engine compartment for powertrain assembly 250 and other components of vehicle 2
positioned below cargo box 12. As shown in FIGS. 1-4, side wall 12a supports an
engine intake port 502 and side wall 12b supports a clutch intake port 500 for an air
                                                 7

intake assembly 260 or 260', as detailed further herein. In one embodiment, intake ports
500 and 502 include filters therein.
[0070] Cargo box 12 may be comprised of a polymeric material. In one embodiment,
cargo box 12 is comprised of a light-weight polymeric material, which decreases the
weight of vehicle 2. As such, the center of gravity of vehicle 2 may be lowered when
cargo box 12 is comprised of a light-weight material.
[0071] Operator area 14 includes seating for at least an operator and a passenger in a
side -by- side arrangement. Illustratively, operator area 14 includes a plurality of bucket
type seats 15, each having a seat bottom 16 and a seat back 18. Seat bottom 16 and
seat back 18 may be coupled to each other or may be separate therefrom. Alternative
embodiments of seats 15 may include a bench-type seat, in which one seat bottom 16
and one seat back 18 support both the operator and the passenger. In one
embodiment, the height of seat back 18 may be vertically adjustable to accommodate
different heights of operators and passengers. Additionally, in one embodiment of seats
15, seat bottom 16 may be configured to slide or otherwise move in a longitudinal
direction to further increase the comfort of the operator and passenger. Further details
about seats 15 of vehicle 2 may be disclosed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application

[0074] Referring to FIGS. 9A-11, frame assembly 20 extends along a longitudinal axis L
of utility vehicle 2 (FIG. 6) and includes a front frame portion 22, a mid-frame portion 24,
and a rear frame portion 26. Frame assembly 20 includes forward longitudinally
extending members 28 extending between front frame portion 22 and rear frame portion
26. A plurality of cross-members 30, 32, and 34 extend transversely to longitudinal axis
L and are coupled to both forward longitudinally-extending members 28. Additionally, a
skid plate 86 may be coupled to forward longitudinally-extending members 28 and/or
cross-members 30, 32, and 34. Skid plate 86 also extends between front frame portion
22 and rear frame portion 26 and is positioned below forward longitudinally-extending
members 28 and cross-members 30, 32, and 34.
[0075] At front frame portion 22, forward longitudinally-extending members 28 are
coupled to alignment arm brackets 36 for a front suspension assembly 170, as detailed
further herein. Illustratively, front frame portion 22 includes at least four alignment arm
brackets 36. Additionally, forward longitudinally-extending members 28 are coupled to a
lower plate member 38, which is spaced apart from and positioned below an upper plate
member 39. Upper plate member 39 includes brackets 40, which may be integrally
formed with upper plate member 39 or, alternatively, welded or otherwise coupled
thereto.
[0076] As shown in FIG. 11, upper plate member 38 includes an opening, which may be
configured to cooperate with a winch assembly (not shown). Lower plate member 39
includes a plurality of accessory mounts, illustratively openings 37, which may be
configured to couple with accessories and/or cargo. Additionally, some of openings 37
are configured as tie-downs for receiving a hook or other coupling device for coupling
cargo to vehicle 2. As such, frame assembly 20 integrally includes mounts for
accessories and cargo. Referring to FIG. 12, lower and upper plate members 38, 39
may support an accessory 110, such as a bumper, brush guard, or other similar
member configured to protect front end 4 of vehicle 2 from damage. For example,
                                                 9

accessory 110 may be coupled to lower plate member 38 and brackets 40 of upper
plate member 39 with coupling assemblies 112.
[0077] Referring to FIGS. 12 and 13, coupling assemblies 1 12 may be configured as
expansion members, such as expansion bolts, configured to extend through openings in
bracket 40 and openings 37 in lower plate member 39 in order to secure accessory 110
to front frame portion 22. Coupling assemblies 112 include a support member 122, a
washer 124, a sleeve 116, and a bolt 118. Support member 122 is coupled to a frame
member 114 of accessory 110. Washer 124 is positioned against the front surface of
support member 122. Bolt 118 is inserted through washer 124 and support member 122
until a flange 120 of bolt 118 contacts washer 124. Bolt 118 is received within a
cylindrical opening of sleeve 116.
[0078] In order to couple accessory 110 with front frame portion 22, sleeve 116 extends
through integral openings 37 in lower plate member 39 and brackets 40 of upper plate
member 38. A lip 126 of sleeve 116 engages an inner surface of lower plate member 38
and/or brackets 40. Bolt 118 is received within sleeve 116 such that sleeve 116
expands when bolt 118 is tightened in order to secure accessory 110 to front frame
portion 22. As such, frame assembly 20 integrally includes various mounting points for
accessories, such as accessory 110. Additionally, the configuration of coupling
assemblies 112 is such that it is not necessary for accessory 110 to be held in place at
front end 4 of vehicle 2 while assembling accessory 110 on vehicle 2.
[0079] Referring again to FIGS. 9A-10, a forward powertrain support member 42 is
coupled to forward longitudinally-extending members 28 and is positioned rearward of
lower plate member 38. Forward powertrain support member 42 may be configured to
support a portion of a powertrain assembly 250, for example front final drive unit 256
(FIG. 38).
[0080] Additionally, as shown in FIGS. 9A-10, forward longitudinally-extending members
28 are coupled to first upstanding members 44 and second upstanding member 45 at
front frame portion 22. Illustratively, front frame portion 22 includes two first upstanding
members 44 and two second upstanding members 45. First upstanding members 44
include generally vertical portions 44a, generally angled portions 44b, and generally
rearward portions 44c. Vertical portions 44a are coupled to upper plate member 39 and
lower plate member 38. Rearward portions 44c of first upstanding members 44 of front

frame portion 22 are angled upwardly. In one embodiment, rearward portions 44c are at
an angle a of approximately 30-32 degrees from horizontal and are approximately 8-12
inches above the top surface of the front tires along a line C, as shown in FIG. 9B.
 Illustratively, angle a is approximately 31.3 degrees and the distance along line C is
approximately 10.1 inches. As such, first upstanding members 44 are sufficiently
spaced apart from front wheels 8 to provide sufficient space in the wheel well area for
maximum turning radius. In other words, the geometry of front frame portion 22 does
not interfere with or limit the turning radius of front wheels 8. In one embodiment, the
front tires have a diameter of approximately 30 inches and the configuration of front end
4 of vehicle 2 does not interfere with or limit the turning radius of front wheels 8.
[0081] First upstanding members 44 also support a generally U-shaped frame member
54 coupled to the upper ends thereof. More particularly, vertical portions 44a of first
upstanding members 44 are coupled to forward longitudinally-extending members 28
and rearward portions 44c of first upstanding members 44 are coupled to U-shaped
frame member 54, such that U-shaped frame member 54 is positioned above forward
longitudinally-extending members 28. U-shaped frame member 54 includes a cross
member 56 and a support member 58.
[0082] Second upstanding members 45 support a brace 46 extending therebetween.
Brace 46 is coupled to U-shaped frame member 54. Additionally, second upstanding
members 45 are coupled to braces 60, which are angled forwardly. The lower ends of
braces 60 are coupled to forward longitudinally-extending members 28 and the upper
ends of braces 60 are coupled to second upstanding members 45.
[0083] Referring to FIGS. 9A-10, mid- frame portion 24 includes lower longitudinally
extending members 62 and upper longitudinally-extending members 64. Lower
longitudinally-extending members 62 are coupled to forward longitudinally-extending
member 28 with frame members 66. Lower longitudinally-extending members 62
include front portions 62a, which are coupled to U-shaped frame member 54, horizontal
portions 62b, which are coupled to frame members 66, and rear portions 62c, which are
coupled to a cab frame assembly 150, as detailed further herein. Front portions 62a
may be approximately 4-8 inches from the outer surface of the tire of front wheel 8
along a line D, as shown in FIG. 9B. Illustratively, the distance along line D is
approximately 6.0 inches. Additionally, frame members 66 may be approximately 6-10
                                               11

inches from the outer surface of the tire of front wheel 8 along a line E, as shown in FIG.
9B. Illustratively, the distance along line E is approximately 8.3 inches. The distance
from front wheel 8 to frame members 66 and front portions 62a provides sufficient
space within the wheel well of front wheels 8 such that the turning radius of front wheels
8 is not compromised.
[0084] Illustratively, horizontal portions 62b may be coupled to front and rear portions
62a, 62c with coupler assemblies 68. Alternatively, horizontal portions 62b may be
integrally formed with front and rear portions 62a, 62c, or may be coupled thereto with
conventional fasteners (e.g., welds, rivets, bolts, and/or adhesive). Lower longitudinally
extending members 62 may be coupled to upper longitudinally-extending members 64
with brackets 65.
[0085] Upper longitudinally-extending members 64 include horizontal portions 64a and
angled portions 64b. Horizontal portions 64a are coupled to front portions 62a of lower
longitudinally-extending members 62. Additionally, horizontal portions 64a may be
coupled to U-shaped frame member 54 with frame members 70. Horizontal portions 64a
may be integrally formed with angled portions 64b, or alternatively, may be separate
therefrom and coupled thereto with conventional fasteners (e.g., welds, rivets, bolts,
and/or adhesive). Angled portions 64b extend rearwardly from horizontal portions 64a
and are coupled to rear portions 62c of lower longitudinally-extending members 62.
[0086] Referring to FIG. 10, mid-frame portion 24 also includes a dashboard support
member 72 coupled to cross-member 56 with an arm member 74 and a steering
support member 76. Additionally, dashboard support member 72 is coupled to front
portions 62a of lower longitudinally-extending members 62 with members 78 and
brackets 79. In one embodiment, dashboard support member 72 and members 78 may
be comprised of a light-weight material. In one embodiment, members 72, 78 are
comprised of polymeric material, a carbon fiber material, and/or an aluminum material to
lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2.
[0087] Mid-frame portion 24 also includes a seat frame assembly 80. Seat frame
assembly 80 includes a front cross-member 82 and a rear cross-member 84 generally
parallel to front cross-member 82. Seats 15 are configured to be removably coupled to
seat frame assembly 80.
                                               12

[0088] Referring to FIGS. 9A-10, and 14-16, rear frame portion 26 includes upper
rearward longitudinally-extending members 88 which have upper portions 88a and
lower portions 88b. Illustratively, upper portions 88a and lower portions 88b may be
integrally formed with each other. Alternatively, upper portions 88a and lower portions
88b may be separate from each other and coupled thereto with conventional fasteners
(e.g., welds, rivets, bolts, and/or adhesive). Upper portions 88a may be coupled to rear
portions 62a of lower longitudinally-extending members 62 and/or a rear cross-member
90. Additionally, braces 92 may be coupled to upper portions 88a and rear cross
member 90. Rear cross-member 90 and braces 92 may be removably coupled to rear
frame portion 26 with bolts in order to provide access to powertrain assembly 250.
[0089] Rear frame portion 26 also includes lower rearward longitudinally-extending
members 128, which are coupled to forward longitudinally-extending members 28. More
particularly, as shown best in FIGS. 14-16, the outer diameter (od) of lower rearward
longitudinally-extending members 128 is smaller than the inner diameter (id) of forward
longitudinally-extending members 28. Illustratively, the outer diameter (od) of lower
rearward longitudinally-extending members 128 may be approximately 36-40 mm and
the inner diameter (id) of forward longitudinally-extending members 28 may be
approximately 38-42 mm. In one embodiment, the outer diameter (od) of lower rearward
longitudinally-extending members 128 may be approximately 38 mm and the inner
diameter (id) of the forward longitudinally-extending members 28 may be approximately
40 mm. As such, lower rearward longitudinally-extending members 128 are received
within a portion of forward longitudinally-extending members 28. Conventional
fasteners, such as welds, rivets, bolts, and/or adhesive may be used to secure lower
rearward longitudinally-extending members 128 within forward longitudinally-extending
members 28. Illustratively, lower rearward longitudinally-extending members 128 are
welded to forward longitudinally-extending members 28.
[0090] Rear frame portion 26 further includes a plurality of angled members 94, 96, and
98. Angled members 94 may be coupled to rear portions 62c of lower longitudinally
extending members 62 and forward longitudinally-extending members 28. Angled
members 96 and 96 are coupled to lower rearward longitudinally-extending members
 128. Angled members 96 and 98 may be coupled to alignment arm brackets 100 for a
rear suspension assembly 300. A bracket 104 may be coupled to upper rearward
                                              13

longitudinally-extending members 88. A plate member 102 is coupled to lower portions
88b of upper rearward longitudinally-extending members 88 and is positioned rearward
of angled members 94, 96, and 98. Further details about frame assembly 20 of vehicle
2 may be disclosed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/829,743, filed
on May 31, 2013, the complete disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by
reference herein.
[0091] Referring to FIGS. 17-21, a cab frame assembly 150 is coupled to frame
assembly 20 and includes front upstanding members 152, rear upstanding members
 154, and longitudinal members 156 extending therebetween. Additionally, cab frame
assembly 150 includes a front cross-member 158, a rear upper cross-member 160, and
a rear lower cross-member 162. Front cross-member 158 is coupled to an upper end of
front upstanding members 152 and/or longitudinal members 156. In one embodiment,
front upstanding members 152 are integrally formed with longitudinal members 156.
The lower end of front upstanding members 152 may be coupled to frame assembly 20
with couplers 151. Couplers 151 may be bolted, adhered, or otherwise coupled to frame
assembly 20 and/or front upstanding members 152.
[0092] Rear upper cross-member 160 is coupled to an upper end of rear upstanding
members 154 and/or longitudinal members 156. Rear lower cross-member 162 is also
coupled to rear upstanding members 154. In one embodiment, rear upstanding
members 154 are integrally formed with rear upper cross-member 160. The lower end
of rear upstanding members 154 may be coupled to frame assembly 20 with couplers
 151, which may be bolted, adhered, or otherwise coupled to frame assembly 20 and/or
rear upstanding members 154.
[0093] As shown in FIGS. 18 and 19, front cross-member 158 may be coupled to front
upstanding members 152 and/or longitudinal members 156 with a coupler assembly
 130. Similarly, longitudinal members 156 are coupled to rear upper cross-member 160
and rear upstanding members 154 with coupler assemblies 130. Additionally, rear lower
cross-member 162 is coupled to rear upstanding members 154 with coupler assemblies
 130. Coupler assemblies 130 include an outer bracket 132, an inner bracket 134, and a
fastener 136. More particularly, front upstanding members 152 and longitudinal
members 156 are received within opposing ends of outer and inner brackets 132, 134
and may be coupled thereto with conventional fasteners (e.g., adhesive). Front cross
                                             14

member 158 is received within an inner end of inner bracket 134 and may be coupled
thereto with adhesive or other conventional fasteners. As such, front upstanding
members 152, longitudinal members 156, and front cross-member 158 are bought
together in a T-configuration by coupler assemblies 130. Fastener 136 is received within
an opening of outer bracket 132 and extends into an inner channel 166 of front cross
member 158 in order to couple together front upstanding members 152, longitudinal
members 156, and front cross-member 158. Fastener 136 may be threadedly coupled
or otherwise secured within inner channel 166. In a similar way, upper rear cross
member 160 is coupled to rear upstanding members 154 and longitudinal members
156. Additionally, lower rear cross-member 162 is coupled to rear upstanding members
154 with coupler assemblies 130.
[0094] Cab frame assembly 150 may be at least partially comprised of a metallic
material. For example, illustrative cab frame assembly 150 is comprised of a material
that weighs less, or has a lower density, than the material of frame assembly 20.
Illustrative cab frame assembly 150 may be comprised of aluminum, whereas illustrative
frame assembly 20 may be at least partially comprised of steel. More particularly, at
least some of front upstanding members 152, rear upstanding members 154,
longitudinal members 156, front cross-member 158, rear upper cross-member 160, and
rear lower cross-member 162 are comprised of aluminum. Alternative embodiments of
cab frame assembly 150 may be comprised of other light-weight materials, such as
polymeric materials and/or carbon fiber materials. By using aluminum, polymeric
materials, and/or carbon fiber materials, cab frame assembly 150 may be light-weight
and decrease the overall weight of vehicle 2. As such, the center of gravity of vehicle 2
may be lowered. For example, when cab frame assembly 150 is comprised of
aluminum, the weight of cab frame assembly 150 may be reduced by approximately
40% compared to a cab frame assembly 150 comprised of steel. Alternatively, members
152, 154, 156, 158, 160, and/or 162 of cab frame assembly 150 may be comprised of
16-gauge tubes, rather than 14-gauge tubes, and the decreased size of members 152,
154, 156, 158, 160, and/or 162 may decrease the weight of cab frame assembly 150
and, therefore, lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2.
[0095] When cab frame assembly 150 is comprised of aluminum, the bending stiffness
or strength of at least some of front upstanding members 152, rear upstanding
                                             15

members 154, longitudinal members 156, front cross-member 158, rear upper cross
member 160, and rear lower cross-member 162 may be increased by including at least
one structural reinforcement member. Illustratively, the at least one structural
reinforcement member defines a plurality of internal ribs 164 and inner channel 166.
 Internal ribs 164 and inner channel 166 may be extruded with members 152, 154, 156,
 158, 160, and 162. As shown if FIG. 20, front upstanding members 152, rear upstanding
members 154, longitudinal members 156, front cross-member 158, rear upper cross
member 160, and/or rear lower cross-member 162 may include at least four internal ribs
 164. Internal ribs 164 extend inwardly from the inner surface of front upstanding
members 152, rear upstanding members 154, longitudinal members 156, front cross
member 158, rear upper cross-member 160, and/or rear lower cross-member 162 and
engage with inner channel 166. By including at least four internal ribs 164, the bending
stiffness of each member 152, 154, 156, 158, 160, and/or 162 is increased in two
directions - both direction Bi and direction B2 . As shown in FIGS. 19 and 20, inner
channel 166 extends along the length of front upstanding members 152, rear
upstanding members 154, longitudinal members 156, front cross-member 158, rear
upper cross-member 160, and/or rear lower cross-member 162 and is generally hollow
in order to receive fastener 136 of coupler assemblies 130. Additionally, electrical wires
may be routed through inner channel 166 and/or the channels defined between internal
ribs 164 in order to conceal and protect the wires.
[0096] At least some of front upstanding members 152, rear upstanding members 154,
longitudinal members 156, front cross-member 158, rear upper cross-member 160, and
rear lower cross-member 162 may be extruded and profiled. For example, front
upstanding members 152, rear upstanding members 154, longitudinal members 156,
front cross-member 158, rear upper cross-member 160, and/or rear lower cross
member 162 may be extruded with a generally hour-glass or figure 8 profile to allow
accessories, such as doors 222 (FIG. 35), a roof (not shown), a front windshield (not
shown), and/or a rear windshield (not shown) to be coupled to cab frame assembly 150.
Additional details about the profile of cab frame assembly 150 may be disclosed in U.S.
Patent Application Serial No. 13/429,589, filed on June 8, 2012, the complete disclosure
of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.
                                              16

[0097] Additionally, cab frame assembly 150 also includes a retainer or bolster bar 140,
which may be coupled to rear upstanding members 154. More particularly, rear
upstanding members 154 may include tabs 142 for coupling with bolster bars 140. A
fastener 144 may be received within openings of bolster bars 140 and corresponding
openings in tabs 142 in order to couple bolster bars 140 to rear upstanding members
 154. Bolster bar 140 includes tabs 141, which are configured to support a door 222
(FIG. 35), as detailed further herein. Illustrative bolster bars 140 may be comprised of a
light-weight or low-density metallic material, polymeric material, and/or carbon fiber
material. For example, bolster bar 140 may be comprised of aluminum. With the use of
aluminum or other light-weight materials, the center of gravity of vehicle 2 may be
lowered.
[0098] Referring to FIG. 22, frame assembly 20 may be coupled to a body of vehicle 2.
For example, the body of vehicle 2 may include a hood 220 at front end 4, as well as
dashboard assembly 200 and floorboard assembly 210 with operator area 14 (FIG. 2).
As shown in FIG. 22, the forward-most portion of vehicle 2 is defined by upstanding
members 44 along line F. However, the forward-most portion of front wheels 8 are
forward of the line F. As such, if vehicle 2 contacts an obstacle (e.g., rock or tree) at a
position along line 0, only front wheels 8 will contact the obstacle. The remainder of
vehicle 2 is rearward of line 0 and, therefore, does not contact the obstacle. In this way,
the approach angle at front frame portion 22 of frame assembly 20 minimizes damage
to vehicle 2 by ensuring that front wheels 8 will contact an obstacle before any other
portion of vehicle 2. For example, angle a of first upstanding members 44 defines the
approach angle, which allows front wheels 8 to be configured to contact an obstacle at
line 0 before the remainder of vehicle 2 reaches the obstacle. Further details about the
body of vehicle 2 may be disclosed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No.
61/829,743, filed on May 31, 2013, the complete disclosure of which is expressly
incorporated by reference herein.
[0099] Referring to FIGS. 23 and 24, a cooling system 230 is positioned at front end 4 of
vehicle 2 and, therefore, the approach angle of frame assembly 20 also protects cooling
system 230 from damage if front end 4 vehicle 2 contacts an obstacle. Cooling system
230 includes a main grille 232, at least one heat exchanger 234, and secondary grilles
236, 238. Main grille 232 is positioned forward of heat exchanger 234 and above
                                               17

secondary grilles 236, 238. Main grille 232 is removably coupled to the body of vehicle
2, for example hood 220, with tabs 233 and 235. As shown in FIG. 24, tabs 233 are
positioned along the top edge of main grille 232 and tabs 235 are positioned along the
bottom edge of main grille 232. Tabs 233 are configured to compress when main grille
232 is assembled at front end 4 of vehicle 2; however, tabs 233 are biased to an
expanded position in order to secure main grille 232 against hood 220 and other
components at front end 4 of vehicle 2.
[00100] Main grille 232 includes a plurality of louvers 237 to allow air to flow
therethrough in order to provide cooling air to heat exchanger 234. In one embodiment,
louvers 237 may be angled in order to deflect dirt, mud, and other debris away from
heat exchanger 234. Additionally, the angled configuration of louvers 237 may be such
that the flow of air therethrough is laminar. Also, by keeping main grille 232 clean and
free of dirt and mud, air flow through louvers 237 is more efficient. Additionally, a
removable deflector 239 may be coupled to heat exchanger 234 in order to further
deflect dirt, mud, and debris away from heat exchanger 234. Illustratively, deflector 239
may extend around the perimeter of heat exchanger 234.
[00101] Referring to FIG. 25, the body of vehicle 2 also includes a plurality of panels
within operator area 14. For example, an access panel 240 may be included within
operator area 14, which is positioned between seats 15, as shown in FIG. 5. In this way,
access panel 240 may be positioned generally rearward of seats 15 and encloses an
engine compartment for powertrain assembly 250 from operator area 14. More
particularly, an engine 252 of powertrain assembly 250 may be positioned rearward of
access panel 240. As such, access panel 240 prevents the operator or passenger from
accidentally contacting components of powertrain assembly 250 within the engine
compartment and also prevents transfer of noise, heat, fluids, dirt, and/or debris from
the engine compartment into operator area 14. Access panel 240 is removably coupled
to the body, which also provides access to the engine compartment for repairing,
changing, and/or monitoring components of engine 252 or other portions of powertrain
assembly 250. For example, engine 252 may be oriented such that the oil dipstick
and/or engine filter is adjacent access panel 240. In this way, the operator is able to
monitor or change the oil level and/or filter of engine 252 without removing seats 15.
                                              18

[00102] As shown in FIG. 26, operator area 14 includes seats 15, which include seat
bottoms 16 and seat backs 18. The rearward surface of seat backs 18 may include a
recessed portion 244 rearward of a head rest 246 of seats 15. By including recessed
portion 244 on seats 15, the weight of seats 15 may be reduced. For example, the
weight of seats 15 may be reduced by approximately 15%. As such, the overall weight
of vehicle 2 may be reduced, which may lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2.
[00103] Referring to FIG. 27, operator area 14 also includes dashboard assembly 200
positioned generally forward of seats 15 and generally above floorboard assembly 210
(FIG. 2). Dashboard assembly 200 includes an upper dashboard member 202, which
may include at least one opening for a multi-functional display screen or gauge 204.
Illustratively, screen 204 may be configured with to output information about navigation,
radio, cellular telephones, and/or data about vehicle 2. For example, display screen 204
may be configured to output GPS coordinates, information about the terrain, and data
received from sensors about the fuel levels, output of powertrain assembly 250, and
other similar data from vehicle 2. Additionally, upper dashboard member 202 may
support integrated accessories 206, such as integrated speakers and/or heating and
cooling vents.
[00104] Additionally, upper dashboard member 202 may support a passenger grab bar
208 (FIG. 2). The passenger may hold on to grab bar 208 during operation of vehicle 2
to stabilize himself or herself in seat 15. Grab bar 208 may be comprised of a metallic
material generally surrounded by a polymeric cover. In one embodiment, grab bar 208
may be at least partially comprised of aluminum. As such, grab bar 208 may weigh less
and/or have a lower density than a grab bar comprised of other materials, for example
steel and, and therefore, may lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2.
[00105] As shown in FIGS. 28-28C, vehicle 2 includes front suspension assembly 170
and rear suspension assembly 300. In one embodiment, rear suspension assembly 300
is configured for approximately 8-12 inches of travel. Illustratively, rear suspension
assembly 300 is configured for approximately 10 inches of travel. Rear suspension
assembly 300 is positioned generally rearward of engine 252 at rear end 6 of utility
vehicle 2. Referring to FIGS. 28-28C, rear suspension assembly 300 may be configured
as a dual alignment arm-type suspension assembly and includes upper alignment arms
302, lower alignment arms 304, shock absorbers 306, and a torsion bar 308. An inner
                                              19

end of upper and lower alignment arms 302, 304 are coupled to alignment arms
brackets 100 of rear frame portion 26, and an outer end of upper and lower alignment
arms 302, 304 are coupled to hub assemblies 310 of rear wheels 10.
[00106] A lower end of shock absorber 306 is coupled to lower alignment arm 304, and
an upper end of shock absorber 306 is coupled to brackets 104 on upper rearward
longitudinally-extending members 88. In one embodiment, brackets 104 are
approximately 15-20 inches above skid plate 86, and illustratively, are approximately
17.8 inches above skid plate 86.
[00107] Shock absorbers 306 may be self-leveling or load-leveling shocks, for example
Nivomat@ shocks available from ZF Sachs AG Corporation of Germany. In one
embodiment, shocks 306 include an incompressible fluid, such as oil, and a coil-over
spring. When cargo and passengers are supported within vehicle 2, the ground
clearance of vehicle 2 (i.e., the distance between the bottom of frame assembly 20 and
the ground surface) may be affected such that the ground clearance is reduced and
vehicle 2 sits lower to the ground. As such, the bottom surface of vehicle 2 may scrape
against the ground, obstacles, or other objects, during operation. However, shocks 306
are configured to selectively or automatically adjust the ride height of vehicle 2 to
accommodate a load on vehicle 2 in order to maintain a consistent ground clearance. In
other words, shocks 306 are configured to maintain the same ground clearance when
vehicle 2 supports cargo and passengers as when vehicle 2 does not include any
passengers or cargo. Additional details about shocks 306 may be disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 8,079,602, issued on December 20, 2011, the complete disclosure of which
is expressly incorporated by reference herein.
[00108] In one embodiment, shocks 306 are configured to automatically adjust the ride
height in response to a load on vehicle 2 in order to maintain a predetermined ground
clearance. In another embodiment, the operator may be able to selectively adjust the
ride height, either by manually adjusting a portion of shocks 306 or by activating an
operator input from operator area 14. For example, if the terrain suddenly changes and
includes large obstacles, the operator may selectively adjust shocks 306 to increase the
ground clearance to accommodate the terrain.
[00109] Also, in a further embodiment, shocks 306 may be configured for continuous
damping control, as detailed further in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No.

61/723,623, filed on November 7, 2012, the complete disclosure of which is expressly
incorporated by reference herein.
[00110] Torsion bar 308 of rear suspension assembly 300 extends generally in a U
shape and is generally positioned along the inner sides of shock absorbers 306. Torsion
bar 308 is coupled to upper alignment arms 302 through rods 309, as shown in FIG.
28B. Illustratively, an upper end of rod 308 is coupled to a front surface of upper
alignment arms 302 and a lower end of rod 308 extends below upper alignment arm
302 in order to couple with torsion bar 308. Torsion bar 308 is positioned vertically
intermediate upper and lower alignment arms 302, 304. As shown in FIG. 28C,
forwardly-extending portions 308a of torsion bar 308 may be positioned below upper
alignment arms 302 and half shafts 311 of rear final drive unit 258 (FIG. 38). More
particularly, as shown in FIG. 28B, forwardly-extending portions 308a of torsion bar 308
may be bent and angled downwardly relative to a center portion 308b of torsion bar 308
in order to extend below half shafts 311 and couple with the lower ends of rods 309. In
one embodiment, center portion 308b of torsion bar 308 may be approximately 4-7
inches above skid plate 86, and illustratively is approximately 5.9 inches above skid
plate 86. As such, torsion bar 308 occupies a lower position on vehicle 2, which may
lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2. Torsion bar 308 includes isolators 312. Torsion
bar 308 is positioned below an exhaust assembly 280 of powertrain assembly 250 and
isolators 312 may be configured to couple with frame assembly 20 and contact exhaust
assembly 280, as shown in FIG. 8.
[00111] As shown in FIGS. 29-31, front suspension assembly 170 is configured as a
dual alignment arm-type suspension and includes upper alignment arms 172, lower
alignment arms 174, shock absorbers 176, and a torsion bar 178. In one embodiment,
front suspension assembly 170 is configured for approximately 8-12 inches of travel.
 Illustrative front suspension assembly 170 is configured for approximately 10 inches of
travel. An inner end of lower alignment arms 174 is coupled to alignment arm brackets
36 and an outer end of lower alignment arms 174 is coupled to a hub assembly 180 of
front wheels 8. Illustrative lower alignment arms 174 include a rearward arm 174a and a
forward arm 174b which are angled toward each other in order to couple with hub
assembly 180. Additionally, forward arm 174b includes a bend 175 to further position
                                             21

the outer end of forward arm 174b inward. By bending and angling forward arm 174b
inward, forward arm 174b does not contact an obstacle before front wheels 8.
[00112] Upper alignment arms 172 include a rearward arm 172a and a forward arm
 172b. As with forward arm 174b, forward arm 172b is angled inwardly toward rearward
arm 172a and, as such, does not contact an obstacle before front wheels 8. An inner
end of upper alignment arms 172 is coupled to upper plate member 39 and brackets at
front frame portion 22. An outer end of upper alignment arms 172 is coupled to hub
assembly 180 of front wheels 8. More particularly, upper and lower alignment arms 172,
 174 are coupled to hub assemblies 180 via a knuckle 181. Knuckle 181 has a steering
axis of rotation, also called a king pin axis, 182. As shown in FIG. 29B, steering axis of
rotation or king pin axis 182 is angled rearwardly relative to a vertical axis V.
 Illustratively, steering axis of rotation 182 is at a rearward angle    P of approximately 5-10
degrees, and more particularly, 7.5 degrees, from vertical axis V. Additionally, as shown
in FIG. 29C, front wheels 8 are angled inwardly such that knuckle 181 is angled
inwardly relative to vertical axis V. Illustratively, knuckle 181 is angled inwardly at an
angle    e of approximately 2-8 degrees, and more       particularly, 5.0 degrees, from vertical
axis V.
[00113] Rearward arm 172a of upper alignment arms 172 may bend upwardly in order
to accommodate steering arms 192 of a power steering assembly 190 and/or the half
shafts of front final drive unit 256. More particularly, steering arms 192 are positioned
intermediate upper alignment arms 172 and lower alignment arms 174. Additionally,
steering arms 192 are coupled to hub assemblies 180 at a joint 184, which is rearward
of knuckle 181. As shown in FIGS. 29A-C and 31, joint 184 of steering arms 192 is
rearward of steering axis of rotation 182.
[00114] As shown in FIG. 3 IB, alternative steering arms 192' may be included with
power steering assembly 190. For example, steering arms 192' may include a cast
component 193 for coupling steering arms 192' to joint 184. Illustratively, cast
component 193 may be comprised of aluminum. When power steering assembly 190
includes steering arms 192' with cast component 193, the weight of steering arms 192'
may be reduced by approximately 40% compared to steering arms 192, which may
include steel. As such, the center of gravity of vehicle 2 may be lowered by including
steering arms 192' on vehicle 2.
                                                 22

[00115] Referring to FIGS. 28-31, the upper end of shock absorbers 176 is coupled to
brace 46 at front frame portion 22. In one embodiment, brace 46 and the upper end of
shock absorbers 176 may be approximately 18-23 inches above skid plate 86, and
illustratively, is 21.6 inches above skid plate 86. The lower end of shock absorbers 176
are coupled to upper alignment arms 172 through a bracket 177. Additionally, referring
to FIG. 29C, bracket 177 and the lower end of shock absorbers 176 may be
approximately 2-6 inches from the steering axis of rotation 182 along line M, and
illustratively, is approximately 4 inches from the steering axis of rotation 182. Bracket
177 is also coupled to rods 186, which extend generally vertically and also couple with
torsion bar 178. Illustratively, shock absorbers 176 are operably coupled to torsion bar
178 with rods 186. As such, movement may be transmitted between torsion bar 178 and
shock absorbers 176.
[00116] Shock absorbers 176 may be self-leveling or load-leveling shocks, for example
Nivomat@ shocks available from ZF Sachs AG Corporation of Germany. In one
embodiment, shocks 176 include an incompressible fluid, such as oil, and a coil-over
spring. When cargo and passengers are supported within vehicle 2, the ground
clearance of vehicle 2 may be affected such that the ground clearance is reduced and
vehicle 2 sits lower to the ground. As such, the bottom surface of vehicle 2 may scrape
against the ground, obstacles, or other objects, during operation. However, shocks 176
are configured to selectively or automatically adjust the ride height of vehicle 2 to
accommodate a load on vehicle 2 in order to maintain a consistent ground clearance. In
other words, shocks 176 are configured to maintain the same ground clearance when
vehicle 2 supports cargo and passengers as when vehicle 2 does not include any
passengers or cargo.
[00117] In one embodiment, shocks 176 are configured to automatically adjust the ride
height in response to a load on vehicle 2 in order to maintain a predetermined ground
clearance. In another embodiment, the operator may be able to selectively adjust the
ride height, either by manually adjusting a portion of shocks 176 or by activating an
operator input from operator area 14. For example, if the terrain suddenly changes and
includes large obstacles, the operator may selectively adjust shocks 176 to increase the
ground clearance to accommodate the terrain.
                                              23

[00118] In this way, because both shocks 176 of front suspension assembly 170 and
shocks 306 of rear suspension assembly 300 include load-leveling shocks, vehicle 2
includes load-leveling shocks on all four corners thereof. Additionally, because shocks
176 and/or 306 are configured to adjust the ride height or ground clearance of vehicle 2,
shocks 176 and/or shocks 306 are able to affect the center of gravity of vehicle 2. In one
embodiment, the ride height of vehicle 2 may be lowered by approximately 1 inch in
order to lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2.
[00119] Also, in a further embodiment, shocks 176 may be configured for continuous
damping control, as detailed further in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No.
61/723,623, filed on November 7, 2012, and U.S. Patent No. 8,079,602, issued on
December 20, 2011, the complete disclosures of which are expressly incorporated by
reference herein.
[00120] Torsion bar 178 is supported on frame assembly 20 with a bracket 188. More
particularly, bracket 188 is coupled to second upstanding members 45 of front frame
portion 22. Torsion bar 178 is positioned vertically intermediate upper alignment arm
172 and lower alignment arm 174. In one embodiment, a center portion 178a of torsion
bar 178 (FIG. 30) is approximately 3-7 inches above skid plate 86, and illustratively, is
approximately 4.9 inches above skid plate 86. Illustratively, torsion bar 178 extends
rearwardly around a rear surface of a steering rack 194 of power steering assembly
190. Additionally, torsion bar 178 is positioned directly rearward of front final drive unit
256 such that steering rack 194 is positioned intermediate torsion bar 178 and front final
drive unit 256. Illustratively, torsion bar 178 may be approximately 8-12 inches, and
more particularly, 9.2 inches, rearward of front final drive unit 256 along a line F, as
shown in FIG. 9B.
[00121] As with joint 184, steering rack 194 also is positioned rearward of steering axis
of rotation 182 of knuckle 181. Additionally, steering rack 194 is positioned vertically
intermediate upper alignment arm 172 and lower alignment arm 174, and is positioned
longitudinally intermediate lower alignment arm brackets 36, as shown best in FIG. 31.
In one embodiment, the center of steering rack 194 is positioned approximately 4-8
inches above skid plate 86, and illustratively, is approximately 5.6 inches above skid
plate 86. By positioning steering rack 194 and torsion bar 178 intermediate upper and
lower alignment arms 172 and 174, steering rack 194 and torsion bar 178 are at a low
                                               24

position on vehicle 2, which may lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2. Additional
components of power steering assembly 190, for example an electric power steering
unit (not shown), also may be positioned adjacent upper and lower alignment arms 172,
174 of front suspension assembly 170 to further lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2.
In one embodiment, the electric power steering unit may be adjacent or incorporated
into a top portion of steering rack 194 in order to lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2.
[00122] As shown in FIG. 29C, steering arms 192 are angled downwardly from steering
rack 194 in order to couple with hub assemblies 180 at joint 184. In one embodiment,
steering arms 192 may be at an angle ) of approximately 6-10 degrees, and more
particularly 8.6 degrees, from horizontal. By angling steering arms 192 downwardly, the
suspension travel of front suspension assembly 170 may be increased without
compromising the turning radius of front wheels 8. Additionally, half shafts 257 are
operably coupled to hub assemblies 180 and front final drive unit 256 and also may be
angled downwardly from front final drive unit 256 in order to couple with hub assemblies
180. For example, in one embodiment, half shafts 257 may be at an angle 4Y of
approximately 5-8 degrees, and more particularly 6.9 degrees, from horizontal. By
angling the half shafts downwardly, the suspension travel also may be increased
without compromising the steering angle or turning radius for front wheels 8.
[00123] Additional details of front suspension assembly 170 may be disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 8,302,711, filed on December 8, 2011, and issued on November 6, 2012, the
complete disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.
[00124] Referring to FIG. 32, an air intake assembly 260 of vehicle 2 is shown. Air
intake assembly 260 includes a filter housing 262 for supporting a filter (not shown)
therein, a lid 264 removably coupled to filter housing 262, an intake tube 266, an outlet
tube 268, a breather inlet tube 272, and a resonator tube, illustratively a quarter-wave
tube 274. In one embodiment, the position of filter housing 262 may be adjusted to
lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2. As shown, intake tube 266 pulls air from the right
or passenger side of vehicle 2 and the air flows into filter housing 262 in order to flow
through the filter therein. The filter removes particles, dust, dirt, and/or other debris from
the air. Once cleaned, the air flows out of filter housing 262 and into outlet tube 268.
Outlet tube 268 directs air toward engine 252 of powertrain assembly. More particularly,
a port 270 of outlet tube 268 is fluidly coupled to the throttle bodies of engine.
                                              25

Additionally, a smaller portion of air in outlet tube 268 may flow through breather inlet
tube 272, which directs air to the breather of engine 252.
[00125] Quarter-wave tube 274 is also fluidly coupled to outlet tube 268 in order to
decrease the noise of air intake assembly 260. More particularly, air intake assembly
260 is positioned rearward of seats 15 and, therefore, noise from air intake assembly
260 may be heard within operator area 14. However, by providing a resonator, such as
quarter-wave tube 274, the noise from air intake assembly 260 may be reduced. As
shown in FIG. 32, quarter-wave tube 274 is positioned on the "clean" side of filter
housing 262 (i.e., is fluidly coupled to outlet tube 268). Alternatively, as shown in FIG.
32A, an alternative embodiment quarter-wave tube 274' may be positioned on the "dirty"
side of filter housing 262 such that quarter- wave tube 274' may be fluidly coupled to an
intake tube 266'.
[00126] An alternative embodiment of air intake assembly 260 is shown as air intake
assembly 260' in FIGS. 32A-32E. Air intake assembly 260' includes filter housing 262,
intake tube 266', an outlet tube 268', breather inlet tube 272, and quarter- wave tube
274'. The configuration and operation of illustrative air intake assembly 260' is described
herein. It should be understood that the configuration and operation of air intake
assembly 260 may be the same as that for air intake assembly 260'. As shown in FIG.
32A, air intake assembly 260' is positioned within a forward portion of cargo box 12.
More particularly, air intake assembly 260' is positioned between side walls 12a and
12b of cargo box 12, such that intake tube 266' is positioned adjacent or generally in
proximity to side wall 12a, and outlet tube 268' is adjacent or generally in proximity to
side wall 12b. Additionally, air intake assembly 260' is positioned forward of removable
panel 13 (FIG. 5). A cover 450 of cargo box 12 is positioned generally around air intake
assembly 260', as shown in FIGS. 32C and 32E. Illustratively, air intake assembly 260'
is positioned with a chamber 452 defined by cover 450 and a top surface 458 of cargo
box 12.
[00127] As shown in FIGS. 32C and 32D, intake tube 266' is spaced apart from side
wall 12a of cargo box. As such, intake tube 266' also is spaced apart from engine intake
port 502. In this way, intake tube 266' is not in direct contact with side wall 12a of cargo
box 12 or engine intake port 502. With intake tube 266' spaced apart from side wall 12a,
intake tube 266' can pull air into filter housing 262 from multiple locations. For example,
                                               26

as shown in FIGS. 32C-32E, air may flow in the direction of arrow 456 in order to flow
into intake tube 266' through engine intake port 502. Additionally, air may flow in the
direction of arrow 454 in order to flow into intake tube 266' through chamber 452. As
such, if engine intake port 502 becomes clogged with dirt, debris, snow, mud, or is
otherwise blocked, air can continue to flow into air intake assembly 260' through
chamber 452. In one embodiment, a primary air volume for air intake assembly 260' is
defined by the volume of air flowing in direction 456, and a secondary air volume for air
intake assembly 260' is defined by the volume of air flowing in direction 454. In other
embodiments, the balance of air flowing into intake tube 266' through engine intake port
502 and chamber 452 may be balanced, regulated, or otherwise. In a further
embodiment, air may be pulled into variable clutch assembly 254 (FIG. 38) in the same
manner described herein for engine 252.
[00128] As shown in FIG. 33, exhaust assembly 280 of powertrain assembly 250
includes an inlet body 282, an inlet tube 284, an outlet tube or tailpipe 288, and an
exhaust body or muffler 286. In one embodiment, inlet tube 284 may be configured with
multiple tube portions, which are coupled together with a coupler 285. Exhaust body
286 may include a plurality of baffle plates 290 and a filter tube 292. Exhaust assembly
280 is supported by rear frame portion 26 at rear end 6 of vehicle 2. As shown in FIG. 8,
exhaust body 286 may be further supported on isolators 312 of rear suspension
assembly 300.
[00129] The outer surface of exhaust assembly 280 may be wrapped or otherwise
surrounded by an insulation material, for example a fiberglass insulation wrap available
from The 3M Company. In assembly, the wrap may be wound around exhaust assembly
280, heated, and then allowed to cool such that the wrap ultimately forms a hard cast
type material around exhaust assembly 280. In one embodiment, at least exhaust body
286 may be perforated such that when the insulation wrap is applied thereto and
heated, the insulation may expand and a portion of the insulation will penetrate the
perforations and generally extend into the interior of exhaust body 286. Alternative
embodiments of insulation material also may be used. By using the insulation wrap,
rather than a rigid shield, the thickness of the wrap and, therefore, the insulation
provided to exhaust assembly 280, may be customized and adjusted.
                                              27

[00130] As shown in FIG. 33A, an alternative embodiment exhaust assembly 280'
includes inlet body 282, inlet tube 284, outlet tube or tailpipe 288, and exhaust body
286. Additionally, exhaust assembly 280' includes a heat shield 281, rather than a
fiberglass insulation wrap or other insulating material or object, to insulate exhaust body
286. Illustratively, heat shield 281 is coupled to exhaust body 286 with conventional
fasteners, for example bolts, screws, welds, rivets, and/or adhesive.
[00131] In operation, exhaust from engine 252 flows through ports 298 and into inlet
body 282. The exhaust in inlet body 282 flows into inlet tube 284, into exhaust body 286
through an inlet port 294, and exits vehicle 2 through port 296 of outlet tube 288.
[00132] The internal geometry of exhaust body 286 may affect the sound emanating
from exhaust assembly 280. More particularly, the internal geometry of exhaust body
286 may be configured to reduce or eliminate the effects of acoustical standing waves
therein. It is known that mufflers may include parallel baffle walls to define an expansion
chamber volume within the muffler. The baffle plates are typically oriented in a generally
vertical configuration such that the baffle plates may be generally perpendicular to the
flow of air and sound within the muffler. As such, the muffler may include a plurality of
parallel surfaces. However, as sound reflects off of these parallel surfaces within the
muffler, it can create standing waves in the expansion chamber, which may create
frequencies at which the muffler is less effective.
[00133] In order to reduce or eliminate the amplification effects due to reflections, baffle
plates 290 within exhaust body 286 are angled and oriented in a diagonal configuration
therein. Additionally, by positioning filter tube 292 between baffle plates 290,
amplification effects due to the reflections may be further reduced or eliminated
altogether.
[00134] In operation, as sound enters exhaust body 286 through inlet port 294, the
sound may reflect off of diagonal baffle plates 290. As such, the sound is reflected at an
angle away from inlet port 294 and bounces around a first chamber A, which is defined
by a first baffle plate 290A, a first wall 295A of exhaust body 286, and the corresponding
inner surface of exhaust body 286. Illustratively, first chamber A is generally triangularly
shaped. By reflecting the sound in an angled manner about triangularly-shaped
chamber A, the sound does not reinforce on itself because the sound does not bounce
off of parallel walls. The sound is then transferred through filter tube 292 and a filter
                                                28

therein dampens the sound before the sound exits into a second chamber B. Despite
the generally parallel configuration of baffle plates 290, the sound flowing between
baffle plates 290 is negligible because filter tube 292 dampens the sound. Furthermore,
an alternative embodiment of baffle plates 290 may include curved surfaces such that
the surfaces of baffle plates 290 are not parallel to each other.
[00135] Second chamber B is similar to first chamber A in that second chamber B also
is generally triangularly shaped and is defined by a second wall 295B of exhaust body
286, a second baffle plate 290B, and the corresponding inner surface of exhaust body
286. By reflecting the sound in an angled manner about triangularly- shaped chamber
B, the sound does not reinforce on itself because the sound does not bounce off of
parallel walls. As such, the sound exiting exhaust body 286 through port 296 and outlet
tube 288 is not reinforced, but rather, is reduced or generally eliminated.
[00136] Referring to FIG. 34, an alternative embodiment of exhaust assembly 280 is
shown as exhaust assembly 280', with like reference numerals indicating like parts
having like structure and functionality. Exhaust assembly 280' may be configured as an
active exhaust assembly and includes a first exhaust body 297, a second exhaust body
286', an inlet tube 284', an outlet tube or tailpipe 288', an first tube 291, a second tube
293, and a valve assembly 299. Exhaust assembly 280' is configured to operate in a
high-flow mode and a low- flow mode. In the high-flow mode, a substantial amount or all
of the exhaust flowing from engine 252 flows through exhaust assembly 280' along an
unrestricted path and exits from outlet tube 288'. As a result of the unrestricted flow
path, little backpressure builds within exhaust assembly 280' and a loud sound
emanates from exhaust assembly 280' such that vehicle 2 operates in a high
performance, sport mode. Conversely, when vehicle 2 is in the low-flow mode, the
exhaust from engine 252 is reduced when flowing through exhaust assembly 280'.
Additionally, the exhaust may flow through a restricted path. As a result, the
backpressure increases within exhaust assembly 280' and a quieter sound emanates
from exhaust assembly 280 such that vehicle 2 operates in a restrained and muted or
quiet mode.
[00137] Exhaust assembly 280' may be configured to toggle only between the high-flow
mode and the low- flow mode. Alternatively, exhaust assembly 280' may be configured
for an infinite number of flow options between the two modes. For example, the operator
                                              29

may be able to switch between the high- flow mode and the low-flow mode with a
mechanical valve system, which may include a lever and a pulley to regulate the flow of
exhaust through exhaust assembly 280'. Additionally, the operator may switch between
the high-flow mode and the low- flow mode with an electrical system, which may include
an electrical switch to toggle between the high-flow mode and the low-flow mode.
Alternatively, the electrical system may include a solenoid-operated butterfly valve,
which may be configured to open and close in an infinite number of positions to regulate
the flow of exhaust through exhaust assembly 280. Further still, exhaust assembly 280'
may include an electrical valve operably coupled to the engine control unit ("ECU") of
vehicle 2 in order to regulate the flow of exhaust based on the throttle position.
[00138] In one embodiment, exhaust assembly 280' operates by coupling a butterfly
valve 299a and a solenoid 299b of valve assembly 299 to first tube 291. First tube 291
is fluidly coupled to outlet tube 288' and provides an unrestricted flow path for the
exhaust between inlet tube 284' and outlet tube 188'. Second tube 293 is positioned
below first tube 291 and is fluidly coupled to first exhaust body 297 and second exhaust
body 286'. The flow of exhaust through second tube 293 and second exhaust body 286'
may be restricted. For example, a plurality of baffle plates/walls or a series of cross-over
tubes may be positioned within second exhaust body 286' in order to restrict the flow of
exhaust therethrough.
[00139] In operation, when the operator desires to operate vehicle 2 in the high-flow,
loud, sport mode, for example when the operator drives vehicle 2 in sparsely-populated
areas or at open throttle, solenoid 299b will receive a signal to open valve 299a to allow
a substantial portion or all of the exhaust entering first exhaust body 297 from inlet tube
284' to flow into first tube 291 and into outlet tube 288' through an unrestricted path. As
such, the exhaust bypasses the restricted flow path through second tube 293 and,
therefore, little backpressure builds within exhaust assembly 280'. As a result, a loud
and sportier sound is produced. The high-flow mode may correspond to an open throttle
position such that the high-flow mode may be engaged when vehicle 2 is accelerating,
operating at high speeds, and/or in a sport or high-performance drive mode. Exhaust
assembly 280' may be configured to allow the operator to selectively engage the high
flow mode when it is desirable to operate vehicle 2 in the sport drive mode.
Alternatively, the ECU may automatically operate exhaust assembly 280' in the high
                                               30

flow mode when vehicle 2 is in the high-performance, sport drive mode or at open
throttle.
[00140] Conversely, when the operator desires to operate vehicle 2 in the low-flow,
quiet, restrained mode, for example when the operator drives vehicle 2 in cruise control
or in a densely-populated area, such as a neighbourhood, solenoid 299b will receive a
signal to at least partially close valve 299a to restrict the amount of exhaust entering
first exhaust body 297 from inlet tube 284' to flow into first tube 291 and outlet tube 288'.
 Rather, a substantial portion or all of the exhaust entering first exhaust body 297 from
inlet tube 284' is diverted to second tube 293, where the exhaust flows into second tube
293 and through a restricted flow path in second exhaust body 286'. As such,
backpressure builds within exhaust assembly 280' and only a quiet, muted noise is
produced. The low- flow mode may correspond to a partially-closed throttle position
such that low- flow mode may be engaged when vehicle 2 is decelerating, operating in
cruise control, operating at low speeds, and/or in non-sport drive mode. Exhaust
assembly 280' may be configured to allow the operator to selectively engage the low
flow mode when it is desirable to operate vehicle 2 in the non-sport drive mode, for
example when driving in a neighbourhood. Alternatively, the ECU may automatically
operate exhaust assembly 280' in the low-flow mode, at specific throttle positions, or
when vehicle 2 is in the non-sport drive mode.
[00141] In one embodiment, the position of exhaust assembly 280 or 280' may be
lowered in order to lower the center of gravity of vehicle 2.
[00142] As shown in FIG. 35, utility vehicle 2 may include doors 222. Doors 222 include
a recessed outer portion 224. The recessed outer portion 224 decreases the weight of
doors 222, which may decrease the overall weight of vehicle 2 and, therefore, lower the
center of gravity of vehicle 2.
[00143] The inner surface of doors 222 is generally flat and smooth. In one
embodiment, the inner surface of doors 222 may be angled or curved outwardly to
