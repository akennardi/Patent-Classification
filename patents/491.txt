 5  Field of the Invention
    The present invention relates to antibodies capable of binding to the coagulation Factor XI
    and/or its activated form factor Xla and methods of use thereof, particularly methods of
    use as agents inhibiting platelet aggregation and by this inhibits thrombus formation.
10  Background of the Invention
    In 1964 Macfarlane and Davie & Ratnoff [Macfarlane RG. An enzyme cascade in the
    blood clotting mechanism, and its function as a biochemical amplifier. Nature 1964; 202:
    498-9.; Davie EW, Ratnoff OD. Waterfall sequence for intrinsic blood clotting. Science
     1964; 145: 1310-2.] introduced their cascade hypotheses for the process of blood
15  coagulation. Since then, our knowledge of the function of coagulation in vivo has grown. In
    the last years, the theory of two distinct routes, the so called the extrinsic and intrinsic
    pathway, that initiate coagulation and converge in a common pathway, ultimately leading
    to thrombin generation and fibrin deposition, has been revised. In the current model
    initiation of coagulation occurs when the plasma protease activated factor VII comes into
20  contact and by this forms a complex, with Tissue Factor (TF). This Tissue Factor-FVIla
    complex can activate the zymogen FX into its active form FXa, which on his part can
    convert prothrombin (coagulation factor II) into thrombin (Ila). Thrombin, a key player in
    coagulation, in turn can catalyze the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin. Additionally,
    thrombin activates specific receptors expressed by platelets, which leads to the activation
25  of the latter. Activated platelets in combination with fibrin are essential for clot formation
    and therefore are fundamental players of normal hemostasis .
    The second amplification route is formed by the coagulation factor XI (FXI). It is well
    confirmed that FXI is, like the other members of the coagulation cascade, a plasma serine
    protease zymogen with a key role in bridging the initiation phase and the amplification
30  phase of blood coagulation in vivo [Davie EW, Fujikawa K, Kisiel W. The coagulation
    cascade: initiation, maintenance, and regulation. Biochemistry 1991;30:10363-70; Gailani
    D, Broze Jr GJ. Factor XI activation in a revised model of blood coagulation. Science
     1991;253:909-12; Kravtsov DV, Matafonov A, Tucker El, Sun MF, Walsh PN, Gruber A,
    et al. Factor XI contributes to thrombin generation in the absence of factor XII. Blood
35  2009;114: 452-8.3-5]. FXI deficiency usually does not lead to spontaneous bleeding, but
    is associated with increased risk of bleeding with hemostatic challenges, while the severity
    of bleeding correlates poorly with the plasma level of FXI. Severe FXI deficiency in
    humans has certain protective effects from thrombotic diseases [Salomon 0, Steinberg
    DM, Zucker M, Varon D, Zivelin A, Seligshon U. Patients with severe factor XI deficiency

   WO 2013/167669                                                           PCT/EP2013/059618
                                                 2
    have a reduced incidence of deep-vein thrombosis. Thromb Haemost 2011;105:269-73;
    Salomon 0, Steinberg DM, Koren-Morag N, Tanne D, Seligsohn U. Reduced incidence of
    ischemic stroke in patients with severe factor XI deficiency. Blood 2008;111:4113-7]. Yet,
    a high level of FXI has been associated with thrombotic events [Meijers JC, Tekelenburg
 5  WL, Bouma BN, Bertina RM, Rosendaal FR. High levels of coagulation factor XI as a risk
    factor for venous thrombosis. N Engl J Med 2000;342:696-701]. Inhibition of FXI has
    therefore been proposed as a novel approach in the development of new antithrombotics
    to achieve an improved benefit-risk ratio. Thus, there is still a high medical need for anti
    thrombotic, anti-platelet drugs that blocks intravascular thrombosis efficaciously without
10  debilitating hemostasis.
    Brief Summary of the Invention
    In recent years, the development of novel antithrombotic agents has made great progress;
    nevertheless, undesired bleeding events caused by these agents are still a serious
15  problem. Therefore, the optimal antithrombotic compound which would ideally inhibit
    thrombosis but spare hemostasis is yet to be discovered.
    Coagulation factor XI (FXI/FXla) interacts with platelet receptor apoER2. The present
    invention demonstrates for the first time that inhibiting FXI/FXIa activity interferes with the
    process of pathological platelet activation and platelet aggregation under shear flow
20  conditions. In an ex vivo thrombosis model, inhibition of FXI/FXIa leads to a significant
    reduction of platelet activation markers like CD62P as well as to the reduction of
    downstream microaggregates in whole blood under physiologic flow conditions over a
    collagen surface. Accordingly, inhibition of FXIa reduces platelet-deposition without
    compromising platelet-dependent primary hemostasis in a primate model of platelet
25  dependent arterial-type thrombus formation. Despite of the pronounced antiplatelet effect,
    the initial interaction of platelets with the extravascular matrix proteins that is necessary
    for the tissue factor-dependent primary hemostatic plug formation is surprisingly not
    affected. Therefore, inhibition of FXI/FXIa activity represents an ideal pharmacological
    principle exhibiting antithrombotic activity without causing bleeding-related side effects.
30  For clarification: Without compromising hemostasis means that the inhibition of the
    coagulation factor XI and/or Xla does not lead to unwanted and measurable bleeding
    events even in the presence of other anti-coagulation compounds and/or anti-platelet
    compounds. Like as shown for Hemophilia C patients, bleeding occurs only in the context
    of intensive surgeries and/or severe injuries.

    Compositions and methods are provided for showing that antibodies or antigen-binding
    fragments, or variants thereof directed against the coagulation factor XI in form of its

15  Definitions
    Hemostasis: The term hemostasis represents the principal mechanisms for arresting the
    flow of blood at sites of injury and restoring vascular patency during wound healing,
    respectively. During normal hemostasis and pathological thrombosis, three mechanisms
    become activated simultaneously: primary hemostasis            meaning the interactions of
20  activated platelets with the vessel wall, the formation of fibrin, and a process termed as
    fibrinolysis [Arthur A. Sasahara, Joseph Loscalzo(2002) New Therapeutic Agents for
    Thrombosis and Thrombolysis (2nd Edition) Marcel Dekker Inc. New York, NY, ISBN 0
    8247-0795-8].
25  Coagulation and Coagulation cascade: The protein based system termed coagulation
    cascade serves to stabilize the clot that has formed and further seal up the wound. The
    coagulation pathway is a proteolytic cascade. Each enzyme of the pathway is present in
    the plasma as a Zymogen (in an inactive form), which on activation undergoes proteolytic
    cleavage to release the active factor from the precursor molecule. The coagulation
30  cascade functions as a series of positive and negative feedback loops which control the
    activation process. The ultimate goal of the pathway is to produce Thrombin, which can
    then convert soluble Fibrinogen into Fibrin that forms a clot. The process of generation of
    Thrombin can be divided into three phases: the Intrinsic and Extrinsic pathways which
    provide alternative routes for the generation of an active clotting factor: FXa (Activated
35  Factor-X), and the final Common pathway which results in Thrombin formation [Hoffman
    M.M. and Monroe D.M. (2005) Rethinking the coagulation cascade. Curr Hematol Rep.

    cascade systems in plasma. Biol Chem. 387:173-178].
    Platelet aggregation: When a break in a blood vessel occurs, substances are exposed
 5  that normally are not in direct contact with the blood flow. These substances (primarily
    Collagen and von Willebrand factor) allow the platelets to adhere to the broken surface.
    Once a platelet adheres to the surface, it releases chemicals that attract additional
    platelets to the damaged area, referred to as platelet aggregation. These two processes
    are the first responses to stop bleeding.

    Coagulation factor XI and coagulation factor XIa
    The coagulation Factor XI (FXI) is synthesized in the liver and circulates in the plasma as
    a disulfide bond-linked dimer complexed with High Molecular Weight Kininogen. Each
    polypeptide chain of this dimer is approximately 80 kD. The zymogen Factor XI is
15  converted into its active form, the coagulation factor Xla (FXla) either via the contact
    phase of blood coagulation or through Thrombin-mediated activation on the platelet
    surface. During this activation of factor XI, an internal peptide bond is cleaved in each of
    the two chains, resulting in the activated factor Xla, a serine protease composed of two
    heavy and two light chains held together by disulfide bonds. This serine protease FXla
20  converts the coagulation Factor IX into IXa, which subsequently activates coagulation
    Factor X (Xa). Xa then can mediate coagulation Factor II/Thrombin activation. Defects in
    this factor lead to Rosenthal syndrome (also known as hemophilia C), a blood coagulation
    abnormality characterized by prolonged bleeding from injuries, frequent or heavy
    nosebleeds, traces of blood in the urine, and heavy menstrual bleeding in females. As
25  used herein, "coagulation factor Xl," "factor Xl", or "FXI" refers to any FXI from any
    mammalian species that expresses the protein. For example, FXI can be human, non
    human primate (such as baboon), mouse, dog, cat, cow, horse, pig, rabbit, and any other
    species exhibiting the coagulation factor XI involved in the regulation of blood flow,
    coagulation, and/or thrombosis.
30  The cleavage site for the activation of the coagulation factor XI by the coagulation factor
    Xlla is an internal peptide bond between Arg-369 and lle-370 in each polypeptide chain
    [Fujikawa K, Chung DW, Hendrickson LE, Davie EW. (1986) Amino acid sequence of
    human factor XI, a blood coagulation factor with four tandem repeats that are highly
    homologous with plasma prekallikrein. Biochemistry 25:2417-2424]. Each heavy chain of
35  the coagulation factor Xla (369 amino acids) contains four tandem repeats of 90-91 amino
    acids called apple domains (designated A1-A4) plus a short connecting peptide [Fujikawa

    are typical of the trypsin family of serine proteases [Fujikawa K, Chung DW, Hendrickson

    factor with four tandem repeats that are highly homologous with plasma prekallikrein.

10  pathway of blood coagulation by activating factor IX.
    Conservative amino acid variants
    Polypeptide variants may be made that conserve the overall molecular structure of an
    antibody peptide sequence described herein. Given the properties of the individual amino
15  acids, some rational substitutions will be recognized by the skilled worker. Amino acid
    substitutions, i.e., "conservative substitutions," may be made, for instance, on the basis of
    similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and/or the
    amphipathic nature of the residues involved.
    For example, (a) nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine,
20  valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine; (b) polar neutral amino acids
    include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; (c)
    positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine; and (d)
    negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid.
    Substitutions typically may be made within groups (a)-(d). In addition, glycine and proline
25  may be substituted for one another based on their ability to disrupt a-helices. Similarly,
    certain amino acids, such as alanine, cysteine, leucine, methionine, glutamic acid,
    glutamine, histidine and lysine are more commonly found in a-helices, while valine,
    isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan and threonine are more commonly found in
    P-pleated sheets. Glycine, serine, aspartic acid, asparagine, and proline are commonly
30  found in turns. Some preferred substitutions may be made among the following groups: (i)
    S and T; (ii) P and G; and (iii) A, V, L and I. Given the known genetic code, and
    recombinant and synthetic DNA techniques, the skilled scientist readily can construct
    DNAs encoding the conservative amino acid variants.
    As used herein, "sequence identity" between two polypeptide sequences, indicates the
35  percentage of amino acids that are identical between the sequences. "Sequence
    homology" indicates the percentage of amino acids that either is identical or that represent
    conservative amino acid substitutions. Preferred polypeptide sequences of the invention

   WO 2013/167669                                                        PCT/EP2013/059618

    70% or 80%, still more preferably at least 90% and most preferably at least 95%.
    Preferred antibodies also have a sequence homology in the CDR regions of at least 80%,
    more preferably 90% and most preferably 95%.
 5
    DNA molecules of the invention
    The present invention also relates to the DNA molecules that encode an antibody of the
    invention. These sequences include, but are not limited to, those DNA molecules set forth
    in SEQ ID NOs 1 to 18.
10  DNA molecules of the invention are not limited to the sequences disclosed herein, but
    also include variants thereof. DNA variants within the invention may be described by
    reference to their physical properties in hybridization. The skilled worker will recognize
    that DNA can be used to identify its complement and, since DNA is double stranded, its
    equivalent or homolog, using nucleic acid hybridization techniques. It also will be
15  recognized that hybridization can occur with less than 100% complementarity. However,
    given appropriate choice of conditions, hybridization techniques can be used to
    differentiate among DNA sequences based on their structural relatedness to a particular
    probe. For guidance regarding such conditions see, Sambrook et al., 1989 [Sambrook, J.,
    Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring
20  Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, USA)] and Ausubel et al., 1995 [Ausubel,
    F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Sedman, J. G., Smith, J. A., & Struhl, K.
    eds. (1995). Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. New York: John Wiley and Sons].
    Structural similarity between two polynucleotide sequences can be expressed as a
    function of "stringency" of the conditions under which the two sequences will hybridize
25  with one another. As used herein, the term "stringency" refers to the extent that the
    conditions disfavor hybridization. Stringent conditions strongly disfavor hybridization, and
    only the most structurally related molecules will hybridize to one another under such
    conditions. Conversely, non-stringent conditions favor hybridization of molecules
    displaying a lesser degree of structural relatedness. Hybridization stringency, therefore,
30  directly correlates with the structural relationships of two nucleic acid sequences. The
    following relationships are useful in correlating hybridization and relatedness (where Tm is
    the melting temperature of a nucleic acid duplex):
    a.      Tm = 69.3 + 0.41 (G+C)%
    b.      The Tm of a duplex DNA decreases by 1C with every increase of
35          1% in the number of mismatched base pairs.
    c.      (Tm)p 2 - (Tm)p1 = 18.5 log1op2/pl

   WO 2013/167669                                                          PCT/EP2013/059618
                                             13
             where p1 and p2 are the ionic strengths of two solutions.
    Hybridization stringency is a function of many factors, including overall DNA
    concentration, ionic strength, temperature, probe size and the presence of agents which
 5  disrupt hydrogen bonding. Factors promoting hybridization include high DNA
    concentrations, high ionic strengths, low temperatures, longer probe size and the absence
    of agents that disrupt hydrogen bonding. Hybridization typically is performed in two
    phases: the "binding" phase and the "washing" phase.
    First, in the binding phase, the probe is bound to the target under conditions favoring
10  hybridization. Stringency is usually controlled at this stage by altering the temperature. For
    high stringency, the temperature is usually between 65'C and 70'C, unless short (< 20 nt)
    oligonucleotide probes are used. A representative hybridization solution comprises 6x
    SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5x Denhardt's solution and 100 pg of nonspecific carrier DNA [see 15].
    Of course, many different, yet functionally equivalent, buffer conditions are known. Where
15  the degree of relatedness is lower, a lower temperature may be chosen. Low stringency
    binding temperatures are between about 25'C and 40'C. Medium stringency is between
    at least about 40'C to less than about 65'C. High stringency is at least about 65'C.
    Second, the excess probe is removed by washing. It is at this phase that more stringent
    conditions usually are applied. Hence, it is this "washing" stage that is most important in
20  determining relatedness via hybridization. Washing solutions typically contain lower salt
    concentrations. One exemplary medium stringency solution contains 2X SSC and 0.1%
    SDS. A high stringency wash solution contains the equivalent (in ionic strength) of less
    than about 0.2X SSC, with a preferred stringent solution containing about O.1X SSC. The
    temperatures associated with various stringencies are the same as discussed above for
25  "binding." The washing solution also typically is replaced a number of times during
    washing. For example, typical high stringency washing conditions comprise washing twice
    for 30 minutes at 550 C and three times for 15 minutes at 60' C.
    Accordingly, subject of the present invention is an isolated nucleic acid sequence that
    encodes the antibody and /or antigen-binding fragments of the present invention. Another
30  embodiment of the present invention is the afore mentioned isolated nucleic acid
    sequence, which encodes the antibodies of the present invention. Accordingly, the
    present invention includes nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to the molecules of set
    forth under high stringency binding and washing conditions, where such nucleic molecules
    encode an antibody or functional fragment thereof having properties as described herein.
35  Preferred molecules (from an mRNA perspective) are those that have at least 75% or
    80% (preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90% and most preferably at least

   WO 2013/167669                                                         PCT/EP2013/059618

    95%) sequence identity with one of the DNA molecules described herein. The DNA codes
    for molecules which reduce and or inhibit the conversion of the coagulation factor XI into
    its active form factor Xla and / or block the catalytic activity of the coagulation factor Xla
    directly.
 5
    Recombinant DNA constructs and expression
    The present invention further provides recombinant DNA constructs comprising one or
    more of the nucleotide sequences of the present invention. The recombinant constructs of
    the present invention are used in connection with a vector, such as a plasmid, phagemid,
10  phage or viral vector, into which a DNA molecule encoding an antibody of the invention is
    inserted.
    The encoded gene may be produced by techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1989,
    and Ausubel et al., 1989. [Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular
    Cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor,
15  USA; Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Sedman, J. G., Smith, J. A.,
    & Struhl, K. eds. (1995). Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. New York: John Wiley
    and Sons]. Alternatively, the DNA sequences may be chemically synthesized using, for
    example, synthesizers. See, for example, the techniques described in OLIGONUCLEOTIDE
    SYNTHESIS    [Gait, M.J. (1984) "An introduction to modern methods of DNA Synthesis" In
20  Oligonucleotide Synthesis a Practical Approach. Ed. M.J. Gait, IRL Press Oxford UK]
    which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The expert in the field is able to
    fuse DNA encoding the variable domains with gene fragments encoding constant regions
    of various human IgG isotypes or derivatives thereof, either mutated or non-mutated. He
    is able to apply recombinant DNA technology in order to fuse both variable domains in a
25  single chain format using linkers such as a fifteen-amino acid stretch containing three
    times glycine-glycine-glycine-glycine-serine. Recombinant constructs of the invention are
    comprised with expression vectors that are capable of expressing the RNA and/or protein
    products of the encoded DNA(s). The vector may further comprise regulatory sequences,
    including a promoter operably linked to the open reading frame (ORF). The vector may
30  further comprise a selectable marker sequence. Specific initiation and bacterial secretory
    signals also may be required for efficient translation of inserted target gene coding
    sequences.
    The present invention further provides host cells containing at least one of the DNAs of
    the present invention. The host cell can be virtually any cell for which expression vectors
35  are available. It may be, for example, a higher eukaryotic host cell, such as a mammalian
    cell, a lower eukaryotic host cell, such as a yeast cell, and may be a prokaryotic cell, such

   WO 2013/167669                                                       PCT/EP2013/059618
                                             15
    as a bacterial cell. Introduction of the recombinant construct into the host cell can be
    effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE, dextran mediated transfection,
    electroporation or phage infection.
 5  Bacterial expression
    Useful expression vectors for bacterial use are constructed by inserting a structural DNA
    sequence encoding a desired protein together with suitable translation initiation and
    termination signals in operable reading phase with a functional promoter. The vector will
    comprise one or more phenotypic selectable markers and an origin of replication to
10  ensure maintenance of the vector and, if desirable, to provide amplification within the host.
    Suitable prokaryotic hosts for transformation include E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella
    typhimurium and various species within the genera Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, and
    Staphylococcus.
    Bacterial vectors may be, for example, bacteriophage-, plasmid- or phagemid-based.
15  These vectors can contain a selectable marker and bacterial origin of replication derived
    from commercially available plasmids typically containing elements of the well known
    cloning vector pBR322 (ATCC 37017). Following transformation of a suitable host strain
    and growth of the host strain to an appropriate cell density, the selected promoter is de
    repressed/induced by appropriate means (e.g., temperature shift or chemical induction)
20  and cells are cultured for an additional period. Cells are typically harvested by
    centrifugation, disrupted by physical or chemical means, and the resulting crude extract
    retained for further purification.
    In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected
    depending upon the use intended for the protein being expressed. For example, when a
25  large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of antibodies or to
    screen peptide libraries, for example, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of
    fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable.
    Therefore an object of the present invention is an expression vector comprising a nucleic
    acid sequence encoding for the novel antibodies of the present invention.
30
    Mammalian expression and protein purification
    Preferred regulatory sequences for mammalian host cell expression include viral elements
    that direct high levels of protein expression in mammalian cells, such as promoters and/or
    enhancers derived from cytomegalovirus (CMV) (such as the CMV promoter/enhancer),
35  Simian Virus 40 (SV40) (such as the SV40 promoter/enhancer), adenovirus, (e.g., the

   WO 2013/167669                                                      PCT/EP2013/059618
                                             16
    adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP)) and polyoma. For further description of viral
    regulatory elements, and sequences thereof [see U.S. 5,168,062 by Stinski; U.S.
    4,510,245 by Bell et al.; U.S. 4,968,615 by Schaffner et al.]. The recombinant expression
    vectors can also include origins of replication and selectable markers [see U.S. 4,510,245
 5  by Bell et al.; U.S. 4,968,615 by Schaffner et al.; U.S. 4,399,216, by Axel et al.] Suitable
    selectable markers include genes that confer resistance to drugs such as G418,
    hygromycin or methotrexate, on a host cell into which the vector has been introduced. For
    example, the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene confers resistance to methotrexate
    and the neo gene confers resistance to G418.
10  Transfection of the expression vector into a host cell can be carried out using standard
    techniques such as electroporation, calcium-phosphate precipitation, and DEAE-dextran
    transfection.
    Suitable mammalian host cells for expressing the antibodies, antigen binding portions, or
    derivatives thereof provided herein include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) [including
15  dhfr- CHO cells, described in [U.S. 4,634,665 by Axel et al.] used with a DHFR selectable
    marker, e.g., as described in [U.S. 5,179,017, by Axel et al.]. NSO myeloma cells, COS
    cells and SP2 cells. In some embodiments, the expression vector is designed such that
    the expressed protein is secreted into the culture medium in which the host cells are
    grown. The antibodies, antigen binding portions, or derivatives thereof can be recovered
20  from the culture medium using standard protein purification methods.
    Antibodies of the invention or an antigen-binding fragment thereof can be recovered and
    purified from recombinant cell cultures by well-known methods including, but not limited to
    ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, Protein A chromatography,
    Protein G chromatography, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phospho-cellulose
25  chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography,
    hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. High performance liquid
    chromatography ("HPLC") can also be employed for purification [see Urlaub G, Chasin
    LA. (1980) Isolation of Chinese hamster cell mutants deficient in dihydrofolate reductase
    activity. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 77:4216-4220; e.g chapters 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, each
30  entirely incorporated herein by reference]. Antibodies of the present invention or antigen
    binding fragment thereof include naturally purified products, products of chemical
    synthetic procedures, and products produced by recombinant techniques from a
    eukaryotic host, including, for example, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian cells.
    Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the antibody
35  of the present invention can be glycosylated or can be non-glycosylated. Such methods
    are described in many standard laboratory manuals [see Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F. and

   WO 2013/167669                                                          PCT/EP2013/059618

    Molecular Biology. New York: John Wiley and Sons, chapters 10, 12, 13, 16, 18 and 20].
 5  Therefore an object of the present invention are also host cells comprising the vector or a
    nucleic acid molecule, whereby the host cell can be a higher eukaryotic host cell, such as
    a mammalian cell, a lower eukaryotic host cell, such as a yeast cell, and may be a
    prokaryotic cell, such as a bacterial cell.
    Another object of the present invention is a method of using the host cell to produce an
10  antibody and antigen binding fragments, comprising culturing the host cell under suitable
    conditions and recovering said antibody.
    Therefore another object of the present invention is the antibody 005-C04 produced with
    the host cells of the present invention and purified to at least 95% homogeneity by weight.
15  Affinity
    "Affinity" or "binding affinity" KD are often determined by measurement of the equilibrium
    association constant (ka) and equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) and calculating the
    quotient of kd to ka (KD = kd/ka). The term "immunospecific" or "specifically binding"
    means that the antibody binds to the coagulation factor XI and/or its activated form, the
20  coagulation factor Xla with an affinity     KD of lower than or equal to 10-6 M (monovalent
    affinity). The term "high affinity" means that the      KD that the antibody binds to to the
    coagulation factor XI and/or its activated form, the coagulation factor Xla with an affinity
    KD   of lower than or equal to 10-7 M (monovalent affinity). The antibody may have
    substantially greater affinity for the target antigen compared to other unrelated molecules.
25  The antibody may also have substantially greater affinity for the target antigen compared
    to homologs, e.g. at least 1.5-fold, 2-fold, 5-fold 10-fold, 100-fold, 10-3 -fold, 104-fold, 10-5
    fold, 10-6 -fold or greater relative affinity for the target antigen. Such affinities may be
    readily determined using conventional techniques, such as by equilibrium dialysis; by
    using the BlAcore 2000 instrument, using general procedures outlined by the
30  manufacturer; by radioimmunoassay using radiolabeled target antigen; or by another
    method known to the skilled artisan. The affinity data may be analyzed, for example, by
    the method described in [Kaufman RJ, Sharp PA. (1982) Amplification and expression of
    sequences cotransfected with a modular dihydrofolate reductase complementary dna
    gene. J Mol Biol.159:601-621].

    Antibodies
    As used herein the phrase "antibodies blocking the coagulation FXI and/or its activated
    form, the coagulation factor Xla" is meant to refer to a blockade of FXI and/or FXIa by the
    antibodies of the present invention which leads to a complete or partial inhibition of the
 5  coagulation factor FXI and/or FXIa activity. The amino acid sequences include, but are not
    limited to, those DNA molecules set forth in SEQ ID NOs 19 to 36.
    The term "antibody" is used in the broadest sense and includes fully assembled
    antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g.,
10  bispecific antibodies), antibody fragments that can bind the antigen ( e.g., Fab', F'(ab)2,
    Fv, single chain antibodies, diabodies), camel bodies and recombinant peptides
    comprising the forgoing as long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. Antibodies
    may carry different constant domains (Fc domains) on their heavy chain preferably
    derived from IgG1, IgG2, or IgG4 isotypes (see below). Mutations for modification of
15  effector functions may be introduced. Amino acid residues in the Fc-domain that play a
    dominant role in the interactions with the complement protein Clq and the Fc receptors
    have been identified and mutations influencing effector functions have been described [for
    a review see Colligan, Current Protocols in Immunology, or Current Protocols in Protein
    Science, John Wiley & Sons, NY, N.Y., (1997-2001)] Particularly, aglycosylation of IgG1
20  may be achieved by mutating asparagine to alanine or asparagine to glutamine at amino
    acid position 297, which has been reported to abolish antibody-derived cell-mediated
    cytotoxicity (ADCC) [Labrijn AF, Aalberse RC, Schuurman J. (2008) When binding is
    enough: nonactivating antibody formats. Curr Opin Immunol. 20:479-485]. Replacement of
    lysine by alanine at position 322 leads to reduction of ADCC and removal of complement
25  derived cytotoxicity (CDC), while simultaneous replacement of the two leucines at position
    234 and 235 by alanines leads to avoidance of ADCC and CDC [Sazinsky SL, Ott RG,
    Silver NW, Tidor B, Ravetch JV, Wittrup KD. (2008) Aglycosylated immunoglobulin G1
    variants productively engage activating Fc receptors. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.
     105:20167-20172] In order to apply IgG4 isotypes as bivalent therapeutics in vivo which
30  retain avidity, a modification such as the serine-to-proline exchange in the 'core hinge
    region' [Schuurman J, Van Ree R, Perdok GJ, Van Doorn HR, Tan KY, Aalberse RC.
    (1999) Normal human immunoglobulin G4 is bispecific: it has two different antigen
    combining sites. Immunology. 97:693-698] may be introduced. The tendency of human
    IgG2 molecules to form heterogeneous covalent dimers may be circumvented by
35  exchanging one of the cysteines at position 127, 232 and 233 to serine [Simmons LC,

    produced by recombinant DNA techniques or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact
    antibodies and are described further below. Nonlimiting examples of monoclonal
    antibodies include murine, chimeric, humanized, human, and Human Engineered T M
10  immunoglobulins, antibodies, chimeric fusion proteins having sequences derived from
    immunoglobulins, or muteins or derivatives thereof, each described further below.
    Multimers or aggregates of intact molecules and/or fragments, including chemically
    derivatized antibodies, are contemplated.
15  The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a
    population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies
    comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations
    that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being
    directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional
20  (polyclonal) antibody preparations that typically include different antibodies directed
    against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a
    single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal
    antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the homogeneous culture,
    uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins with different specificities and characteristics.
25
    The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from
    a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as
    requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the
    monoclonal antibodies to be used may be made by the hybridoma method first described
30  by Kohler et al. [Allen MJ, Guo A, Martinez T, Han M, Flynn GC, Wypych J, Liu YD, Shen
    WD, Dillon TM, Vezina C, Balland A. (2009) Interchain disulfide bonding in human IgG2
    antibodies probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Biochemistry. 48:3755-3766] or may be
    made by recombinant DNA methods [see An Z, Forrest G, Moore R, Cukan M, Haytko P,

    function. MAbs. 1:572-579]. The "monoclonal antibodies" may also be recombinant,
    chimeric, humanized, human, Human Engineered T M , or antibody fragments, for example.

    An "immunoglobulin" or "native antibody" is a tetrameric glycoprotein. In a naturally
    occurring immunoglobulin, each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide
    chains, each pair having one "light" (about 25 kDa) and one "heavy" chain (about 50-70
 5  kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a "variable" region of about 100
    to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy
    terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector
    function. Immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes depending on the amino
    acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains. Heavy chains are classified
10  as mu (p), delta (A), gamma (y), alpha (a), and epsilon (E), and define the antibody's
    isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Several of these may be further
    divided into subclasses or isotypes, e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2. Different
    isotypes have different effector functions; for example, IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes often have
    ADCC activity. Human light chains are classified as kappa (K) and lambda (A) light chains.
15  Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a "J" region
    of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a "D" region of about
     10 more amino acids [see generally K6hler G, Milstein C. (1975) Continuous cultures of
    fused cells secreting antibody of predefined specificity. Nature. 256:495-497].
    A     "functional fragment"       or    "antigen-binding   antibody    fragment"    of an
20  antibody/immunoglobulin hereby is defined as a fragment of an antibody/immunoglobulin
    (e.g., a variable region of an IgG) that retains the antigen-binding region. An "antigen
    binding region" of an antibody typically is found in one or more hypervariable region(s) of
    an antibody, i.e., the CDR-1, -2, and/or -3 regions; however, the variable "framework"
    regions can also play an important role in antigen binding, such as by providing a scaffold
25  for the CDRs. Preferably, the "antigen-binding region" comprises at least amino acid
    residues 4 to 103 of the variable light (VL) chain and 5 to 109 of the variable heavy (VH)
    chain, more preferably amino acid residues 3 to 107 of VL and 4 to 111 of VH, and
    particularly preferred are the complete VL and VH chains [amino acid positions 1 to 109 of
    VL and 1 to 113 of VH, while numbering of amino acid positions occurs according to the
30  Kabat database [U.S. Patent NO: 4,816,567]. A preferred class of immunoglobulins for
    use in the present invention is IgG.
    The term "hypervariable" region refers to the amino acid residues of the variable domains
    VH and VL of an antibody or functional fragment which are responsible for antigen
35  binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a "complementarity
    determining region" or CDR [i.e., residues 24-34 (LCDR1), 50- 56 (LCDR2) and 88-97
    (LCDR3) in the light chain variable domain and 29-36 (HCDR1), 48-66 (HCDR2) and 93-

   WO 2013/167669                                                        PCT/EP2013/059618

     102 (HCDR3) in the heavy chain variable domain and/or those residues from a
    hypervariable loop [i.e., residues 26-32 (within LCDR1), 50-52 (within LCDR2) and 91-96
    (within LCDR3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (within HCDR1), 53- 55
    (within HCDR2) and 96-101 (within HCDR3) in the heavy chain variable domain as
 5  described in [Fundamental Immunology, Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y.
    (1989)].
    Nonlimiting examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, domain
    antibody (dAb), complementarity determining region (CDR) fragments, single-chain
    antibodies (scFv), single chain antibody fragments, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies,
10  minibodies, linear antibodies [Johnson G, Wu TT. (2000) Kabat database and its
    applications: 30 years after the first variability plot. Nucleic Acids Res. 28:214-218];
    chelating recombinant antibodies, tribodies or bibodies, intrabodies, nanobodies, small
    modular immunopharmaceuticals (SMIPs), an antigen-binding-domain immunoglobulin
    fusion protein, a camelized antibody, a VHH containing antibody, or muteins or derivatives
15  thereof, and polypeptides that contain at least a portion of an immunoglobulin that is
    sufficient to confer specific antigen binding to the polypeptide, such as a CDR sequence,
    as long as the antibody retains the desired biological activity; and multispecific antibodies
    formed from antibody fragments [Chothia C, Lesk AM. (1987) Canonical structures for the
    hypervariable regions of immunoglobulins. J Mol Biol. 196:901-917; Zapata G, Ridgway
20  JB, Mordenti J, Osaka G, Wong WL, Bennett GL, Carter P. (1995) Engineering linear
    F(ab')2 fragments for efficient production in Escherichia coli and enhanced antiproliferative
    activity. Protein Eng. 8:1057-1062]. An antibody other than a "bispecific" or "bifunctional"
    antibody is understood to have each of its binding sites identical. The F(ab') 2 or Fab may
    be engineered to minimize or completely remove the intermolecular disulphide
25  interactions that occur between the    CH1  and CL domains. Papain digestion of antibodies
    produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called "Fab" fragments, each with a
    single antigen-binding site, and a residual "Fc" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to
    crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab')2 fragment that has two "Fv"
    fragments. An "Fv" fragment is the minimum antibody fragment that contains a complete
30  antigen recognition and binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy- and
    one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in this configuration
    that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on
    the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding
    specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv
35  comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind
    antigen.

                                             22
    "Single-chain Fv" or "sFv" or "scFv" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains
    of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain.
    Preferably, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and
 5  VL domains that enables the Fv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a
    review of sFv see         [C. A. K Borrebaeck, editor (1995) Antibody Engineering
    (Breakthroughs in Molecular Biology), Oxford University Press].
    The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first
10  constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab' fragments by
    the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain
    including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the
    designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear
    a free thiol group. F(ab')2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab'
15  fragments which have hinge cysteines between them.
    "Framework" or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the
    hypervariable region residues.
20  The phrase "constant region" refers to the portion of the antibody molecule that confers
    effector functions.
    The term "mutein" or "variant" can be used interchangeably and refers to the polypeptide
    sequence of an antibody that contains at least one amino acid substitution, deletion, or
25  insertion in the variable region or the portion equivalent to the variable region, provided
    that the mutein or variant retains the desired binding affinity or biological activity.
    Muteins may be substantially homologous or substantially identical to the parent antibody.
30  The term "derivative" refers to antibodies covalently modified by such techniques as
    ubiquitination, conjugation to therapeutic or diagnostic agents, labeling (e.g., with
    radionuclides or various enzymes), covalent polymer attachment such as pegylation
    (derivatization with polyethylene glycol) and insertion or substitution by chemical synthesis
    of non-natural amino acids.

    A "human" antibody or functional human antibody fragment is hereby defined as one that
    is not chimeric or "humanized" and not from (either in whole or in part) a non-human

   WO 2013/167669                                                    PCT/EP2013/059618

    species. A human antibody or functional antibody fragment can be derived from a human
    or can be a synthetic human antibody. A "synthetic human antibody" is defined herein as
    an antibody having a sequence derived, in whole or in part, in silico from synthetic
    sequences that are based on the analysis of known human antibody sequences. In silico
 5  design of a human antibody sequence or fragment thereof can be achieved, for example,
    by analyzing a database of human antibody or antibody fragment sequences and devising
    a polypeptide sequence utilizing the data obtained therefrom. Another example of a
    human antibody or functional antibody fragment is one that is encoded by a nucleic acid
    isolated from a library of antibody sequences of human origin (i.e., such library being
10  based on antibodies taken from a human natural source). Examples of human antibodies
    include n-CoDeR-based antibodies as described by [Kontermann R. and & Duebel S.,
    editors (2001) Antibody Engineering (Springer Laboratory Manual), Springer Verlag;
    Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and
    Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994); Carlsson R, S6derlind E.
15  (2001) n-CoDeR concept: unique types of antibodies for diagnostic use and therapy.
    Expert Rev Mol Diagn. 1:102-108].
    A "humanized antibody" or functional humanized antibody fragment is defined herein as
    one that is (1)derived from a non-human source (e.g., a transgenic mouse which bears a
20  heterologous immune system), which antibody is based on a human germline sequence;
    or (II) CDR-grafted, wherein the CDRs of the variable domain are from a non-human
    origin, while one or more frameworks of the variable domain are of human origin and the
    constant domain (if any) is of human origin.
25  The phrase "chimeric antibody," as used herein, refers to an antibody containing
    sequence derived from two different antibodies which typically originate from different
    species. Most typically, chimeric antibodies comprise human and murine antibody
    fragments, generally human constant and mouse variable regions.
30  An antibody of the invention may be derived from a recombinant antibody gene library.
    The development of ttechnologies for making repertoires of recombinant human antibody
    genes, and the display of the encoded antibody fragments on the surface of filamentous
    bacteriophage, has provided a recombinant means for directly making and selecting
    human antibodies, which also can be applied to humanized, chimeric, murine or mutein
35  antibodies. The antibodies produced by phage technology are produced as antigen
    binding fragments - usually Fv or Fab fragments - in bacteria and thus lack effector
    functions. Effector functions can be introduced by one of two strategies: The fragments

   WO 2013/167669                                                       PCT/EP2013/059618
                                              24
    can be engineered either into complete antibodies for expression in mammalian cells, or
    into bispecific antibody fragments with a second binding site capable of triggering an
    effector function. Typically, the Fd fragment (VH-CH1) and light chain (VL-CL) of
    antibodies are separately cloned by PCR and recombined randomly in combinatorial
 5  phage display libraries, which can then be selected for binding to a particular antigen. The
    Fab fragments are expressed on the phage surface, i.e., physically linked to the genes
    that encode them. Thus, selection of Fab by antigen binding co-selects for the Fab
    encoding sequences, which can be amplified subsequently. By several rounds of antigen
    binding and re-amplification, a procedure termed panning, Fab specific for the antigen are
10  enriched and finally isolated.
    A variety of procedures have been described for deriving human antibodies from phage
    display libraries. Such libraries may be built on a single master framework, into which
    diverse in vivo-formed (i. e. human-derived) CDRs are allowed to recombine as described
15  by [U.S. Patent NO: 6,989,250; U.S. Patent NO: 4,816,567]. Alternatively, such an
    antibody library may be based on amino acid sequences that have been designed in silico
    and encoded by nucleic acids that are synthetically created. In silico design of an antibody
    sequence is achieved, for example, by analyzing a database of human sequences and
    devising a polypeptide sequence utilizing the data obtained there from. Methods for
20  designing and obtaining in silico-created sequences are described; for example, see
    [Carlsson R, S6derlind E. (2001) n-CoDeR concept: unique types of antibodies for

 5  As used herein, different 'forms' of antigen, e.g. coagulation factor XI and/or the
    coagulation factor Xla, are hereby defined as different protein molecules resulting from
    different translational and posttranslational modifications, such as, but not limited to,
    differences in splicing of the primary FXI      transcript, differences in glycosylation, and
    differences in posttranslational proteolytic cleavage.
10
    As used herein, the term 'epitope' includes any protein determinant capable of specific
    binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of
    chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side
    chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as
15  specific charge characteristics. Two antibodies are said to 'bind the same epitope' if one
    antibody is shown to compete with the second antibody in a competitive binding assay, by
    any of the methods well known to those of skill in the art, and if preferably all amino acids
    of the epitope are bound by the two antibodies.
    The term 'maturated antibodies' or 'maturated antigen-binding fragments' such as
20  maturated Fab variants includes derivatives of an antibody or antibody fragment exhibiting
    stronger and / or improved      binding - i. e. binding with increased affinity - to a given
    antigen such as FXI. Maturation is the process of-identifying a small number of mutations
    within the six CDRs of an antibody or antibody fragment leading to this affinity increase.
    The maturation process is the combination of molecular biology methods for introduction
25  of mutations into the antibody and screening for identifying the improved binders.
    Pharmaceutical composition and administration
    The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions which may comprise
    FXI/FXIa antibodies, alone or in combination with at least one other agent, such as
30  stabilizing compound, which may          be administered in any sterile, biocompatible
    pharmaceutical carrier, including, but not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, and
    water. Any of these molecules can be administered to a patient alone, or in combination
    with other agents, drugs or hormones, in pharmaceutical compositions where it is mixed
    with excipient(s) or pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In one embodiment of the
35  present invention, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is pharmaceutically inert.
    The present invention also relates to the administration of pharmaceutical compositions.
    Such administration is accomplished parenterally. Methods of parenteral delivery include

   WO 2013/167669                                                         PCT/EP2013/059618
                                               26
    topical, intra-arterial (directly to the tumor), intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary,
    intrathecal, intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intrauterine or intranasal
    administration. In addition to the active ingredients, these pharmaceutical compositions
    may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and
 5  auxilliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which
    can be used pharmaceutically. Further details on techniques for formulation and
    administration may be found in the latest edition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences
    (Ed. Maack Publishing Co, Easton, Pa.).
10  Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of
    active compounds. For injection, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be
    formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as
    Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiologically buffered saline. Aqueous injection
    suspensions may contain substances that increase viscosity of the suspension, such as
15  sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Additionally, suspensions of the
    active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable
    lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid
    esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Optionally, the suspension may
    also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds
20  to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.
    For topical or nasal administration, penetrants appropriate to the particular barrier to be
    permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.
    The perenteral administration also comprises methods of parenteral delivery which also
    include intra-arterial, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary, intrathecal, and
25  intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intrauterine, vaginal, or intranasal
    administration.
    Kits
    The invention further relates to pharmaceutical packs and kits comprising one or more
30  containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the afore mentioned compositions
    of the invention. Associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed
    by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or
    biological products, reflecting approval by the agency of the manufacture, use or sale of
    the product for human administration.

    In another embodiment, the kits may contain DNA sequences encoding the antibodies of
    the invention. Preferably the DNA sequences encoding these antibodies are provided in a
    plasmid suitable for transfection into and expression by a host cell. The plasmid may
    contain a promoter (often an inducible promoter) to regulate expression of the DNA in the
 5  host cell. The plasmid may also contain appropriate restriction sites to facilitate the
    insertion of other DNA sequences into the plasmid to produce various antibodies. The
    plasmids may also contain numerous other elements to facilitate cloning and expression
    of the encoded proteins. Such elements are well known to those of skill in the art and
    include, for example, selectable markers, initiation codons, termination codons, and the
10  like.
    Manufacture and storage
    The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured in a
    manner that is known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving,
15  granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or
    lyophilizing processes.
    The pharmaceutical composition may be provided as a lyophilized powder in 1 mM-50
    mM histidine, 0.1%-2% sucrose, 2%-7% mannitol at a pH range of 4.5 to 5.5 that is
    combined with buffer prior to use.
20  After pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention formulated in
    an acceptable carrier have been prepared, they can be placed in an appropriate container
    and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition. For administration of anti-coagulation
    factor XI and/or anti-coagualtion factor Xla antibodies, such labeling would include
    amount, frequency and method of administration.
25
    IC50/EC50
    According to the FDA, IC50 represents the concentration of a compound that is required
    for 50% inhibition of a given biological process. The antibodies of the present invention
    exhibit IC50 values 100 pM, preferably 1 pM, more preferred 0.1 pM, more preferred 0.01
30  pM, more preferred 0.001 pM, more preferred 0.0001 pM.
    Therapeutically effective dose
    Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention include
    compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an effective amount to
35  achieve the intended purpose, i.e. treatment of a particular disease state characterized by

   WO 2013/167669                                                            PCT/EP2013/059618

    the coagulation factor XI and/or the coagulation factor Xla. The determination of an
    effective dose is well within the capability of those skilled in the art.
    A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of protein or its antibodies,
 5  antagonists, or inhibitors that ameliorate the symptoms or condition. Therapeutic efficacy
    and toxicity of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical
    procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., ED5o (the dose therapeutically
    effective in 50% of the population) and LD5o (the dose lethal to 50% of the population).
    The dose ratio between therapeutic and toxic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can
10  be expressed as the ratio, ED5 o/LD 5o. Pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit large
    therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal
    studies are used in formulating a range of dosage for human use. The dosage of such
    compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations what include the
    ED5o with little or no toxicity. The dosage varies within this range depending upon the
15  dosage form employed, sensitivity of the patient, and the route of administration.
    The exact dosage is chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient to be treated.
    Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active moiety or
    to maintain the desired effect. Additional factors that may be taken into account include
20  the severity of the disease state, age, weight and gender of the patient; diet, time and
    frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction sensitivities, and
    tolerance/response to therapy. Long acting pharmaceutical compositions might be
    administered every 3 to 4 days, every week, or once every two weeks, or once within a
    month depending on half-life and clearance rate of the particular formulation.
25
    Normal dosage amounts may vary from 0.1 to 100,000 micrograms, up to a total dose of
    about 2 g, depending upon the route of administration. Guidance as to particular dosages
    and methods of delivery is provided in the literature [see U.S. Patent NO: 6,300,064].
    Those skilled in the art will employ different formulations for polynucleotides than for
30  proteins or their inhibitors. Similarly, delivery of polynucleotides or polypeptides will be
    specific to particular cells, conditions, locations, etc. Preferred specific activities for a
    radiolabeled antibody may range from 0.1 to 10 mCi/mg of protein [WO08/022295, US.

    Measurement of the coagulation factor XI and/or the coagulation factor XIa
    inhibition in buffer.
    To determine the factor Xa inhibition of the substance listed above, a biological test
    system is constructed in which the conversion of a factor Xla substrate is used for
20  determining the enzymatic activity of human factor Xla. The determinations are carried out
    in microtitre plates.
    Determination of the anticoagulatory activity
    The anticoagulatory activity of the test substances is determined in vitro in human plasma
25  and / or rabbit plasma and / or rat plasma. To this end, blood is drawn off in a mixing ratio
    of sodium citrate/blood of 1/9 using a 0.11 molar sodium citrate solution as receiver.
    Immediately after the blood has been drawn off, it is mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at
    about 4000 g for 15 minutes. The supernatant is pipetted off.
    The prothrombin time (PT, synonyms: thromboplastin time, quick test) is determined in the
30  presence of varying concentrations of test substance or the corresponding solvent using a
    commercial test kit (Neoplastin@ from          Roche (former Boehringer Mannheim) or
    Hemoliance@ RecombiPlastin from Instrumentation Laboratory). The test compounds are
    incubated with the plasma at 370 C. for 3 minutes. Coagulation is then started by addition

   WO 2013/167669                                                      PCT/EP2013/059618
                                            30
    of thromboplastin, and the time when coagulation occurs is determined. The concentration
    of test substance which effected a doubling of the prothrombin time is determined.
    The thrombin time (TT) is determined in the presence of varying concentrations of test
    substance or the corresponding solvent using a commercial test kit (thrombin reagent
 5  from Roche). The test compounds are incubated with the plasma at 370 C. for 3 minutes.
    Coagulation is then started by addition of the thrombin reagent, and the time when
    coagulation occurs is determined. The concentration of test substance which effects a
    doubling of the thrombin time is determined.
    The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is determined in the presence of varying
10  concentrations of test substance or the corresponding solvent using a commercial test kit
    (PTT reagent from Roche). The test compounds are incubated with the plasma and the
    PTT reagent (cephalin, kaolin) at 370 C. for 3 minutes. Coagulation is then started by
    addition of 25 mM calcium chloride, and the time when coagulation occurs is determined.
    The concentration of test substance which effects a doubling of the aPTT is determined.
15  Concentrations of the antibodies of the present invention lead to a doubling of the aPTT at
    a concentration of 100 pM, preferably at a concentration of 1 pM, more preferred at a
    concentration of 0.1 pM, more preferred at a concentration of 0.01 pM, more preferred at
    a concentration of 0.001 pM, more preferred at a concentration of 0.0001 pM, more
    preferred at a concentration of 0.00001 pM.

    Therapeutic Use
    Anti-coagulation factor XI antibodies and/or anti-coagulation factor Xla antibodies of the
    invention may be administrated to any subject in which inhibition of the coagulation
    cascade and inhibition of platelet aggregation and inhibition of thrombosis would be
25  beneficial.
    Therefore, the anti-coagulation factor XI antibodies and/or anti-coagulation factor Xla
    antibodies of the invention are suitable for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of
    coagulation-related disease in humans as well as in animals.
    The term "thromboembolic diseases" includes diseases like myocardial infarction (MI) or
30  acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with and without ST elevation on ECG (STEMI and non
    STEMI), stable Angina Pectoris as well as unstable Angina Pectoris, re-occlusion and re
    stenosis following coronary intervention like angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft
    (CABG), peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD), pulmonary embolism (PE), deep

   WO 2013/167669                                                         PCT/EP2013/059618
                                               31
    vein thrombosis (DVT) as well as renal vein thrombosis, transient ischemic attack (TIA),
    thrombotic stroke and thromboembolic stroke.
    These antibodies are also useful for the treatment and prevention of cardiogenic
    thromboembolism        like cerebral ischemia, apoplectic stroke as well as systemic
 5  thromboembolism, for the treatment of patients with irregular heartbeat or abnormal heart
    rhythm e.g. for patients with atrial fibrillation, for patients with valvular heart disease of
    with artificial heart valves. Further on, these antibodies could be helpful in the treatment of
    patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
    Thromboembolic complications may be caused by atherosclerotic lesions of the vessel
10  wall, especially disturbance of endothelial function, which may lead to acute thrombotic
    occlusions. Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial disorder which depends on a large number
    of cardiovascular risk factors. Clinical studies have shown that prophylaxis with
    anticoagulants does not definitively influence the course of the arterial vascular disorder.
    Targeted treatment of the risk factors in conjunction with an antithrombotic therapy is
15  therefore advantageous. Risk factors for coronary, peripheral and cerebral vascular
    disorders are, for example: elevated serum cholesterol levels, arterial hypertension,
    cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus. The principles of preventive medicine are based
    on elimination of these risk factors. Besides a change in lifestyle, also included are
    pharmacological measures such as, for example, antihypertensive therapy, lipid-lowering
20  medicaments or thrombosis prophylaxis. In addition, combination with coronary
    therapeutic agents is suitable for the treatment where there is preexistent coronary heart
    disease.
    Thromboembolic complications are involved in             microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
    (MAHA), extracorporeal blood circulation like haemodialysis and aortic valve replacement.
25  In addition the antibodies of this invention are useful for the treatment or for prophylaxis of
    inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or like neurological diseases like
    Alzheimer's disease (AD). Further on, these antibodies could be useful for the treatment of
    cancer and metastasis, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), age related macular
    degeneration, diabetic retinopathies, diabetic nephropathies, as well as other
30  microvascular diseases.
    The antibodies of this invention are also useful for the treatment of thromboembolic
    complications following the surgery of tumor patients or tumor patients undergo a chemo
    and/or radiotherapy.

   WO 2013/167669                                                         PCT/EP2013/059618
                                              32
    The antibodies of this invention are also useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of
    Dialysis patients, especially the Cimino-fistula prevention of shunt thrombosis in
    hemodialysis. Hemodialysis can be performed using native arteriovenous fistulae,
    synthetic loop grafts, large-bore central venous catheters or other devices consisting of
 5  artificial surfaces. Administration of antibodies of this invention will prevent the formation
    of clot within the fistula (and propagation of embolized clot in the pulmonary arteries), both
    during dialysis and shortly thereafter.
    The antibodies of this invention are also useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of
    patients undergoing intracardiac and intrapulmonary thromboses after cardiopulmonary
10  bypass surgeries (e.g. .ECMO: Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation).
    Beneath the requirement for systemic anticoagulation, and the mechanical stability and
    duration of the device, major limitations of ventricular assist devices are the high incidence
    of thromboembolic events. Therefore, the antibodies of this invention are also useful for
    the treatment and/or prophylaxis of patients getting a left ventricular assist device.
15  There is a high need for anticoagulation in dialysis patients without increasing the risk of
    unwanted bleeding events and where the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE)
    and atrial fibrillation (e.g. end-stage renal disease in hemodialysis patients) in this
    population is high. The antibodies of this invention are also useful for the treatment and/or
    prophylaxis of these types of patients.
20  The antibodies of this invention are also useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of
    patients affected with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (IPT). These patients have an
    increased thrombotic risk compared to the general population. The concentration of the
    coagulation factor FXI is significantly higher in ITP patients compared to controls and
    aPTT is significantly longer in ITP patients.
25  The antibodies of this invention are also useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of
    pulmonary hypertension.
    The term "pulmonary hypertension" follows the guidelines defined by the World Health
    Organization WHO (Clinical Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension, Venice 2003), e.g.
    the pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary hypertension caused by left ventricular
30  disease, pulmonary hypertension caused by lung diseases and/or hypoxia, by               blood
    clots, artery constriction, and other diseases like chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
    hypertension (CTEPH).
    The term "pulmonary hypertension" also includes diseases like idiopathic pulmonary
    arterial hypertension IPAH, the familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (FPAH), the
35  associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (APAH), which could be associated with
    collagenosis , congenital systemic pulmonary shunt vitia, HIV infections, or the

                                             33
    administration of certain drugs in combination with diseases like thyroid diseases,
    Glycogen      storage    disease   (GSD),    Morbus     Gaucher,       hereditary hemorrhagic
    teleangiectasy, hemoglobinopathy, and/or myeloproliferative disorders.
    The antibodies of this invention are useful for the treatment and/or the prophylaxis of
 5  diseases like pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, the pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis
    (PCH), as well as the persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.
    The term "pulmonary hypertension" also includes diseases like the chronic obstructive
    pulmonary disease (CODP), interstitial lung disease (ILD),              sleep apnea, alveolar
    hyperventilation, altitude sickness, as well as constitutional dysplasia.
10  Diseases caused by chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) can be
    associated with proximal and/or distal pulmonary artery obstruction, or with non
    thrombotic lung emboli like cancer, parasites, or contaminants.
    Further on the antibodies of this invention can be used for the treatment and/or
    prophylaxis of the pulmonary hypertension caused by sarcoidosis, histiocytosis X, and
15  lymphangiomatosis.
    In addition, the antibodies of this invention may be useful for the treatment and/or
    prophylaxis of pulmonary and/or hepatic fibrosis.
    The antibodies of this invention are also useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of
    sepsis, the systemic inflammatory syndrome (SIRS), organ dysfunction, multiple organ
20  dysfunction syndrome (MODS) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung
    injury (ALI), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
    The term "sepsis" defines the occurrence of an infection or of the systemic inflammatory
    response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS is mainly induced by infections, but can also take place
    following lesion, burn, shock, operations, ischemia, pancreatitis, reanimation or tumor
25  affection. In the course of a sepsis, the coagulation cascade can be activated, a process
    termed as disseminated intravascular coagulation or shortly DIC. This can lead to the
    formation of microthrombi and to secondary complications.
    In addition, sepsis or SIRS can lead to endothelial dysfunction, leading to an increase in
    permeability vessel. In the course of sepsis or SIRS, combined failure of several organs
30  can take place, e.g. kidney failure, liver failure, lung failure, failure of the cardio-vascular
    system.
    Pathogenic organism inducing sepsis or SIRS are gram-positive and gram-negative
    bacteria, fungi, viruses, and/or eukaryotic pathogens.

     WO 2013/167669                                                       PCT/EP2013/059618
                                              34
      DIC and /or SIRS can occur in line with a sepsis, but can also occur due to an operation,
      tumor diseases, burning, or other types of injury.
      During DIC, an activation of the coagulation cascade takes place ate the surface of
      damaged vessels or other types of tissues. This could lead to the formation of
 5    microthrombi, which on their part are leading to the occlusion of small vessels.
      In one embodiment, the anti-coagulation factor XI antibodies and/or the anti-coagulation
      factor Xla antibodies is used in combination with other drugs for the treatment and/or
      prophylaxis of the already mentioned diseases.

    centrifugation step (1 h at 5500 rpm). The precipitated library was subsequently
    resuspended in 1 ml blocking buffer and incubated at r.t. for 30 min.
    Meanwhile, aliquots of streptavidin-coated Dynabeads M280 (Invitrogen, 11206D) were
    prepared by washing 3 times with PBST. After that some aliquotes were mixed with
 5  biotinylated Kallikrein/pre-Kallikrein (500 nM) or biotinylated hFXI (500 nM) while the
    remaining were mixed with the biotinylated target protein as indicated in Tab. 2 to 6 The
    mixtures were incubated ON at 4'C on an end-to-end rotator and subsequently washed 5
    times in 1 ml PBST. Coated beads were finally blocked by resuspension in 1 ml blocking
    buffer, aliquoted in 5 tubes follwed by collection of the beads and removal of the
10  supernatant.
    5 sequential depletion steps were done as indicated by adding the blocked library
    (described above) to blocked Dynabeads coated with biotinylated Kallikrein/pre-Kallikrein
    (500 nM) or biotinylated hFXI (500 nM) and incubated at r.t. for 10 min while rotating. After
    collection of the beads on a magnetic rack, the supernatant was cleared by centrifugation
15  and mixed with blocked Dynabeads coated with target protein. After 30 min incubation on
    an end-to-end rotator the samples were washed 3 times with blocking buffer followed by 9
    times washing with PBST. Half of the resuspended beads containing enriched phages
    were then used to infect exponentially growing E. coli TG1 (from Stratagene) for
    preparation of new phage stocks used in the next selection round according to the
20  strategies depicted in Tab. 2 - 6. In more detail, 6 ml of TG1-culture were infected with
    500 pl of dynabead/phage suspension for 30 min at 37'C without shaking. After that
    aliquots were taken for output tirtration. The remaining culture was centrifuged for 15 min
    at 5000 rpm and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 2 ml 2xYT and plated on agar
    plates (2xYT, 100 pg/ml ampicillin, 2% glucose). After over night incubation at 37'C, cells
25  were scraped off in 5 ml 2xYT and used to inoculate a fresh culture of 20 ml 2xYT (100
    pg/ml Amp) at an OD600 of 0.05 and for the preparation of glycerol stocks. The fresh
    liquid culture was shaked for about 2 h at 37'C until OD600 0.5 to 0.8 was reached, then
    5 ml culture were mixed with M13 helperphage M123K07 (Invitogen 420311) at an
    multiplicity of infection (MOI) of about 20. After slow shaking for 30 min at 37'C 30 ml
30  prewarmed 2xYT (100 pg/ml ampicillin, 20 pg/ml kanamycin, f.c.) was added and the
    culture skaked ON at 30'C. Next morning the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation
    at 6000 rpm and cleared by filtration through Steriflip (0,22pm; Milipore SCGP00525).
    Subsequently, phages were precipitated as descriped above and resuspended in 1 ml
    blocking buffer (or cell panning buffer) for use in the next selection round. Aliquots were
35  used for the determination of the input titer.

    Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA):
    Phage ELISA:
    Phage pools after different rounds of selection were analyzed for the enrichment of
    specific binder by ELISA on biotinylated target proteins. Briefly, aliquots from the glycerol
 5  stocks were plated on 2xYT (100 mg/ml ampicillin, 1% glucose) ON at 370C. Single
    colonies were picked into wells of MTP containing 100 pl medium (2xYT, 100 pg/ml
    ampicillin, 1 % glucose) and shaked overnight at 370C. Phage expression was performed
    by adding 10 pl of overnight culture to 190 pl fresh medium (2xYT supplemented with 100
    pg/ml ampicillin) containing helperphage M123K07 (Invitogen 420311) and incubating at
10  200 rpm and 370C in 96-well MTP until an OD600 of -0.5 was reached.
    96-well ELISA-plates pre-coated with streptavidin (Pierce, 15500) were coated over night
    at 40C with 1pg/ml biotinylated target protein. The next day plates were washed 7 times
    with PBST, treated with blocking reagent, and washed again 3 times with PBST.
    Meanwhile, ON phage cultures were mixed with 100 pl blocking buffer. After that 100 pl of
15  the blocked phages were transferred per well and incubated for 1 h at r.t.. After washing 7
    times with PBST, anti M13 antibody coupled to HRP (GE Healthcare, 27-9421-01; 1:2500
    diluted in PBST) was added, incubated for 1 h at r.t. and wells were washed again 7
    times.. Color reaction was developed by addition of 100 pl TMB (Invitrogen, 2023) and
    stopped after 5-15 min by adding 100 pl H2 SO 4 (Merck, 1120801000). Colorimetric
20  reaction was recorded at 450 nM in a plate reader (Tecan).

    Example 4: Determination of the anti-aggregatory activity of the FXIa antibody
    For the measurement of platelet activation under flow conditions, glass slides (Menzel
 5  Glsser SUPERFROST 76 x 26 mm; Gerhard Menzel GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany)
    were coated with collagen (150 pg/ml) overnight at 4 C, followed by blocking with BSA (5
    mg/ml) prior to assembly into a flow system on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 135
    microscope (Carl Zeiss, G6ttingen, Germany). Citrated whole blood was incubated with
    GPRP (3 mM final) and vehicle or FXI antibodies for 10 min at 37C. After the addition of
10  CaCl2 (5 mM), blood was immediately perfused over the collagen-coated slide at the initial
    shear rate of 1000 s1 for 5 min. After the perfusion of whole blood as described above,
    post-chamber whole blood was collected into sodium citrate (1:10 vol/vol) at each 1 min.
    Pre-chamber blood was also sampled and treated with or without TRAP6 as positive
    control (10 pg/ml) for 5 min.
15
    Pre- and post-chamber blood samples were diluted in Cell Wash (BD Biosciences,
    Heidelberg, Germany) and incubated with antibodies for 20 min at 4 C. Antibody reaction
    was stopped by adding ice cold-Cell Wash and all samples were kept on ice until
    measurement. 10000 single platelets were determined with the positivity of the FITC
20  conjugated platelet marker (CD41a or CD61a) and the characteristic light scatter patterns
    by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). For CD62P
    expression, single platelets were gated to a separate scatter plot with a PE-CD62P
    fluorescence threshold which was verified with unlabeled control samples. The platelet
    population above the threshold was considered activated and quantified. Platelet
25  microaggregates were defined with the arbitrary thresholds for Forward Scatter (FSC) and
    FITC-fluorescence.
    Example 5: FeCl 2 induced thrombosis and ear bleeding time in rabbits.
    The antithrombotic activity of 076D-M007-H04, 076D-M007-H04-CDRL3-N110D and
30  076D-M028-H17 was determined in an arterial thrombosis model. 15 minutes after an i.v.
    bolus administration of 076D-M007-H04 (0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg), 076D-M007-H04
    CDRL3-N110D (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1mg/kg) or 076D-M028-H17 (0.075 mg/kg, 0.15
    mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg) thrombosis was induced by chemical damage of a carotid artery by

    ferric chloride in rabbits. Male rabbits (Crl:KBL (NZW)BR, Charles River) were
    anaesthetized with a mixture of xylazine and ketamine (Rompun, Bayer 5 mg/kg and
    Ketavet Pharmacia & Upjohn GmbH, 40 mg/kg body weight) given by i.m. injection.
    Supplemental anesthesia was administered by infusion of the anesthetic mixture in the
 5  marginal vein of the right ear. After exposure of the right common carotid artery vascular
    damage was produced by placing a piece of blotting paper (10 mm x 10 mm) on a strip of
    Parafilm @ (25 mm x 12 mm) under the right common carotid artery in a way that the
    blood flow was not affected. The blotting paper was saturated with 100 pl FeC12 (Iron(II)
    chloride tetrahydrate), 13% in A. dest, Sigma). After 5 minutes the filter paper was
10  removed, and the vessel was rinsed twice with 0.9% NaCl. 30 minutes after the injury the
    carotid artery was removed, the thrombus withdrawn and weighed immediately. 5-7
    animals were used for each group. The ear bleeding time was determined 2 minutes after
    the FeCl2-injury. The left ear was shaved and a standardized incision (3 mm long) was
    made with a surgical blade (number 10-150-10, Martin, Tuttlingen, Germany) parallel to
15  the long axis of the ear. Care was taken to avoid damage of visible blood vessels. The
    incision sites were blotted at 30 sec intervals with filter paper, carefully avoiding contact
    with the wound. The bleeding time was determined by measuring the time from the
    incision until blood no longer stained the filter paper.
20  Example 6: Determination of the FeCl 2 induced thrombosis and ear bleeding time in
    rabbits.
    076D-M007-H04 dose-dependently reduces the thrombus weight and does not prolong
    the ear bleeding time as shown in figure 14. Figure 15 demonstrates the antithrombotic
    effect of 076D-M007-H04-CDRL3-N1 10D without an increase in ear bleeding time. In
25  figure 16 the antithrombotic effect and no bleeding time prolongation of 076D-M028-H17
    is shown.

30  Complex formation and Crystallization.
    FXIa C500S (amino acids 388 - 625) was purchased by Proteros Biostructures. Purified
    Fab 076D-M007-H04 was mixed in an 1:1 ratio with FXIa C500S. To allow complex
    formation the solution was stored for 18 hours on ice. The complex solution was loaded
    on a Superdex 200 HR 16/60 column and was further concentrated to a final
35  concentration of 20mg/ml in 20 mM Tris / HCI at pH 7.5 and 75 mM NaCl. Crystals of the
    protein complex comprising Fab 076D-M007-H04 and FXIa C500S were grown at 20'C

    Data Collection and Processing.
 5  Crystal was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen without use of cryo-buffer. Data of crystal was
    collected at beamline BL14.1, BESSY synchrotron (Berlin) on a MAR CCD detector. Data
    was indexed and integrated with XDS (Kabsch, W. (2010) Acta Cryst. D66, 125-132),
    prepared for scaling with POINTLESS, and scaled with SCALA (P.R. Evans, (2005) Acta
    Cryst. D62, 72-82). The crystal diffracted up to 2.7 A and possesses orthorhombic space
10  group P2(1)22(1) with cell constant a=61.9, b=70.7, c=185.9 and one Fab 076D-M007

    Structure Determination and Refinement.
    The complex-structure of FXIa and the monoclonal antibody Fab 076D-M007-H04 was
    solved by molecular replacement in different steps. First the H-chain was located using
15  BALBES (F.Long, A.Vagin, P.Young and G.N.Murshudov (2008) Acta Cryst. D64, 125
     132), with pdb code 3GJE as search model. Then FXIa C500S was added using program
    MolRep with an internal FXIa crystal structure as search model. Initial refinement with
    REFMAC5.5 (G.N. Murshudov et al. (1997) Acta Cryst. D53, 240-255) results in R1 =
    39.4% and Rfree = 44.1%. Finally, the H-chain was located using the L-chain of pdb entry
20  31DX as search model and fixed coordiantes of the initially refined H-chain and FXIa
    C500S solution. Iterative rounds of model building with COOT (P. Emsley et al. (2010)
    Acta Cryst. D66:486-501) and maximum likelihood refinement using REFMAC5.5
    completed the model. Data set and refinement statistics are summarized in table 10.

    In summary, FXIa C500S epitope is formed by the following residues:

    Fab 076D-M007-H04 acts as a allosteric competitive inhibitor. It is not blocking the acive
    site of FXIa directly but binds adjacent to it. This adjacent binding triggers a re
10  arrangement of parts of active site of FXIa hindering natural substrates to bind to activated
    FXIa (Figure 18).
    In contrast, Fab 076D-M007-H04 does not bind zymogen FXI. In the reported x-ray
    structure of zymogen FXI (pdb entry 2F83) various loops building up the active site as well
    as the epitope to Fab 076D-M007-H04 are not properly ordered. Especially the epitope
15  region is well structured in the Fab 076D-M007-H04:FXla C500S complex.
    Example 9: Hydrogen/Deuterium-Exchange Mass Spectrometry-based Epitope
    mapping.
    A different analysis of Epitope mapping has been performed by the contract research
20  organization ExSAR [ExSAR Corporation; 11 Deer Park Drive, Suite 103; Monmouth
    Junction, NJ 08852; USA]. In this case, the interactions of FXIa C500S (amino acids 388
    - 625; purchased by Proteros Biostructures) and the purified Fabs of 076D-M007-H04
    and 076D-M049-015, respectively, have been analyzed by the differential
    hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry method [for overview see Percy AJ,

    21]. Thereby, differences in the deuteration level of more than 10% indicates a strong
    protection by the Fab of the corresponding antigen. Values between 5 and 10% indicate
 5  weak binding, differences in the deuteration level of below 5% indicates no protection at
    al.

    These data clearly show that covering an epitope of 200 amino acids within FXIa (amino
    acids 408 - 609 of FXIa C500S) leads to an inhibition of FXIa proteolytic activity.
    Example 10: Functional neutralization of FXIa by antibodies of this invention
 5  Human FXIa (Haematologic Technologies, Inc., catalogue number HCXIA-0160) activity is
    determined by measuring the cleavage of a specific, fluorogenically-labeled substrate (I
     1575, Bachem, final concentration 25 pM) and the fluorescence is monitored continuously
    at 360/465 nm using a SpectraFluorplus Reader (Tecan). For testing the inhibitory activity,
    the antibodies are pre-incubated for 60 minutes at 37'C with a final concentration of 10
10  nM of FXIa in a buffer containing 50mM Tris/HCI, 100mM NaCl, 5mM CaC12 and 0.1%
    BSA. Following this incubation step, the substrate I-1575 is added, and the signals from
    the reaction are measured. Data are analyzed using the GraphPadPrism software as
    shown in figure 1, figure 2, figure 3, and in figure 4. Data are given as mean ± SEM, n= 4.
    For some experiments instead of the full length human FXIa (Haematologic Technologies,
15  Inc., catalogue number HCXIA-0160) the isolated catalytic domain of FXIa C500S (amino
    acids 388 - 625; purchased by Proteros Biostructures) is used. All other conditions are as
    described above.

    M007-H04 in an experimental thrombosis in vivo model in primates.
    Experimental Procedures
 5  Experiments were conducted on non-anticoagulated awake juvenile baboons weighing 9
     11 kg. These animals had chronic exteriorized arterio-venous (AV) shunts placed between
    the femoral artery and vein, as described elsewhere (Hanson et al. (1993) Journal of
    Clinical Investigation 92:2003-2012). Baseline shunt blood flow exceeded 250 ml/min in all
    study animals. Anxiety was managed with low dose ketamine (< 2mg/kg/hr). Whole blood
10  cell counts were measured daily, before and after the experiments. Calculated blood loss
    did not exceed 4% of total blood volume on any experimental day.a
    Thrombus formation was initiated within the baboon AV shunt by interposing a
    thrombogenic segment of prosthetic vascular graft (ePTFE, WL Gore & Co., Flagstaff,
    Ariz.), as previously described (Hanson et al. [1993] J. Clin. Invest. 92:2003-2012). To
15  consistently trigger platelet-dependent thrombus formation, the clinical graft segments
    were coated with immobilized collagen. Twenty mm long grafts having internal diameters
    (i.d.) of either 2 or 4 mm were filled with equine type I collagen (1 mg/ml; Nycomed
    Arzenmittel, Munich, Germany) for 15 min, and then dried overnight under sterile airflow.
    This method produced a uniform collagen coating within the graft lumen as determined by
20  scanning electron microscopy. In addition, in some experiments, a 20mm long chamber of
    9mm i.d. followed the 20mm long graft with 4mm i.d. to model average venous and arterial
    shear rates, respectively. The thrombogenic collagen-coated grafts were then
    incorporated between segments of silicon rubber tubing, and deployed into the AV shunts.
    The grafts were exposed to blood for up to 60 min. During each experiment, the blood
25  flow rate through the graft was restricted to 100 ml/min by clamping the proximal silicone
    rubber shunt segment, thereby producing a mean wall shear rate (MWSR) in the 4 mm
    grafts of 265/sec, while in the 2 mm grafts the initial MWSR was 2120/sec. Flow rates
    were continuously monitored using an ultrasonic flow meter (Transonics Systems, Ithaca,
    N.Y.). The 4 mm grafts did not occlude and pulsatile flow rates remained at 100 ml/min
30  until the thrombogenic graft segments were removed at 60 min. Baseline blood flow was
    restored through the permanent shunt after each experiment. In the 2 mm diameter grafts
    blood flow rates progressively declined due to thrombus formation. The grafts were
    removed from the AV shunts when the flow rate fell from 100 ml/min to below 20 ml/min,
    signaling imminent occlusion. The time from initiation of blood flow to graft removal (<20
35  ml/min blood flow) was taken as the occlusion time.
    For imaging of the platelet deposition, autologous baboon platelets were labeled with 1
    mCi of 111In-oxine as previously described (Hanson et al. [1993] J. Clin. Invest. 92:2003-

   WO 2013/167669                                                     PCT/EP2013/059618
                                            86
    2012). Labeled platelets were infused and allowed to circulate for at least 1 h before
    studies were performed. Accumulation of labeled platelets onto thrombogenic grafts and
    silicon chambers were measured in 5-min intervals using a gamma scintillation camera.
    Homologous 1251-labeled baboon fibrinogen (4 pCi, >90% clottable) was infused 10 min
 5  before each study, and incorporation of the labeled fibrin within the thrombus was
    assessed using a gamma counter >30 days later to allow the 111 In to decay. The
    radioactivity deposited (cpm) was divided by the clottable fibrin(ogen) radioactivity of
    samples taken at the time of the original study (cpm/mg).
    Occlusion studies were performed using 20 mm long, 2 mm i.d. collagen-coated devices
10  which produced high initial wall shear rates (2120/sec at 100 ml/min clamped blood flow).
    Accumulation of labeled platelets onto the 2 mm thrombogenic grafts were measured in 3
    min intervals using a gamma scintillation camera. Flow was maintained at 100 ml/min by
    proximal clamping for as long as possible, and then allowed to decrease as the
    propagating thrombus began to occlude the device. A final blood flow rate of 20 ml/min
15  was used as a cutoff for occlusion, since a fully occlusive thrombi and lack of blood flow
    through the device could lead to occlusion of the shunt and a significant loss of blood for
    the animals.
    Blood sample analysis. Blood cell counts were determined using a micro-60 automated
20  cell counter (Horiba-ABX Diagnostics). Blood samples were collected into a final
    concentration of 0.32% sodium citrate. All samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 12,900 g,
    and the plasmas were collected and stored at minus 80' C. Cross-reacting ELISA assays
    were used to determine thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT, Enzygnost-TAT, Dade
    Behring; LOD: 2 ng/mL). All ELISA test kits utilized for these studies have previously
25  shown sensitivity to baboon markers.
    In interruption studies (4mm i.d. collagen-coated graft only), 076D-M007-H04 was
    administered as a bolus 30 minutes into the study (0.5mg/kg, i.v. bolus over 10 seconds)
    to determine whether this antibody can interrupt acute thrombus propagation. In occlusion
    studies (2mm i.d. collagen-coated graft only), 076D-M007-H04 was administered as a
30  bolus 3 hours before the experiment (0.5mg/kg or 2mg/kg 24 hours following a 0.5mg/kg
    dose, i.v.). In prevention studies (4mm i.d. collagen-coated graft followed by 9mm i.d.
    silicon chamber), 076-M007-H04 was administered as a bolus 1 hour before the
    experiment (0.5mg/kg or 2mg/kg 24 hours following a 0.5mg/kg dose, i.v.).
    Hemostatic assessment. The effects of FXIa inhibition on primary hemostasis in baboons
35  were assessed using the standard template skin bleeding time test (Surgicutt@,
    International Technidyne Corp). Experimentally, this and similar tests (e.g., Simplate
    bleeding times) have been shown to be sensitive to the effects of therapeutic

   WO 2013/167669                                                        PCT/EP2013/059618

    anticoagulants, anti-platelet agents, and coagulation abnormalities in humans and non
    human primates (Gruber et al. [2007] Blood 109:3733-3740; Smith et al. [1985] Am. J.
    Clin. Pathol. 83:211-215; Payne et al. [2002] J. Vasc. Surg. 35:1204-1209). All bleeding
    time measurements were performed by the same expert technician. For indirect
 5  assessment of hemostasis, aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time; SynthASil,
    HemoslL; Instrumentation Laboratory Company, Bedford, MA) and ACT (activated clotting
    time, LupoTek KCT; r2 Diagnostics, South Bend, IN) measurements were also performed
    at various time-points before, during, and after the experiments.
10  In vitro aPTT. Various concentrations of 076D-M007-H04 were incubated in plasma for 10
    minutes prior to the initiation of the aPTT assay. As shown in figure 20, aPTT clotting
    times were determined in plasma samples collected from the baboons at the "pre" time
    point, i.e., before any treatment was administered. Results show that 076D-M007-H04
    was anticoagulant in plasma from all 6 experimental baboons used in the thrombosis
15  studies.
    In vivo clotting Studies. Three baboons were used in these studies: two baboons were
    dosed with 076D-M007-H04 (2.5mg/kg H04, i.v. bolus) after being given 32m/kg chewable
    aspirin and 1 baboon was dosed with 0.5mg/kg 076D-M007-H04 (i.v. bolus) followed by a
    2mg/kg dose 24 hours later (i.v. bolus). ACT (figure 21 and figure 22) and aPTT (figure 23
20  and figure 24) were measured at various time-points following administration.
    Platelet deposition during shunt experiments.
    Thrombosis occlusion experiments. The thrombogenic device that was used to evaluate
    whether 076D-M007-H04 treatment can prevent occlusion of a small blood vessel or
25  prolong the time to occlusion consisted of a 2mm i.d., 20mm long collagen-coated graft.
    As shown in figure 25, platelet deposition is shown for 60 minutes or until the time of graft
    occlusion when applicable. 12/14 control devices occluded within 60 minutes, while 2/5
    076D-M007-H04 (0.5mg/kg) and 2/5 076D-M007-H04 (0.5mg/kg + 2mg/kg) devices
    occluded. Data are means ± SEM.

    Thrombosis prevention experiments. The thrombogenic device that was used to evaluate
    the effect of 076D-M007-H04 on thrombus initiation and propagation consisted of a 4mm
    i.d., 20mm long collagen-coated ePTFE graft that was followed by a 9mm i.d., 20mm long
    silicon rubber chamber. The slope of platelet deposition as shown in figure 26 is an
35  indication of antiplatelet activity. Both doses of 076D-M007-H04 (0.5mg/kg and 0.5mg/kg
    followed by 2mg/kg 24 hours later) showed efficacy as evidenced by reduction in the rates
    of platelet deposition at various times from the initiation of thrombus formation. The data

   WO 2013/167669                                                       PCT/EP2013/059618
                                             88
    have been normalized to account for platelet count variations between experiments. Data
    are means ± SEM.
    As shwon in figure 27 both doses of 076D-M007-H04 (0.5mg/kg and 0.5mg/kg followed by
    2mg/kg 24 hours later) showed efficacy as evidenced by the profound reduction in the
 5  rates of platelet deposition in the silicon chamber at various times from the initiation of
    thrombus formation. Data are means + SEM.
    Thrombin anti-thrombin complexes. Since inhibition of FXI could reduce thrombus
    formation in vivo both by limiting thrombin-mediated platelet activation and fibrin formation
10  and/or by increasing thrombolysis, levels of thrombin anti-thrombin (TAT) were measured
    using a commercially available ELISA kit. As shown in figure 28, pretreatment of baboons
    with 076D-M007-H04 (0.5mg/kg and 0.5mg/kg followed by 2mg/kg 24 hours later)
    prevented the increase in TAT levels, implying a profound reduction in thrombin
    generation in the absence of FXla activity.

    Bleeding Times. Primary hemostasis was evaluated using the adult Surgicutt device
    (http://www.itcmed/com/products/surgicutt-bleeding-time-device) that has been approved
    by the FDA for use in children and adults. Bleeding time (BT) was manually recorded. The
    wound was observed for re-bleeding for 30 minutes, and the skin was evaluated for
20  bruising, petechiae, hematomas, and suffusions the next day. One or more of these
    hemostasis assessments have been shown to be sensitive and predictive of the
    antihemostatic effects of virtually all marketed antithrombotic agents (antiplatelet drugs,
    anticoagulants, thrombolytics).
25  Baboons were administered 076D-M007-H04 (0.5mg/kg and 2mg/kg 24 hours later) alone
    or after they were given chewable aspirin (ASA, 32mg/kg). As shown in figure 29 there
    was no increase in bleeding time with any of the 076D-M007-H04 treatments compared to
    baseline. Administration of 076D-M007-H04 to aspirin-treated animals did not seem to
    further increase the bleeding time compared to aspirin treatment alone.
