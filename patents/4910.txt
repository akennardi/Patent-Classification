   Statement of the Technical Field
   [00011     The present disclosure relates to electrical interfaces. More particularly, the present
  disclosure relates to electrical interfaces with floating contacts, contact redundancy and break
  away retention.
  Description of the Related Art
  [0002]      There are many electrical interfaces known in the art. Some of these known electrical
  interfaces comprise spring fingers, fixed pins and/or pogo pins. These known electrical
  interfaces suffer from certain drawbacks. For example, a single point of contact is provided
 between a finger/pogo pin and a mating conductor. During severe shock and/or vibration, the
 contact between the finger/pogo pin and mating conductor can be lost. Additionally, the
 finger/pogo pin could be damaged as a result of excessive stress on the fixed points of the
 electrical interface. In effect, the reliability of such conventional electrical interfaces is not
 satisfactory for certain applications, such as military applications.
                                   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 [00031      The present disclosure concerns systems and methods for providing an electrical
interface between a male plug and a female receptacle. The method comprises: receiving a
conductive pin of the male plug in a socket opening of the female receptacle; providing (a) a
plurality of first spring loaded floating contact points between an elongate body of the
conductive pin and an electrical contact of the female receptacle and (b) at least one second
spring loaded floating contact point between a tip of the conductive pin and the electrical contact
of the female receptacle, when the conductive pin is fully inserted into the female receptacle; and
maintaining at least two of the first and second spring loaded floating contact points when the pin
moves within the socket opening as a result of an external force applied to the male plug or
female receptacle.

                                                                                                   RF-1050
  100041       In some scenarios, the electrical contact comprises: a plurality of first elongate spring
  contacts extending in a first direction parallel to the center axis of the socket opening; and a
  second elongate spring contact extending in a second direction different than the first direction.
  The first and second elongate spring contacts are electrically connected to each other via a planar
  contact provided for connecting the female receptacle's electrical contact to an external circuit.
  [00051       In those or other scenarios, the plurality of first spring loaded floating contact points
  is provided by a plurality of first conductive spring contacts respectively applying spring forces
  on a plurality of conductive retention members. The conductive retention members are slidingly
  disposed in a support structure of the female receptacle and in direct contact with the elongate
 body of the conductive pin. The first conductive spring contacts are spaced apart along a
 periphery of a support structure of the female receptacle. An elastic member applies a retention
 force on each said first conductive spring contact in a direction towards a center axis of the
 female receptacle. The elastic member may also provide an environmental seal at least reducing
 an ingress of contaminants into the socket opening. The second spring loaded floating contact
 point is provided by a second spring contact that is in direct contact with the conductive pin's tip.
 100061       In those or other scenarios, the following events occur as the pin is being inserted into
 the female receptacle: a first chamfered edge of the conductive pin slides against second
 chamfered edges of a plurality of conductive retention members disposed in the female
 receptacle whereby each said conductive retention member is urged from a first position in a
 direction away from the socket opening; pushing forces are respectively applied by the plurality
of conductive retention members on a plurality of first spring contacts so as to cause the plurality
of first spring contacts to flex away from the socket opening; and the plurality of first spring
contacts respectively apply spring forces in directions towards the socket opening on the
plurality of conductive retention members so as to cause each said conductive retention member
to return to the first position when the conductive pin is inserted a certain distance into the socket
opening.

                                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
  100231      The invention is described with reference to the attached figures. The figures are not
  drawn to scale and they are provided merely to illustrate the instant invention. Several aspects of
  the invention are described below with reference to example applications for illustration. It
  should be understood that numerous specific details, relationships, and methods are set forth to
 provide a full understanding of the invention. One having ordinary skill in the relevant art,
  however, will readily recognize that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the
 specific details or with other methods. In other instances, well-known structures or operation are
 not shown in detail to avoid obscuring the invention. The invention is not limited by the
 illustrated ordering of acts or events, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or
 concurrently with other acts or events. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts or events are required
 to implement a methodology in accordance with the invention.
 [00241       The present disclosure concerns electrical interfaces or connectors. The electrical
 interfaces or connectors solve many drawbacks of conventional electrical interfaces or
 connectors (such as those discussed in the background section of this document) associated with
the following issues: loss of electrical contact during shock and vibration; stresses on Printed
Wiring Board ("PWB") solder joints; stresses on connector pins; complexity and limitations of
pogo pins; and/or precision alignment requirements for engagement between the male plug and
the female receptacle.
[0025J       The electrical interfaces or connectors discussed herein: provide electrical
connections with contact point redundancy; allow for blind mating of the male plug and the
female receptacle; provide strain relief at cable connections; and/or have environmentally sealed
                                                 4

                                                                                                 RF-1050
  housings. The electrical interfaces or connectors also have a floating contact feature. The
  floating contact feature minimizes mating alignment errors and/or issues resulting from shock
  and/or vibration. In this regard, the floating contact feature allows the mating contact to float in
  at least two directions (e.g., X, Y and/or Z directions). The electrical interfaces or connectors
  further have a break-away retention feature. The break-away retention feature reliably allows
  components to break free from each other and/or their mounted position in emergency situations.
  This break-away retention feature is a requirement in many stationary and mobile applications
  where personnel safety and equipment survival cannot be compromised. Accordingly, the
  electrical interfaces or connectors are designed to allow the couplings of a male plug and a
  female receptacle to disconnect at selectable, predetermined forces.
  [0026]       The male plug generally comprises a housing which supports at least one pin to be
 inserted into the female receptacle. An exemplary male plug is shown in FIGS. 10-11. The male
 plug of FIGS. 10-11 is shown with seven (7) pins. The present solution is not limited in this
 regard. The male plug can have any number of pins selected in accordance with a particular
 application. For example, the male plug used in connection with the female receptacle of FIGS.
  1-4 has a single pin since the female receptacle has a single socket opening as described below.
 100271       Referring now to FIGS. 1-4, there are provided illustrations of an exemplary
 architecture for a female receptacle 100 having a single socket opening. The female receptacle
 100 comprises a housing (or support structure) 102, a plurality of elastic members 104A, 104B,
 104C, 104D, a plurality of spring contacts 106A, 106B, 106C, 106D, 110 and a plurality of
retention members 108A, 108B, 108C, 108D. Although four (4) elastic members 104A-104D,
spring contacts 106A-106D and retention members 108A-108D are shown in FIGS. 1-4, the
present solution is not limited in this regard. Any number of elastic members, spring contacts
and retention members can be employed in accordance with a given application.
100281        Also, the respective placements of the elastic members, spring contacts and retention
members need not be the same as that shown in FIGS. 1-4. For example, each spring contact
may be offset from all other spring contacts as opposed to being aligned with one (1) other
spring contact as shown in FIGS. 1-4 (e.g., spring contact 106A is aligned with spring contact
106D and spring contact 106B is aligned with spring contact 106C). In this regard, the spring

   contacts 106A-106D may or may not be equally spaced along a periphery of the housing (or
   support structure) 102. These statements apply equally to the elastic members and retention
   members 108A-108D.
   [00291     The housing (or support structure) 102 is provided for housing and/or structurally
   supporting the elastic members, spring contacts and retention members. In this regard, the
  housing 102 is formed of rigid or semi-rigid dielectric material, such as plastic. The housing 102
  comprises a socket opening (or aperture) 112 in which a pin 402 of a male plug (not shown in
  FIGS. 1-4) can be inserted into the female receptacle 100 so as to establish an electrical
  connection therebetween (as shown in FIG. 4).
  [0030]      Notably, five (5) floating contact points (spring loaded) are provided by the present
  solution which results in an electrical interface with extreme contact point redundancy. The
  extreme contact point redundancy and spring loading ensures that there are a minimum of two
  (2) points of contact at all times (even in extreme vibration and shock scenarios where the pin
 402 moves around in the socket) between the male plug's pin and the female receptacle's
 electrical contact. In this regard, it should be understood that electrical connections are provided
 between the following components when the male plug and female receptacle are coupled to
 each other (in times when the connectors are not subjected to shock and vibration): (A) the pin's
 tip 420 and the spring contact 110; and (B) the pin's elongate body 422 and each spring contact
 106A-106D via a respective retention member 108A-108D. The pin 402, spring contacts 110,
 106A-106D and retention members 108A-108D are fonned of a conductive material, such as
 metal (e.g., copper or brass).
 [0031]      The spring contacts 110, 106A-106D are electrically connected to each other via a
planar contact 202. The spring contacts 110, 106A-106D can be integrally formed with the
planar contact 202 so as to provide a single contact component as shown in FIG. 2. In this case,
the single contact component can be formed from a circular planar plate.
10032]       The planar contact 202 is also formed of a conductive material, such as metal (e.g.,
copper or brass). The planar contact 202 provides a means to electrically connect the female
receptacle 100 to external circuitry, such as that disposed on a PWB. In this case, solder and/or a
wire can be used to establish this electrical connection.

   [00331      Each spring contact 110, 106A-106D is designed to allow the pin 402 to float in the
   socket opening 112. Accordingly, each spring contact 110, 106A-106D protrudes out and away
  from the planar contact 202. For example, spring contact 110 extends horizontally and protrudes
  vertically out and away from a center of the planar contact 202. Each spring contact 106A-106D
  extends vertically and protrudes vertically out and away from a peripheral edge portion of the
  planar contact. In this regard, the housing 202 comprises a plurality of insert spaces 204 for
  receiving vertically extending spring contacts 106A-106D. Each insert space 204 has a generally
  T-Shape. The thinner portion of the insert space has a width 208 that is slightly larger than the
  width 210 of a spring contact 106A-106D. The wider portion of the insert space has a width 206
  that is substantially similar (possibly slightly smaller) or the same as the width of an elastic
  member 104A-104D so that the elastic member 104A-104D is securely retained in the housing
  202 with or without the assistance of an adhesive (e.g., via friction or by being molded in place
  so that a chemical reaction occurs at the contact surfaces of the housing and elastic members).
  [0034]      Each spring contact 110, 106A-106D is flexible so that when the female receptacle
  100 is subjected to shock and/or vibration the electrical connection between itself and the pin
 402 is maintained. For example, the spring contact 110 flexes in two (2) opposing vertical
 directions 212. Similarly, spring contacts 106A and 106C flex in two (2) opposing horizontal
 directions 214, and spring contacts 106B and 106D flex in two (2) opposing horizontal directions
 216. The flexing of the spring contacts facilitates shock and vibration absorption by the female
 receptacle 100, as well as the elimination of the need for precision alignment for engagement
 between the male plug and the female receptacle 100. The elimination of the precision
 alignment requirement is also at least partially facilitated by the provision of an angled surface
 114 in the socket opening 112. The angled surface 114 helps guide the pin 402 into proper
placement within the socket opening 112 as shown in FIG. 4 (even when the center axis 418 of
the pin 402 is not aligned with or is angled relative to a center axis 300 of the socket opening
412).
 [0035]       During shock and vibration, the pin 402 applies a pushing force on each retention
member 1OSA-108D at respective times. As a result of this pushing force, the retention members
slidingly move within the housing 102 in respective directions away from the center axis 300 of
the socket opening 112. This movement causes the retention members 108A-108D to
                                                 7

   respectively apply pushing forces on the spring contacts 106A-106D. In turn, the spring contacts
   108A-108D flex away from a surface 306 of the housing 102.
   [00361      Throughout this process, each elastic member 104A-104D provides a retention force
  on the respective retention member 108A-108D (via spring contact 106A-106D) in a direction
  towards a center axis 300 of the female receptacle 100, i.e., the elastic members force the
  retention members toward the center of the female receptacle 100. The inward force applied by
  the elastic members ensures that the yield strength of the material (e.g., copper or brass) forming
  the spring contacts 106A-106D is not exceeded during times when (A) the pin 402 is being
  inserted into the female receptacle 100 and/or (B) the female receptacle 100 is subjected to shock
  and vibration. If this yield strength is exceeded, then the spring contacts 106A-106D may
  experience permanent deformation such that they do not spring back to their rest positions. In
  effect, the elastic members 104A-104D provide (A) structural support for the spring contact
  106A-106D and (B) an inward force to ensure that the retention member 108A-108D are in
 contact with pin regardless of whether there is shock and vibration.
  100371       The elastic members 104A-104D are formed of an elastomer or other rubber. The
 elastic members 104A-104D have the same durometer. The present solution is not limited in this
 regard. In some scenarios, the elastic members 104A-104D have different durometers.
 Adjustments in durometers allow the retention forces of the elastic members 104A-104D to be
 tuned in accordance with a particular application. For example, each elastic member 104A-104D
 has a different durometer so that it reacts to different frequencies of shock and vibration as
 compared to that to which the other elastic members react. The tuning also facilitates one to
define a breakaway force at which the male plug and female receptacle would disconnect from
each other. This breakaway force feature of the present solution is valuable in scenarios where
equipment damage is undesirable as a result of certain events (e.g., when a pulling force of
greater than about fifty (50) pounds is applied to the coupled male plug/female receptacle).
10038]        In some scenarios, the spring contacts 106A-106D have the same spring rates. In
other scenarios, the spring contacts 106A-106D have different spring rates. The adjustment of
spring rates allows the spring contacts to have the same or different natural frequencies selected
in accordance with a particular application.

   100391      As shown in FIGS. 1-4, the retention members 108A, 108B, 108C, 108D each have a
   generally disc or circular shape. The present solution is not limited in this regard. The retention
  members 108A, 108B, 108C, 108D can have any shape selected in accordance with a particular
   application. For example, the retention members 108A, 108B, 108C, 108D can alternatively
  have rectangular, square, spherical or elliptical shapes.
   [00401      Referring now to FIG. 4, the insertion of the pin 402 into the socket opening 112 is
  described. First, it should be appreciated that the retention members 108A-108D are respectively
  resiliently biased to first positons (shown in FIG. 1) by the contact springs 106A-106D. In the
  first positions, at least a portion each retention member 108A-108D protrudes a certain distance
  into the socket opening 112.
  [00411       As the pin 402 is inserted into the socket opening 112, a chamfered edge 404 of the
  pin 402 slides against the chamfered edges 406 of the retention members 108A-108D. This
  sliding causes the pin 402 to urge the retention members 108A-108D in respective outward
  directions 450 away from the center axis 300 of the female receptacle 100. In turn, the retention
  members 108A-108D apply pushing forces on the spring contacts 106A-106D, whereby the
  spring contacts 106A-106D flex in a direction out and away from the pin 402. Once the pin 402
 is inserted a certain distance into the socket opening 112, the retention members 108A-108D
 automatically move in an opposing direction 452 towards the center axis 300 of the female
 receptacle 100.
 [0042]       Notably, the pin 402 has an end portion with a generally hour glass shape, i.e., the
 diameter of proximal end portion 408 is smaller than the diameter of distal end portion 410. The
 decrease in the pin's diameter facilitates the automatic movement of the retention members
 108A-108D towards the center axis 300 of the female receptacle 100. This movement is also
 facilitated by the inward forces respectively applied by (A) the spring contacts 106A-106D to the
retention members 108A-108D and/or (B) the elastic members 104A-104D to the spring contacts
 106A-106D.
 [00431       As shown in FIG. 4, the retention members 108A-108D also have chamfered edges
412 opposed from chamfered edges 406. Chamfered edges 412 facilitate the removal of pin 402
from socket opening 112. In order for the male plug to be decoupled from the female receptacle

   100, the pulling force needs to be sufficient to overcome the spring force of the spring contacts
   106A-106D. Once the spring force is overcome, the chamfered edge 412 of the retention
  member slides against the chamfered edge 416 of the pin 402. This sliding causes the pin 402 to
  urge the retention members 108A-108D in outward directions 450. When the pin 402 is
  removed from the socket opening 112, the retention members 108A-108D return to their first (or
  rest) positions shown in FIG. 1 as result of the spring force applied thereto by the spring contacts
  106A-106D.
  [0044]       Notably, the male plug can be decoupled from the female receptacle even when in a
  positon that is angled relative to the female receptacle. This is at least partially possible since the
  pin 402 floats in the socket opening 112 and/or since an angled surface 114 is provided at the
  entrance of the socket opening. The angled surface 114 acts as a guide for directing the pin 402
  into proper placement within the socket opening 112.
  [0045]       The present solution is not limited to the chamfered pin and retention member
 configuration shown in FIG. 4. In other scenarios, the pin 402 and retention members 108A
 108D are designed so that the pin 402 is unable to be removed from socket opening 112. For
 example, both components 402, 108A-108D can be designed with mating right angled features.
 In those or other scenarios, the male plug and female receptacle can include housings with
 mating mechanical coupling means for securely coupling themselves to each other. Such a
 mechanical coupling means can include, but is not limited to, snap couplers and/or locking tabs.
 [0046]       It should be noted that the housing 102 has a plurality of apertures 302 formed in a
sidewall 304 thereof. Each aperture 302 is aligned with a portion of a respective insert space
204. In some scenarios, the apertures are shaped so as to ensure that the retention members
108A-108D are retained in the socket opening 112 and/or protrude only a certain distance into
the socket opening 112 when the pin 402 is not inserted therein. For example, each aperture 302
may have an inner dimension (e.g., width and/or height) that is smaller than an outer dimension
(e.g., width and/or height).
100471        The present solution is not limited to the housing and/or elastic member architecture
shown in FIGS. 1-4. For example, a single elastic member can be provided instead of four (4)
separate elastic members 104A-104D. Schematic illustrations are provided in FIGS. 5-9

   showing an exemplary architecture of an electrical connector in accordance with a single elastic
   member implementation. The electrical connector comprises a female receptacle 500 and a male
  plug (not shown in FIGS. 5-9) with a pin 800.
   [00481      The female receptacle 500 is substantially similar to the female receptacle 100 of
  FIG. 1 with the exception of the elastic member 502. As such, the discussion provided above in
  relation to the female receptacle 100 of FIG. 1 is sufficient for understanding the female
  receptacle 500. However, a discussion of the elastic member 502 is now provided.
  [0049]       The elastic member 502 is designed to have a plurality of purposes: (A) provide
  structural support for the spring contacts 506; (B) provide an inward force to ensure that the
  retention members 508 are in contact with the pin 800 regardless of whether the female
  receptacle 500 is being subjected to shock and vibration; and/or (C) provide an environmental
  seal for preventing or reducing the ingress of contaminants (e.g., dirt, dust, sand, water, etc.) into
 the female receptacle 500.
  100501      Notably, the elastic member 502 has a generally U-cross sectional shape with slits
 600 formed in a surface 602 thereof The slits 600 allow the pin 800 to pass therethrough when a
 downward force is applied thereto, while at least reducing the amount of contaminants entering
 the female receptacle 500. A schematic illustration is provided in FIG. 8 which shows the pin
 800 inserted into the female receptacle 500. A cross-sectional view of the pin 800 inserted into
 the female receptacle is provided in FIG. 9. When the pin 800 is fully inserted into the female
receptacle 500, the environmental seal is also provided by the elastic member 502 as shown in
FIG. 9 (i.e., the elastic member 502 circumscribed the pin 800 so as to provide the environmental
seal).
100511        In this scenario, the elastic member 502 has a single durometer. The ability to
provide a plurality of elastic members with different durometers may not be possible here.
However, the spring contacts 506 can have the same or different spring rates. Adjustments of the
spring rates allows the spring contacts to have the same or different natural frequencies selected
in accordance with a particular application. If effect, the spring contacts 506 can be selectively
designed so that they react to the same or different frequencies of shock and vibration, i.e., the
natural frequencies of the spring contacts can be tuned. The tuning facilitates one to define a

  other. This breakaway force feature of the present solution is valuable in scenarios where
  equipment damage is undesirable as a result of certain events (e.g., when a pulling force of
  greater than about fifty (50) pounds is applied to male plug/female receptacle).
  [0052]      The present solution is not limited to the particular architecture of the elastic member
 shown in FIGS. 5-9. Another exemplary architecture for the elastic member is shown in FIG. 16.
 In both cases, the elastic member is designed to provide an environmental seal for preventing or
 reducing the ingress of contaminants into the female receptacle during use thereof.
 100531       Notably, various components shown in FIG. 16 are the same as or substantially
 similar to that shown in FIGS. 1-4. For example, these components include the housing, spring
 contacts, planar contact, and retention members. As such, the discussion provided above in
 relation to FIGS. 1-4 is sufficient for understanding these components of the female receptacle
 1600 shown in FIG. 16.
 100541      Referring now to FIGS. 10-15, there are provided illustrations that are useful for
 understanding an exemplary architecture for an electrical connector 1000 with a plurality of
pin/socket pairs. Each pin/socket pair is substantially similar to the pin/socket pair described
 above in relation to FIGS. 1-5.
 10055]      As shown in FIGS. 10-15, the electrical connector 1000 comprises a male plug 1002
and a female receptacle 1004. The male plug 1002 comprises a housing 1004 and a plurality of
pins 1006. The housing is designed to provide a handle 1008 to facilitate the insertion of the
pins 1006 into mating sockets 1300 of the female receptacle 1004. Seven (7) pins 1006 are
shown in FIGS. 10-11. The present solution is not limited in this regard. Any number of pins
can be employed in accordance with a particular application. The pins 1006 are formed of a
conductive material (e.g., copper or brass). The pins 1006 are arranged relative to each other so
that each pin is aligned with a respective socket 1300 of the female receptacle 1004 when the
electrical components 1002, 1004 are being coupled to each other.

  respective pin 1006.
   [0057]       An insert space 1102 is provided which allows a contact retainer 1014 to be inserted
  and retained in the housing 1010. The retention of the contact retainer 1014 is at least partially
  achieved via engagement of protrusions 1104 formed on a sidewall 1106 of the insert space 1102
  and protrusions 1108 formed on a sidewall 1110 of the contact retainer 1014. An adhesive or
  other coupling means may also be employed for securely coupling the contact retainer 1014 to
  the housing 1010.
  [0058]       The contact retainer 1014 comprises a dielectric support structure 1112 and an elastic
  member 1114. The elastic member 1114 is disposed in and structurally supported by the
  dielectric support structure 1112. The elastic member 1114 has a plurality of apertures 1014
  formed therethrough. Each aperture 1014 is sized and shape to receive a respective socket
 support structure 1016. Each socket support structure 1016 is designed to receive respective
 retention members 1018 and spring contacts 1020, 1022, as well as provide structural support to
 these components and retain these components in a particular relative configuration as shown in
 FIG. 12. In some scenarios, the socket support structures 1016 are formed of a rigid or semi
 rigid material, such as plastic. Each socket support structure 1016 is also designed so that
 surface of the planar contacts 1400 are exposed when the female receptacle 1004 is assembled as
 shown in FIG. 14 so that the planar contacts 1400 can be electrically connected to an external
 circuit (e.g., a circuit disposed on a PWB).
 [0059]       Notably, the overall structure of each socket (i.e., defined by socket support structure
 1016, retention members 1018 and spring contacts 1020, 1022) is similar to that shown in FIGS.

  1700 for providing an electrical interface between a male plug (e.g., male plug 1002 of FIG. 10
  and a female receptacle (e.g., female receptacle 100 of FIG. 1, 500 of FIG. 5, 1004 of FIG. 10, or
  1600 of FIG. 16). Method 1700 begins with 1702 and continues with 1704 where a conductive
  pin (e.g., pin 402 of FIG. 4, 800 of FIG. 8, 1006 of FIG. 10, or 1602 of FIG. 16) of the male plug
  is received in a socket opening (e.g., socket opening 112 of FIG. 1, 900 of FIG. 9, 1012 of FIG.
  10, or 1612 of FIG. 16) of the female receptacle. As the conductive pin is inserted into the
  socket opening, the events described in 1706-1712 occur. These events comprise: sliding a first
  chamfered edge (e.g., chamfered edge 404 of FIG. 4) of the conductive pin against second
  chamfered edges (e.g., chamfered edge 406 of FIG. 4) of a plurality of conductive retention
 members (e.g., retention members 108A-108D of FIG. 1, 508 of FIG. 5, 1018 of FIG. 10, or
  1608 of FIG. 16) disposed in the female receptacle so as to urge each said conductive retention
 member from a first position (e.g., shown in FIG. 1) in a direction away from the socket opening;
 respectively applying pushing forces by the plurality of conductive retention members on a
 plurality of first spring contacts (e.g., spring contacts 106A-106B of FIG. 1, 506 of FIG. 5,1020
 of FIG. 10, or 1606 of FIG. 16) so as to cause the plurality of first spring contacts to flex away
 from the socket opening; applying, by at least one elastic member (e.g., elastic member 104A
 104D of FIG. 1, 502 of FIG. 5, 1114 of FIG. 11, or 1604 of FIG. 16), a retention force on each
 said first spring contact; and respectively applying, by the plurality of first spring contacts, spring

  receptacle. Notably, at least two of the first and second spring loaded floating contact points are
  maintained when the pin moves within the socket opening as a result of an external force applied
  to the male plug or female receptacle (e.g., when experiencing shock and/or vibration), as shown
  by 1716. Also, the elastic member continues to apply the retention force to each first spring
  contact so as to prevent permanent deformation to the same as a result of the first spring contact
  material's yield strength being exceeded when the external force is being applied to the male
  plug and/or female receptacle, as shown by 1718. The elastic member may also provide an
  environmental seal at least reducing an ingress of contaminants into the socket opening.
  Thereafter, method 1700 ends in 1720 or other operations are performed.
  100631      In some scenarios, the plurality of first spring loaded floating contact points is
 provided by the first conductive spring contacts respectively applying spring forces on the
 conductive retention members slidingly disposed in a support structure (e.g., housing 102 of FIG.

 The first conductive spring contacts are spaced apart along a periphery of a support structure of
 the female receptacle (e.g., as shown in FIG. 1). The second spring loaded floating contact point
 is provided by the second spring contact that is in direct contact with the conductive pin's tip.
 The first and second elongate spring contacts are electrically connected to each other via a planar
 contact (e.g., planar contact 202 of FIG. 2) provided for connecting the female receptacle's
 electrical contact to an external circuit.
