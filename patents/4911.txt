ABSTRACT
Enhancing Process Yield ofa ContinuousStir Tank Reactor for reactions with Low-Single-Pass
conversion in a fixed volume system with the Integrated Circuit Networked Reactor Design
Approach
Using a novel Integrated Circuit Networked Reactor (ICNR) design approach, the process yield of a
polyvalent granular solid particles conversion reaction was improved multi-fold to minimise cost (both
CapEx and OpEx), volume and space when compared to the traditional use of recycling streams in an
industrial application. This novel arrangement integrated the use of a decoupled three stage solid
liquid contact reaction steps involving Plug Flow and Column Tray reactors embedded in a CSTR

                                                   Approach
   Using a novel Integrated Circuit Networked Reactor (ICNR) design approach, the process yield of a
   polyvalent granular solid particles conversion reaction was improved multi-fold to minimise cost (both
   CapEx and OpEx), volume and space when compared to the traditional use of recycling streams in an
   industrial application. This novel arrangement integrated the use of a decoupled three stage solid
   liquid contact reaction steps involving Plug Flow and Column Tray reactors embedded in a CSTR
   freeboard volume.
   Introduction
   The laboratory test of a waste stream recycling concluded at 3.8% conversion per pass with product
   assay as presented in Table 1, but commercial viability required a minimum of 80% conversion.

   The Reaction
   The core process unit operation is a heterogeneous liquid-solid surface contact irreversible isobaric,
   endothermic, slow reaction at 60*C with exiting kinetic rate of 5.02kg/hr.m3 . The solvent reagent
   acting as limiting reagent.
   Reactor Design Considerations
   Optimising real estate foot print, cost, and delivery for the conversion of a granular waste stream with
   a view to achieving constrained business objectives of reduced speed to market time requirement and
   early payback. Technically, the objectives were to:
        *   Enhance conversion from 3.8% per pass to ~90% for the process to be commercially feasible
        "   Continuous or batch processing
        e   Limit process volume to reduce CapEX and OpEX
        e   Reduce process plant complexity to limit OpEX
   Reactor Design
   MKPro Engineering Pty Ltd implemented an Integrated Circuit Networked Reactor Design-ICNR to
   achieve the above objectives. In this instance, a continuous process was preferred to reduce overall
   cost of hire and labour, but approach is equally applicable to batch and semi-continuous processes.
                                                                                                 Page 1 of 3

  Whereas traditional reactor design requires a single 180m 3 Continuous Stir Tank Reactor (CSTR)' or
  fourteen 36m 3 CSTR in series to achieve 90% conversion" as presented in Table 2, the novel ICRN
  design requires a front-end PFR and two 36m 3 CSTR in series to achieve 90% conversion as presented
  in Table 3.

  Implementing a single 18Om 3 CSTR reactor (~O6m, H10m) will require an investment in a big agitator
  for mixing and particle suspension duties, with a large'"''v agitation power (~60kW). This is
  comparatively expensive in terms of Capital investment and running cost of power. This will also
  require a high-level tank and hence a taller building facility which engenders additional safety
  considerations along with the additional cost of pumping, piping, cabling, support frames, civil works,
  process control, etc. Fundamentally, establishing such a plant will be quite expensive.

While fourteen 36m 3 CSTR (~03.2m, H4.5m, ~1.3kW agitator"' power) in series is more reasonable
than a single 180m 3 CSTR, the cumulative cost and real estate requirement is constraining. Further,
the cumulative capital investment and operating cost requirements are high.
In contrast, the ICNR design resulted in 80,373m long 050mm Plug Flow Reactor (PFR) wound as a
helix on the freeboard height for each of two 36m 3 CSTR (~03.2m, H4.5m, ~1.3kW agitator power) in
series to achieve 90% conversion. This design conserves real estate, reduces capital requirement and
limits operating cost.
Helical PFR can be mounted on the inside or outside of the tank freeboard or the entire height of the
tank depending on the risk of process fluid contamination or fouling"'. This approach is also application
where heat integration""' is an objective.
