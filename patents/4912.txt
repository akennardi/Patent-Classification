SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR CONTROLLING ACCESS TO CONTENT DISTRIBUTED
                                        OVER A NETWORK
                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001] The technology generally relates to systems and methods for distributing content over a
network.
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002] Traditionally, sensitive documents have been printed on special paper that contains a
physical watermark or electronically, e.g., as Portable Document Files (PDF), with an embedded
digital watermark and accompanied by one or more access policies. Access policies control how
a user can use the file. As an example, an access policy can allow the recipient to open the
attached file only once before the policy is revoked, thus preventing the recipient from opening
the file multiple times.
[0003] The paper distribution process is often costly and time-consuming. For example, to
prepare for the distribution of four or five movie scripts to twenty readers to review over a
weekend, a movie studio needs to replicate each script twenty times, bind each script, and hand
deliver the scripts to each reader by the close of business on Friday before the weekend. On the
following Monday, to ensure the scripts are not leaked to unauthorized third parties, the studio
needs to collect and account for each of the scripts distributed.
[0004] Even though emailing scripts as PDF documents improves the distribution process, there
are limitations with this form of distribution. Often the policies are managed by a policy server,
and the policies embedded in the PDF documents require constant Internet connectivity to check
with the policy server to ensure that the user is complying with the policy. Hence, this process is
unreliable if a recipient does not have constant Internet access.
                                                   1

    WO 2013/055766                                                           PCT/US2012/059509
                                 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0005] Systems and methods are needed for securely distributing documents to one or more user
devices and providing flexible user access to the distributed documents while enforcing specific
access rules. With the rise of electronic tablet devices, solutions are also needed to allow a
recipient to access distributed documents on a portable electronic device that is smaller and
lighter than a typical laptop, such as on an iPad. It would be also beneficial if feedback could be
received from a recipient about the documents in a timely manner without allowing the user to
alter the documents. In addition, it would be beneficial to allow an administrator to manage
document distribution processes in a secure environment from any location at any time as well as
receive documents from any location at any time.
[0006] According to the present invention, devices for receiving distributed documents need to
satisfy several requirements including, but not limited to, being portable (i.e., small and light),
have a large viewing screen, support wireless and manual document distribution processes,
provide a software development kit (SDK) for customized application development and provide
secure access to distributed documents.
[0007] Several distribution platforms, such as Netbooks, e-readers (e.g., Amazon Kindle) and
computer tablets, can be configured to receive distributed documents. E-Readers and computer
tablets are generally lighter, smaller and easier to handle than laptops or Netbooks, and their
reading screens are larger than personal digital assistants (PDAs) or Smartphones. Between the
e-readers and computer tablets, however, only the e-readers currently support both wireless and
manual document distribution processes. Presently, none of these devices offer a SDK for
custom application development. In addition, the e-readers present security risks. For example,
the e-readers typically do not offer password protection for distributed documents, prevent
documents from being downloaded to personal computers or prevent documents from being
redistributed via electronic mailing or printed copies.
                                                   2

    WO 2013/055766                                                              PCT/US2012/059509
[0008] In contrast, the Apple iPad meets the basic requirements of a user device for receiving
distributed documents. The iPads are portable and include a reading canvas that is larger than a
PDA or Smartphone. The iPads also provide a SDK for custom application development. In
certain embodiments of the present invention, a client application can be implemented on an iPad
or a like device to provide a user secure access to distributed documents. The client application
remedies shortcomings of existing document review applications, such as GoodReader or
iAnnotate, which lack features for managing secure delivery of documents to and from user
devices or capable of controlling use and share of documents after they are distributed.
[0009] In one aspect, the invention features a computer-implemented method for controlling use
of a file on a user device. The method includes transmitting, by the user device, authentication
information to a system. The authentication information includes an identifier of the user device
and at least one form of identification of a user associated with the user device. The method also
includes downloading, by the user device, the file from the system upon successful
authentication by the system and limiting, by the user device, access of the file to a client
application of the user device. The method further includes preventing, by the user device,
altering of the file, printing of the file and opening of the file outside of the client application. In
addition, the method includes storing, by the user device, notes corresponding to the file in a
local storage area separate from the file, transmitting, by the user device, at least a portion of the
notes to the system; and removing, by the user device, the file from the user device as instructed
by the system.
[0010] In another aspect, the invention features a computer program product, tangibly embodied
in a non-transitory computer readable medium, for controlling use of a file on a user device. The
computer program product includes instructions being operable to cause data processing
apparatus to transmit authentication information to a system. The authentication information
includes an identifier of the user device and at least one form of identification of a user
                                                    3

    WO 2013/055766                                                           PCT/US2012/059509
associated with the user device. In addition, the computer program product includes instructions
being operable to cause data processing apparatus to download the file from the system upon
successful authentication by the system, limit access of the file to a client application of the user
device, and prevent altering of the file, printing of the file and opening of the file outside of the
client application. Furthermore, the computer program product includes instructions being
operable to cause data processing apparatus to store notes corresponding to the file in a local
storage area separate from the file.
[0011] In yet another aspect, the invention features a user device for controlling use of a file
disposed on the user device. The user device includes a client application that has an
authentication module for transmitting authentication information to a system. The
authentication information includes an identifier of the user device and at least one form of
identification of a user associated with the user device. The authentication module is adapted to
download the file from the system upon successful authentication by the system. The client
application also includes a reader module for limiting access of the file to the client application.
The reader module prevents altering of the file, printing of the file and opening of the file outside
of the client application. The client application additionally includes a notes module for storing
notes corresponding to the file in a local storage area. The client application further includes a
sharing module for permitting the user to designate the file for sharing with a second user. The
user and the second user are in a group defined by the system and the file has not been
previously assigned.
[0012] In other examples, any of the aspects above can include one or more of the following
features. In some embodiments, the system is adapted to instruct the user device to remove the
file after detecting expiration of a time period associated with the file. In some embodiments, the
system is adapted to instruct the user device to remove the file when access privilege of the user
in relation to the file is revoked by an administrator of the system.
                                                   4

    WO 2013/055766                                                             PCT/US2012/059509
[0013] In some embodiments, the user device transmits at least a portion of the notes to the
system after the system detects expiration of a time period associated with the file. In some
embodiments, the user device transmits at least a portion of the notes to the system as instructed
by the user.
[0014] In some embodiments, the user device can store the file in a first folder of the local
storage area if the file is assigned to the user device by an administrator of the system.
Alternatively, the user device can store the file in a second folder of the local storage area if the
file is shared with the user by a second user. The user and the second user can belong to the
same group defined by the system.
[0015] In some embodiments, the user device permits the user to designate the file for sharing
with a second user. The user and the second user can belong to the same group defined by the
system and the file has not been previously assigned. In addition, the user device is adapted to
transmit at least one of an identification of the second user or an identification of the predefined
group to the system such that the system is enabled to send the file to the second user.
[0016] In some embodiments, when the user device is disconnected from the system, the user
device authenticates at least one form of identification of the user and, upon successful
authentication, permits the user to access a locally-stored copy of the file.
[0017] In some embodiments, the user device is an iPad. In some embodiments, the file is in a
portable document format (PDF).
[0018] In another aspect, the invention features a system for controlling use of a file on a user
device. The system includes a services module, in communication with the user device, for
performing: i) authenticating the user device and one or more user credentials of a user
associated with the user device, ii) sending a file to the user device, iii) receiving at least a
portion of notes from the user device corresponding to the file, and iv) removing the file from the

user device upon expiration of a time period associated with the file or when access privilege of
the user in relation to the file is revoked by an administrator. The system also includes an
application module for managing the file and an account of the user.
[0019] In some embodiments, the application module manages the account of the user by
performing at least one of: activating the account, setting an identification of the account,
generating a watermark associated with the account, locking the account, or deactivating the
account.
[0020] In some embodiments, the application module manages the file by performing at least
one of: uploading the file to a database in communication with the system, assigning the file to
the user, assigning the file to a group of users, revoking access privilege of the user in relation to
the file, revoking access privilege of a group of users in relation to the file, or setting the time
period associated with the file.
[0021] In some embodiments, the application module can aggregate notes from multiple users
corresponding to the file and generate a report for the file that includes the aggregated notes.
The report is generated without altering the file.
[0022] In some embodiments, the application module is further configured to manage a group of
users by performing at least one of: creating the group, assigning the user to the group, removing
the user from the group, or deleting the group. The application module can prevent the user from
sharing the file with a second user if the second user is not in the same group as the user or the
file has been previously assigned.
[0023] In some embodiments, the application module is further configured to manage roles of
users by performing at least one of: creating a role, defining the role, assigning the role to a user,
removing the role from the user, or deleting the role. The application module can prevent the
                                                    6

                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0039] FIG. 1 shows an exemplary network environment according to some embodiments of the
technology. The network environment includes an administration system 102 and one or more
user devices 104. The administration system 102 can securely assign, manage and monitor
delivery of documents to any of the user devices 104 and provider user account and document
management functions. A client application installed on each of the user devices 104, such as
client application 200 illustrated in FIG. 2, allows a user associated with the user device 104 to
download assigned documents from the administration system 102, open the documents in read
only mode, add notes associated with the documents that can be edited, emailed, printed or
submitted to the administration system 102, and share the documents under controlled
conditions. In certain embodiments, the administration system 102 can communicate with the
user devices 104 over an IP network 100 such as a LAN, WAN, cellular network, or the Internet.
However, communication over the IP network 100 is not required in all embodiments. For
example, in some embodiments, communications occur over network protocols other than
                                                   8

    WO 2013/055766                                                         PCT/US2012/059509
Internet Protocol (IP). In some embodiments, communications occur over infrared transmission
systems, Blue Tooth or Personal Area Networks (PANs).
[0040] The administration system 102 includes a services module 106 and an application module
108 for securely managing and monitoring delivery of documents to any one of the user devices
104 registered with the administration system 102. In some embodiments, either the services
module 106 or the application module 108 (or both) communicates with a database 120
configured to store the documents. For the purposes of illustration, the database 120 is shown to
reside outside of the administration system 102. In other embodiments, however, the database
120 can be a part of the administration system 102. As an example, a business enterprise, such
as a movie studio, can control and operate the administration system 102 to distribute movie
scripts to select readers associated with one or more of the user devices 104. In some
embodiments, the administration system 102 and the database 120 are behind a firewall (not
shown) for protecting data transmissions within the business enterprise. In some cases, the user
devices 104 may also be behind the firewall. Alternatively, in embodiments where the devices
are connecting to the administration system 102 via the Internet, the user devices 104 utilize data
tunneling software or a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to connect through the firewall to access
to the administration system 102.
[0041] Each of the user devices 104 can be a computing device operated by a user. A computing
device refers to any device with a processor and memory that can execute instructions.
Computing devices include, but are not limited to, personal computers, server computers,
portable computers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), e-Readers such as the
Amazon Kindle, cellular telephones, e-mail clients, tablets and other mobile devices. In some
embodiments, a user device 104 is smaller and lighter in weight than a laptop and has a screen
that is larger than a PDA or a smart phone, such as an iPad. In some embodiments, a user device
104 offers wireless connection to the administration system 102, and the device's manufacturer
                                                  9

    WO 2013/055766                                                           PCT/US2012/059509
provides a SDK for customized application development. For example, each of the user devices
104 can include a client application, such as the client application 200 illustrated in FIG. 2, for
allowing a user to download documents from the administration system 102 and controlling user
access to the downloaded documents in compliance with specific access rules.
[0042] In some embodiments, the documents distributed by the administration system 102 are
PDF documents. The documents can also be in other electronic formats, such as Microsoft
Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Project, Visio, .mobi, ePub, Text, jpeg, png, bmp or the like. Each
document can embed a personal watermark associated with the user to whom the document is
distributed. As an example, the watermark is generated using PdfReader and PdfStamper classes
of iText, which is an open source PDF library in Java and C#.
[0043] In various embodiments, the client application 200 or the administration system 102 can
be implemented as a computer program product, i.e., a computer program tangibly embodied in a
non-transient machine-readable storage device, for execution by, or to control the operation of, a
data processing apparatus. The computer program can be written in any form of computer or
programming language, including source code, compiled code, interpreted code, scripting code
(e.g., Javascript) and/or machine code, and the computer program can be deployed in any form,
including as a stand-alone program or as a subroutine, element, or other unit suitable for use in a
computing environment.
[0044] In various embodiments, the user devices 104 and the computing device on which the
administration system 102 is implemented include processors suitable for the execution of a
computer program. The processors include, by way of example, both general and special
purpose microprocessors, which may be sold by companies such as Intel, AMD or Qualcomm.
The processors can receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access
memory or both. Memory devices, such as a cache, can be used to temporarily store data.
Memory devices can also be used for long-term data storage.

[0045] In various embodiments, the user devices 104 and the computing device on which the
administration system 102 is implemented can receive data from or transfer data to one or more
storage mediums. In general, computer-readable storage mediums, such as the database 120,
include all forms of volatile and non-volatile memory, including by way of example
semiconductor memory devices, e.g., DRAM, SRAM, EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory
devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and
optical disks, e.g., CD, DVD, HD-DVD, and Blu-ray disks. In addition, the devices can be
operatively coupled to a communications network, such as network 100, to receive instructions
and/or data from the network and/or to transfer instructions and/or data to the network.
[0046] In various embodiments, the user devices 104 or the computing device on which the
administration system 102 is implemented communicate with a display device, e.g., a CRT
(cathode ray tube), plasma, LED (light emitting diode), or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor,
for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse, a
trackball, a touchpad, or a motion sensor, by which the user can provide input to the computer
(e.g., interact with a user interface element). Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for
interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of
sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from
the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, and/or tactile input.
[0047] In various embodiments, the network 100 is a transmission medium that facilitates any
form or medium of digital or analog communication (e.g., a communication network).
Transmission medium can include one or more packet-based networks and/or one or more
circuit-based networks in any configuration. Packet-based networks can include, for example,
the Internet, a carrier internet protocol (IP) network (e.g., local area network (LAN), wide area
network (WAN), campus area network (CAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), home area
network (HAN)), a private IP network, an IP private branch exchange (IPBX), a wireless

network (e.g., radio access network (RAN), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, general packet radio
service (GPRS) network, HiperLAN), optical fiber, satellite and/or other packet-based networks.
Circuit-based networks can include, for example, the public switched telephone network (PSTN),
a legacy private branch exchange (PBX), a wireless network (e.g., RAN, code-division multiple
access (CDMA) network, time division multiple access (TDMA) network, global system for
mobile communications (GSM) network), infrared transmissions, Blue Tooth or Personal Area
Networks (PANs), Near Frequency Communication (NFC) network, and/or other circuit-based
networks.
[0048] Information transfer over the network 100 can be based on one or more communication
protocols. Communication protocols can include, for example, Ethernet protocol, Internet
Protocol (IP), Voice over IP (VOIP), a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) protocol, Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), H.323, Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP),
Signaling System #7 (SS7), a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) protocol, a
Push-to-Talk (PTT) protocol, a PTT over Cellular (POC) protocol, a Real-time Messaging
protocol (RTMP), a Real-time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP) and/or other communication
protocols.
                                    The Administration System
[0049] The administration system 102 includes two modules, the services module 106 and the
application module 108. In some embodiments, the services module 106 performs the following
exemplary functions: i) authenticating a user device 104 and user credentials associated with the
user device 104, ii) assigning and transmitting a document to an authenticated user device 104,
iii) retrieving notes associated with a document from a user device 104, and iv) sending an
instruction to a user device 104 to remove a document. In some embodiments, the application
module 108 performs the following exemplary functions: i) user account management, ii) user
group management, iii) document management, iv) organize notes submitted by user device 104
                                                 12

    WO 2013/055766                                                         PCT/US2012/059509
for one or more documents, and v) monitoring user activities on one or more user device 104,
such as keeping a log of which documents have been opened and which pages have been
reviewed.
[0050] In one exemplary embodiment, the services module 106 of the administration system 102
is designed to communicate with the client application 200 installed on a user device 104. Prior
to distributing a document to a user device 104, the services module 106 authenticates a user of
the user device 104 by comparing authentication information provided by the user via the user
device 104 with reference information about the user stored in the database 120. In an
exemplary embodiment, the authentication information includes the identifier of the user device
104 and at least two forms of user identification. The device identifier can be, for example, the
physical device ID of the user device 104. The user identifications can include a user name and
a corresponding pin, such as a personal identification number, assigned to the user by the
administration system 102. In some embodiments, the administration system 102 authenticates a
user based on the device identifier and one or more user identifications issued by the
administration system 102.
[0051] In one exemplary embodiment, the services module 106 can transmit one or more
documents to the client application of the user device 104 upon successful authentication. Prior
to transmission of a document, the document can be assigned to the user by an administrator or
shared with the user by another user. After transmission of the document, the user is able to
annotate the document using the client application 200 to create notes about the document. The
services module 106 can receive the notes from the user device 104 and store the notes in the
database 120. In some embodiments, the notes are stored with a reference to the document and
the user who created the notes (document-user-centric notes). The services module 106 can also
instruct the user device 104 to remove a document from the user device 104 based on one or
more removal criteria provided by the administration system 102, such as removing the
                                                 13

    WO 2013/055766                                                            PCT/US2012/059509
document following the expiration of a time period associated with the document. For example,
the services module can instruct the user device 104 to delete the document two (2) days after it
is downloaded to the user device 104. In some embodiments, the services module 106 can
instruct the user device 104 to remove a document at the direction of a system administrator,
who may also revoke a user's access privilege in relation to the document for any reason.
Furthermore, the services module 106 can enforce one or more security rules of the
administration system 102, such as internal company rules for compliance with the Sarbanes
Oxley Act (SOX) that require a password for accessing the administration system 102 to be
changed on a periodic basis.
[0052] In one exemplary embodiment, the application module 108 of the administration system
102 can be a web application (in some cases, secured using the https protocol) that enables an
administrator to access the application module 108 from any personal computer with Internet
access. The application module 108 manages the account of one or more registered users of the
administration system 102. Some of the management activities include, for example, activating
new users, resetting user identifications, automatically generating personal watermarks, locking a
user account and deactivating a user account. In some embodiments, the application module 108
registers at least one user device 104 associated with a user. When distributing documents to the
user, the application module 108 only transmits the documents to the registered user device 104.
In some embodiments, the application module 108 manages user roles by, for example, creating
role(s), defining role(s), assigning role(s) to a user, removing role(s) from a user, or deleting
role(s). The application module 108 can prevent a user from sharing a document with another
user if, for example, the first user's role is not defined as a sharing role. Furthermore, the
application module 108 can also manage one or more user groups. Some group management
functions include, for example, creating group designations, assigning user(s) to a group,
                                                    14

    WO 2013/055766                                                         PCT/US2012/059509
removing user(s) from a group, deleting a group designation altogether, assigning document(s) to
a group or removing document(s) from a group.
[0053] In some embodiments, the application module 108 manages documents for distribution
purposes. Specifically, the application module 108 can facilitate the uploading of a document by
an administrator and store the document in the database 120. The application module 108 can
assign a document to be distributed to one or more designated users via their respective user
devices 104 registered with the administration system 102. Designated users can be individual
users or a group of users. The application module 108 can also set one or more criteria for
removing a document from a user device 104 prior to distributing the document to the user
device 104, such as set an expiration date for the document, thereby allowing the document to
reside on the user device 104 only for the duration of the time period. In addition, the
application module 108 can remove a document that is already assigned to a user or a group of
users, but has not been distributed to the corresponding user device(s) 104. Furthermore, the
application module 108 can generate a report associated with a document by aggregating notes
about the document collected via the associated user devices 104.
[0054] In addition to managing document distribution within a single department or a group
within an organization, the administration system 102 can manage concurrent document
distribution processes for multiple departments. A department in the administration system 102
typically includes multiple users and multiple user groups. Some of the users can be
administrators of the department. The administrators can be further organized into one or more
user groups associated with the department. The departments are controlled by a super
administrator who can add, edit or remove the departments in the administration system 102.
The super administrator can also add, edit or remove department user groups. The super
administrator can further remove department users or edit department users, such as assign
department users to department user groups. In some embodiments, once the super administrator
                                                  15

    WO 2013/055766                                                         PCT/US2012/059509
has created a new department in the administration system 102, added new users to the
department, assigned administrator role to at least one of the users and set up one or more user
groups for the department, the department can be intelligently run by the administration system
102 without much intervention from the super administrator.
                                        Client Application
[0055] FIG. 2 shows an exemplary architecture of a client application 200 installed on a user
device 104 of FIG. 1. In some embodiments, the client application 200 can work in both online
and offline modes. When in the online mode, the client application 200 can authenticate a user
with the administration system 102 by transmitting to the administration system 102 the physical
device identifier of the user device 104 and the user identification(s). Upon successful
authentication, the administration system 102 can interact with the client application 200 to
perform functions such as removal of a document from the client application 200, retrieval of
notes associated with a document from the client application 200, and transmission of newly
assigned or newly-shared documents to the client application 200. When operating in the offline
mode, the client application 200 can authenticate a user locally based on the user
identification(s). Upon successful authentication, the client application 200 operates
independently from the administration system 102 by making available to the user only
previously downloaded documents.
[0056] In some embodiments, the client application 200 can allow a user to read the downloaded
documents without permitting the user to embed notes in the documents. The client application
200 can also prohibit document printing and emailing or opening of the documents using other
applications on the user device 104. The client application 200 can allow a user to add notes to
the documents, which are stored separately from the documents. The notes can be transmitted to
the administration system 102 after the associated documents expire or when the user chooses to
submit them prior to the expiration of the associated documents.
                                                 16

    WO 2013/055766                                                          PCT/US2012/059509
[0057] In some embodiments, the client application 200 allows a user to share his documents
with one or more other users, subject to certain restrictions, such as the document can only be
shared once. In some cases, the shared documents do not include any notes. The recipient has
the ability to add his own notes and submit the notes to the administration system 102.
[0058] As shown in FIG. 2, the client application 200 includes an authentication module 204, a
reader module 206, a notes module 208, and a sharing module 212. The client application 200
communicates with a local storage area 210 of the user device 104, which can be a part of the
client application 200 or located outside of the client application 200.
[0059] The authentication module 204 of the client application 200 is configured to authenticate
a user when the user requests access to a document. In an offline mode, the authentication
module 204 performs authentication of a user without communication with the administration
system 102. In an exemplary embodiment, the authentication module 204 authenticates the user
locally based on at least two user-supplied identifications, such as the user name and user pin
issued by the administration system 102. After successful authentication, the user is permitted to
access all documents previously downloaded from the administration system 102 and stored in
the local storage area 210. Therefore, in the offline mode, the client application 200 operates
independent of the administration system 102.
[0060] The authentication module 204 can also operate in an online mode, during which the
authentication module 204 transmits authentication information of a user to the administration
system 102 over the network 100 using, for example, a Wi-Fi or cellular network data
connection, e.g., Edge, 3G, 4G, and the like. The authentication information supplied by the
authentication module 204 can include the physical device identifier of the user device 104
and/or the user name and pin issued by the administration system 102. In some embodiments,
the administration system 102 needs to match all three pieces of information - the physical
device identifier, user name and user pin - before instructing the client application 200 to give
                                                  17

    WO 2013/055766                                                          PCT/US2012/059509
the user document access privilege. Therefore, in both the online and offline modes of
communication, user access to a distributed document is limited to the user device 104 registered
to the user.
[0061] Furthermore, in the online mode of operation, the administration system 102 can perform
additional tasks on the user device 104 after a user is successfully authenticated. In some
embodiments, the administration system 102 interacts with the database 120 to determine
whether one or more removal criteria are satisfied, such as whether there are any expired
documents stored in the local storage area 210. In some cases, a system administrator may
revoke a user's right to access a document for any reason. If an expired or revoked document is
detected, the administration system 102 instructs the client application 200 to submit any notes
stored in the local storage area 210 corresponding to the document. In addition, the
administration system 102 can send an instruction to the client application 200 to delete the
expired or revoked document. In some embodiments, the administration system 102 interacts
with the database 120 to determine whether there are any documents that are newly assigned to
or shared with the user device 104 and have not been distributed to the user device 104. If a
newly-assigned or newly-shared document is detected, the administration system 102 transmits
the document to the client application 200 over a secured or non-secured connection. Hence, in
the online mode of operation, a user is able to access both previously-downloaded documents
and newly-assigned or newly-shared documents.
[0062] The client application 204, upon receiving a document from the administration system
102, can save the document in a folder of the local storage area 210. The local storage area 210
can be a secure Binary Large Object (blob) field in a local database, such as SQLite with the
database designed to prevent an intruder from exporting documents stored in the database. In
one example of preventing an intruder from exporting documents from the database, the database
may render the documents unreadable to an unauthorized user.
                                                 18

    WO 2013/055766                                                          PCT/US2012/059509
[0063] In some embodiments, if the document is assigned to the user device 104 of an intended
recipient by the administration system 102 and the document is not shared with the intended
recipient by another user of the administration system 102, the client application 200 stores the
document (herein referred to as an "assigned document") in an assigned folder 214 of the local
storage area 210. In some embodiments, if the document is shared with the user device 104 of
the intended recipient by another user of the administration system 102 and the document has not
been previously assigned to or shared with the intended recipient, the client application 200
stores the document (herein referred to as a "shared document") in the shared folder 216 of the
local storage area. The user who chooses to share the document can be a registered user of the
administration system 102 who has sharing privileges, such as a super user or an administrator,
and who is in the same group as the intended recipient. In some embodiments, if the document is
shared with the user device 104 of the intended recipient by another user of the administration
system 102 and the document was previously assigned to the intended recipient prior to the
sharing, the client application 200 does nothing since the document is already stored in the
assigned folder 214 of the local storage area 210. In some embodiments, a document is stored in
a My Documents folder 218 of the local storage area 210. The My Document folder 218 can
include documents that are added by the user via a mail program or another application on the
user device 104. Hence, the client application 200 can be used to read other sources of
documents, in addition to the documents transmitted by the administration system 102.
[0064] The client application 200 also includes a sharing module 212 for determining whether a
user can share an assigned document with another user of the administration system 102. In
general, a user's ability to share documents can be based on the role or group affiliation of the
user. If the user has an administrator or super user role, the user can share any one of the
documents in the assigned folder 214 of the local storage area 210. In contrast, the sharing
module 212 prevents the user from sharing documents stored in the shared folder 216 of the local
                                                 19

    WO 2013/055766                                                         PCT/US2012/059509
storage area 210, which includes documents that have been previously shared with another user
of the administration system 102. This policy ensures that a document, after being shared once,
cannot be re-shared by the recipient. In some embodiments, a user shares a document in the
assigned folder 214 by selecting another user or a group of users for receiving the document.
The sharing module 212 can then transmit the information about the selected recipient(s) to the
administration system 102. Such information can include the user name and/or group name of
the recipient(s) and the name of the document to be shared. The administration system 102,
upon receiving the information, assigns the identified document to the intended recipient(s), who
can then download the document into the shared folder 216 of their respective user device(s)
104.
[0065] In some embodiments, a shared document retains the expiration date of the original
parent document. In some embodiments, a shared document does not include any notes upon
receipt by the recipient. In some embodiments, the recipient has the ability to create notes for
the shared document and submit them to the administration system 102.
[0066] The reader module 206 of the application enforces specific rules for reviewing a
document from the client application 200. For example, the reader module 206 can permit a user
to read a document without providing in-text editing privileges. The reader module 206 can also
prohibit the user from printing the document, emailing the document or opening the document
using another application installed on the user device 104.
[0067] Even though the reader module 206 can prevent a user from embedding notes in a
document itself, the user is permitted to make notes for the documents, which are saved by the
notes module 208 in a separate file in the local storage area 210. In operation, the notes module
208 allows a user to add and/or edit as many notes per page for as many pages of a document as
the user desires. The user can also add and/or edit a general note for the entire document. In
addition, the notes module 208 can allow both note types, i.e., the page notes and the general
                                                 20

    WO 2013/055766                                                        PCT/US2012/059509
note, to be printed and emailed using the standard print and mail functionalities provided by the
user device 104. In addition, the notes module 208 can transmit the notes to the administration
system 102 when the document is expired, when the administration system 102 revokes access
privilege to the document, or when the user chooses to submit the notes prior to the expiration or
revocation.
[0068] Moreover, the administration system 102 can keep track of and aggregate the notes
received for each document. In some embodiments, the administration system 102 generates a
single report including general and page notes. For example, the administration system 102 can
aggregate the general and page notes by the name of the user who created the notes, by the name
of the document, and/or by page number(s) in a document. In some embodiments, similar
general or page notes made by different users for a document can be aggregated with the user
names attached to respective general or page notes.
[0069] The present invention is advantageous because it provides a mixed-collaborative
approach for document review, allowing one user to work together with or independently from
other user(s). As an example of an independent approach to document review, notes added
through each client application 200 of a user device 104 belong to the individual user. The notes
are not embedded in the original document distributed to the user device 104, but are separately
stored. As an example of a collaborative approach, the notes can be emailed or shared by one
user device 104 with another. The notes can also be centrally aggregated by the administration
system 102 after they are submitted to the administration system 104 by individual client
applications 200. The administration system 104 can generate a report including the aggregated
information. As an example, the report can be made available for a later group discussion
outside of the document distribution platform.

    WO 2013/055766                                                          PCT/US2012/059509
                                    Representative Examples
[0070] FIG. 3 shows an exemplary flow diagram illustrating a method for operating the client
application of FIG. 2. The process starts with the client application 200 of a user device 104
transmitting authentication information to the administration system 102 over the network 100
(step 301). The authentication information can include the physical device identifier of the user
device 104 and identification of the user, such as the user's user name and user pin issued by the
administration system 102. The administration system 102 can authenticate the user and the
associated user device 104 by comparing the authentication information with reference
information stored in the database 120. If the user is not successfully authenticated by the
administration system 102 (step 302), the user is prevented from accessing the client application
200 (step 303). Otherwise, after successful user authentication, the administration system 102
determines if the document satisfies a removal criterion, such as if the document is expired or the
user's access privilege to the document has been revoked. If this is the case, the administration
system 102 can instruct the client application 200 to transmit locally-stored notes associated with
the document to the administration system 102, followed by removing the document from the
user device 104 (step 304). After successful authentication, the client application 200 is also
allowed to download a newly-assigned or newly-shared document to the user device 104 if the
document is made available by the administration system 102 (step 306).
[0071] Alternatively, the client application 200 can operate in an offline mode independent of
the administration system 102. In the offline mode, the user is allowed to access only previously
assigned or shared documents already downloaded to the user device 104 after the client
application 200 authenticates the user based on the user name and user pin.
[0072] During document review, the client application 200 can prevent the user from opening
the document in a different application of the user device 104 (step 308). The client application
200 can also prevent the user from altering the document, printing the document or emailing the

document (step 310). The user is permitted, however, to create notes for the document that are
stored separately from the document in the local storage area 210 (step 312). In some
embodiments, the user can instruct the client application 200 to transmit at least a portion of the
notes to the administration system 102 prior to the expiration of the document or prior to access
privilege of the document being revoked.
[0073] FIGS. 4-8 show various exemplary user interfaces of the administration system 102 of
FIG. 2. FIG. 4 shows an exemplary administrator interface that keeps track of a list of users to
whom documents have been transmitted. Specifically, the users can be identified by their user
names 402 and email addresses 404. In addition, the number of days remaining before each
document expires 406 is also displayed. The administration system 102 can set the "account
locked" flag 408 of a user account after certain number of unsuccessful attempts by a user to
access the account from the corresponding user device 104. Once the "account locked" flag 408
is set, the user is prevented from accessing the client application 200 of the user device 104, even
if the user supplies the correct physical device identifier and/or user name and user pin. To reset
the "account locked" flag 408, the administration system 102 needs to reset the user pin. In
addition, the administrator interface includes a status flag 410 for each user account. The status
flag 410, when it is active, indicates that the corresponding user has the privilege to access the
client application 200 on his designated user device 104, receive newly-assigned or newly-shared
documents from the administration system 102, and submit notes to the administration system
102. The status flag, 410, when it is inactive, indicates that the user has no privilege to access
the documents stored in the local storage area 214 and/or local storage area 216 on the user
device 104.

[0075] FIG. 6A shows a "user-wise" assignment interface of the administration system 102,
which allows an administrator to assign multiple documents to a single user. The administrator
first chooses a user from the drop-down menu 602, after which the administrator selects one or
more documents from the drop-down menu 604 for transmission to the user. The drop-down
menu 604 can include documents previously not assigned to or shared with the user chosen from
the drop-down menu 602. Hence, document selections from the drop-down menu 604 can
change dynamically depending on the user selected from the drop-down menu 602. Upon
completing an assignment, pertinent assignment information is displayed in the display area 606.
The administrator can also select from the display area 606 an expiration date associated with an
assigned document. In addition to a specific expiration date, "never expires" may be an option
selectable by the administrator. Similarly, FIG. 6B shows a "script-wise" assignment interface
of the administration system 102, which allows an administrator to assign a document to multiple
users. The administrator first chooses a document from the drop-down menu 608 and then
chooses one or more users from the drop-down menu 610 for receiving the document. The drop
down menu 610 can include users previously not assigned to or shared with the document chosen
from the drop-down menu 608. Hence, user selections from the drop-down menu 610 can
change dynamically depending on the document selected from the drop-down menu 608.
[0076] FIG. 7 shows an exemplary notes interface of the administration system 102. The
administrator can first select a document from the drop-down menu 702. If notes have been
submitted by one or more user devices 104 for the selected document, the notes are shown in the
region 704. Specifically, general notes are identified in the area 708 of the region 704. Page
notes, corresponding to specific pages of the document, are identified in the area 706 of the
