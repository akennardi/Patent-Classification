A PORTABLE SHELTER
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      The present invention relates to a portable shelter. The present invention has
particular, although not exclusive application to beach shelters and other like outdoor
shelters.
BACKGROUND
[0002]      The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be
taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of
the common general knowledge.
[0003]      Skin cancer and other skin damage from the sun is increasing at alarming
rate. In order to order to minimize skin damage, beach goers can bring beach umbrellas
to the beach. The umbrellas may be jammed into the sand and expanded to provide
shelter to a beach goer.
[0004]      Hoverer, in practice, beach umbrellas are prone to blow away in the wind.
Accordingly, the canopy of a beach umbrella is often rested on the sand to stabilize the
umbrella. Resting the umbrella in this manner undesirably results in the beach goer
needing to crouch awkwardly beneath the umbrella and generally provides only partial
sun protection as part of the beach goer is exposed.
[0005]      Other types of shelter are also known. A semi-enclosed expandable shelter
has flexible ribs that extend to ground level to tension the shelter. These shelters
undesirably lack air flow and adequate height to provide suitable ventilation and cooling
for their occupants and can be difficult to foldaway.
[0006]      Large "scissor" action shelter have extendable legs requiring two or more
people to erect. These shelters are difficult to easily transport to and from the beach.
[0007]      A known shelter is reliant upon the wind to be kept open to provide adequate
room for it's occupants. Often, there is not enough wind to keep these shelters open
enough with the outcome that beach goers do not stay long, do not enjoy their time at

                                             2
the beach or simply do not use any shelter thereby increasing their susceptibility to skin
cancers.
[0008]     The preferred embodiment provides an improved shelter for beach goers.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0009]     According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a portable
shelter assembly including:
       a support;
       an expandable shelter for being supported by the support;
       a runner for running along the support to expand the shelter so as to shelter at
least one person; and
       anchors for anchoring the shelter and including respective receptacles for
receiving material, the anchors defining two or more separate access spaces.
[00010]    Each access space may be substantially greater in area than the anchors to
advantageously capture the view and breezes.
[00011]    The anchors may define three access spaces. The anchors may define four
access spaces on each side of the shelter to provide entry into the shelter from any
side.
[00012]    Advantageously, the anchors anchor the shelter to impede the assembly
from being blown away in the wind. Typically, the shelter assembly is erected by a
single person and provides excellent ventilation.
[00013]    The receptacles may include sheet material. The anchors may include
respective strips extending from a periphery of the shelter. The strips may include sheet
material. The strips may include corner strips. One or more of the strips may include
respective interior pockets.
[00014]    The support may include a spike for spiking into the ground (e.g. sand or
grass). The support may include a pole for releasably fastening to the spike which may
also act as a hammer to hammer the said spike(s) into sand or grass.

                                               3
[00015]     The shelter may be expanded in two steps, namely: a first step for opening
the shelter and a second step for tightening the shelter. The expandable shelter may
include a canopy. The canopy may include a sheet of material. The shelter may include
ribs supporting the canopy. In one embodiment the ribs are axially expandable to
tighten the canopy. Each rib may include a lock for locking the rib in an expanded
configuration. In another embodiment, the ribs are pivotally expandable to extend and
possibly tighten the canopy. Each rib may include a restraint for restraining pivoting.
The shelter may include stretchers for expanding the ribs from the support. The runner
may run along the support to actuate the stretchers. The shelter may include a lock for
locking the runner in place when the shelter is expanded.
[00016]     The shelter assembly may be collapsed to be stowed in a carry-bag. The
shelter may be square and expanded to be at least 1.7m long x 1.7m wide. The
assembled shelter may be of sufficient height to accommodate a standing person. The
ribs or support may include lightweight, resilient tubes (e.g. aluminium or fibre reinforced
material).
[00017]     A method is described for assembling a portable shelter assembly, the
method including:
        erecting a support;
        supporting an expandable shelter with the support;
        anchoring the shelter; and
        expanding the shelter by running a runner along the support to shelter at least
one person.
[00018]     Any of the features described herein can be combined in any combination
with any one or more of the other features described herein within the scope of the
invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[00026]     According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a
portable beach shelter assembly 100 as shown in Figure 1. The shelter assembly 100
includes a vertical and central support 102. An expandable shelter 104 is supported by
the support 102 and expands to shelter a person from the sun. Four corner anchors 106
are provided for anchoring the shelter 104 to the ground. The anchors 106 define four
respective and separate access spaces to provide entry into the shelter 104 from any of
the four sides. Each access space is substantially greater in area than the anchors 106
to advantageously capture the view and breezes. Advantageously, shelter assembly
100 is wind resistant whereby the anchors anchor the shelter 104 to impede the
assembly 100 from being blown away. The assembly 100 is erected by a single person
and provides excellent ventilation.
[00027]     The anchors 106 include base pocket receptacles 108 for receiving sand,
water bottles, rocks or other like anchoring materials. The receptacles 108 are formed
from stitched sheet or other material. The anchors 106 also include respective corner

                                               5
strips 110 extending from a corner periphery of the shelter 104 to the ground. One or
more of the strips 110 may include interior storage pockets 112.
[00028]     Turning to Figure 2, the support 102 includes a spike 200 for spiking into the
sand (e.g. ground). The support 102 also includes a tubular hammer pole 202 for
releasably receiving the spike 200. In turn, the pole 202 couples to a tubular vertical
pole 204 of the shelter 104.
[00029]     The expandable shelter 104 includes attached canopy 206 formed from a
sheet of material. The shelter 104 includes four ribs 208 supporting the canopy 206 and
pivotally anchored at a crown 209. The shelter 104 also includes stretchers 212 for
expanding the ribs 208 from the support 102. A runner 210 is provided for running along
the support 102 to actuate the stretchers 212. The shelter 104 may include a lock for
locking the runner 210 in place when the shelter 104 is expanded.
[00030]     The shelter assembly 100 can be collapsed to be conveniently stowed in a
carry-bag carried by one person. The shelter 100 is generally square (Fig. 1) and
expanded to be at least 1.8 metres long x 1.8 metres wide, or other larger or smaller
dimension as required. The assembled shelter 100 may be of sufficient height to
accommodate a standing person. The ribs 208 and support 102 include lightweight,
resilient tubes (e.g. aluminium) to facilitate easy handling by the single user that can
conveniently erect and collapse the assembly 100.
[00031]     The shelter 104 is initially expanded using the runner 210, and then further
expanded to tighten the canopy 206 using the ribs 208. Figure 3 shows a telescopic rib
208 which can be axially expanded to tighten the canopy 208. Each rib 208 includes a
lock 300 or a ratchet type lock for locking the rib 208 in an expanded configuration. The
lock 300 includes a spring-biased pushbutton 302 that protrudes through adjustment
holes 303 in both sliding stems 304, 306 to lock the stems 304, 306 together. Figure 6
shows the beach shelter frame including the ribs 208 of Figure 3.
[00032]     Alternatively, as shown in Figure 4, the ribs 208 can be pivotally expandable
to tighten the canopy 206. In this manner a top stem 400 of the rib 208 pivots
downwardly to align with the level stem 402 during tightening of the canopy 206. Each
rib 208 may include a mechanical restraint for restraining pivoting downwardly beyond

                                                 6
1800 so that the erected rib 208 is substantially straight. Figure 5 shows the beach
shelter frame including the ribs 208 of Figure 4.
[00033]
[00034]     A method for assembling the portable shelter assembly 100 is now briefly
described.
[00035]     Initially, a storage bag axially slips of off the compacted shelter assembly
100.
[00036]     Next, the method involves erecting the support 102. The spike 200 slides into
the pole 202. The spike 200 is then hammered into the sand by forcing the pole 202 up
and down.
[00037]     Next, the expandable shelter 104 is supported by the support 102. The
vertical pole 204 of the shelter 104 slides onto the lower pole 202.
[00038]     Next, the anchor receptacles 108 are filled with sand to anchor the shelter
104.
[00039]     Next, the shelter 104 is expanded in two easy steps to shelter up to two
people comfortably, namely: a first step for opening the shelter 104 and a second step
for tightening the shelter 104. Firstly, the runner 210 is run up the vertical pole 204 to
expand the ribs 208 supporting the canopy 206. Secondly, the ribs 208 are expanded to
tighten the canopy 206. Both the runner 210 and the ribs 208 may be locked in place.
[00040]     Once the day is done, the portable assembly 100 may be conveniently
unassembled and returned to its storage bag.
[00041]     A person skilled in the art will appreciate that many embodiments and
variations can be made without departing from the ambit of the present invention.
[00042]     In one embodiment, the anchors 106 may include pegs for pegging to hard
ground (e,g. grass).
