ABSTRACT
The present invention discloses use of one or more MicroRNA genes selected from miRNAs of
Family Let-7, miR-21 or miR-222 in the construction of tissue engineered nerves and in the
repair of peripheral nerve defects. An outer and/or internal surface or pores of a tissue
engineered nerve graft are coated or adsorbed with polymeric nanomicrospheres carrying a
Let-7 family miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, or miR-222, or a mimetic thereof, wherein the polymeric
material is composed of biocompatible fibronectin and heparin. In the present invention, the
regeneration of peripheral nerves and the construction of tissue engineered nerves are
promoted by regulating the expression of MicroRNA genes which can effectively promote the
proliferation of primary Schwann cells cultured in vitro and have an anti-apoptotic effect on
neuronal cells. In-vivo test proves that bridging of the tissue engineered nerve graft can
facilitate the regeneration of peripheral nerves, thus being useful in the treatment of peripheral
nerve injury.

   ENGINEERED NERVE AND APPLICATIONS THEREOF IN REPAIRING NERVE
                                              DEFECT
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]     The present invention relates to the technical field of biomedicines, and in particular
to use of MicroRNA genes in the construction of tissue engineered nerves and in the repair of
nerve defects.
BACKGROUND
[0002]     Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
[0003]      Peripheral nerve injury is a common clinical disease that is caused by traffic
accidents and a variety of accidental injuries and is on a sharp rise. With the rapid
development of China's economy, the number of patients with peripheral nerve injury caused
by traffic and production accidents and other accidental traumas also increases year by year.
At present, there are nearly 20 millions of patients suffering from dysfunction after peripheral
nerve injury in China, with the increase rate being nearly 2 millions of patients per year.
Peripheral nerve injury has serious impact on the quality of life of patients, and the loss of labor
power and the increase in medical expenses cause serious burdens to the society.
[0004]      Peripheral nerve injury often leads to paralysis, palsy and loss of autonomous control
over corresponding body area. The effect of surgical repair of the nerve injury is currently less
desirable. There is a need for new strategies to improve specific axonal regeneration after
nerve injury. Neurons of the peripheral nervous system have higher intrinsic regeneration
ability than the neurons of the central nervous system, and can regenerate axons under
suitable environmental conditions. The peripheral nerve regeneration process is complex and
controlled by multiple factors. Good microenvironment is conducive to the nerve regeneration.
[0005]     Autologous nerve transplantation has been accepted as a gold standard for repairing
peripheral nerve defects. However, because the autogenous nerve donor is hardly available,
transplantation often causes secondary damage, and thus the application is greatly limited.

                                                -2
The bridging and transplantation of xenograft are limited in the clinical application, because the
allogeneic or heterogeneous tissue may carry the source of infection per se and thus easily
lead to infectious diseases, and immune rejection also exists.
[0006]     At present, the research direction of autologous nerve replacements is mainly toward
tissue engineered nerve. The tissue engineered nerve is usually composed of a scaffold, an
extracellular matrix, seed cells, growth factors and others. To better guide the growth of nerve
tissue, a hollow neural tube is added with a fibrous scaffold, a gel or prepared into a neural
tube having a number of microchannels. Studies confirm that compared with an unfilled hollow
neural tube, an artificial nerve graft with such improvements is increased in terms of the
distance to repair the nerve defects. On the basis of biological nerve grafts, other researchers
have a specific extracellular matrix or growth factors incorporated to enhance the repair
function. Studies show that the tissue-engineered nerves can help the organism produce a
microenvironment favorable to regeneration locally in the site of injury.
[0007]     The neural tubes simply made of scaffold materials, such as collagen, chitosan,
polyglycolic acid and other materials are neural tubes of artificially synthesized and natural
materials that are initially used in the repair of peripheral nerve defects, and some products
have been commercialized and approved for clinical use. However, the products have limited
ability to repair defects, and generally can only be used to repair short-distance peripheral
nerve defects. Schwann cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells used as seed cells
are hardly available because they can be obtained only after secondary injury, and also have
the problem of immunogenicity and others. The growth factors added to the scaffold material
are also problematic in maintaining their stability and efficiency. In the method where an
extracellular matrix is incorporated on the basis of biological nerve graft to enhance the repair
function, the cells need to be co-incubated with the neural tube in vitro. The period is long, the
steps are cumbersome, and decellularization is needed in a later time to remove the
immunogenicity. It is difficult to ensure the consistency between batches
[0008]     MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of endogenous small non-coding single-stranded
RNAs (less than 22 nucleotides in length) that are widely present in eukaryotes and negatively
regulate the post-translational expression of proteins by inhibiting the protein translation or
degrading a target mRNA. MiRNAs are a wide range of regulatory factors present during
development and cell differentiation.
[0009]     The lethal-7 (let-7) family of microRNAs is first found in C. elegans, and is highly

                                                 -3
conserved in vertebrates and nonvertebrates. The Let-7 family of microRNAs can regulate the
neuronal cell fate, and have effect on neurodegenerative diseases and nerve regeneration.
The 8 members let-7a, 7b, 7c, 7c, 7d, 7e, 7f, 7i and miR-98 in the family have substantially the
same expression at various times after sciatic nerve injury, and the variation in expression is
negatively correlated with NGF. The Let-7 family of microRNAs significantly reduces the
proliferation and migration of primary Schwann cells cultured in vitro by directly targeting and
regulating NGF and reducing the protein translation of NGF. After sciatic nerve injury, the
Schwann cell is promoted to secrete NGF and the axon co-cultured with Schwann cells and
DRG neurons is promoted to grow by inhibiting the expression of Let-7 microRNAs. In vivo
animal experiments show that inhibition on Let-7 MicroRNA expression contributes to the
migration of Schwann cells and the axon growth in a regeneration microenvironment.
[0010]      The miR-21 gene is located on chromosome 17q23.2, which is widely present in the
tissues and organs of mammals. The miR-21 gene is a proto-oncogene, and highly expressed
in almost all human cancers. Approximately two-thirds of the experimental results show that
the miR-21 gene is associated with endogenous/exogenous apoptosis. MiR-222 is located on
chromosome Xp11.3, and its expression is up-regulated in many patients with cancer in clinic.
[0011]      After sciatic nerve injury, miR-21 and miR-222 reduce the apoptosis of neurons in the
dorsal root ganglion in adult rats by inhibiting the expression of tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3). MiR-21 and miR-222 directly target the super-apoptotic protein
TIMP3. MiR-21 and miR-222 are among the 13 miRNA genes differentially expressed in the
L4-6 dorsal root ganglia during the first 7 days after sciatic nerve transection in rats. The
expression of miR-21 and miR-222 is continuously increased within 7 days after injury. Over
expression of miR-21 and miR-222 significantly inhibits the apoptosis of neurons in dorsal root
ganglion cultured in vitro, increases the viability of neurons in dorsal root ganglion and
promotes the growth of neuronal processes by their effect of inhibiting and targeting TIMP3.
After sciatic nerve injury, miR-21 is highly expressed in the spinal and dorsal root ganglia, and
promotes the growth of neurite by directly targeting and down-regulating the expression of
Sprouty2 protein.
[0012]      The addition of a microRNA-222 inhibitor to DRG neurons cultured in-vitro can inhibit
the growth of neurite. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a gene that is directly
targeted by microRNA-222. PTEN is an important regulator inhibiting nerve regeneration, and
inhibition of PTEN can increase the intrinsic regeneration ability of adult peripheral axon. MiR
222 regulates the phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) by

                                                 -4
PTEN. The activation of c-Jun increases the expression of miR-222 and regulates and
activates the intrinsic regeneration ability of neurons after peripheral nerve injury at the
transcriptional level. MiR-222 is a proto-oncogene directly targeting TIMP3 and PTEN, and is
associated with the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced signaling pathways.
[0013]     So far, there is no research in which local microRNA expression for regulating the
body damage is combined with the construction of novel tissue-engineered nerves to promote
nerve regeneration and repair peripheral nerve defects.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[0014]     The present invention is designed according to the theoretical characteristics of
peripheral nerve regeneration, in which regulation of the expression of miRNAs belonging to
the Family Let-7, miR-21 and miR-222 is adopted in the construction of tissue engineered
nerves. The research results show that the present invention has good effects in the regulation
of nerve growth factor (NGF) production, the promotion of axonal regeneration, the promotion
of Schwann cell proliferation, and the regulation of angiogenesis, thus providing an appropriate
microenvironment for peripheral nerve regeneration.
[0015]     Furthermore, a Let-7 family miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, miR-222 or a mimetic thereof is
embedded in nanomicrospheres by a nanomicrosphere technology, and the nanomicrospheres
are bound to a chitosan tube or a silk fibroin tube to form a novel tissue-engineered nerve graft
that is tublized and sutured in peripheral nerve defects and can regulate the expression of
microRNAs through slow release locally in vivo.
[0016]     The tublization system for promoting the peripheral nerve regeneration of the present
invention is a tissue engineered nerve that is formed by, on the basis of a chitosan or silk
fibroin tube developed in an early stage of the present invention, embedding a Let-7 family
miRNA inhibitor, miR-21,       miR-222    or a mimetic thereof in nanomicrospheres         by a
nanomicrosphere technology, and binding the nanomicrospheres to the biological tube, and
that is tublized and sutured in peripheral nerve defects and can regulate the expression of
microRNAs through slow release locally in vivo after suture.
[0017]     The specific technical solutions of the present invention are as follows.
[0018]     According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided use of a
MicroRNA gene in the construction of tissue engineered nerves and in the repair of peripheral

                                                -5
nerve defects, wherein the MicroRNA gene is one or more selected from miRNAs of Family
Let-7, miR-21 or miR-222.
[0019]     The peripheral nerve regeneration can be promoted by regulating the expression of
the above microRNA genes, that is, by inhibiting the expression of Let-7 microRNAs or by up
regulating the expression of miR-21 or miR-222 to construct tissue-engineered nerves.
[0020]     Preferably, a Let-7 family miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, miR-222 or a mimetic thereof may
be coated or adsorbed as an ingredient for promoting the peripheral nerve regeneration to an
outer and/or internal surface or pores of a tissue engineered nerve graft.
[0021]     Preferably, the Let-7 family miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, miR-222 or a mimetic thereof is
present on the tissue engineered nerve graft material in an amount of 10 pg/g-10 mg/g.
[0022]     In a preferred technical solution of the present invention, the Let-7 family miRNA
inhibitor, miR-21 or miR-222 or a mimetic thereof is embedded in nanomicrospheres by a
nanomicrosphere technology. The nanomicrospheres may be polymeric nanomicrospheres
carrying the Let-7 family miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, miR-222 or a mimetic thereof. Preferably, the
polymeric material is composed of biocompatible fibronectin and heparin, and the weight ratio
of fibronectin to heparin is 1:10-1:1.
[0023]     Further preferably, the nanomicrosphere has an average diameter of 100-250 nm.
[0024]     The nanomicrospheres are prepared through the following process.
[0025]     An appropriate amount of fibronectin is dissolved in sterilized pure water to obtain a
1 mg/ml aqueous fibronectin solution. An appropriate amount of heparin is also dissolved in
sterilized water to form a 1 mg/ml aqueous heparin solution. The aqueous fibronectin solution
is then added to the aqueous heparin solution with stirring, and the reaction is continued at
room temperature for 90 min. After the reaction is completed, the biocompatible crosslinking
agent Genipin is added to the above solution, mixed until uniform, and reacted overnight at
40C to form light blue nanomicrospheres with uniform particle size, in which the weight ratio of
Genipin to fibronectin is 1:5.
[0026]     A MicroRNA is dissolved in saline to form a solution containing 250 ng/mL
microRNA. The solution is then added to the above-mentioned nanomicrosphere solution, fully
stirred and mixed at 40C, and incubated for 2 hrs, to finally form a dispersion containing

[0028]     Another object of the present invention is to provide a tissue engineered nerve graft,
in which an outer and/or internal surface or pores of the tissue engineered nerve graft are
coated or adsorbed with one or more of a Let-7 family miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, miR-222 or a
mimetic thereof. Preferably, the outer and/or internal surface or pores of the tissue engineered
nerve graft are coated or adsorbed with polymeric nanomicrospheres of the Let-7 family
miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, miR-222 or a mimetic thereof. The polymeric material is composed of
biocompatible fibronectin and heparin. Preferably, the weight ratio of fibronectin to heparin is
1:10-1:1. Further preferably, the nanomicrospheres have an average diameter of 100-250 nm.
[0029]     The tissue engineered nerve graft may be a tissue engineered nerve graft routinely
used in the art, preferably a nerve graft scaffold or a nerve tube, where the scaffold or tube has
pores distributed therein. Preferred is chitosan artificial nerve graft, a porous and highly tensile
nerve tube with a scaffold having a porosity of 50%-90% and a pore size of 10-100 pm.

[0030]     The present invention has the following advantages.
[0031]     The present invention is designed according to the theoretical characteristics of
peripheral nerve regeneration, in which a Let-7d miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, miR-222 or a
mimetic thereof is applied in tissue engineered nerves. The present invention has effects in the
regulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) production, the promotion of axonal regeneration, the
promotion of Schwann cell proliferation, and the regulation of angiogenesis, thus providing an
appropriate microenvironment for peripheral nerve regeneration. The Let-7d miRNA inhibitor,
miR-21, miR-222 or a minetic thereof is embedded in nanomicrospheres composed of
biocompatible fibronectin and heparin by a nanomicrosphere technology. The fibronectin and
cell surface receptors for collagen, heparin, cellulose and integrin family are involved in a
variety of cellular biological processes such as cell adhesion, migration, thrombosis and
embryo differentiation. In the present invention, fibronectin and heparin are crosslinked to
produce nanomicrospheres by using their biological characteristics, through which not only the
stability of the Let-7 family miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, miR-222, or a mimetic thereof is
increased, but also the sustained release is achieved to maintain the concentration locally in
the site of nerve injury, and the cell proliferation, tissue or organ repair and regeneration are
promoted. The nanomicrospheres of the present invention have good biocompatibility and
stable biochemical properties, can effectively promote the proliferation of primary Schwann
cells cultured in vitro, and have anti-apoptotic effect on neuronal cells. In vivo experiments
demonstrate that the bridging of the tissue engineered nerve graft can facilitate the
regeneration of peripheral nerves, thus being useful in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury.

[0045]      An appropriate amount of fibronectin was dissolved in sterilized pure water to obtain
a 1 mg/ml aqueous fibronectin solution. An appropriate amount of heparin was also dissolved
in sterilized water to form a 1 mg/ml aqueous heparin solution. The aqueous fibronectin
solution was then added to the aqueous heparin solution with stirring, and the reaction was

                                               - 10
continued at room temperature for 90 min. After the reaction was completed, the biocompatible
crosslinking agent Genipin was added to the above solution, mixed until uniform, and reacted
overnight at 40C to form light blue nanomicrospheres with uniform particle size, in which the
weight ratio of Genipin to fibronectin was 1:5.
[0046]     One or more of the Let-7 family miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, miR-222 or a minetic
thereof was dissolved in saline to form a solution containing 250 ng/mL of the Let-7 family
miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, miR-222 or a minetic thereof. The solution was then added to the
above-mentioned nanomicrosphere solution, fully stirred and mixed at 40C, and incubated for 2
hrs, to finally form a dispersion containing fibronectin-heparin nanomicrospheres carrying the
Let-7 family miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, miR-222 or a minetic thereof.
[0047]     Example 2. Preparation of tissue engineered nerves load with nanomicrospheres
[0048]     A nerve tube was prepared following the method as described in Electrospun,
Reinforcing Network-Containing, Silk Fibroin-Based Nerve Guidance Conduits for Peripheral
Nerve Repair Journal of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering Vol. 6, 53-60, 2016. The nerve
tube was incubated for 2 hrs with the nanomicrospheres prepared in Example 1 at room
temperature for physical adsorption, to obtain a tissue engineered nerve loaded with
nanomicrospheres. Alternatively, the nerve tube was incubated for 2 hrs with one or more of
the Let-7 family miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, miR-222 or a minetic thereof at room temperature for
physical adsorption, to obtain a tissue engineered nerve directly loaded with the Let-7 family
miRNA inhibitor, miR-21, miR-222 or a minetic thereof.

[0055]     Example 3: In vitro proliferation promotion experiment of Schwann cells
[0056]     Tissue engineered nerves 1-6 of 1 cm in length were totally immersed in 2 ml of a
culture media (which is, depending on the experimental purposes, DMEM + 10% FBS in the
Schwann cell proliferation experiment; and 97% Neurobasal + 2% B27 + 1% GluMAX in the
apoptosis detection experiment of DRG neuron) for 24 hrs at room temperature respectively,
and then stored at 40C for later use.
[0057]     Newborn SD rats aged 1-2 days was frozen, and disinfected by spraying 75%
alcohol, followed by the steps below which are conducted on a sterile ultraclean bench in a
culture room. The sciatic nerve was removed by exposing it via the muscular space
posterolateral to the femur and then placed in a pre-cooled HBSS solution. After the
epineurium was peeled off under a dissecting microscope, the sciatic nerve was placed in a
1.5 ml EP tube containing 200 pl of 1 mg/ml collagenase, and digested at 370C for 30 min.
Then, the collagenase was removed, and 0.125% trypsin was added, for digestion at 370C for
12 min. The digested solution was transferred to a 5 ml EP tube, 3 ml Schwann cell culture
medium was added and pipetted repeatedly until substantially no tissue mass was visible. After
centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed twice with a Schwann
cell culture medium, then inoculated at a density of 1 x 106 cells in a plate previously coated
with PLL, and placed in a humidified incubator at 370C with 95% air and 5% C02. The culture
medium was refreshed with a cytosine arabinoside containing medium (1:1000) in 24 hrs. After
24 hrs, the culture medium was refreshed with a medium containing 2 pM forsokolin and 10
ng/ml HRG, and refreshed once every 3 days. After the cells were grown to 50% confluent, the
culture medium was refreshed completely with a leachate of tissue engineered nerves 1-6
respectively, and continuously cultured for 24 hrs. After digestion with 0.25% trypsin, the cell
density was adjusted to 5 x 105/ml. 0.5 ml of 50 ug/ml PI staining solution was added, and the
cells were stained for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The cell cycle was detected by
flow cytometry following a standard procedure
[0058]     The detection results by flow cytometry are shown in 1 (A. Let-7d inhibitor
nanomicrosphere       group;   B.   miR-98     inhibitor nanomicrosphere    group;  C.   miR-21

nanomicrosphere group; D. miR-222 nanomicrosphere group; E. non-nanomicrosphere group
with the combination of Let-7d inhibitor, miR-98 inhibitor, miR-21 mimetic and miR-222
mimetic; and F. nanomicrosphere group with the combination of Let-7d inhibitor, miR-98
inhibitor, miR-21 mimetic and miR-222 mimetic). The results show that 74.93% and 88.58% of
the Schwann cells in the experimental groups E and F are in the proliferation cycle, which is
significantly higher than the 64.71% in Fig. A, 68.57% in Fig. B, 66.34% in Fig. C, and 60.15%
in Fig. D, suggesting that the effect of the combination of Let-7d inhibitor, miR-98 inhibitor, miR
21 mimetic and miR-222 mimetic is better than that of any one alone. Moreover, the tissue
engineered nerve loaded with nanomicrospheres containing the Let-7d inhibitor, miR-98
inhibitor, and miR-21 and miR-222 mimetics has an obviously better effect on the Schwann cell
proliferation than the tissue engineered nerve directly adsorbed with the Let-7d inhibitor, miR
98 inhibitor, and miR-21 and miR-222 mimetics. It is concluded that the tissue engineered
nerve loaded with nanomicrospheres containing the combination of Let-7d inhibitor, miR-98
inhibitor, and miR-21 and miR-222 mimetics can promote the proliferation of primary Schwann
cells cultured in vitro.
[0059]      DRG L4, 5, and 6 from SD rat embryos of 16 days were digested with 0.25% trypsin
at 370C for 15 min, and inoculated in a 24-well culture plate at a cell density of 101 cells/ml.
After 1 day of conventional culture in vitro, it was found through observation under a
phasecontrast microscope that cells adherent occurred and a few neurites were grown. After
pretreatment with 40 ng/ml TNF-a for 12 hrs, the primary DRG neurons cultured were treated
with a leachate of tissue engineered nerves 1-6 for 12 hrs respectively. The culture medium
was aspirated off and the cells were washed once with 0.01 M PBS. 4% paraformaldehyde
was added, and the cells were immobilized at room temperature for 30 min. The fixative was
removed and the cells were washed for 10 min with 0.01 M PBS at room temperature (x3).
The cells were blocked for 60 min at 370C with 0.01 M PBS containing 10% goat serum and
0.3% Triton X-0100, and then the blocking solution was aspirated off. The primary antibodies,
i.e. the Rabbit antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 (1:500) and the Mouse rabbit antibody
against total caspase-3 (1:800), were added dropwise and incubated overnight at 40C. The
cells were washed for 10 min with 0.01 M PBS (x 3). The secondary antibodies, i.e. the TRITC
labeled secondary antibody donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:600), and the FITC labeled secondary
antibody donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:600) were added dropwise, and the nucleus was labeled
with Hoechst (5 pg/ml), stood for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark, and then washed for 10
min with 0.01 M PBS (x3). The immunofluorescence cytochemical detection results were
observed under a laser confocal microscope (FITC excitation wavelength: 488 nm, and
emission wavelength: 500-535 nm; and Hoechst Ar ion excitation wavelength: 353-364 nm,

                                                - 13
and emission wavelength: 460-480 nm).
[0060]      The immunohistochemical staining results of cells are shown in Fig. 2 (A. Let-7d
inhibitor nanomicrosphere group; B. miR-98 inhibitor nanomicrosphere group; C. miR-21
nanomicrosphere group; D. miR-222 nanomicrosphere group; E. non-nanomicrosphere group
with the combination of Let-7d inhibitor, miR-98 inhibitor, miR-21 mimetic and miR-222
mimetic; and F. nanomicrosphere group with the combination of Let-7d inhibitor, miR-98
inhibitor, miR-21 mimetic and miR-222 mimetic). In the figure, the blue indicates Hoechst
labeled nucleus; the red indicates total caspase-3 which is expressed generally in all of the
normal cells; the green indicates activated caspase-3, which is expressed merely in apoptotic
cells. The results show that the immunohistochemistry of Let-7d inhibitor nanomicrosphere
group     (Fig. A), the    miR-98    inhibitor nanomicrosphere     group  (Fig.  B), the miR-21
nanomicrosphere group (Fig. C), and the miR-222 nanomicrosphere group (Fig. D) indicates
the presence of a lot of green, that is, activated caspase-3, suggesting the apoptosis of cells.
Fig. E shows the result of the non-nanomicrosphere group with the combination of Let-7d
inhibitor, miR-98 inhibitor, miR-21 mimetic and miR-222 mimetic. Although activated caspase-3
is still expressed, the level is obviously lower than that of the experimental group with a single
MicroRNA. Fig. F shows the result of the nanomicrosphere group with the combination of Let
7d inhibitor, miR-98 inhibitor, miR-21 mimetic and miR-222 mimetic. The result shows that no
activated caspase-3 is expressed, suggesting that almost no apoptosis of cells occurs. It is
concluded that the tissue engineered nerve with the combination of Let-7d inhibitor, miR-98
inhibitor, and miR-21 and miR-222 mimetics can greatly inhibit the apoptosis caused by TNF-a
of primary DRG neurons cultured.
[0061]      Example 4. Use of MicroRNA gene-meditated novel tissue engineered nerve in the
repair of nerve defects
            1. Grouping of animal experiment and model preparation
            1.1. Animal experiment and grouping
[0062]      The rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (each group having 15 animals),
including a tissue engineered nerve group (experimental group with tissue-engineered nerve 6
described in Example 2), an autologous nerve group, a chitosan nanomicrosphere-loaded tube
group (negative control group), and a sham operation group (normal group).

                                                 - 14
            Preparation of chitosan nanomicrosphere-loaded tube:
[0063]     As described in Kawadkar J, Chauhan M K. I Intra-articular delivery of genipin cross
linked chitosan nanomicrospheres of flurbiprofen: preparation, characterization, in vitro and in
vivo studies. [J]. European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, 2012,81(3):563
572, 3 ml of a 30 g/L chitosan solution in acetic acid/water was added dropwise to 40 ml of
liquid paraffin containing 20 g/L span-80 and magnetically stirred at room temperature to form
a stable W/O emulsion system. Biological cross-linking agent Genipin with 2ml volume fraction
of 70% ethanol solution dissolved, into the emulsion for cross-linking curing. After completion
of the reaction, the resulting chitosan nanomicrospheres were collected by centrifugal
dispersion. The biocompatible crosslinking agent Genipin was dissolved in 2 ml of a 70 vol%
ethanol solution, and added dropwise into the emulsion for curing by cross-linking. After
completion of the reaction, the resulting chitosan nanomicrospheres were collected by
centrifugation. The Let-7d inhibitor, miR-98 inhibitor, miR-21 and miR-222 mimics described in
Example 1 were dissolved in physiological saline to form a 250 ng/mL solution containing the
Let-7d inhibitor, miR-98 inhibitor, miR-21 and miR-222 mimics. The solution was then added to
the above-mentioned nanomicrosphere solution, mixed fully by stirring at 40C, and incubated
for 2 hrs to finally form a dispersion of chitosan nanomicrospheres carrying the Let-7d inhibitor,
miR-98 inhibitor and miR-21 and miR-222 mimetics.
[0064]     A nerve tube was prepared following the method described in Electrospun,
Reinforcing Network-Containing, Silk Fibroin-Based Nerve Guidance Conduits for Peripheral
Nerve Repair Journal of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering Vol. 6, 53-60, 2016. The nerve
tube was incubated for 2 hrs with the nanomicrospheres for physical adsorption, to obtain a
chitosan tube loaded with nanomicrospheres.
            1.2. Model preparation
[0065]     The animals were intraperitoneally anesthetized with a compound anesthetic (0.2-0.3
ml/100 g body weight). After the success of anesthesia, conventional skin preparation,
disinfection, and draping were done in a surgical area at the left femur. An incision was made
right in the center posterior to the left femur, followed by cutting the skin and fascia, to free and
fully expose the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was dissected in the middle of the femur and a
10 mm defect was caused. For the tissue engineered nerve group (TENG) and the fibroin tube
group (Scaffold), the dissected ends at both sides of the nerve were inserted 1 mm into the
tube, and immobilized by suturing the epineurium with an atraumatic suture. For the

                                               -15
autologous nerve group, the dissected sciatic nerve was reversed before suturing. The incision
was conventionally closed. The model preparation and subsequent feeding and observation
were all carried out in an SPF barrier system.
          2. Evaluation of postoperative functional recovery
          2.1. Test of electrophysiological functions
[0066]     12 weeks      after operation,  the rats were     subjected   to electrophysiological
examination at room temperature. The rats were weighed and intraperitoneally injected with
compound anesthetic (0.2-0.3ml per 1O0g body weight of rat). After the success of anesthesia,
the sciatic nerve was exposed and carefully separated with a glass dissecting needle. The
compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were recorded. The recording electrode was
inserted into the muscle belly of the gastrocnemius muscle, and the interference electrode was
placed on the skin surface of the rat knee. The stimulation electrodes were sequentially placed
proximal and distal to the sciatic nerve trunk of the injured site to stimulate the nerve. The
CMAPs were recorded and the amplitude and latency of the CMAPs were measured. Similarly,
the amplitude and latency of the CMAPs at the normal side were recorded. The amplitude of
CMAPs is proportional to the nerve fibers that dominate the target muscle. Therefore, the
detection of CMAPs provides an important parameter for the recovery of the conduction
function of peripheral nerves. The CMAP recovery index was calculated according to the
formula: recovery index = maximal amplitude of CMAPs at the operated side/maximal
amplitude of CMAPs at the normal side.
[0067]    The experimental results are shown in Fig. 3 (A. chitosan nanomicrosphere-loaded
tube group; B. experimental group with tissue engineered nerve 6 of the present invention; C.
autologous nerve group; and D. normal group). The results show that the recovery of CMAP
and nerve conduction velocity in the gastrocnemius muscle of the rats in the experimental
group with tissue engineered nerve 6 of the present invention is significantly better than that of
the chitosan nanomicrosphere group, and is close to that of the positive control autologous
nerve group.
          2.3. Perfusion fixation and acquisition of tissue
          2.3.1. Perfusion fixation
[0068]    At weeks 4 and 12 after surgery, rats were given an operation with a compound

                                                 - 16
anesthetic and the chest was opened to expose the heart. The right auricle was pierced, and
the needle was pierced into the left ventricle to perfuse it with physiological saline (where the
perfusion volume was about 2 times of the body weight) until the color of the liver became
light, and the fluid in the mesenteric vessels became nearly colorless from the red. Then, equal
volume of 4% paraformaldehyde was perfused.
            2.3.2. Acquisition of tissue
[0069]      Three rats in each group were perfused and fixed. The regenerated sciatic nerve
trunk was removed, immersed in a pre-cooled glutaraldehyde fixative solution, and left for
being embedded with a resin and observed under an electron microscope.
[0070]      After perfusion, the bilateral gastrocnemius muscles with a volume of about 0.5 cm x
0.3 cm x 0.3 cm were carefully dissected and cut intact, and immersed overnight in a suitable
amount of a pre-cold post-fixative solution (4% PA) at 40C. The regenerated sciatic nerve trunk
on the operated side was carefully dissected and removed, and a segment of sciatic nerve in a
corresponding site at the normal side was removed and taken as the control. The sciatic nerve
sample was straightly attached on a cardboard and immersed overnight in a suitable amount
of a pre-cold post-fixative solution (4% PA) at 40C.
            2.4. Sample treatment and observation
            2.4.1. Treatment of samples for electron microscopy
[0071]      At weeks 4 and 12 after operation, the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle
samples were fixed with glutaraldehyde, followed by post-fixation with 1% osmic acid, fast
staining with uranyl acetate, dehydration over ethanol gradient, and embedding in Epon 812
epoxy resin.
            2.4.2. Masson Trichrome (MT) staining for muscles
[0072]      At weeks 4 and 12 after operation, the gastrocnemius muscle was precipitated in a
sucrose solution, then embedded in 5% sucrose (formulated in 0.1 M PB), frozen, and laterally
sliced into 10 pm. The slices were placed at room temperature for about 24 hours, for
facilitating the tissue attachment. Masson trichrome staining was performed as follows. The
collagen fibers appeared blue, the muscle fibers appeared red and the nuclei appeared black
and blue.

                                                 - 17
             (1) The slices were placed in ddH 2O for 3-5 min.
             (2) The slices were stained with Ehrlich hematoxylin for 20min.
             (3) The slices were immersed in ddH 2O for about 1 min, and amenable to color
separation for about 1min in 1% hydrochloric acid in ethanol.
             (4) Bluing with tap water is continued for about 20 min under a microscope.
             (5) The slices were stained with Ponceau S - acid complex red for 5min.
             (6) The slices were washed with ddH 2O.
             (7) The slices were stained with 1% phosphomolybdic acid.
             (8) The slices were directly stained with toluidine blue for 5 min without washing with
water.
             (9) The slices were washed with ddH 2O, and amenable to color separation for about
1 min with 1% glacial acetic acid.
             (10) The slices were dehydrated with 95% ethanol for 5 min (x3), followed by
dehydration in absolute ethanol for 5min (x2).
             (11) The slices were transparented with xylene for 5 min (x3), mounted with resin, air
dried at room temperature, and then observed under an optical microscope.
[0073]      The experimental results are shown in Fig. 4 (A. chitosan nanomicrosphere-loaded
tube group; B. experimental group with tissue engineered nerve 6 of the present invention; C.
autologous nerve group; and D. normal group, where the red indicates muscle fiber; and the
blue indicates collagen fiber). The results show that the cross-sectional area of the muscle
fibers in the experimental group with tissue engineered nerve 6 of the present invention is
close to that of the autologous nerve group, both of which is significantly higher than that of the
chitosan nanomicrosphere group; and the percent of area of the collagen fibers is significantly
lower than that of the chitosan nanomicrosphere group.
            2.5. Electron microscopic analysis of nerve tissue
[0074]      (1) Harris hematoxylin: 0.5 g of hematoxylin was added to and dissolved in 5 ml of
absolute ethanol. 10 g of potassium aluminum sulfate was added to and dissolved in 100 ml of
double distilled water. The two solutions were mixed until uniform and heated to boiling. Then,
0.25 g of mercury oxide yellow was added, and cooled in ice water after dissolution. After
filtering, 5 ml of glacial acetic acid was added. (2) Trichrome stain solution: 0.3 g of solid green

                                                -18
FCF, 0.6 g of chromotrope 2R and 0.6 g of phosphotungstic acid were added in sequence to
and dissolved in 100 ml of double distilled water, and then 2 ml of glacial acetic acid was
added to adjust the pH to 3.4. The stain solution might be stored at room temperature for two
weeks. If the preservation time is too long or the pH value changes, the color shifts towards
purple and the green become lighter. (3) The 0.3% glacial acetic acid solution was formulated
immediately before use.
[0075]      Referring to the experimental method of Meyer et al with modification, the slices
were (1) conventionally deparaffinized into ddH 2O; (2) stained with Harris hematoxylin for 5
min; (3) washed for 5 min with double distilled water, and controlled in terms of bluing under a
microscope; (4) stained with the trichrome stain solution for 30 min; (5) washed twice with
0.3% glacial acetic acid for 20 seconds each; and washed for 5-10 min with running water, until
the color of the tissue slice was unchanged; and (7) dehydrated, transparented, and mounted
with resin.
[0076]     The results are shown in Fig. 5 (A. chitosan nanomicrosphere-loaded tube group; B.
experimental group with tissue engineered nerve 6 of the present invention; C. autologous
nerve group; and D. normal group, where the purple indicates Schwann cell nuclei; and the
green indicates the nerve axon). The results show that the formation of myelin sheath of the
regenerated nerve trunk in the experimental group with tissue engineered nerve 6 of the
present invention is significantly better than that of the chitosan nanomicrosphere group, and is
close to that of the positive control autologous nerve group.
            3. Data statistics
[0077]      In this study, the data of group design and morphometric analysis was analyzed by
one-way ANOVA using the STATA7 statistical analysis software. If the difference between the
groups was statistically significant, the Turkey's method was used to compare pairwise. The
results are expressed as mean  standard deviation (X  SD), and p<0.05 indicates that the
difference was statistically significant.
