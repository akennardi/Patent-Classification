DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0031]     As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein;
however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the
invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not
necessarily to scale; some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of
particular components. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are
not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in
the art to variously employ the present invention.
[0032]     With reference now to Figure 1, a rotary oscillating bone, cartilage, and disk removal
tool assembly is illustrated according to an embodiment, and referenced generally by numeral
30. The bone, cartilage, and disk removal tool assembly 30 is a handheld tool assembly with a
housing 32 providing a handle 34 for manual gripping for bone, cartilage, and disk removal via
a cutting operation. Alternatively, the housing may have a narrowed front portion for a smaller
pencil-like "precision grip", while the heavier remaining portion is sized to balance on a
webspace of the user's hand for allowing better control with less fatigue.
[0033]     The tool assembly 30 can be used in surgical operations, such as spinal surgery,
wherein bone, cartilage, disk, and other non-fibrous body material may be removed, such as
from the spine. The tool assembly 30 has an output spindle 36 which is driven to rotate in both
directions, or rotary oscillate about its axis. The spindle 36 supports a cutting tool 38, which is
driven by the spindle 36 to rotate partially in both directions with a limited range of rotation.
Such oscillatory cutting is effective for bone, cartilage, and disk removal by a shearing
operation, while effective in minimizing damage to any fibrous material. If the cutting tool 38
inadvertently contacts fibrous material, such as a nerve, during the cutting operation, the
fibrous material is likely to be oscillated due to the flexibility of the fibrous material with minimal
shearing, thereby minimizing damage to the fibrous material. Such rotary oscillating operations
are common in cast removal tools.
[0034]     The tool assembly 30 may receive power from an external supply, such as a direct
current power supply cord 40. A power switch 42 may be provided on the housing for
controlling the operation of the tool assembly 30. A light source 44 may also be provided on the
housing for illuminating a work piece. The light source 44 may be a light emitting diode (LED).

                                                  -5
[0035]      Figure 2 illustrates some internal components of the tool assembly 30. A power
source may be provided by a battery supply 46 oriented in the housing 32. The battery supply
46 may be charged or recharged by the power cord 40. Electronics 48 are provided in the
housing 32 for controlling the operations of the tool assembly 30. The power switch 42 may
alternatively be located at a distal end of the housing. A plurality of indicator lamps 50 may be
provided on the housing 32 and illuminated by LEDs for indicating operational characteristics
of the tool assembly 30, such as a state of charge of the battery supply 46.
[0036]     A motor 52 is mounted in the housing 32 for providing a rotary input. The motor 52 is
powered by the battery supply 46 when controlled by the electronics 48. The motor 52 drives a
transmission 54 for converting continuous rotary motion from the motor 52 to rotary oscillation
to the spindle 36. The spindle 36 is journaled in the housing 32 and driven by the transmission
54. The spindle 36 may be angled relative to the housing 32 as depicted for ergonomics.
Cooling fins, or a cooling fan may be attached to or near the motor 52 for cooling the motor 52
and/or the tool assembly 30.
[0037]      Referring now to Figures 2-9, the motor 52 drives an eccentric drive 56. The
eccentric drive 56 includes a roller 58 supported to rotate upon the drive 56, which is offset
from an axis 60 of the motor 52. Thus, rotation of the eccentric drive 56 causes the roller 58 to
revolve about the axis 60. The eccentric drive 56 also includes a counter-balance 62 offset
from the axis 60 opposed from the roller 58 to counter-balance the transmission 54 and to
minimize unwanted vibrations. The counter-balance 62 can be formed integrally with the
eccentric drive 56 according to at least one embodiment. The counter-balance 62 may include
an additional weight according to another embodiment. Alternatively, the roller 58 may be a pin.
[0038]     A guide 64 is supported in the housing 32 generally perpendicular to the motor axis
60. The guide 64 can be provided by a pair of pins 66. A shuttle 68 is provided on the guide 64
for reciprocating translation upon the guide 64. The shuttle 68 includes a channel 70 that is
generally perpendicular to the guide 64. The channel 70 receives the roller 58 of the eccentric
drive 56. The channel 70 cooperates as a follower for permitting the roller 58 to translate along
a length of the channel 70 while driving the shuttle 68 along the guide 64. The guide 64 may
utilize bearings and/or rollers to reduce friction.
[0039]     The eccentric drive 56 and shuttle 58 cooperate as a Scotch-yoke mechanism for
converting continuous rotary motion to linear reciprocating motion. The range of motion is
illustrated in Figure 4-9. At Figure 4, the roller 58 is at bottom-dead-center thereby maximizing

                                                 -6
translation of the shuttle 68. From Figures 5 to 6, the roller 58 approaches an extent of the
translation whereby the shuttle 68 decelerates. From Figures 6 to 7, the shuttle 68 reverses
direction and accelerates. At Figure 8, the roller 58 approaches top-dead-center at a maximum
velocity of the shuttle 68. From Figure 8 to Figure 9, the shuttle 68 decelerates until it reaches
an opposite range of translation, whereby the shuttle 68 reverses directions and continues to
the position of Figure 4. Although the Scotch-yoke mechanism is illustrated, any mechanism
for converting rotary motion to reciprocation can be employed, such as a crank-and-slider
mechanism, or the like.
[0040]     Referring again to Figures 2-9, a gear rack 72 is formed upon the shuttle 68. The
gear rack is formed generally parallel to the spindle 36. A pinion gear or burr gear 74 is
mounted to the spindle 36 in engagement with the gear rack 72, thereby providing a rack-and
pinion mechanism for converting the reciprocating translation of the shuttle 60 to rotary
oscillation of the spindle 36. A pair of bearing assemblies 76 may also be provided in the
housing for providing bearing support to the spindle 36. The transmission 54 may include any
additional gearsets, as is known in the art, to vary speed or torque. According to one
embodiment, a spur gear may be added to a motor output shaft to multiply speed of the roller
58.
[0041]     Figure 10 illustrates the transmission 54 according to another embodiment. A front
housing portion 78 may be detachable from the remainder of the housing 32 for interchanging
functionalities of the tool assembly 30. A bearing assembly 80 is provided in the front housing
portion 78 for providing bearing support of the eccentric drive 56. A first coupling configuration
82 is exposed from the front housing portion 78 to engage a corresponding second coupling
configuration on the housing 32. Thus, the transmission 54 and output spindle 36 can be
detached and reattached to the housing 32.
[0042]     Figure 11 illustrates a transmission 84 according to another embodiment. A motor 86
drives an eccentric drive 88 with an offset roller 90 and a counter-balance 92. A guide is
provided by a rail 94 in the housing 32. A shuttle 96 is provided on the rail 94; and includes a
channel 98 for receiving the roller 90. Ball bearings can be provided between the shuttle 96
and the rail 94.
[0043]     Unlike prior art rotary oscillating bone, cartilage, and disk removal tool assemblies,
the tool assembly 30 reduces vibrations to the user and the tool assembly 30 is easier to grip
during cutting operations. In order to obtain these product performance objectives, the motion

                                                -7
of the cutting tool 38 avoids sudden or abrupt changes in direction or velocity. Instead, as the
cutting tool 38 oscillates back and forth, its velocity smoothly transitions from zero to its peak
value, then back to zero and repeats. The motion of the cutting tool 38 is controlled so that
angular displacement, velocity and acceleration all follow harmonic signatures. That is to say,
when plotted on a graph, these characteristics follow a sinusoidal-like curve. Of course, non
harmonic signatures may be employed.
[0044]     The lateral displacement, velocity and acceleration of the shuttle 96 can be found at
any point in time by the following equations.
[0045]     Motor velocity:    w = 21T(15000rpm/60) = 1570.8 radian/second); wherein rpm is
rotations per minute.
[0046]     Motor Angle: 0 = w; wherein t is time.
[0047]     Displacement:   Xshuttle = R sin(wt); wherein R is an offset of the roller 90 from the
motor axis 60. For the depicted embodiment, R equals 3.75 millimeters (mm).
[0048]     Shuttle Velocity: shuttle = wR cos(wt).
                                                2
[0049]     Shuttle Acceleration: ashuttle = -0    R sin(wt).
[0050]     The burr gear 74 is driven by the shuttle 68 via the gear rack 72. The burr gear 74
demonstrates similar motion, but instead of lateral displacement, it experiences angular
displacement.     The rotational motion of the burr gear 74 can be described by following
equations:
[0051]     Angular Displacement:    Xburr = (R/Rburr)Sin(Wt); wherein   Rburr is pitch radius of burr
gear, which for the depicted embodiment is three millimeters.
[0052]     Angular Velocity:  Vburr = w(R/Rburr)cos(Wt).
[0053]     Peak Angular Velocity: vburr(peak) = nw,         wherein o is the oscillation amplitude,
which is % of the total angular range (expressed in radians), and which for the depicted
embodiment is also equal to R/R burr; and n is the number of oscillations per motor revolution,
which for the depicted embodiment is one.

                                                 -8
[0054]     Angular Acceleration: aburr -Wo(R/Rburr)sin(wt).
[0055]     Peak Angular Acceleration: abur,(peak) = (nw)2 u.
[0056]     Peak Angular Jerk:    Ibur, (peak) = (nw) 3 g.
[0057]     Figure 12 illustrates a graph of angular displacement x, angular velocity v, and
angular acceleration a. At 15,000 rpm, the motor 86 completes one revolution every 0.004
seconds. As the curve x illustrates, the burr gear 74 completes one full oscillation during one
motor revolution.    Oscillation is rotation from center, away from center to one angular side,
rotation past center to another angular side, and back to center. The burr gear 74 also travels
± 1.25 radian (±71.60) per oscillation (143.2' total travel).
[0058]     Curve v shows that the peak angular velocity (VP = 1,963rad/sec = 18,750rpm)
occurs at top dead and bottom dead center, exactly in the middle of the burr gear 74 swing.
This is when the maximum amount of material is being removed from the material being cut.
The shuttle 96 then allows the burr gear 74 to decelerate to a velocity of zero as it approaches
maximum excursion, only to accelerate back through to maximum velocity on the return swing.
[0059]     The motion of the burr gear 74 is smooth, with no sudden or abrupt changes in
direction, velocity or acceleration. Although the motion of the depicted embodiment can be
described with formulas in terms of sine and cosine, the design could be embodied in such a
way that the motion of the burr gears 74 follows similarly looking harmonic curves that cannot
be conveniently described with formulas in terms of sine and cosine.
[0060]     Curve a illustrates that a peak angular acceleration of the spindle is less than five
million radians per second squared at fifteen-thousand oscillations per minute. By analyzing
the rate of change of acceleration, jerk can be determined as less than five billion radians per
second cubed at fifteen-thousand oscillations per minute.
[0061]     Although the motor speed is described as 15,000rpm, the motor speed may be within
a range of 5,000rpm to 40,000rpm according to one embodiment. The motor speed may be
within a range of 15,000rpm to 20,000rpm according to another embodiment.
[0062]     The transmission 84 in the tool assembly 30 causes the output torque at the burr
gear 74 to vary from the input torque of the motor 86. This variance can be expressed as a

                                                -9
Torque Ratio:
[0063]     XT  =       ; wherein Tburr is output torque applied to burr gear 74; and Tm is input
                   Tmm
torque supplied by the motor 86.
[0064]     In other words, the transmission 84 causes the output torque to the burr gear 74 to
be "XT times" the input torque from the motor 86 at any specified point in the displacement of
the burr gear 74. This factor is a mechanical advantage of the transmission 84. The
following analysis does not take into account inefficiencies (such as friction, air
resistance and other losses) that will impede the transmission of torque from the motor
86 to burr gear 74. However, steps have been taken to reduce such losses wherever
possible, such as the use of bearings to reduce friction.
[0065]     In general, Torque equals Force times Distance. The torque of the motor 86 acts on
the eccentric drive 88, which then exerts a force on the shuttle 96 via the roller 90. The forces
between the shuttle 96 and the roller 90 are equal and opposing, and in the direction
perpendicular to the shuttle channel 98. The motor torque can therefore be expressed as this
force is multiplied by its perpendicular distance from the eccentric drive 88:
[0066]     Tm, = FpR cos(O); wherein F equals F, which are forces acting between the roller 90
and the shuttle 96.
[0067]     When the shuttle 96 and the burr gear 74 approach a travel limit (as depicted in
Figure 6 for shuttle 68), the velocity of the shuttle 96 and the burr gear 74 is low compared to
the velocity of the eccentric drive 88. Since the eccentric drive 88 has to move a relatively
large angle in order to move the shuttle 96 and the burr gear 74, a relatively small amount, it
has a "mechanical advantage" with respect to torque. In other words, the eccentric drive 88 is
able to transfer much more torque to the burr gear 74 just when it is needed most - when the
burr gear 74 is moving its slowest and is the most likely to get stuck. The length of "R cos(O)"
decreases as the shuttle 96 nears its end of travel, and as its formula suggests, the Torque
Ratio increases.
[0068]     As the roller pushes on the shuttle 96, the shuttle 96 pushes on the burr gear 74 with
the same amount of force. This creates a torque on the burr gear 74 which can be expressed
as:

                                                    - 10
[0069]     Tburr = Fburr Rburr; wherein Fbur, equals F, which equals forces acting between
the burr gear 74 and the shuttle 96.         Rburr equals a pitch radius of the burr gear 74, which is
three millimeters for the depicted embodiments. Combining the above equations, the torque
on the burr gear 74 can be expressed as:
[0070]     Tb rr  = T,     Rb crr
                          R cos(O)
[0071]     Therefore, the Torque Ratio can be expressed as:
[0072]     Xt =    Rcos)
[0073]     Figure 13 illustrates a torque ratio of the burr gear 74. The minimum torque applied
to the burr gear 74 equals 0.80 times (or eighty percent of) the motor torque. This minimum
torque occurs at the midpoint of the travel of the burr gear 74, when its velocity is greatest. As
the burr gear angular velocity decreases toward zero, the transmitted torque increases
exponentially toward infinity (theoretically, it would never actually obtain infinity due to the
inefficiencies that have been ignored).
[0074]     This relationship between torque and velocity is well known. In general, the Torque
Ratio is inversely proportional to the Velocity Ratio.          For the embodiment of Figure 11, the
angular velocity of the burr gear 74 can be rewritten in terms of 0 (knowing that 0 = wt):
[0075]     Vburr = w(R/Rburr)COs((ot) becomes Vburr = w)(R/Rburr)COs(Q).
[0076]     Then the Velocity Ratio is:
[0077]     Xy  -     b"" -           , which is the inverse of the Torque Ratio:
                     60        Rburr
[0078]     X  7=  R cos 6
                  R cos(6)

[0079]     A dampening system may be provided in the tool assembly 30 to control vibration.
The dampening system may include a dampening material or system between the motor 52 or
transmission 54 and the housing 32 to minimize vibrations to the user. The dampening system
or material can be provided externally or internally on the housing 32.

[0080]      Figure 14 illustrates a bone, cartilage, and disk removal tool assembly 100 according
to another embodiment. The tool assembly 100 includes a motor 102 mounted in a housing
104.     The motor 102 drives a cam mechanism 106 for continuous rotation.              The cam
mechanism 106 has four distinct cam profiles 108, 110, 112, 114 stacked axially from the motor
102. Each of the cam profiles 108, 110, 112, 114 is illustrated schematically in Figures 15-18.
A follower mechanism 116 is mounted for rotation in the housing 104. The follower mechanism
116 has four follower profiles 118, 120, 122, 124 each for cooperating with one of the cam
profiles 108, 110, 112, 114, as also illustrated in Figures 15 to 18. A spindle 126 is provided in
the housing 104 with bearing support. The cam mechanism 106 and the follower mechanism
116 cooperate as a transmission 128 for converting one rotation of the cam mechanism into
two rotary oscillations of the follower mechanism 116.
[0081]      The electric motor 102 spins the cam mechanism 106 continually in one direction,
which is clockwise in Figures 15 -18. The cam profiles 108, 110, 112, 114 engage the follower
profiles 118, 120, 122, 124 at two contact points at all times. At one contact point, the cam
mechanism 106 pushes the follower mechanism 116 to rotate. At the other contact point, the
cam mechanism 106 prevents the follower mechanism 116 from over-rotating. The profiles
108, 110, 112, 114 on the cam mechanism 106 work together to cause the follower mechanism
116 to rotationally oscillate in two directions. For the depicted embodiment, each of the four
cam profiles 108, 110, 112, 114 consists of two symmetrical lobes, which causes the follower
mechanism 116 to make two complete oscillations (back and forth twice) for every complete
revolution of the motor. The cam mechanism 106 could also be designed asymmetrical, and/or
so that it causes the follower mechanism 116 to make any number of oscillations, such as one,
or more than tow, per motor revolution.
[0082]      In Figure 15, the second cam profile 110 contacts the second follower profile 120 for
preventing over-rotation of the follower mechanism 116, while the fourth cam profile 114 drives
the fourth follower profile 124. In Figure 16, the second cam profile 110 contacts the second
follower profile 120 for driving the follower mechanism 116, while the third cam profile 112
engages the third follower profile 122 to prevent over-rotation of the follower mechanism. In
Figure 17, the first cam profile 108 contacts the first follower profile 118 for preventing over
rotation of the follower mechanism, while the third cam profile 112 drives the third follower
profile, thereby reversing directions. In Figure 18, the first cam profile 108 contacts the first
follower profile to prevent over-rotation of the follower mechanism 116, while the fourth cam
profile 114 drives the fourth follower profile 124. The process is repeated at Figure 15.

[0083]     The cam profiles 108, 110, 112, 114 cause the angular displacement, velocity and
acceleration of the follower mechanism 116 to follow sinusoidal wave patterns. The motion
can be described:
[0084]     Angular Displacement:       xbur, = asin(not); wherein n equals the number of full
oscillations per motor revolution, which is two for the depicted embodiment. o- equals half of
the full oscillation range (forty-five degrees or Tr/4radian).
[0085]     Angular Velocity: V1brr = noa cos(not).
[0086]     Peak Angular Velocity: vb,,r,(peak) = nco.
[0087]     Angular Acceleration: a burr -(n)    2a  sin(not).
[0088]     Peak Angular Acceleration: aburr(peak) = (no)2 g.
[0089]     Peak Angular Jerk: Ibur,(peak) = (no)3cr.
[0090]     Figure 19 illustrates these relationships. At 15,000rpm, the motor 102 completes
one revolution every 0.004 seconds.           Displacement curve x illustrates that the follower
mechanism 116 completes two full oscillations during one motor revolution.             The follower
mechanism 116 also travels ±0.79 radian (±45 degrees) per oscillation (ninety degrees total
travel.) Velocity curve v illustrates that the peak angular velocity to be (Vp = 2,467rad/sec =
23,562rpm), which is higher than the prior embodiment. The peak angular velocity occurs in
the middle of the oscillation, when the maximum amount of material is being removed from the
material being cut. The motion of the follower mechanism 116 is smooth, with no sudden or
abrupt changes in direction, velocity, or acceleration.        Similarly, although the motion of the
current design can be described with formulas in terms of sine and cosine, the design could be
changed in such a way that that the motion of the following mechanism 116 follows similarly
looking harmonic curves that cannon be conveniently described with formulas in terms of since
and cosine.
[0091]     Curve a illustrates that a peak angular acceleration of the spindle is less than eight
million radians per second squared at thirty-thousand oscillations per minute. By analyzing the
rate of change of acceleration, jerk can be determined as less than twenty-give billion radians
per second cubed at thirty-thousand oscillations per minute.

                                               - 13
[0092]    Since the cam mechanism 106 is attached directly to the motor 102, the torque on
the cam mechanism 106 is equal to the torque of the motor 102.               This torque can be
expressed as a force acting at a perpendicular distance from the center of the cam mechanism
106.   The following analysis does not take into account inefficiencies (such as friction, air
resistance and other losses) that will impede the transmission of torque from the motor 102 to
the spindle 126. However, steps have been taken to reduce such losses wherever possible,
such as the use of bearings to reduce friction.
[0093]    Tm = FLc cos(Ac); wherein F equals force of cam mechanism 106 acting on a cam
follower 108, 110, 112, 114. L, equals a length of cam contact point from center. Ae equals a
push angle of cam profile, which is an angle normal from the contact point to the center.
[0094]    In the case of the follower mechanism 116, the torque on the follower mechanism
116 is equal to the torque on the burr or cutting tool driven by the spindle 126, and can be
expressed as:
[0095]    Tbur, = FfLf cos(Af); wherein Ff equals a force of follower acting on cam; Lf equals
a length of follower contact to center; and Af equals push angle of follower profile, which is an
angle normal form the contact point to the center.
[0096]    The maximum amount of torque that can be transmitted to the spindle 126 occurs
during a steady state situation, such as if the spindle 126 becomes stuck. In such a situation,
the forces acting between the cam mechanism 106 and the follower mechanism 116 are equal
and opposing, and in a line perpendicular to a line that is tangent to the point of contact:
[0097]    F = Ff
[0098]    Combining the above equations, the torque on the spindle 126 or cutting tool burr
can be expressed as:
                         LICOS(Af)
[0099]    Tbur, = Tm     L
                         LcCos(Ac)
[00100]   Therefore, for this embodiment, the Torque Ratio can be expressed as:
                 LfCOS(Af)
[00101]   XT     LcCOS(AC)

                                               - 14
[00102]    When the follower mechanism 116 nears its end of travel, the velocity of the follower
mechanism 116 is low compared to the velocity of the cam mechanism.              Since the cam
mechanism 106 has to move a relatively large angle in order to move the follower mechanism
116 a relatively small angle, it has a "mechanical advantage" with respect to torque. In other
words, the cam mechanism 106 is able to transfer much more torque to the follower
mechanism 116 just when it is needed most - when the follower mechanism 116 is moving its
slowest and is the most likely to get stuck.        As the formula suggests, the Torque Ratio
increases as the length of "Lf cos(Af)" increases, and the length "Le cos(Ac)" decreases.
[00103]    The Torque Ratio can also be computed by taking the inverse of the Velocity Ratio.
The angular velocity of the spindle 126 or output burr can be rewriting in terms of 0 (knowing
that 0 = wt):
[00104]    Vbur, = ncou cos(nwt) becomes Vbaurr = nou cos(nO).
[00105]    Then the Velocity Ratio is:
[00106]    XT =        = na cos(nO).
[00107]    The Torque Ratio, being the inverse of the Velocity Ratio, becomes:
[00108]    XT =     1     c 1s
[00109]    Because this formula for the Torque Ratio is different from the earlier formula, there
are two formulas for computing the Torque Ratio.             The first formula requires taking
measurements of Lf, L, Af and Ac at the desired locations on the cam, since these values
change all along the cam profiles. The second formula, however, can be calculated for all
values of 0. Both methods are plotted in Figure 20, which shows agreement between the two
formulas.
[00110]    The minimum torque applied to the spindle 126 equals 0.64 times (of sixty-four
percent of) the motor torque. This minimum torque occurs at the midpoint of the spindle travel,
when its velocity is greatest. The torque increases exponentially at the ends of the spindle
travel, as the spindle velocity approaches zero. Oscillating twice per motor revolution causes
the peak velocity to increase, but causes the minimum Torque Ratio to decrease, company to
oscillating only once per motor revolution at the same motor speed.

[00111]     Figures 21 and 22 illustrate the tool assembly 30 with another front portion 130
interchangeably attached to the housing. The front housing portion 130 includes an output
driver head 132 for driving pedicle screws 134 into a spine as illustrated in Figure 22. An
aperture 136 may extend through the front housing 130 for receipt of a wire guide 138 that
may be utilized for alignment of the screw 134. Figure 23 illustrates a transmission 140 with a
first coupling configuration 142 for engagement with one driven by the motor 52 in the housing
32. The coupling configuration 142 drives a worm gear 144, which drives a reduction gear
146, and consequently, the drive head 132.

for various motor speeds to illustrate the versatility of the transmissions.
