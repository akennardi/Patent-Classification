CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This is a United States Non-Provisional patent application, which is a Continuation-In-part
claiming the benefit of U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 14/494,629 filed on 24 Sep.
2014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
FIELD OF INVENTION
[0002] This invention relates to a clearinghouse system for use with electronic vouchers issued by casino
systems via electronic gaming machines (EGMs).
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003] Voucher tickets are utilized in the gaming industry for transactions. The voucher tickets include
information required to complete secured transactions, including coded data provided in any suitable
format, such as barcodes. Typically, a player will cash out after completing the gaming play, and the
gaming machine will print a voucher ticket. The voucher ticket is identified by a voucher ID that is issued
and managed by the casino voucher ticket system. The voucher ID is printed in a barcode and is
associated with a printed validation code printed on the voucher ticket. The voucher ticket received by
the player can be inserted into a second gaming machine to credit the machine or can be inserted into a
payment kiosk to receive cash that is equivalent to the value of the printed voucher ticket.
[0004] Each property issues its own proprietary form of these voucher tickets. Therefore, a gaming
patron playing games at a variety of casino properties will be issued voucher tickets from each of the
variety of properties; each voucher ticket is property-specific so cannot be used at another property.
The gaming patron must keep track of these numerous voucher tickets from different properties.
[0005] As previously mentioned, the voucher tickets are limited for use with one gaming company, and
generally, limited for use with one specific facility. To ensure security, the voucher tickets are commonly
encoded to a financial system that is proprietary to the gaming facility. The proprietary encoding is one
method, which restricts the use of the voucher ticket to the associated issuing gaming facility. When the
user desires to leave one gaming facility to play at a different gaming facility, this constraint imposes a
requirement upon the user to cash in the voucher ticket prior to leaving the current gaming facility.
[0006] An object of the present invention is to provide a clearinghouse to manage vouchers from
multiple properties. A multi-property clearinghouse has been proposed that connects the back end
voucher servers from different properties. This proposal provides a solution to the user for converting a
voucher ticket issued by a first gaming facility to a voucher ticket that would be accepted for use at a
second gaming facility. However, this solution would require the cooperation of the multiple properties
and of gaming regulators. Another object of the present invention is to solve communication trouble
                                                        1

between a gaming machine and an electronic money management system located at a distance
therefrom in a method of operating the gaming machine and managing a player's available playing
credit.

 BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
 [0064] A basic concept of an electronic payment system 99, according to the present invention, is
 presented in FIG. 1 with details of a portion of the components being presented in FIG. 2. The exemplary
electronic payment system 99 comprises a mobile terminal 190 for emitting and/or receiving a remotely
operable signal that may include information on a specific or unique account number or a debit card
number associated with a financial database 142. The unique account number or a debit card number
 identifies an account owned by a holder thereof. The electronic payment system 99 also comprises a
communications device 150 provided in signal communication with an automated machine 100 for
 receiving a remotely operable signal emitted from the mobile terminal 190. The communications device
 150 can also receive a monetary signal indicative of a transaction fee necessary to drive the automated
 machine 100 simultaneously with, before, or after receiving the remotely operable signal. When the
remotely operable signal contains a monetary signal, the communications device 150 can receive the
encoded information respective to account number and the monetary signal contained in the remotely
operable signal transmitted from the mobile terminal 190. Alternatively, the monetary signal can be
 produced and transmitted to the communications device 150 by another signal input device such as an
entry device 182, which will be described below. The holder of the financial account usually is a same
 individual that owns the mobile terminal 190, however, the holder might be a different person from the
owner of the mobile terminal 190. The mobile terminal 190 can be any portable computing device
comprising a wired or wireless communication system compatible with the communication system and
respective protocol of the communications device 150.
 [0065] Then, the communications device 150 may retrieve the holder's account number from the
financial database 142 and the monetary signal if they are contained in the remotely operable signal.
The electronic payment system 99 may also comprise an automatic payment device 140 linked to the
financial database 142 for receiving a transmitted signal from the communications device 150, the
holder's account number signal from the financial database 142 and the monetary signal of the
transaction fee and for withdrawing an amount of transaction fee from the correct holder's account at
the financial database 142 to produce an authorization signal, wherein the authorization signal is only
provided in a condition where the received account number is correct and the amount of transaction fee
is within a deposit balance of the account. Upon receipt of the authorization signal, the communications
device 150 produces a monetary signal to the automated machine 100 to drive it at the amount
equivalent to a value of received monetary signal.
 [0066] The mobile terminal 190 may emit a remotely operable signal, such as a radio or other wireless
signal; an optical beam signal of infrared, ultraviolet or visible ray; and the like, to interact with the
remotely operable signal by communications device 150. The mobile terminal 190 and communications
device 150 are electrically connected to each other through a wired or a wireless mutual communication
                                                       7

interface for radio or optical connection. The mobile terminal 190 also may include a cellular phone, a
smart phone utilizing wireless application protocol (WAP), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a portable
computer, a hand held computer for electronic payment through the debit or prepaid card transaction
system, or the like. A debit card transaction system may include J-Debit, VISA Debit and Debit Master.
Prepaid card transaction systems may include Eddy, Suica, PASMO, nanaco, and WAON. The
aforementioned systems and devices are exemplary and the mobile terminal 190 may comprise ones for
other electronic payment systems 99 or devices. Also, the mobile terminal 190 may be an electronic
computer terminal or a smart card, chip card, or integrated circuit card (commonly referred to as an IC
card) that incorporates a built-in non-contact IC chip such as for example FeliCa (Registered Mark),
MIFARE (Registered Mark) or NFC (Near Field Communication) chips.
[0067] The automatic payment device 140 can additionally incorporate elements for reading and
generating voucher tickets 310, 410 (FIG. 3). The voucher tickets 310, 410 can be in any suitable form
factor, including a paper voucher ticket 310 and an electronic voucher ticket 410. The information
associated with the voucher ticket 310, 410 would be obtained using elements respective to the form
factor of the voucher ticket 310, 410. For example, the automatic payment device 140 would include a
scanner for reading a paper voucher ticket 310 and/or a camera for reading an image displayed upon an
electronic voucher ticket 410. An additional option would be the use of the mobile terminal 190 to
wirelessly communicate with a portable computing device 400 (FIG. 3) to provide a wireless
communication interface therebetween to obtain data associated with the electronic voucher ticket
410.
[0068] Details of the mobile terminal 190 are presented in FIG. 3. The mobile terminal 190 comprises a
digital storage device 193 such as an integrated digital storage media, a removable digital storage, or
both. The digital storage device 193 can be provided in any suitable format, including a memory card,
flash memory, and the like removably insertable or integrated within a cellular phone for storing code
information that includes an account number of a holder's debit or prepaid card, PIN (Personal
Identification Number) and/or ID (identification) number, a user entry device 194 such as a physical
numerical keypad, a physical keyboard, a graphical user interface generated numerical keypad or alpha
numeric keypad in cellular phone for inputting an amount of a transaction fee signal such as gaming fees
into digital storage device 193, a Central Processing Unit (CPU) 192 electrically connected to all
electronic circuits and electronic functional systems for preparing a remotely operable signal inclusive of
the code information stored from digital storage device 193, the wireless transmitting system 196 for
transmitting remotely operable signal from CPU 192 to communications device 150, the wireless signal
receiving system 198 for receiving a deal signal from the communications device 150 when
communications device 150 transmits to mobile terminal 190 the deal signal produced by
communications device 150, and a portable power supply (such as a battery, super capacitor, and the
like), (not shown) for supplying electric power to each electrically operated device or circuit to perform
the various reading, writing, transmitting and receiving functions in mobile terminal 190. The digital
storage device 193 does not need to store the code information for enhancement in security as any
code signals may be produced by user entry device 194 and transmitted outside through wireless
transmitting system 196. A single convertible transceiver circuit can be used for both the transmission
                                                      8

and reception functions 196, 198. The CPU 192 can prepare the remotely operable signal that contains a
transaction fee signal and a code signal inclusive of account number of debit or prepaid card, a PIN
(Personal Identification Number) and/or an ID (identification) number.
[0069] Returning to FIG. 1, there are a variety of automated machines for receiving transaction fee
signal from the communications device 150, wherein the automated machines may include automated
teller machines (ATM), vending machines, money exchangers, gaming machines, or other money
operated equipment or apparatus. The present invention adopts a gaming or automated machine 100 as
an example of automated machines, however, it would be apparent to ordinary skill in the art that the
electronic payment system 99 of the present invention can also apply to drive other financially driven,
automated machines in a similar way.
[0070] The communications device 150 and automatic payment device 140 are electrically linked to
each other through a wired, a wireless connection, an Intranet connection, an Internet protocol, or any
combination thereof. The automatic payment device 140 and the financial database 142, such as
banking systems are linked to each other through a wired, a wireless connection, an Intranet
connection, an Internet protocol, or any combination thereof. In embodiments of the present invention,
the communications device 150 can be disposed within, outside of, or adjacent to the gaming or
automated machine 100 so far as users may operate the mobile terminal 190 to access communications
device 150 in the vicinity of or at a location not too distant from the gaming or automated machine 100.
Both the communications device 150 and the automatic payment device 140 may be disposed within or
outside of the gaming or automated machine 100 for any spatial reason, so far as users may easily
access the gaming or automated machine 100 and operate the communications device 150. For a similar
reason, one of the communications device 150 and the automatic payment device 140 can be disposed
within or outside of gaming or automated machine 100 so far as they may be provided in signal
communication with one another.
[0071] The communications device 150 comprises a signal processor 154 connected to automated
machine 100 for retrieving and producing an account number that identifies a holder of the account at
financial database 142 and if necessary holder's PIN and/or ID numbers and monetary signals from
remotely operable signal received from mobile terminal 190, and a communications interface 152 for
intervening telecommunication between mobile terminal 190 and signal processor 154.
[0072] A typical example of the automated machine applied to a schematically depicted gaming or
automated machine 100 is illustrated in FIG. 2. The gaming or automated machine 100 comprises a bill
acceptor 130, a drive device 120 connected to the communications device 150, and to gaming hardware
110 and a printer 160 for recording game information on a recording medium. The bill acceptor 130
validates a bill inserted therein from outside to produce a bill monetary signal to drive device 120 as a
monetary signal of transaction fee when bill acceptor 130 decides that the inserted bill is genuine. The
drive device 120 generates drive signals of the amount equivalent to a value of received monetary signal
to present games when receiving each monetary signal from the bill acceptor 130. The drive signals are
forwarded to the gaming hardware 110. The printer 160 prints onto a recording medium, data of the
                                                       9

game information, money amount to be refunded and management codes to issue the recording
medium as a coupon.
[0073] The bill acceptor 130 comprises an inlet sensor 134 for producing a detection signal when a bill is
inserted into bill acceptor 130, a bill sensor 135 for producing a characteristic signal inclusive of an
optical or magnetic signal when a bill is moved along bill sensor 135, a conveyor (not shown) for
transporting a bill along a passageway 132 in bill acceptor 130 and a control device 136 for receiving
detection signal from inlet sensor 134 and characteristic signal from bill sensor 135 to produce drive
signals to conveyor when control device 136 considers the bill as being genuine. Specifically, control
device 136 may verify whether or not the bill is genuine and what kind of denomination the bill has, and
when it decides that the bill is genuine, the control device 136 generates a denomination signal of the
bill as a digital monetary signal, wherein the signal is communicated to the drive device 120. On the
other hand, the control device 136 also receives from the communications device 150, the monetary
signal sent from the mobile terminal 190, and so, transmits to the drive device 120 either of the
monetary signals that bill acceptor 130 produces and relays from the communications device 150. The
control device 136 is provided in electrical communication to a converter 156 of the communications
device 150 for converting the denomination signal from the signal processor 154 into a serial
denomination signal and transmitting the serial denomination signal to the control device 136 of the bill
acceptor 130. The control device 136 has a memory area for storing a specific code, such as an
electronic serial number, identifying the specific gaming or automated machine 100 and also storing
both monetary signals that the bill acceptor 130 produces and relays from the communications device
150. Otherwise, the present invention also contemplates that the bill acceptor 130 can validate valuable
coupon tickets, scrip, tender, tokens or substitutes of bills.
[0074] The bill acceptor 130 validates a bill inserted from outside to produce a monetary signal
representative of the valuation of the bill to the drive device 120 when the bill acceptor 130 determines
the value of the inserted bill and that the inserted bill is genuine. The bill acceptor 130 also receives a
monetary signal contained in the remotely operable signal from the signal processor 154 through the
converter 156 of the communications device 150, and forwards the monetary signal to the drive device
120. Then, the drive device 120 receives either of the monetary signals from the bill acceptor 130 to
generate to the gaming hardware 110 the drive signals having the amount equivalent to a value of
either of the received monetary signal(s) to allow the gaming hardware 110 to conduct a game. Each of
monetary signals may indicate a financial value corresponding to one or more denominations of bills
optically or magnetically readable by the bill acceptor 130. In other words, the financial value or money
amount to be transmitted may be selected from amounts in denominations of bills readable by the bill
acceptor 130. By way of example, when the bill acceptor 130 can selectively validate bills of five kinds,
i.e. one-dollar, five-dollar, ten-dollar, twenty-dollar or one hundred-dollar bills, it would be preferable to
send signals of the amount selected from one-dollar, five-dollar, ten-dollar, twenty-dollar or one
hundred-dollar bill from the mobile terminal 190 to the communications device 150.
[0075] The drive device 120 can generate to the gaming hardware 110, drive signals having the amount
equivalent to a value of the received monetary signal when receiving the monetary signal through the
                                                        10

bill acceptor 130. Otherwise, the communications device 150 may forward the monetary signal of the
transaction fee directly to the drive device 120 without the bill acceptor 130 so that the drive device 120
may produce to the gaming hardware 110 the respective drive signals having the amount equivalent to
the amount of transaction fee to drive the gaming hardware 110 by drive signals from the drive device
120. This allows users to select either a cash payment or a cashless electronic payment for gaming in
amusement halls or casinos.
[0076] The bill acceptor 130 also comprises a stacker 139 for accommodating bills considered genuine
by the control device 136, and a memory device 138 in electrical communication with the control device
136 and attached to the stacker 139 for storing monetary or denomination signals, account number
signals, PIN and ID number signals and specific code signal identifying the gaming or automated machine
100 forwarded from the control device 136. The control device 136 distinctively stores in the memory
area both monetary signals produced by the control device 136 and transmitted from the
communications device 150. The memory device 138 distinctively stores both monetary signals
transmitted from both the control device 136 and the communications device 150, account number
signals, PIN and ID number signals and specific code signal identifying the gaming or automated machine
100; all forwarded from the control device 136. The bill acceptor 130 is removably attached to the
gaming or automated machine 100 and also the stacker 139 is removably attached to the bill acceptor
130 to easily take out and collect bills accumulated within the stacker 139. Accordingly, when the bills
accumulated within the stacker 139 are to be collected, the bill acceptor 130 is detached from gaming or
automated machine 100 and then the stacker 139 is removed from the bill acceptor 130.
[0077] In operation, when the mobile terminal 190 moves closer to the communications device 150, the
mobile terminal 190 emits a radio signal inclusive of the account number signal of financial database 142
identifying a holder of the account and transaction fee signal to be paid for operation of gaming or
automated machine 100. Subsequently, the communications device 150 receives a radio signal to
retrieve the holder's account number embedded within the radio signal and also receive a monetary
signal indicative of the transaction fee that may be involved in the radio signal. Alternatively, the
communications device 150 may be connected to an entry device 182 for inputting a monetary signal of
a transaction fee for the gaming or automated machine 100 to transmit monetary signal from the entry
device 182 to the communications device 150. Then, the automatic payment device 140 can receive
monetary signal from the entry device 182 through the communications device 150 simultaneously
with, before, or after receiving the radio signal from the mobile terminal 190. Then, just like through an
on-line debit or prepaid card system, the automatic payment device 140 can withdraw the financial
equivalent of the transaction fee from the holder's account at the financial database 142 when the
amount of transaction fee is within a deposit balance of the holder's account. Then, the automatic
payment device 140 produces an authorization signal to the communications device 150 that then sends
the monetary signal to the gaming or automated machine 100 to drive it.
[0078] In another embodiment of the present invention, remotely operable signal may include PIN
and/or ID numbers to more strictly identify the holder in addition to the holder's account number of the
mobile terminal 190 to increase security against unauthorized access to the holder's account. When the
                                                      11

mobile terminal 190 emits a radio signal inclusive of account number and PIN and/or ID number, the
communications device 150 can receive the radio signal, retrieve or decipher the account number, the
PIN and/or ID numbers from the radio signal and withdraw the amount of transaction fee from the
holder's account at the financial database 142 when PIN and/or ID numbers correspond to one or ones
of pass-codes or secret numbers stored within the financial database 142. In lieu of the PIN and/or ID
number included in radio signal, the entry device 182 can be used to produce the PIN and/or ID number
signals from the entry device 182 connected to the communications device 150 to provide them to the
automatic payment device 140 through the communications device 150 so that the automatic payment
device 140 can withdraw the amount of transaction fee from the holder's account at the financial
database 142 when the PIN and/or ID numbers correspond to one or ones of pass-codes or secret
numbers at financial database 142.
[0079] In a further embodiment of the instant invention, the communications device 150 can be
connected to a visual and/or acoustic display device 180. When communications device 150 receives an
authorization signal from the automatic payment device 140, the communications device 150 produces
and transmits a deal signal to the mobile terminal 190 and/or to the display device 180 to exhibit the
deal signal thereon. On another aspect, when the communications device 150 fails to retrieve the
account number embedded within the radio signal or retrieves an incorrect account number, the
automatic payment device 140 produces an unauthorized signal to the communications device 150 that,
then produces and forwards a no-deal signal to the mobile terminal 190 and/or to display device 180 for
exhibition of no-deal signal.
[0080] For example, when the drive device 120 has completed its program-controlled operation or when
a force-quit button 184 is actuated to terminate the game, the drive device 120 generates a refund
money signal of an unspent remaining financial balance, award, prize, jackpot, or the like obtained from
the game if any. The drive device 120 may transmit a refund money signal and a management code
signal to the printer 160 and also to the signal processor 154 of the communications device 150 to store
the financial value to be refunded in the signal processor 154. The signal processor 154 may also
transmit the refund money signal to the wireless signal receiving system 198 of the mobile terminal 190
through the communications interface 152 so that the mobile terminal 190 may receive and write the
refund money signal in the digital storage device 193 of the mobile terminal 190 to add the financial
value in the digital storage device 193. The printer 160 may record data as directed by the refund money
signal and the necessary management code signals from the drive device 120 on the recording medium
or media and prepares a coupon of the recording media for dispensation of the coupon from printer
160. In this way, a mutual intercommunication system may be established to transport and receive
electronic signals between the mobile terminal 190 and the signal processor 154 through wired, wireless
or radio, optical connection, or the like. Specifically, the communications interface 152 may receive the
remotely operable signal from the mobile terminal 190, and transmit it to the signal processor 154 that
may receive the remotely operable signal from the communications interface 152. The signal processor
154 can also retrieve and produce signals of the account number or debit card number for identifying
the account owner or holder and the holder's PIN and/or ID number and monetary signals or a
denomination signal contained in the remotely operable signal and, can then, send the information to
                                                       12

the automatic payment device 140.
[0081] After or before bills are extracted from the stacker 139, it is put on a readout device 170 as
shown in FIG. 3, but the memory device 138 attached to the stacker 139 is retained in the non-contact
condition away from the readout device 170 that may be operated to retrieve the following four kinds
of information stored in the memory device 138:
(i) Total amount and total number of bills stowed in stacker 139;
(ii) All denomination signals of the bills;
(iii) All account numbers that identify account holders involved; and
(iv) The specific code signal identifying gaming or automated machine 100 from which the stacker 139
has been removed.
[0086] The information readout device 170 has retrieved from the memory device 138 is compared with
the information of the bills removed from the stacker 139 and with the information from the
communications device 150 to inspect whether or not they match.
[0087] In still another embodiment, the gaming or automated machine 100 can comprise an entry
device made up of a plurality of choice switches, namely an entry device 182 such as image switches
(commonly referred to as soft switches or a graphical user interface) on a touch display screen or made
up of mechanical selector switches to be chosen to determine a denomination of bills for payment for
games so that one or more of choice switches may be selected to determine one or more of different
charge amounts to be paid for gaming to transmit one or more charge or denomination signals to signal
processor 154 of communications device 150. On the other hand, when mobile terminal 190 transmits
to the communications device 150 remotely operable signal including holder's account number signal,
the communications interface 152 may receive the account number signal from the mobile terminal
190, and the signal processor 154 may receive a chosen charge signal from the entry device 182 and the
holder's account number signal transmitted from the mobile terminal 190.
[0088] In operation of the gaming or automated machine 100, a user may select either cash or
electronic payment as a method for payment for playing games with the gaming or automated machine
100. In order to select the electronic payment option, he or she may operate the user entry device 194
of the mobile terminal 190 to input the money amount of the gaming fees into the Central Processing
Unit (CPU) 192 that may synthesize a remotely operable signal by placing on a carrier wave the financial
value of the gaming fees and the account number signal stored in the digital storage device 193 and
then transmit remotely the operable signal to the communications device 150 through the wireless
transmitting system 196. In this way, the user may move closer to the gaming or automated machine
100 and allow the mobile terminal 190 to lightly touch the communications interface 152 while making
the mobile terminal 190 produce and transmit the remotely operable signal from the mobile terminal
190.
[0089] A first financial process flow diagram 200 is presented in FIG. 3. The financial process flow
diagram 200 presents a general interaction between contributing elements utilizing an electronic
                                                     13

voucher ticket (eV/T in the diagrams) 310, 410 (FIG. 6) for financial processing in conjunction with an
electronic gaming machine 100. The various contributing elements include the electronic gaming
machine 100, a casino host server 146, at least one printer 160, a bill validator 130 (or other electronic
voucher ticket reader), a near field communications device 150, and a mobile wallet server 144. The
process initializes with the user 199 submitting a request for tendering payment for credits for use in
conjunction with the electronic gaming machine 100. The user 199 enters an amount and necessary
information for authorization for the transaction using an application provided on a Smartphone 400
(step 201). The data is received by wireless communication between the smartphone 400 and the near
field communicator 150 as indicated by step 201. The near field communicator 150 forwards the
information to the bill validator 130 as referenced in step 202. The bill validator 130 completes a credit
check or any other associated transaction validation process (step 203). The system utilizes technology
referred to as Network Hub Link (NHL) 158 to communicate with and complete transactions with the
mobile wallet server 144. The communication process completes a balance check for available funds and
provides feedback to the bill validator 130 as indicated by steps 204 and 205. During this process, an
electronic or electronic voucher ticket (eV/T) 410 is issued. In parallel, the bill validator 130
communicates the outcome of the request (accepted or denied) to the user 199 (step 206). Should the
user desire to begin play on the automated machine 100, the user 199 enters the electronic voucher
ticket 410 into the bill validator 130 associated with the automated machine 100 (step 207). The
electronic voucher ticket 410 can be read by the bill validator 130 using any suitable technology
associated with the form factor of the electronic voucher ticket 410, including a camera to view an
electronic voucher ticket 410 displayed upon a smartphone display 404, an near field communicator 150
to read wirelessly transfer information from the smartphone 400, and the like. The automated machine
100 digitally conveys the transaction to the gaming facility host server 146 (step 208). The gaming
facility host server 146 in turn, provides feedback to the automated machine 100 on whether the
electronic voucher ticket 410 is accepted or rejected (step 209). In a condition where the electronic
voucher ticket 410 is accepted, credit is applied to the automated machine 100 and the user 199 begins
play thereon (step 210).
[0090] A first alternative process for utilizing mobile wallet is presented in an alternative financial
process flow diagram 220 is presented in FIG. 4. The financial process flow diagram 220 presents a
general interaction between contributing elements utilizing the electronic voucher ticket (eV/T in the
diagrams) 310, 410 (FIG. 6) for financial processing in conjunction with the electronic gaming machine
100. The various contributing elements include those previously described in FIG. 3, excluding the as
Network Hub Link (NHL) 158. The process initializes with the user 199 submitting a request for tendering
payment for issuance of credits onto the electronic voucher ticket 410 (step 221). The user 199 enters
an amount and necessary information for authorization for the transaction using an application
provided on the smartphone 400. The data is received by the mobile wallet server 144 using wireless
communication between the smartphone 400 and the mobile wallet server 144. The mobile wallet
server 144 issues and forwards the electronic voucher ticket 410 to the Smartphone 400 (step 222).
Upon request by the user, the smartphone 400 communicates information associated with the
electronic voucher ticket 410 to the bill validator 130 via the near field communications device 150 (step
223). The bill validator 130 can optionally transfer a request to print a paper voucher ticket 310 (FIG. 6)
                                                       14

to the printer 160 (step 224). The paper voucher ticket 310 is dispensed and provided to the user 199
(step 225). The user 199 enters either the paper voucher ticket 310 or the electronic voucher ticket 410
into the bill validator 130 for use with an associated automated machine 100 (step 226). The bill
validator 130 forwards information directly or indirectly to the gaming facility host server 446 (steps 227
and 228). The gaming facility host server 446 either confirms or rejects a validation of the electronic
voucher ticket 410 and reports the validation status (either approved or rejected) to the automated
machine 100 (step 229). In a condition where the electronic voucher ticket 310, 410 is accepted, credit is
applied to the automated machine 100 and the user 199 begins play thereon (step 230).
[0091] The play can conclude by either a depletion of credits pending in the automated machine 100 or
at a request submitted by the user 199. An exemplary electronic voucher ticket (eV/T) cash out process
flow diagram 240 is presented in FIG. 5. The financial process flow diagram 240 presents a general
interaction between contributing elements for cashing out after play on the automated machine 100.
The various contributing elements include those previously described in FIG. 3, wherein the leap
forward gaming 158 and the smartphone 400 can be used interchangeably. The process initializes with
the user 199 submitting a request for issuance of credits onto the electronic voucher ticket 410 (step
241). The request is entered using an application on the smartphone 400 via a communication with the
near field communications device 150 (step 242). The near field communications device 150 forwards
the information via a digital communication link with the bill validator 130 (step 243). The bill validator
130 forwards the information directly or indirectly to the gaming facility host server 446 (steps 244 and
245). The gaming facility host server 446, in conjunction with the automated machine 100, tallies any
tendered balance, concludes play of the game, and issues a digital electronic voucher ticket 410 (step
246). The new electronic voucher ticket 410 is forwarded to the near field communications device 150
(step 247). The new electronic voucher ticket 410 is transferred to the smartphone 400 using near field
communication protocol (step 248).
[0092] Automated machines 100 can utilize voucher tickets 310, 410 in conjunction with a financial
account server 512 associated with a casino 510 to control and communicate a financial value while a
player is within a casino 510 as illustrated in an exemplary schematic diagram presented in FIG. 3. The
voucher ticket can be provided as a paper voucher ticket 310 or an electronic voucher ticket 410.
[0093] Each voucher ticket 310, 410 would include a computer legible value reference 332, wherein the
computer legible value reference 332 can be in any computer readable format, including a barcode, a
Quick Read or QR code (as illustrated), and the like. The computer readable value reference 332 is
preferably encoded using a protocol that is specific to the respective casino 510. For ease of use, it is
desirable that each voucher ticket 310, 410 includes a human legible value reference 330. The human
legible value reference 330 would include a human legible financial value of the voucher ticket 310, 410.
Each voucher ticket 310, 410 can include additional information suitable for the respective application.
The additional information can include a casino identifier 320, a voucher ticket issue date 326 and a
voucher ticket expiration date 328. The voucher ticket expiration date 328 is set by a predetermined
time period from the voucher ticket issue date 326. The voucher ticket issue date 326 and/or the
voucher ticket expiration date 328 is preferably recorded on a voucher ticket database server 512, 522,
                                                      15

532. The paper voucher ticket 310 includes printing applied upon one or both surfaces of a paper
voucher ticket substrate 312. The paper voucher ticket 310 can additionally include a master ticket
identifier 322 and/or a local ticket identifier 324 for security purposes.
[0094] The paper voucher ticket 310 can include a master ticket identifier 322 and/or a local ticket
identifier 324, wherein the master ticket identifier 322 is essentially a unique serial code (numeric,
alphabetic, or alpha-numeric) utilized in identifying the validity of the paper voucher ticket 310 and the
local ticket identifier 324 is a secondary validation code. The local ticket identifier 324 is another
identification reference used in conjunction with the paper voucher ticket 310 and assigned to one
voucher ticket master identification reference. More specifically, the master and local identification
reference has a one-to-one association. The local ticket identifier 324 is assigned by the electronic
money management system 512, and used in conjunction with the equipment described herein, is not
used at the casino voucher ticket server 512. Because the master identification reference can be
redeemable for cash, it is desired to conceal the master identification reference on a smartphone
display 404 of a PC or smartphone 400. A local identification reference 324 is employed for the user of
the system. The master identification reference 324 is only used when certain messages about the
voucher ticket 310, 410 should be sent or received between the voucher ticket server 512 in the casino
510 and the system.
[0095] The electronic voucher ticket 410 can be communicated to the smartphone 400 by a wired or
wireless communication interface. For reference, the smartphone 400 can comprise common elements
associated with a smartphone, a tablet, or any other suitable portable computing device. These
elements can include a smartphone display 404 carried by a smartphone housing 402, wherein the
smartphone display 404 can be a standard display or more desirably, a touch screen display enabling
tactile inputs by the user. The smartphone display 404 presents images from a digital image file. The
digital image file would include information to store and display the electronic voucher ticket 410. The
elements of the smartphone 400 additionally include a microphone 406 and a speaker 408 for voice
communication. At least one Smartphone mechanical user control interface 405 is included providing
alternative tactile inputs respective to the smartphone display 404. Advanced portable computing
devices include a camera 409 enabling acquisition and storage of digital images. The electronic voucher
ticket 410 includes a majority of the same features as the paper voucher ticket 310, wherein like
elements of the electronic voucher ticket 410 and the paper voucher ticket 310 are numbered the same
except preceded by the numeral '4'. The paper voucher ticket 310 is generated by a printing process.
The electronic voucher ticket 410 is communicated to the smartphone 400 by any suitable, preferably
secure digital data communication protocol. Master information respective to the value and status of
the voucher tickets 310, 410 are stored on the respective casino voucher ticket database server 512.
[0096] An exemplary e-money or voucher ticket management system 580 is presented in a schematic
diagram illustrated in FIG. 7. The casino voucher ticket database server 512 can be organized each
player's e-money account 582. Each player's e-money account 582 can be shared across or distributed
into each of a plurality of player's cards 590, 592, 594, 596.
                                                       16

[0097] An exemplary electronic financial process flow 600 is presented in two portions, a first portion
being presented in FIG. 8, with the process continuing in a second portion being presented in FIG. 9. The
process initiates with an issued voucher ticket 310, 410 (step 610). The player initiates use of the gaming
machine 100 by selecting the desired mode of operation. The player can initiate an option utilizing the
paper voucher ticket 310 or the electronic voucher ticket 410. Initially, the player would identify their
player account by informing the gaming machine 100 of such. This can be accomplished by inserting a
magnetic card into a player's card slot within the gaming machine 100 (step 612). The gaming machine
100 would convey information obtained from the player's card to the respective casino voucher ticket
database server 512 to establish the desired association. The player would prior to, subsequently, or
simultaneously insert the paper voucher ticket 310 into the gaming machine 100 (Step 614). The gaming
machine 100 would determine the financial or token value of the paper voucher ticket 310 and upload
the financial or token value to the gaming machine 100 for play. The player would initiate and continue
play on the gaming machine 100 until a desired point of conclusion. At the time of conclusion, the player
would request a voucher ticket for any remaining credit or financial value of the game. The player can
enter the desired form factor of the voucher from the gaming machine 100. The gaming machine 100
would respond in accordance with the player's instructions. A first option would be to print and
dispense a new paper voucher ticket 310 (Step 626). Once the new paper voucher ticket 310 is printed,
the system would return to an idle state (step 628). A second option would be to transfer the credit or
financial value pending at the point of termination of the game to an e-account (Step 620). The system
compares e-account information entered by the player (Step 620) with e-account information stored on
the casino voucher ticket database server 512. The system determines if the entered information is
consistent with the information stored on the casino voucher ticket database server 512 (Step 622). In a
condition where the entered e-account information is consistent with the information stored on the
casino voucher ticket database server 512, the system transfers a new electronic voucher ticket 410 to
the smartphone 400 (Step 624). In a condition where the entered information is inconsistent with the
information stored on the casino voucher ticket database server 512, the system notifies the player with
the inconsistency and rejects a request for an e-account transfer.
[0098] Alternatively, the player can elect to utilize funds from an e-account. The user enters the e
account information into the gaming machine 100 (Step 630). The system processes the entered
information to determine if the entered information is consistent with the information stored on the
casino voucher ticket database server 512 (decision Step 632). In a condition where the entered
information is consistent with the information stored on the casino voucher ticket database server 512,
the system toggles into an electronic money management mode (Step 640). In a condition where the
entered information is inconsistent with the information stored on the casino voucher ticket database
server 512, the system rejects the request for entry of a financial value (Step 636). The system can direct
the player to re-enter the e-account information, request that the player utilize a different source for
application of the game fees or simply terminate the process and return to an idle state (Step 638).
[0099] Details of the electronic money management mode are presented in FIG. 9. The electronic money
management mode (Step 640) presents a series of options. The options are based upon the status of
play, the current pending credit or financial value retained within the gaming machine 100, and the like.
                                                       17

In a condition where the current pending credit or financial value retained within the gaming machine
100 is greater than zero, the player can continue playing (Step 644) or request to cash out (Step 642).
The cash out can be accomplished by printing a paper voucher ticket 310 or conveying an electronic
voucher ticket 410 to a smartphone 400. The player can insert a magnetic card into the game machine
100 to identify themselves with the game machine 100 as well as the casino voucher ticket database
server 512 or other casino financial database server (Step 646). The player can opt to insert a bill, a
paper voucher ticket 310, or the like into the game machine 100 (Step 648). The game machine 100
would apply a credit equaling the value of the entered bill, the entered paper voucher ticket 310, or the
like to the total pending credit or financial value stored therein. Upon completion of play, the game
machine would disburse a voucher 310, 410 to the player in accordance with the mode selected by the
player. The game machine 100 would subsequently clear the account (Step 650) and return to an idle
stage (Step 652).
[0100] When using an e-account, the player would enter the e-account information (Step 649). The
method of entry can vary based upon the options integrated into the game machine 100. The process
determines if the e-account information entered into the game machine 100 is the same as the e
account that has been pending. If the entered e-account information is the same as the e-account
currently pending in the game machine 100 (Step 670), the process continues by requesting entry of an
authorization code and application of funds to the gaming machine 100. In a condition where the player
desired to increase the pending credit value (Step 672), the player enters the associated e-account and
authorization information (Step 676). The entered information is validated against information stored
within the e-money or voucher ticket management system 580. In a condition where the entered
information is inconsistent with the information stored on the e-money or voucher ticket management
system 580, the system notifies the player with the inconsistency and rejects a request for an e-account
transfer (Step 678). In a condition where the entered e-account information is consistent with the
information stored on the e-money or voucher ticket management system 580, the system uploads and
applies the financial value to the pending credits (Step 679). Wherein the player elects to continue
playing with the pending credit, the system continues play using e-money (Step 674).
[0101] In a condition where the entered e-account information differs from the e-account information
pending in the gaming machine 100, the gaming machine 100 clears the pending account (Step 660) and
proceeds requesting the player enter authorization and a financial transaction to apply credits
accordingly (Step 680). The player would commonly proceed by entering the associated e-account and
authorization information and proceeding accordingly in an electronic management mode (Step 682).
[0102] In a condition where the player rejects this request (Step 686), the gaming machine returns to an
idle condition (Step 688).
[0103] An exemplary bill validator system 700 is illustrated in a schematic diagram format presented in
FIG. 10. The bill validator system 700 includes an e-money integrated bill validator structure 710
provided in signal communication with an electronic money management system 760 and a gaming
machine operational system 770. The signal communication can be provided using a wired interface or a

[0109] The voucher ticket system can utilize an automated system for exchanging currency 560 and
coins 562, such as the exemplary voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 illustrated in FIG. 13.
The voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 includes functional components for processing the
currency 560 and coins 562 and dispensing a casino A voucher ticket 514 of an equivalent value. A
processing circuit assembly 920 includes a central processing unit 922, a digital memory device 924, and
other electrical components to form a circuit. The circuit enables functional operation of the voucher
ticket automated processing unit 910. It is a general practice for each gaming facility to utilize their own
custom encryption for generation of the computer readable reference (similar to the computer readable
value reference 332). Small volumes of digital data can be stored within the digital memory device 924.
The digital memory device 924 can be solid-state memory. Larger volumes of digital data are preferably
stored in a general memory storage device 930. The general memory storage device 930 can utilize one
or more disc drives, tape drives, or larger solid-state memory banks. The system would include an
encoding protocol 932 or the encryption coding specific to the gaming facility. The encoding protocol
932 can be stored within the digital memory device 924, within the general memory storage device 930,
or embedded within other portions of the circuit. A display monitor 940 is integrated into the voucher
ticket automated processing unit 910 and provided in signal communication with the processing circuit
assembly 920. The display monitor 940 provides a visual display to inform the user of any necessary
steps required for the transaction as well as the status of the exchange. The display monitor 940 can be

unit 910 is sitting idle. The display monitor 940 can be fabricated to include a touch screen function,
wherein the touch screen function enables user input through a graphical user interface (GUI).
[0110] A user input device 942 is integrated into the voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 and
provided in signal communication with the processing circuit assembly 920. The user input device 942
enables manual entry of data, instructions, and the like.
[0111] A bill validator and input slot 950 enables insertion of the currency 560 and coins 562 into the
voucher ticket automated processing unit 910. The bill validator and input slot 950 can include a bill
validator, a coin operator, and the like for ingesting, valuating, and storing the currency 560 and coins
562. The bill validator and the coin operator are in signal communication with the processing circuit
assembly 920. The value of the inserted currency 560 and coins 562 is determined by the bill validator,
the processing circuit assembly 920, or any other integrated component designated for the specific
function. After the quantity of currency 560 and coins 562 is deposited within the bill validator and input
slot 950, the voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 determines the total financial face value of
the quantity of deposited currency 560 and coins 562. Upon instruction, a printed and discharge slot 952
would print and dispense the casino A voucher ticket 514, wherein the casino A voucher ticket 514
                                                      21

would have a value respective to the value of the inserted currency 560 and coins 562.
[0112] Gaming facilities 510, 520, 530 can be located independently or in clusters. Each gaming facility
510, 520, 530 provides voucher tickets 514, 524, 534 that are encrypted in accordance with the gaming
facilities specific encryption coding. This scenario dictates that each voucher ticket 514, 524, 534 be
used and redeemed at the respective gaming facility. Should the player desire to go to a different
gaming facility 510, 520, 530, the player would have to cash out their voucher ticket(s) 514, 524, 534 at
the first gaming facility, then convert the funds to a voucher ticket for another gaming facility. The
implementation of a voucher ticket exchange process would reduce the two-step process to a one step
process, thus giving the player more time for gaming. Variations of exchange processes are presented in
FIGS. 14 through 17.
[0113] A generic conceptual schematic diagram of a voucher ticket exchange process is presented in FIG.
14. The exemplary schematic diagram utilizes three gaming facilities, a casino A 510, a casino B 520, and
a casino C 530. Each gaming facility includes their own respective voucher ticket database server 512,
522, 532. Each voucher ticket database server 512, 522, 532 maintains records respective to each issued
voucher ticket 514, 524, 534. The player would provide a voucher ticket clearing house 540 with the
issued voucher ticket 514, 524, 534 they obtained from the gaming facility 510, 520, 530 and request
one or more exchanged voucher tickets 516, 526, 536. The voucher ticket clearing house 540 would
collect the issued voucher ticket 514, 524, 534 from the player and disburse the requested one or more
exchanged voucher tickets 516, 526, 536. The exchanged voucher tickets 516, 526, 536 can be of a value
equal to the value of the collected voucher ticket 514, 524, 534, or the voucher ticket clearing house 540
can optionally include a processing fee 544 and issue the requested one or more exchanged voucher
tickets 516, 526, 536 at a value reduced by the exchange rate as suggested in FIG. 15.
[0114] A conceptual schematic diagram of a physical voucher ticket exchange process is presented in
FIG. 15. The voucher ticket clearing house 540 retains an inventory of exchange voucher tickets 516,
526, 536. The voucher ticket clearing house 540 arranges a physical voucher ticket transfer program
with each gaming facility 510, 520, 530. The physical voucher ticket exchange process collects the
undesired issued voucher tickets 514, 524, 534 from players and distributes voucher tickets 516, 526,
536 respective to the requested casino. The voucher tickets 516, 526, 536 would be distributed to
replace the undesired issued voucher tickets 514, 524, 534, wherein the voucher tickets 516, 526, 536
would be of equal or lower value than the undesired issued voucher tickets 514, 524, 534. The voucher
ticket clearing house 540 would provide the processing 542. As previously mentioned, the voucher ticket
clearing house 540 can include a processing fee 544 for completing the exchange. The voucher ticket
clearing house 540 would retain an inventory of voucher tickets 516, 526, 536 having predetermined
valuation range for each gaming facility 510, 520, 530. Each gaming facility 510, 520, 530 retains
information regarding valuation, status and the like pertaining to the player held voucher tickets 516,
526, 536 and the clearing house inventory voucher tickets 516, 526, 536 in a respective voucher ticket
database server 512, 522, 532. In the example presented in FIG. 15, the player is exchanging a casino A
voucher ticket 514 from casino A 510 for a casino C exchanged voucher ticket 536 issued by casino C
530. The valuation of the casino C exchanged voucher ticket 536 can be equal to or less than the
                                                      22

valuation of the casino A voucher ticket 514.
[0115] A second exemplary embodiment utilizes the voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 as an
exchange machine, as illustrated in the schematic diagram presented in FIG. 16. The voucher ticket
automated processing unit 910 can be operated by the player or an employee of the voucher ticket
clearing house 540.
[0116] The player can enter the name of the gaming facility associated with the undesired issued
voucher ticket(s) 514, 524, 534. The player also enters the name of the gaming facility associated with
the desired replacement voucher tickets 516, 526, 536. In a condition where an exchange rate 544 is
applied, the voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 would notify the player of the exchange rate
544 prior to completing the exchange process.
[0117] The undesired issued voucher ticket(s) 514, 524, 534 are inserted into the bill validator and input
slot 950. The voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 would scan the computer readable value
reference 332 of the inserted undesired issued voucher ticket(s) 514, 524, 534, decode the computer
readable value reference 332, determine if the ticket is valid, and determine the value of the undesired
issued voucher ticket(s) 514, 524, 534. In a condition where the exchange rate 544 is applied, the
voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 would calculate a reduction in the total valuation of the
inserted undesired issued voucher ticket(s) 514, 524, 534, and subsequently print and dispense a
replacement voucher ticket 516, 526, 536 for use at the requested gaming facility 510, 520, 530. It is
noted that the casino B exchanged voucher ticket 526 would be encoded in accordance with the
respective second encoding protocol 934.
[0118] In the example presented in FIG. 16, the player is exchanging a casino A voucher ticket 514 from
casino A 510 for a casino B exchanged voucher ticket 526 associated with a casino B 520. The exemplary
valuation of the casino B exchanged voucher ticket 526 is reduced from the valuation of the casino A
voucher ticket 514 by the voucher ticket exchange commission fee 544, wherein in the example, the
commission in 10%, or $6.00. The process can additionally include a revised issued date. In the
illustrated example, the casino A voucher ticket 514 was issued from casino A 510 on Jun. 1, 2013. The
exchanged voucher ticket 526 associated with casino B 520 includes an issue date of Jun. 15, 2013.
[0119] The exchanged voucher ticket 526 can retain the issue date of the original voucher ticket 514 or
the process can establish a new issue date, identified as a casino B exchanged electronic voucher ticket
issue date 528. The process can address the issue date in any of a variety of solutions. In a first solution,
the process can retain the original issue date and originally established expiration date. In a second
solution, the process can increment the issue date and retain the originally established expiration date.
In a third solution, the process can increment the issue date and increment the expiration date. The
expiration date can be incremented by a pre-established period of time. The time period can be based
upon the originally established issue date, the exchanged electronic voucher ticket issue date 528, or
any other suitable time. The updated information resulting from the exchange process would be
incorporated into the exchanged voucher ticket 526 and recorded at each respective voucher ticket
                                                     23

database server 512, 522. The information can additionally be encoded in the encoded, computer or
machine-readable image, such as a barcode, a Quick Read or QR code, and the like. It is understood that
the exchanged voucher ticket 526 can have continuously resetting expiration period, an effective
indefinite expiration or exclusive of an expiration date.
[0120] The above examples are directed towards paper voucher ticket 310. The same concept can be
applied to the electronic voucher tickets 410, as illustrated in the exemplary schematic diagram
presented in FIG. 17. The undesired issued voucher ticket(s) 514, 524, 534 are read by the voucher ticket
automated processing unit 910. The reading process can be accomplished by scanning an image of a
casino A electronic voucher ticket 515 displayed upon the smartphone display 404 of the smartphone
400, wireless communication between the smartphone 400 and the voucher ticket automated
processing unit 910 wherein the voucher ticket is transmitted to the voucher ticket automated
processing unit 910, and the like. The exchange process would include an additional step of validating
the casino A electronic voucher ticket 515 with the casino A voucher ticket database server 512. The
voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 would subsequently communicate with the casino B
voucher ticket database server 522 to obtain or purchase a financial value for issuance of a casino B
exchanged electronic voucher ticket 527. Alternatively, the voucher ticket clearing house 540 can retain
an account having a value for use for issuance and credits of voucher tickets 515, 527 for each partnered
gaming facility 510, 520, 530. The replacement voucher ticket 516, 526, 536 is conveyed to the
smartphone 400 using a wired or wireless transmission. Alternatively, an image of the entire
replacement voucher ticket 516, 526, 536 or a representative computer readable value reference 332
can be displayed upon the display monitor 940. The player would utilize the camera 409 to obtain a
digital image of the displayed information and the smartphone 400 would properly interpret and
convert the acquired image into an electronic replacement voucher ticket 516, 526, 536.
[0121] In the example presented in FIG. 17, the player is exchanging a casino A electronic voucher ticket
515 from casino A 510 for a casino B exchanged electronic voucher ticket 527 associated with the casino
B 520. Changes in valuation are not presented in this example.
[0122] The issuing casino voucher ticket 514 can be operationally converted to an exchanged electronic
voucher ticket 527 through the voucher ticket clearing house 540, as illustrated in FIG. 18. The
smartphone 400 would obtain a digital image of the issuing casino voucher ticket 514 using a camera
409 integrated into the smartphone 400. The smartphone 400 would communicate a digital image or
other digital representation of the issuing casino voucher ticket 514 (representing a exchanged
electronic voucher ticket 527) to the voucher ticket clearing house 540. The voucher ticket clearing
house 540 is in encoded digital communication with the issuing casino voucher ticket database server
512 of the issuing casino 510. The voucher ticket clearing house 540 forwards the digital representation
of the exchanged electronic voucher ticket 527 to the issuing casino voucher ticket database server 512
using any secured wired or wireless communication interface. Either the voucher ticket clearing house
540 or the issuing casino voucher ticket database server 512 decodes and interprets the digital
representation of the exchanged electronic voucher ticket 527 into a format that is compatible with the
database of the issuing casino voucher ticket database server 512. The issuing casino voucher ticket
                                                      24

database server 512 determines the validity of the issuing casino voucher ticket 514 (based upon the
information provided as the exchanged electronic voucher ticket 527), and records data respective to a
conversion of the issuing casino voucher ticket 514 to the exchanged electronic voucher ticket 527. The
issuing casino voucher ticket database server 512 can optionally generate and return a revised and/or
encoded image of the exchanged electronic voucher ticket 527 to the smartphone 400. This step can be
used to introduce additional security measures into the process and resulting exchanged electronic
voucher ticket 527. Alternatively, the issuing casino voucher ticket database server 512 would cancel the
originally issued issuing casino voucher ticket 514 and generate and return a newly issued voucher in a
form of a exchanged electronic voucher ticket 527.
 [0123] The user can request that the voucher ticket clearing house 540 can be exchanged from the
issuing Casino or other gaming facility 510 to a different, desired exchanging Casino other gaming facility
520. When being exchanged, the server 512 associated with the issuing Casino or gaming facility 510
would be notified of the exchange. The server associated with the exchanging Casino or gaming facility
520 would also be notified of the exchange. The voucher ticket clearing house 540 would arrange a
transfer of funds between the issuing casino voucher ticket database server 512 and the exchanging
casino voucher ticket database server 522. The process can include a fee paid to the voucher ticket
clearing house 540 for their services for completing the exchange.
 [0124] A schematic diagram detailing basic components of an electronic money transaction system 1000
is presented in FIG. 19. An electronic money transaction server 1010 comprises various elements to
support the electronic money transaction system 1000. The electronic money transaction server 1010
includes an account transaction management system 1020, which is in digital data communication with
an account transaction management database 1029. The account transaction management system 1020
and account transaction management database 1029 combination provide the financial transaction and
data retention portion of the electronic money transaction server 1010. The electronic money
transaction server 1010 further includes a series of subsystems arranged to interactively communicate
with various external devices. A voucher ticket management system interface 1022 provides
communication between the account transaction management segment 1020 and a voucher ticket
management system 1030. An electronic money handling terminal interface 1024 provides
communication between the account transaction management segment 1020 and a voucher ticket
automated processing unit 910A messaging interface 1026 provides communication between the
account transaction management segment 1020 and a messaging server 1040. A user terminal interface
 1028 provides communication between the account transaction management segment 1020 and a user
terminal, such as the Smartphone 400.
 [0125] The voucher ticket management system 1030 provides a physical interface for the player to
obtain voucher tickets 310, 410, exchange money for voucher tickets 310, 410, deposit funds into the
 player's digital account, and the like. The voucher ticket management system interface 1022 would be
adapted to support a protocol for interfacing with the voucher ticket management system 1030. The
voucher ticket management system interface 1022 would preferably be adapted to support a plurality of
 interfaces, broadening the adaptability of the voucher ticket management system interface 1022 to a
                                                       25

variety of available management systems 1030. The voucher ticket management system 1030 is
preferably as an automated machine, but could be provided at a cashier's station. In a configuration
where the voucher ticket management system 1030 is through a cashier's station, the casher would
interface with a terminal or other computing device configured to communicate with the voucher ticket
management system interface 1022. The communication link between the voucher ticket management
system interface 1022 and the voucher ticket management system 1030 can be wired, wireless, or both.
It is understood that the voucher ticket management system interface 1022 and the voucher ticket
management system 1030 can be integrated into a single unit/solution or separate as illustrated.
[0126] The electronic money handling terminal interface 1024 includes circuitry and associated
instruction set (software) to provide an electronic money handling terminal interface. The process is
directed towards an application for using voucher tickets 310, 410 for play on any voucher ticket
automated processing unit 910. The voucher tickets 310, 410 can be sourced from the voucher ticket
management system 1030 or through the bill validator and input slot 950 integrated into the voucher
ticket automated processing unit 910. The bill validator and input slot 950 would be provided in digital
data communication with the electronic money handling terminal interface 1024 or directly with the
account transaction management segment 1020. The bill validator and input slot 950 would
communicate the payment processing status to the processing circuit assembly 920, wherein the
processing circuit assembly 920 would control operation of a gaming portion of the voucher ticket
automated processing unit 910. Alternatively, payment for credits/play using the voucher ticket
automated processing unit 910 can be provided through the voucher ticket management system 1030,
wherein the voucher ticket management system 1030 would communicate directly with the processing
circuit assembly 920. It is understood that these are only exemplary configurations and that the digital
data communication between the voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 and the account
transaction management segment 1020 can be provided in any suitable arrangement.
[0127] The messaging interface 1026 provides a messaging service to the account holder. The account
transaction management segment 1020 would determine when appropriate messages should be
conveyed to the account holder based upon any criteria. The criteria can be pre-established, updated,
provided as an intermediary, or any other suitable trigger condition. The messaging interface 1026
forwards the appropriate message or messages to the messaging server 1040. The appropriate message
or messages would include a target address. The messaging server 1040 utilizes the target address to
direct the message to the account holder accordingly. The messaging server 1040 forwards the message
to the target recipient in accordance with the format instructed by the messaging interface 1026. This
can include simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), commonly referred to as e-mail; short message service
(SMS), commonly referred to as text messaging, push, or server push, which is a style of Internet-based
communication where the request for a given transaction is initiated by the publisher or central server;
and the like. The messaging service can be provided as a unidirectional configuration or a bi-directional
configuration.
[0128] The user and electronic money transaction server 1010 can communicate with one another
through a user terminal, represented by the Smartphone 400. The communication can be provided
                                                     26

through a data system, such as the Internet; a wireless interface such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Near Field
Communications, and the like; infra-red, or any other communication link provided on a fixed or
portable computing device. The communications can be unidirectional or a bi-directional, based upon
the desired end result.
[0129] The cash-out process can be accomplished using any of a variety of processes, including issuing a
paper voucher ticket 310, issuing an electronic voucher ticket 410, completing an electronic transfer of
the financial value to the account transaction management segment 1020, and the like. The voucher
ticket automated processing unit 910 can offer optional voucher ticket output configurations to the
player. The voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 can be configured to offer issuance of either a
paper voucher ticket 310 or an electronic voucher ticket 410. The output configuration can be
established using any of a variety of inputs. A first exemplary basis to establish a cash-out mode would
be from a selection made by the player or account owner. The player or account owner can select a
desired output from either a paper voucher ticket mode or an electronic transfer mode. In a condition
where the cash-out mode is established as the paper voucher ticket mode, the printer prints a paper
voucher ticket 310. In a condition where the cash-out mode is established as the electronic transfer
mode, the voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 transfers the associated balance to the account
transaction management segment 1020.
[0130] The cash-out mode can be established based upon a current condition of the system. The system
can optionally include a feature to convey the current cash-out mode to the player or user. This can
include a visual indicator, such as a light, a colored light, a text message, a backlight stenciled message,
and the like; an audible indicator, such as an audible output; a printed output, and the like. The system
can include a feature enabling the player or user an ability to request to change the cash-out mode. One
example of a selection feature could include at least one button, where the user would actuate the
button accordingly. In a preferred variant, the system would include two buttons, wherein a first of the
two buttons is associated with the paper voucher ticket mode and a second of the two buttons is
associated with the electronic transfer mode. The player or user would select the button associated with
the desired cash-out mode to establish or change the cash-out mode.
[0131] In one configuration, the system can default to cash-out mode to be the paper voucher ticket
mode. This would be independent of the mode in which the funds are initially provided to the system. In
one alternative configuration, the default mode can be established by the mode in which the funds are
initially provided to the system. In a condition where the funds are initially provided using a paper
voucher ticket 310, the default cash-out mode would be established as the paper voucher ticket mode.
In a condition where the funds are initially provided using an electronic voucher ticket 410, the default
cash-out mode would be established as the electronic transfer mode.
[0132] The configuration of the system can include trigger functions to direct a player or user to select
the desired cash-out mode. For example, the system can direct the player or user to select the desired
cash-out mode when the pending financial credit value is equal to zero. In another example, the system
can direct the player or user to select the desired cash-out mode when the pending financial credit value
                                                       27

is greater than zero.
 [0133] In another configuration, the cash-out mode can default to a paper voucher ticket mode when
the pending financial credit value equals zero. The cash-out mode can optionally be configured to return
to the previously established cash-out mode upon replenishment of credits to the gaming machine 910.
 [0134] In yet another configuration, the currently established cash-out mode can be converted to the
paper voucher ticket mode when the gaming machine 910 receives submission of a financial transfer
thereto to increase the available financial based credit, wherein the financial transfer originates from a
source that differs from the electronic money account 1230, 1232, 1234, 1236, 1238, 1239 associated
with the electronic ticket voucher 410.
 [0135] In yet another configuration, the currently established cash-out mode can be converted to the
paper voucher ticket mode from the electronic transfer mode when the gaming machine receives
submission of a financial transfer thereto to increase the available financial based credit, wherein the
financial transfer is accomplished using at least one of a paper bill and a paper voucher ticket.
 [0136] In another configuration, the cash-out mode can default to a paper voucher ticket mode when
the system encounters any of the following conditions:
(a) the mode is not in the electronic money management mode when the electronic money handling
section receives the request to store the voucher ticket master ID to the electronic money management
system,
 (b) the electronic money handling section does not have an effective and authenticated account
associated with the electronic funds of the player,
 (c) the electronic money handling section fails in one of sending a request to store the voucher ticket
 master ID at the electronic money management system or receiving a result of the storing of the
voucher ticket master ID from the electronic money management system, and
 (d) the electronic money handling section receives the result of the failure to store the voucher ticket
 master ID from the electronic money management system.
 [0141] The system can include a feature enabling storage of the electronic voucher ticket information,
 particularly directed to a scenario where the gaming machine does not recognize the authenticated
electronic money account. This can include an automated process when the gaming machine does not
 recognize the authenticated electronic money account, is unable to communicate with the account
transaction management segment 1020, or any other scenario where the information may not be
completely transferred between the gaming machine and the account transaction management
segment 1020. This process can optionally employ a user interface input device, such as a button,
enabling the user to request that the system store the electronic voucher ticket information.
 [0142] The system can include a feature enabling printout of a receipt. The printed receipt can include at
 least one of: a cash-out amount, an initial credit submission, a partial transaction history, a complete
transaction history, or any other information that would be appropriate. In one example, the printed
                                                      28

receipt can include a complete history of at least one of the voucher ticket information and voucher
ticket and electronic money account transactions.
[0143] The system can retain a history of statistical information associated with the processing of at
least one of:
(a) paper bills,
(b) paper voucher tickets,
(c) electronic money, and
(d) electronic voucher tickets,
[0148] The history of statistical information associated with the processing can be stored in any suitable
digital memory format and associated digital memory device. In one example, the information can be
stored in a removable memory module.
[0149] The process of employing voucher tickets 310, 410 requires a method to ensure the voucher
tickets 310, 410 and associated financial system remain secure. One proposed method to ensure the
authenticity of the voucher tickets 310, 410 would be to introduce an electronic marking system, as
introduced in an exemplary voucher ticket marking process 1100 presented in FIG. 20. The voucher
ticket marking process 1100 is representative of a subroutine that can be inserted into any voucher
ticket processing instruction set. The process utilized information provided by the electronic money
transaction server 1010. Communication with the electronic money transaction server 1010 is
referenced by the network communication node 1110 illustrated at a start and an end of the voucher
ticket marking process 1100. The device receives and validates receipt of the appropriate voucher ticket
marking requirements from the electronic money transaction server 1010 (decision step 1112). In a
condition where the received voucher ticket marking is considered acceptable, the process continues. In
a condition where the received voucher ticket marking is not received or considered unacceptable, the
process submits a subsequent request for the appropriate voucher ticket marking requirements. The
user forwards the electronic voucher ticket 410 to the receiving device (step 1114). Upon receipt of the
electronic voucher ticket 410 from the electronic voucher ticket submitter, the specific voucher ticket
410 is selected and subsequently marked in accordance with the appropriate voucher ticket marking
requirements (step 1116).
[0150] The electronic voucher tickets 410 are managed through the account transaction management
segment 1020 and stored in any suitable information storage configuration, such as one or more tables
provided in one or more databases. A voucher ticket (TITO) account table 1200 utilizes a voucher ticket
(TITO) account number listing 1210 to retain a series of player's accounts, as presented in FIG. 21. Each
account is identified by an account number 1230, 1232, 1234, 1236, 1238, 1239. The account number
1230, 1232, 1234, 1236, 1238, 1239 provides a continuity link identifying other associated elements.
One exemplary data element is an electronic account (e-money) financial balance, as represented by a
list of voucher ticket (TITO) account financial balances 1212. A second exemplary data element is a
message destination table segment 1220. The message destination table segment 1220 can include a
number of different protocols for communicating with the account owner. The exemplary voucher ticket
                                                      29

(TITO) account table 1200 presents three exemplary listings, including an email address listing 1222, a
short message service (SMS) number listing 1224, and any other notification listing 1226. The email
address listing 1222 would include one or more email addresses for each account number. The short
message service (SMS) number listing 1224 would include one or more short message services (SMS)
(text message) addresses for each account number. The other notification listing 1226 can list any other
suitable address for contacting the account owner. This can include mailing addresses, landline voice
telephone numbers, or any other suitable manner to contact the account owner. The other notification
listing 1226 is representative of a catch all option. It is understood that other dedicated listings can be
added to accommodate any other suitable address for contacting the account owner.
[0151] A stored voucher ticket (TITO) status table 1250 utilizes the voucher ticket (TITO) account
number listing 1210 to associate and manage one or more voucher tickets 310, 410 of a series of
player's accounts, as presented in FIG. 22. The stored voucher ticket (TITO) status table 1250 manages
and retains information associated with each voucher ticket. Each voucher ticket 410 includes a local
identifier, as listed in a voucher ticket (TITO) local identification reference 1260 and a master identifier
as listed in a voucher ticket (TITO) master identification reference 1262. The local identifier is used for
identification of the voucher ticket 410. The master identifier is used for identification of the voucher
ticket 410. The stored voucher ticket (TITO) status table 1250 retains a financial value associated with
each voucher ticket, as listed in a voucher ticket (TITO) financial value 1264. The stored voucher ticket
(TITO) status table 1250 can include a voucher ticket (TITO) status 1266, which identifies the current
status of each of the listed voucher tickets 410. Examples of current status of the voucher tickets 410
include currently valid, considered invalid, considered expired, and currently pending. The stored
voucher ticket (TITO) status table 1250 can include a voucher ticket (TITO) expiration 1268, which
identifies the established expiration date and time of each of the listed voucher tickets 310, 410. The
voucher ticket (TITO) expiration 1268 can include other references, such as "unknown" in a condition
where there is an issue with the expiration date and pending in a condition where the voucher ticket
410 is currently in a pending state and the expiration has not yet been established.
[0152] An additional feature associated with each voucher ticket 410 is an electronic marker. The
electronic markers can be stored on a voucher ticket (TITO) marking table 1270, as shown in the
exemplary table presented in FIG. 23. Each voucher ticket 410 would be associated with a player's
account 1230, 1232, 1234, 1239. It is noted that each player's account can be associated with one or
more voucher tickets 310, 410. For example, the first account listing 1230 is associated with three
different voucher tickets 310, 410 (1010057Z, 0000036X, 3175041A), as shown in a column identifying
the voucher ticket (TITO) master identification references 1280. The electronic marking can be a
timestamp when the voucher ticket 410 is issued out, returned into the account, or any other time
associated with an activity of the voucher ticket, as shown in a column identifying a voucher ticket
(TITO) marked date 1282 and a paired column identifying a voucher ticket (TITO) marked timestamp
1284. The 3510547S exemplifies a condition where a marking for the voucher ticket 410 is currently
pending.
[0153] An exemplary voucher ticket (TITO) voucher ticket withdrawal process 1300 is presented in FIG.
                                                        30

24. The process initiates (step 1310) with a request to withdraw a voucher ticket 410 (step 1320) from a
voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 of a kiosk or a gaming machine. The request can be
submitted through the voucher ticket management system 1030, the user terminal (such as the
Smartphone 400), a cashier, or any other process adapted to submit the request. The account
transaction management segment 1020 returns a list of voucher tickets 410 associated with the player's
account 1230, 1332, 1234, 1239 as shown in FIG. 22. The user selects a voucher ticket 410 from the list
of voucher tickets 410 associated with the player's account 1230, 1332, 1234, 1239 (step 1322). The
process continues by determining if the voucher ticket 410 is marked (step 1324) as shown in FIG. 23.
The process reviews the list of voucher tickets 410 to determine if the voucher ticket 410 is marked
(decision step 1324). In a condition where the process determines that the voucher ticket 410 is not
marked, the process returns a "no marked voucher ticket" message to the user (step 1332) and
terminates the process (step 1340). In a condition where the process determines that the voucher ticket
410 is marked, the process verifies that the marking is within a valid time frame (decision step 1326). In
a condition where the process determines that the voucher ticket 410 is marked and that the voucher
ticket 410 is not within the valid time frame, the process returns a "no marked voucher ticket" message
to the user (step 1332) and terminates the process (step 1340). In a condition where the process
determines that the voucher ticket 410 is marked and that the voucher ticket 410 is within the valid time
frame, the process issues the voucher ticket (master ID) to the user (step 1330) and terminates the
process (step 1340).
[0154] It is understood that the system and associated processes disclosed for use with a voucher ticket
automated processing unit 910 can be adapted to an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) or any other
automated financial transacting machine. For example, the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) would
include a bill validator that is adapted to validate both paper bills and a paper voucher ticket. The
Automated Teller Machine (ATM) would include a communication link to the voucher ticket
management system interface 1022, which is in communication with the account transaction
management segment 1020. The voucher ticket automated processing unit 910 and/or the Automated
Teller Machine (ATM) would include an input device for receiving electronic money from an external
media, wherein the input device would be at least one of: a magnetic strip card reader, an integrated
smart card reader, a barcode scanner, a Quick Read (QR) code scanner, a near field communication
(NFC) signal reader, a short range RF signal reader, a radio frequency identification (RFID) signal reader,
and the like.
[0155] It is understood that the above presented exemplary exchange embodiments can be tailored by
mixing the processes. For example, the player can insert a paper voucher ticket 310 into the voucher
ticket automated processing unit 910 and request an electronic voucher ticket 410 as an exchanged
output.
