                               FOAM CONTROL FORMULATIONS
   [001]   The present invention relates to foam control formulations for preventing or
   reducing foam, and to the use of such formulations to prevent or reduce foam in fluid
 5 environments,    such as aqueous fluid environments, and especially those in oilfield
   applications.
   Background to the Invention
10 [002]   Defoamer formulations are widely used in industrial applications to control foam
   produced by mechanical agitation or shearing of fluids. They may be comprised of low
   viscosity oils, polyols and low foam surfactants. Commercial defoamer formulations may
   also contain hydrophobic particles to break the foam, by adsorbing to the air/liquid
   interface and changing the contact angle.
15
   [003]   Defoamer      compositions     containing    hydrophobic    particulates (such    as
   hydrophobically modified silica or fatty acid amides, e.g. behenamide and diamides)
   often require complex processing, whereby the waxy material has to be melted and then
   cooled to produce solid in the oil phase with the appropriate particle size distribution. A
20 major drawback of these defoamers is the separation of the particulates            from the
   formulation, which may result in the particulates depositing in an unwanted manner. In
   particular, there may end up being unwanted deposits on equipment surfaces or blockages
   of injection lines or filters. This may necessitate costly clean up operations.
25 [004]   Silicone antifoam/defoamer formulations are an important group of foam control
   systems; these include polydimethylsiloxane/silica dispersions and the like. They are
   commercially available as O/W (oil in water) or W/O (water in oil) emulsions. They are
   primarily used to suppress the production of foam in applications such as laundry
   detergents, pulp and paper (particulate stabilized foams), mineral processing, food
30 processing (proteinous foams), agrochemicals and oilfield applications. Although the use
   of silicone antifoams is widespread in oilfield applications, there are instances where
   their use may be prohibitive owing to the potential risk of downstream production
   problems. A particular area of concern is the refining of petroleum where the presence of
   silicone antifoams may cause catalyst poisoning or contamination of products such as
35 fuels. As a consequence of these problems their use has been restricted in oilfield
   production facilities in recent years. Silicone antifoams have additional drawbacks such

                                                 2
   as the deterioration in their efficiency in highly alkaline media as a result of hydrolysis,
   which is relevant in applications such as pulp and paper processing.
   [005]   Defoamer formulations that are free of silicone are also used, but they also have
 5 practical limitations. They are either O/W or W/O emulsions comprised of low foam
   surfactants    (e.g.   EO/PO  block   copolymers),   hydrophobic    particles, mineral   oils,
   paraffinic (e.g. white oils), vegetable and synthetic oils (e.g. esters). They may suffer
   from instability at low or high temperature (creaming) and may form thick pastes or
   creams    which are difficult to pump.      Compositions    based    on low foam nonionic
10 surfactants rely on the cloud point of the amphiphiles in aqueous solution for their mode
   of action. The surfactant is insoluble above its cloud point and behaves as an antifoam
   particle. Below the cloud point the surfactants are soluble in the aqueous media and
   therefore are considered to be non-depositing. This is described in, for example, US
   4946625 and US 4960540.
15
   [006]   Foams generated in oilfield production lines are complex dispersions consisting of
   solid particulates (asphaltenes, paraffin waxes, scales, e.g. alkali metal carbonates or iron
   sulfide, rust and sands), surface active components (natural resins, napthenate soaps,
   corrosion inhibitors, proteins), brine and hydrocarbons. The complexity of the foams
20 makes    it is   difficult to control  the volume produced by the release        of volatile
   hydrocarbons in the separators. Therefore more effective defoamer systems are needed.
   Summary of the Invention
25 [007]   The present invention provides, in a first aspect, a foam control formulation in the
   form of an emulsion, the formulation comprising:
   (a) from 5 to 70% w/w of primary surfactant, this surfactant having an HLB of from 1 to
   12, and a cloud point of from 20 to 70 0 C;
   (b) from 2 to 40% w/w of water-insoluble organic carrier liquid; and
30 (c) water.
   [008]   The present invention provides, in a second aspect, a precursor to a foam control
   formulation in the form of an emulsion, the precursor comprising:
   (a) primary surfactant, this surfactant having an HLB of from 1 to 12 and a cloud point of
35 from 20 to 70 0 C; and
   (b) water-insoluble organic carrier liquid.

                                                 3
   [009]   The present invention provides, in a third aspect, a method of preparing a foam
   control formulation in the form of an emulsion, the method comprising:
   (a) providing a primary surfactant, this surfactant having an HLB of from 1 to 12 and a
 5 cloud point of from 20 to 70 0 C;
   (b) providing a water-insoluble organic carrier liquid;
   (c) combining the primary surfactant and water-insoluble organic carrier liquid with
   water and mixing or stirring to provide a formulation in the form of an emulsion.
10 [010]   The present invention provides, in a fourth aspect, a method of preventing or
   reducing foam in a fluid environment, the method comprising:
       (a) providing a formulation according to the first aspect of the invention; and
       (b) adding the formulation to the fluid environment.
15 [011]   The method may prevent the formation of foam (anti-foam) and/or may reduce the
   levels of foam that already exist (de-foam).      The formation of foam may be fully or
   partly prevented. Any levels of foam that already exist may be reduced to a lower level
   by any percentage; it may be that the reduction is by 100% such that foam levels become
   zero or it may be that the percentage reduction is less than 100%, e.g. from 1 to 99%.
20
   [012] A benefit of the present invention is the ability of the formulations to initially
   reduce the levels of foam that already exist and to then also prevent (or limit) further
   foam formation.     In situations where there is significant agitation a problem with some
   defoamers is that although they reduce the foam levels they do not prevent (or limit)
25 further foam forming in the agitated environment.
   [013]   The present invention provides, in a fifth aspect, the use of a formulation
   according to the first aspect of the invention to prevent and/or reduce foam in a fluid
   system, such as an aqueous fluid system.        It may be that the formulation is used to
30 (partially or fully) reduce foam in a fluid system and to then (partially or fully) prevent
   further foam formation in the system.
   [014] The present invention provides, in a sixth aspect, the use of a formulation
   according to the first aspect of the invention as a processing aid to control foam

                                                  4
   production in a fluid system, especially in a system where there is a high degree of
   agitation.
   [015]    In particular, the formulations may be used in an oilfield system, e.g. an oilfield
 5 production system.
   [016]    In the present invention, the water-insoluble       organic carrier liquid suitably
   comprises a viscosity modifier selected from: dibasic acid esters, fatty acid esters and
   mixtures thereof. This permits the formulation to be provided as a stable and readily
10 usable formulation that is a very effective defoamer and a good antifoamer. The presence
   of one or more dibasic acid ester and/or fatty acid ester serves to improve solvency and
   solubilisation with the surfactant system. As discussed below in more detail, the use of
   these esters enhances the defoaming performance of the hydrophobic phase due to the
   spreading properties of these esters at the gas/liquid interface.
15
   [017]    The primary surfactant is, in general, a surfactant having an HLB of from 1 to 12,
   and a cloud point of from 20 to 70 0 C. However, the skilled reader will appreciate that not
   all surfactants exhibit a cloud point.      The primary surfactant is, therefore, in some
   embodiments, a surfactant having an HLB of from 1 to 12, and that does not have a cloud
20 point.
   [018]    It may be that the primary surfactant is a surfactant having an HLB of from 1 to
   12 and/or having a cloud point of from 20 to 70 0 C.
25 [019]    It may be that the primary surfactant is a surfactant having an HLB of from 1 to
   12, wherein in the event that this surfactant has a cloud point, the cloud point is from 20
   to 70 0 C.
   [020]    In one embodiment, the primary surfactant is an alkoxylated surfactant, which
30 will therefore have a cloud point. In this case it is desired that the surfactant has an HLB
   of from 1 to 12, and a cloud point of from 20 to 70 0 C.
   [021]    In another embodiment, the primary surfactant is not an alkoxylated surfactant,
   which does not have a cloud point. In this case it is desired that the surfactant has an
35 HLB of from I to 12.

                                                 5
   [022]    In the present invention, the foam control formulation is suitably in the form of a
   microemulsion.     The   use of a microemulsion       system is  beneficial   because  it is
   thermodynamically stable, which means it is at its lowest energy state, in contrast to
 5 macroemulsions which are kinetically stable and therefore are liable to separate over
   time. Prior defoamer systems have used conventional emulsions, i.e. macroemulsions, or
   liquid formulations.
   [023]    Microemulsions are macroscopically homogeneous dispersions of hydrophobic
10 liquid (e.g. oil), water and surfactant. The dispersion may include one or more co
   surfactant. The aqueous phase may contain one or more salt and/or one or more other
   ingredients. The hydrophobic liquid may be a single component (e.g. a vegetable oil or a
   mineral oil) or a mixture of components,          e.g. it may be a complex mixture of
   hydrocarbons and/or olefins.
15
   [024]    Microemulsions    are highly   dynamic systems     with respect to their internal
   structure. The surfactant aggregates within the microemulsion are highly labile species.
   Properties of microemulsions are described in the book "Microemulsions Theory and
   Practice" (Leon M Prince, Academic Press Inc., NY, 1977).
20
   [025]    The surfactant aggregates in a microemulsion typically have dimensions of the
   order of from 1 to 100 nm. This results in the formulation having a clear, slightly turbid
   or translucent appearance. This contrasts with particle size distributions for commercial
   defoamers, which are of the order of 0.1 - 20 microns, meaning that those defoamers
25 tend to have an opaque, milky appearance.
   [026]    The use of a microemulsion formulation is beneficial because it will be stable
   over a wide temperature range and will not easily separate into separate phases or settle
   out.    Generally, the formulations of the invention will be stable not only at ambient
30 temperature but also at higher temperatures, e.g. 40 0 C and at lower temperatures, e.g.
   20 0 C.
   [027]    In addition, the microemulsion formulations have a low viscosity. The low
   viscosity characteristic is significant because viscous emulsions are difficult to inject
35 into fluid environments and therefore are difficult to disperse effectively.

                                                   6
   [028]    The microemulsions are also straightforward to manufacture. Microemulsions
   form upon simple mixing of the components. They can be easily prepared by gentle
   mixing or shaking and so their production generally requires only simple liquid blending
 5 facilities; this contrasts with the high shear mixing required in respect of macroemulsion
   production.
   [029]    Due to the ease of manufacture, it is possible to prepare the formulations of the
   invention on site prior to use. For example, the components of the formulation (apart
10 from the water) may be supplied to the site, either separately or as a blend, and then can
   be mixed or shaken with water on site to generate to the foam control formulation of the
   invention. In oilfield applications it can be envisaged that the water used in this regard
   could be seawater. Clearly a benefit of being able to generate the foam control
   formulation of the invention on site is that the volumes of product to be transported to
15 the site and stored on site are reduced, and that the required quantities of product can be
   prepared as required shortly before use. In particular, the precursor of the second aspect
   of the invention may be supplied to the site and then can be mixed or shaken with water
   on site to generate to the foam control formulation of the invention.
20 [030]    The formulations of the invention are low viscosity dispersions and are stable
   over a wide temperature range compared to two commercial antifoams. The formulations
   have a clear or translucent appearance.
   [031]    In summary, the major benefits of the microemulsion formulations of the
25 invention are:
       .    they have a wide temperature stability range, especially compared to emulsions,
       .    they are low viscosity, permitting ease of dosing,
       *    they are easy to manufacture,
       .    they are unlikely to persist in downstream operations (e.g. refining),
30     .    they are relatively benign to the environment (and the majority of the components
            in the formulations of the invention are biodegradable),
       .    they are non-depositing,
       .    it is relatively easy to adapt the formulations, to meet specific criteria for a given
            end use, whilst retaining the antifoaming/defoaming effect.

                                                 7
   Detailed description of the invention
   [032]   The   formulations  of the present      invention  are  stable and  readily usable
   formulations which are very effective defoamers and good antifoamers.        This contrasts
 5 with current products which, whilst effective at de-foaming and anti-foaming, present
   problems in terms of lack of stability and/or ability to be readily or widely used.
   Although microemulsions per se are well known, microemulsion de-foaming or anti
   foaming formulations, e.g. for use in oilfield applications, are a new concept and contrast
   with the conventional emulsion and dispersion formulations previously used.
10
   [033]   The formulations of the invention are water in oil (W/O) dispersions which when
   diluted in water (e.g. when added to the fluid system) will form oil in water (O/W)
   emulsions. They contain a primary surfactant that is relatively "low" foaming; this has
   the characteristics as defined below. The surfactant will phase separate from aqueous
15 solution above its cloud point.
   [034]   The primary surfactant used in the formulations of the invention suitably has an
   HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) value of from I to 12, such as from 1.5 to 11.5 or
   from 2 to 11; it may be that the HLB value is from 2 to 12, such as from 2 to 11 or from
20 3 to 11 or from 3 to 10.
   [035]   The primary surfactant used in the formulations of the invention preferably has an
   HLB value of from 1 to 10, such as from 1.5 to 10. In a preferred embodiment the HLB
   value is from 2 to 10.
25
   [036]   The skilled reader will appreciate that HLB values can be determined by the use
   of H-NMR, which allows a HLB value to be calculated by integration of the H-signals
   from the lipophilic and hydrophilic parts of the molecule. HLB values for surfactants are
   also known in the literature available in the skilled reader's common knowledge.
30
   [037]   The use of low HLB value surfactants gives rise to the relatively "low" foaming
   property mentioned above.
   [038]   The primary surfactant used in the formulations of the invention suitably has a
35 cloud point in the range of from 20 to 70 0 C, such as from 25 to 65 0 C; preferably the

                                                    8
   cloud point is in the range of from 20 to 60 0 C, such as from 25 to 550 C or from 30 to
   500 C.  In one embodiment the cloud point is in the range of from 20 to 40 0 C, such as
   from 25 to 40 0 C or from 30 to 40 0 C.      Of course, as noted above, not all surfactants
   exhibit a cloud point and therefore for such surfactants it is immediately apparent to the
 5 skilled reader that this feature is not applicable and is not required.

   invention and their HLB and cloud point values.

15 test for nonionic surfactants (e.g. ASTM D2024-09).
   [041] The primary surfactant is used in an amount of from 5 to 70% w/w of the

   amount of from 5 to 60% w/w.

   [043] In one embodiment the primary surfactant is used in an amount of from 5 to 55%

    [050]   In one embodiment, the primary surfactant is selected from fatty acid esters of
    alcohols (e.g. sorbitan esters of fatty acids, such as sorbitan monolaurate, polyglyceryl
    fatty acid esters, such as polyglyceryl-3 oleate, and polyethylene glycol fatty acid esters,
    such as PEG dioleate), fatty acid alkoxylates (e.g. fatty acid ethoxylates, such as isodecyl
25  ethoxylate), block copolymers of alkoxylates (e.g. glycerol EO/PO block copolymers,
    EO/PO block copolymers, ethylene diamine EO/PO block copolymers), and alkoxylated
    terpenes (e.g. a block alkoxylated C8-15 terpene, such as a block alkoxylated EO/PO C9
    terpene).
30  [051]   For alkoxylated products, the alkoxylating group may suitably be a C1-C4 alkoxy
    group, such as ethoxy, propoxy or butoxy, or combinations thereof.         For example, the
    invention envisages, inter alia, ethoxylation, propoxylation, butoxylation, and block
    alkoxylation with (EO)(PO), (EO)(BO),         (PO)(EO) and (BO)(EO).        Preferably, the
    alkoxylating group is ethoxy, propoxy, (EO)(PO), or (PO)(EO).

                                                 11
   [052]   For the alkoxylated products, the degree of alkoxylation is suitably from 1 to 50,
   such as from 1 to 40, e.g. from 1 to 30; preferably from 1 to 20 and most preferably from
   1 to 15. In one embodiment, the degree of alkoxylation is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or
   12.  The skilled reader will understand that alkoxylated products are generally present as
 5 mixtures where there are varying numbers of alkoxylation. Thus, when referring to
   alkoxylated products, the degree of alkoxylation is the average (mean) degree of
   alkoxylation of the mixture.
   [053]   The alkoxylated alcohol may suitably be formed from the reaction of a C2-C20
10 alcohol and alkylene oxide(s), wherein the alcohol may preferably be a polyol and
   especially a sugar alcohol.       The alcohol may, for example, be a C2-C20 polyol,
   preferably a C2-C12 polyol, e.g. a C3-C1O polyol, and most preferably a C3-C8 polyol,
   such as a C3, C4, C5 or C6 polyol. The polyol may, for example, be ethylene glycol,
   glycerol, propylene glycol, erythritol, threitol, ribitol, sorbitol, mannitol or galactitol.
15
   [054]   The alkoxylated terpene may suitably be formed from the reaction of a C6-C30
   terpene group and alkylene oxide(s), wherein the terpene group comprises a terpene
   radical that may be acyclic or cyclic; for example it may be a C8 to C30, C8 to C24, C8
   to C22, C8 to C20, C8 to C16, or C9 to C15 terpene radical.
20
   [055]   The terpene group may, in one embodiment, comprise a C8-C15 monocyclic or
   bicyclic terpene radical, and may optionally further comprise a C1-15 hydrocarbon
   linking group.    In the alkoxylated terpene this linking group is a divalent hydrocarbon
   that links the terpene radical to the alkoxylating groups. This C 1-20 hydrocarbon divalent
25 linking group may suitably be a C1-20 alkylene, C2-20 alkenylene, or C1-20 alkoxyene
   group, for example a C1-12 alkylene, C2-12 alkenylene, or C1-12 alkoxyene group, such
   as a C2-10 alkylene, C2-10 alkenylene, or C2-10 alkoxyene group; preferably a C2-8
   alkylene, C2-8 alkenylene, or C2-8 alkoxyene group; more preferably a C2, C3, C4, C5
   or C6 alkylene or alkoxyene group; most preferably a C2, C3, or C4 alkylene or
30 alkoxyene group.
   [056]   In one embodiment the terpene radical comprises a bicyclo[a,b,c,]heptenyl            or
   bicyclo[a,b,c]heptyl radical, wherein a+b+c=5 and a=2, 3, or 4; b=2 or 1; and c=0 or 1.
   Thus the terpene group may, for example, be of formula Z-Y in which Z represents a
35 bicyclo[a,b,c,]heptenyl or bicyclo[a,b,c]heptyl radical, wherein a+b+c=5 and a=2, 3, or 4;

                                                     12
   b=2 or 1; and c=0 or 1; and Y represents -CH 2 -C(R 0 )(R') or -O-CH(R 2 )CH(R 3 )-, wherein
   R , R , R 2, and R3, which may be identical or different, represent hydrogen or a C1-8
   (preferably C1-6 or C1-5) alkyl. Preferably, R0 , R', R2 , and R3 , which may be identical or
                                                                                                1 2
   different, represent hydrogen or a Cl, C2, C3 or C4 alkyl. Most preferably R0 , R , R2
 5 and R3 , which may be identical or different, represent hydrogen or a Cl or C2 alkyl.
   [057]    In one such embodiment, therefore, the alkoxylated terpene is of the following
   formula:
10                               Z-Y-[OCH(R4)-CH(R 5)]-[OCH 2 CH 2 ]m
    in which Z represents a bicyclo[a,b,c,]heptenyl or bicyclo[a,b,c]heptyl radical, wherein
   a+b+c=5 and a=2, 3, or 4; b=2 or 1; and c=0 or 1; Y represents CH 2-C(R)(R')- or -0
   CH(R 2 )-CH(R  3
                     )-,  wherein R0 , R', R 2 , and R 3 , which may be identical or different,
15 represent hydrogen or a C1-8 (preferably C1-6 or C1-4, more preferably Cl or C2) alkyl;
   R 4 and R , which may be identical or different, represent hydrogen or a Cl or C2 alkyl,
   provided that at least one of the radicals R 4 and R 5 is not hydrogen and provided that the
   total number of carbon atoms in the radicals R 4 and R5 is 1 or 2; n is an integer from 0 to
   20; and m is an integer from 1 to 50.
20
   [058]   This type of terpene product is, for example, described in US Patent Publication
   No: 2006/0135683 and in WO 2009/023724.
   [059]   In   one      such    embodiment,      Z   represents    a   bicyclo[a,b,c,]heptenyl   or
25 bicyclo[a,b,c]heptyl radical, wherein a+b+c=5 and a=2, 3, or 4; b=2 or 1; and c=0 or 1; Y
   represents -CH 2-CH 2- or -O-CH 2 -CH 2-; R 4 and R5 , which may be identical or different,
   represent hydrogen, CH      3 or C2 H5 , provided that at least one of the radicals R 4 and R5 is
   not hydrogen and provided that the total number of carbon atoms in the radicals R 4 and
   R5 is 1 or 2; n is an integer from I to 20; and m is an integer from I to 20.
30
   [060]   Preferably,     in this  embodiment the alkoxylated terpene is of the following
   formula:

                                                  13
   wherein Rs is CH 3 or C2 H5 , n is an integer from 1 to 20 and m is an integer from 1 to 30.
   Most preferably, RS is CH 3, n is an integer from 1 to 20 and m is an integer from 1 to 20.
   For example, it may be that RS is CH 3, n is an integer from 1 to 10 and m is an integer
 5 from I to 10.
   [061]   Accordingly, in one embodiment it is preferred that the alkoxylated terpene is a
   block alkoxylated terpene derived from 6,6-dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-ene-2-ethanol
   (CAS    No: 128-50-7),    especially a (PO)(EO) block alkoxylated terpene.          In this
10 embodiment, the number of propoxy groups is preferably from I to 20 (e.g. from I to 10)
   and the number of ethoxy groups is preferably from I to 20 (e.g. from I to 10). The HLB
   of the alkoxylated terpene is preferably less than 10, such as 5 or less; preferably from 1
   to 5 and more preferably from 3 to 5.
15 [062]   In one embodiment the terpene alkoxylate may be a terpene (C9) block
   alkoxylated (EO)(PO) half ester sulfosuccinate where the terpene alkoxylate has an HLB
   in the range of from 3 to 5. (e.g. RHODOLINE HP ex Solvay).
   [063]   The terpene alcohols that may be used are the same terpenes discussed above and
20 terpene alcohols based on the terpene radicals discussed above.
   [064] The block copolymers of alkoxylates may be may suitably be block copolymers of
   two or more C1-C4 alkoxy groups, such as ethoxy, propoxy or butoxy. For example, the
   invention envisages, inter alia, the use of block copolymers that are selected from
25 (EO)(PO), (EO)(BO), (PO)(EO) and (BO)(EO) block copolymers. Specific examples of
   block copolymers of alkoxylates that may be used include EO/PO block copolymers
   comprised of polypropylene glycol hydrophobes (which may have a weight average
   molecular weight Mw of from 100 to 600 Da) with from 1 to 30 moles EO and from 1 to

                                                  14
   30   moles   PO.    Examples   include  ANTAROX@         L64   (available  from  Solvay)   or
   PLURIOL@ PE 6400 (available from BASF).
   [065]   The   fatty  acids,  fatty acid   esters  of alcohols,   fatty  alkanolamides,  fatty
 5 alkanolamines, fatty acid mono and diesters of polyols and fatty acid diamides include a
   "fatty" group. Such groups are known in the art.
   [066]    In one embodiment, the "fatty" group may be a C8-30 unbranched or branched
   alkyl or alkenyl group, such as a C 10-24 unbranched or branched alkyl or alkenyl group,
10 or such as a C10-22 unbranched or branched alkyl or alkenyl group, or a C11-20
   unbranched or branched alkyl or alkenyl group, e.g. a C12-18 unbranched or branched
   alkyl or alkenyl group.
   [067]   In one embodiment, the "fatty" group is a C8-30 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl
15 group, such as a C1O-24 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, or such as a C1O-22
   unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, or a C 11-20 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, e.g. a
   C12-18 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group. In some embodiments, the "fatty" group may
   be a C10-24 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group. In some embodiments, the "fatty" group
   may be a C12-24 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group.
20
   [068]   In relation to these fatty acids, fatty alkanolamides, fatty alkanolamines, fatty
   acid mono and diesters of polyols and fatty acid diamides, the following features also
   apply. The amide may suitably be a monoamide or diamide and may suitably be a C1-12
   amide, e.g. C1-8 or C2-6, e.g. C3, C4 or C5. The amine may suitably be a monoamine or
25 diamine and may suitably be a C1-12 amine, e.g. C1-8 or C2-6, e.g. C3, C4 or C5. The
   polyols may be a polymer of a C2-C20 alcohol, preferably of a C2-C12 alcohol, e.g. a
   C3-C1O alcohol, and most preferably a C3-C8 alcohol, such as a C3, C4, C5 or C6
   alcohol. The polyol may, for example, be polyglyceryl or polyethylene glycol.            The
   polyol may have a weight average molecular weight Mw in the range of from 50 to 1000
30 Da, such as from 100 to 600 Da. In one embodiment, the polyol may be a polyglyceryl
   with from 3 to 12 glyceryl units, e.g. 3, 4 or 5. In another embodiment, the polyol may be
   a polyethylene glycol with a weight average molecular weight Mw in the range of from
   100 to 800 Da. The diamides may be a C1-12 diamide, e.g. C1-8 or C2-6, e.g. C2, C3,
   C4 or C5.     An example of a fatty acid diamide is MIRAMINE@ ODO, which is a 2:1
35 adduct of oleic acid and ethylenediamine.

                                                   15
   [069]   In relation to the fatty acid esters of alcohols, these alcohols may be polyols or
   may be monoalcohols.       The polyols may, as noted above, be polymers of alcohols, or
   they may be other alcohols having multiple hydroxyl groups, e.g. sugar alcohols. It may
 5 be that the alcohol is a C2-18 polyol, such as a C2-12 polyol or a C3-10 polyol or a C3-8
   polyol, for example selected from glycerol, erythritol, threitol, ribitol, sorbitol, sorbitan,
   mannitol or galactitol.
   [070]   In one embodiment, in relation to the fatty acid esters of alcohols, the alcohol is
10 sorbitan, polyglycerol, or polyethylene glycol.
   [071]   The carboxylic acid esters of alcohols may suitably be the reaction product of a
   C1-8 carboxylic acid with a C2-C20 alcohol. The alcohol may, for example, be a C2-C20
   alcohol, preferably a C2-C12 alcohol, e.g. a C3-C10 alcohol, and most preferably a C3
15 C8 alcohol, such as a C3, C4, C5 or C6 alcohol. The carboxylic acid may be a C1-8
   carboxylic acid, such as a C1-6 carboxylic acid, e.g. a C2-6 carboxylic acid.
   [072]     In one embodiment the carboxylic acid esters of alcohols are the reaction
   product of a C1-8 monocarboxylic acid with a C2-C20 polyol wherein the alcohol may
20 optionally be a sugar alcohol. It may be that the alcohol is a C2-10 polyol, such as a C3
   C8 polyol or a C3-6 polyol, for example selected from ethylene glycol, propylene glycol,
   glycerol, erythritol, threitol, ribitol, sorbitol, mannitol or galactitol. It may be that the
   carboxylic acid is a C1-6 monocarboxylic acid, e.g. a C1-4 monocarboxylic acid, such as
   formic acid, acetic acid or propionic acid.
25
   [073]   In one embodiment, the carboxylic acid esters of alcohols are the reaction product
   of a C1-8 dicarboxylic acid with a C2-C20 monoalcohol. It may be that the alcohol is a
   C1-10 monoalcohol, such as a C1-C6 monoalcohol, e.g. methanol, ethanol or propanol.
   It may be that the carboxylic acid is a C2-8 dicarboxylic acid, e.g. a C2-6 dicarboxylic
30 acid, such as oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid or glutaric acid
   [074]   The fatty acid esters of alcohols may suitably be the reaction product of a C8-30
   fatty acid with a C2-C20 alcohol. The fatty acid esters of alcohols may suitably be
   diesters or triesters. The alcohol may be a C2-C20 polyol wherein the alcohol may
35 optionally be a sugar alcohol. It may be that the alcohol is a C2-10 polyol, such as a C3-

                                                   16
   C8 polyol or a C3-6 polyol, for example selected from ethylene glycol, propylene glycol,
   glycerol, erythritol, threitol, ribitol, sorbitol, mannitol or galactitol. The fatty acid may
   be of formula Rf-OH where Rf is a C8-30 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, such as a
   C10-22 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, or a C1i-20 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl
 5 group, e.g. a C12-18 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group. In some embodiments, the Rf
   group may be a C12-24 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group.
   [075]   The alkoxylated fatty acids may suitably be formed from the reaction of a C8-30
   fatty acid and alkylene oxide(s). The fatty acid may be of formula Rf-OH where Rf is a
10 C8-30 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, such as a C10-22 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl
   group, or a C11-20 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, e.g. a C12-18 unbranched alkyl or
   alkenyl group. In some embodiments, the Rf group may be a C12-24 unbranched alkyl or
   alkenyl group.
15 [076]   The alkyl polyglucoside may suitably have an alkyl group that is a Cl to 24
   branched or unbranched alkyl group, such as a Cl to C20, C2 to C18, or C2 to C16
   branched or unbranched alkyl group; in one preferred embodiment it may be a Cl to C12
   branched or unbranched alkyl group, such as a Cl to C1O, Cl to C8, Cl to C6, or C2 to
   C6 branched or unbranched alkyl group, e.g. a C3, C4 or C5 branched or unbranched
20 alkyl group. Preferably the alkyl group is a C4 to 10 branched or unbranched alkyl group
   e.g. a C4, C5, C6, C7, C8 or C9 branched or unbranched alkyl group..
   [077]   The alkyl polyglucoside is suitably one where wherein the polyglucoside has a
   degree of polymerisation (i.e. the average number of glucose units per alkyl group) of
25 from 1 to 15, preferably from 1 to 10, e.g. from 1 to 9, from 1 to 8, from 1 to 7 or from 1
   to 6. Typically it may be from 1 to 5 or from 1 to 4; preferably from 1 to 3 or from 1 to
   2. Alkyl polyglucosides of particular interest have an average degree of polymerisation
   of from I to 1.5, e.g. from 1.1 to 1.5.
30 [078]   The skilled reader will understand that, due to the method by which they are
   synthesized,   alkyl   polyglucosides      are   generally  present   as   mixtures  of alkyl
   polyglucosides, where there are varying numbers of carbon atoms in the alkyl radical and
   where there are varying degrees of polymerisation. Thus, when referring to alkyl
   polyglucosides, the alkyl radical is generally referred to as having a range of carbon
35 atoms, which cover the minimum and maximum length of alkyl carbon chains present in

                                                 17
   the mixture,    and the   degree  of polymerisation     is the average    (mean) degree   of
   polymerisation of the mixture.
   [079]   Synthesis of alkyl polyglucosides is well known and can be found in any text
 5 book covering such surfactants, e.g.    Alkyl Polyglucosides: Technology, Properties and
   Applications, eds K Hill, W von Rybinski and G Stoll (Wiley, (1996)).
   [080]   The water-insoluble organic carrier liquid may suitably be an oil selected from
   dibasic esters, mineral oils, vegetable oils, paraffinic oils, synthetic oils, and mixtures
10 thereof. In one embodiment, the water-insoluble organic carrier liquid is an oil selected
   from mineral oils, vegetable oils, paraffinic oils, synthetic oils, and mixtures thereof.
   [081]   However, other water-insoluble organic carrier liquids can also be contemplated,
   either alone or in combination with such an oil.
15
   [082]   For example, polyvinyl esters (e.g. polyvinyl acetate) and polyolefins such as
   polybutene (isobutylene-butylene copolymer) may also be contemplated. The polyolefins
   preferably have a molecular weight in the range of from 100 to 5000 Da, preferably from
   100 to 1000 Da or from 100 to 500 Da.
20
   [083]   Preferably, if polyvinyl esters (e.g. polyvinyl acetate) and/or polyolefins such as
   polybutene (isobutylene-butylene copolymer) are used, these are not used as the sole
   water-insoluble organic carrier liquid. Thus it is preferred that polyvinyl esters and/or
   polyolefins are only used in combination with another water-insoluble organic carrier
25 liquid, e.g. in combination with one or more oil and/or in combination with one or more
   viscosity modifiers (such as dibasic acid esters, fatty acid esters or mixtures thereof, as
   discussed below).
   [084]   In one embodiment, polyvinyl esters (e.g. polyvinyl acetate) and/or polyolefins
30 such as polybutene (isobutylene-butylene copolymer) are not used or are present in
   amounts of less than 5% wt/wt, e.g. less than 4%, or less than 3% wt/wt, or less than 2%
   w/w, e.g. less than 1%, or less than 0.5% wt/wt.
   [085]   A mixture of liquids is preferred for use as the water-insoluble organic carrier
35 liquid.

                                                  18
   [086]   The water-insoluble organic carrier liquid may in one embodiment comprise oil
   (e.g. mineral oil, vegetable oil, paraffinic oil, synthetic oil, or mixtures thereof) diluted
   with dibasic ester, such as diisobutyl ester of glutaric, succinic or adipic acid; this can
 5 improve solvency and solubilisation with the surfactant system.
   [087]   The water-insoluble organic carrier liquid may alternatively comprise oil (e.g.
   mineral oil, vegetable oil, paraffinic oil, synthetic oil, or mixtures thereof) diluted with
   fatty acid ester, such as capryl/caprylic triglycerides (GTCC) or 2-ethyl hexyl oleate. The
10 benefit of using such an ester is that it lowers the pour point of the oil system and serves
   to improve solvency and solubilisation with the surfactant system.
   [088]   The water-insoluble organic carrier liquid may alternatively comprise oil (e.g.
   mineral oil, vegetable oil, paraffinic oil, synthetic oil, or mixtures thereof) diluted with a
15 dibasic ester (such as diisobutyl ester of glutaric, succinic or adipic acid) and with fatty
   acid ester (such as capryl/caprylic triglycerides (GTCC) or 2-ethyl hexyl oleate). This
   improves solvency and solubilisation with the surfactant system.
   [089]   The water-insoluble organic carrier liquid is insoluble in the aqueous phase and
20 droplets of this liquid behave as hydrophobic oils. This hydrophobic oil also facilitates
   the defoaming action, by forming larger droplets with the surfactant phase.
   [090]   The oil is released by dilution of the formulation in the fluid system, due to phase
   behaviour.
25
   [091]   The water-insoluble organic carrier liquid is used in an amount of from 2 to 40%
   w/w of the formulation, e.g. from 3 to 35% w/w. In one preferred embodiment, it is used
   in an amount of from 5 to 40% w/w, or from 5 to 35% w/w, or from 5 to 30% w/w; e.g.
   from 5 to 25% w/w or from 5 to 20% w/w. In one embodiment, it is used in an amount of
30 from 6 to 30% w/w, e.g. from 7 to 25% w/w or from 8 to 22% w/w or from 9 to 21% w/w
   or from 10 to 20% w/w.
   [092]   In one embodiment, the formulations of the invention are free of silicone or have
   low silicone content. Therefore it may be that the formulations comprise 5% or less w/w

                                                 19
   silicone, such as 4% or less w/w, 3% or less w/w, 2% or less w/w, or 1% or less w/w.
   Suitably, the formulations comprise 0.5% or less w/w silicone, such as 0.1% or less w/w.
   [093]   The viscosity of the water-insoluble organic carrier liquid may be adjusted to aid
 5 the ease of mixing in the formulation. It may be that this is achieved by the addition of
   viscosity modifiers.    These may, for example, be selected from dibasic acid esters, fatty
   acid esters and mixtures thereof.
   [094] Branched fatty acid esters (e.g. pentaerythrityl esters) or unsaturated fatty acid
10 esters (e.g. methyl oleate) are preferred as they have low pour points (< 00 C) and enable
   the formulations to be stable at temperatures down to -20 0 C. Dibasic esters such as
   diisobutyl esters of glutaric, succinic or adipic acids (e.g. RHODIASOLV@ DIB,
   RHODIASOLV@          IRIS    or RHODIASOLV@         RPDE,    available   from    Solvay)  are
   particularly useful as they have relatively low pour points, e.g. as low as -60 0 C.
15
   [095]   In one preferred embodiment, the water-insoluble organic carrier liquid comprises
   one or more viscosity modifier selected from dibasic acid esters, fatty acid esters and
   mixtures thereof. These combinations were found to improve the low temperature
   stability of the microemulsion formulations. Vegetable oils may contain saturated fatty
20 acids and triglycerides, which impart a hazy or opaque appearance as a result of a change
   in the solubility of the oil components as the temperature is reduced.
   [096]   Furthermore,    it is possible to enhance the defoaming performance            of the
   hydrophobic/oil phase by the use of these esters (dibasic acid esters, fatty acid esters and
25 mixtures thereof) owing to the spreading properties of these esters at the gas/liquid
   interface compared to oils such as vegetable oils.
   [097]   These esters typically have lower surface tensions compared to vegetable oils and
   the like. This can be seen from the following table giving examples of surface tensions.

                                                  20
    [098]   These dibasic acid esters, fatty acid esters and mixtures thereof will also have
    larger positive initial spreading coefficients (S) compared to vegetable oils and the like,
    as defined by the Harkins equation (Chapter 4, 'Introduction to Colloid and Surface
  5 Chemistry',    5 th  ed, Duncan J Shaw, Butterworth Heinemann).The          Harkins equation
    describes the spreading properties of substances on substrates and is a key requirement
    for defoamers       and antifoams.  The Harkins    equation is defined by the following
    expression.
                                     S = yW/A - (yO/A + yO/W)
10  where yW/A is the surface tension of the substrate (e.g. water/air), yO/A is the surface
    tension of the oil phase (oil/air) and yO/W is the interfacial tension of the oil in contact
    with the substrate, in this case water. For vegetable oils the interfacial tension with water
    is typically 23 - 26 mN/m (L R Fisher, E E Mitchell and N S Parker, Journal of Food
    Science,    1985,    50, 1201  - 1202)  and for a typical     ester such as capric/caprylic
15  triglyceride it is approximately 17 mN/m (Crodamol product range data sheet, Croda
    Chemicals). If water has a surface tension of 72 mN/m at 25 0 C it is clearly seen the ester
    will produce larger spreading coefficient compared to the vegetable oil, i.e. vegetable
    oils will produce a spreading coefficient of 15 compared to the ester which has a value of
    26.
20
    [099]   In one embodiment, some of the water-insoluble organic carrier liquid (e.g. 10%
    or more, 25% or more, 35% or more, 50% or more, 65% or more, 75% or more, or 90%
    or more, w/w) or all (i.e. 100%, w/w) of the water-insoluble organic carrier liquid is
    made up of one or more viscosity modifier selected from dibasic acid esters, fatty acid
25  esters and mixtures thereof.
    [0100] In one embodiment the one or more viscosity modifier (selected from dibasic acid
    esters, fatty acid esters and mixtures thereof) is present in an amount of from 2 to 40%
    w/w of the formulation, e.g. from 3 to 35% w/w. In one embodiment, it is used in an
30  amount of from 5 to 40% w/w, or from 5 to 35% w/w, or from 5 to 30% w/w; e.g. from 5
    to 25% w/w or from 5 to 20% w/w.
    [0101] In general, the dibasic acid ester may be an ester of any dicarboxylic acid with
    any alcohol and the fatty acid ester may be an ester of any fatty acid with any alcohol.
35

                                                   21
    [0102] The dibasic acid ester may be an ester of any dicarboxylic acid. The dicarboxylic
    acid may be straight chain or branched and may be saturated or unsaturated. The
    dicarboxylic acid may, for example, be a C2-C12 dicarboxylic acid, especially a C3-10
    dicarboxylic acid, e.g. a C3-8 dicarboxylic acid. In one embodiment the dicarboxylic acid
  5 is a saturated C3-8 dicarboxylic acid, which may be straight chain or branched, such as
    glutaric acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, 2-methylpentanoic acid, malonic acid, or pimelic
    acid.
    [0103] The alcohol used to form the ester may be any suitable monoalcohol or polyol,
10  such as a C1-12 alcohol, especially a Ci-10 alcohol, e.g. a C1-8 alcohol. It may, for
    example, be a sugar alcohol, such as sorbitol or mannitol, or it may be a monohydric
    alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol or butanol. The alcohol may be straight
    chain or it may be branched. In one embodiment the alcohol is a C1-6 monoalcohol,
    which may be straight chain or branched, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol (e.g., iso
15  propanol), butanol (e.g. n-butanol or iso-butanol), or is a C2-6 polyol, which may be
    straight chain or branched, such as sorbitol.
    [0104] The dibasic acid ester may, for example, be selected from dimethyl, sorbitol or
    diisobutyl esters of glutaric, succinic or adipic acids.
20
    [0105] The fatty acid ester may be an ester of any fatty acid. Where reference is made to
    a fatty acid in this regard, this is preferably a carboxylic acid with an aliphatic chain that
    is a C8-30 branched or unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, such as a C10-22 branched or
    unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, or a C 11-20 branched or unbranched alkyl or alkenyl
25  group,   e.g.  a C12-18    branched     or unbranched    alkyl or alkenyl group.     In some
    embodiments, the aliphatic chain may be a C8-24, or C1O-24, or C12-24, branched or
    unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group. In some embodiments, the aliphatic chain may be a
    C8-22, or C1O-22, or C12-22, branched or unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group.           In some
    embodiments, the aliphatic chain may be a C8-20, or C1O-20, or C12-20, branched or
30  unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group. The aliphatic chain may be saturated or unsaturated.
    [0106] The fatty acid may, for example, be oleic acid, capric acid, caprylic acid, linoleic
    acid, or lauric acid. Myristic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid may also be mentioned
    as examples.
35

                                                   22
    [0107] Branched fatty acid esters and/or unsaturated fatty acid esters may be preferred in
    some embodiments. Thus in some embodiments, the aliphatic chain may be a C8-24
    branched alkyl or alkenyl group. In other embodiments the aliphatic chain may be a C8
    24 branched or unbranched alkenyl group.
  5
    [0108] The alcohol used to form the ester may be any suitable monoalcohol or polyol,
    such as a C1-12 alcohol, especially a Ci-10 alcohol, e.g. a C1-8 alcohol. It may be a
    polyol (including sugar alcohols); for example it may be glycerol or pentaerythritol, or
    sorbitol or mannitol. It may be a monohydric alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol,
10  propanol, butanol, hexanol or 2-ethyl hexanol. The alcohol may be straight chain or it
    may be branched. In one embodiment the alcohol is a straight chain or branched C1-8
    mono alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol (e.g., iso-propanol), butanol (e.g. n
    butanol or iso-butanol) or 2-ethyl hexanol, or a straight chain or branched C2-8 polyol
    such as glycerol or pentaerythritol.
15
    [0109] In one embodiment, the fatty acid ester is selected from oleic acid esters (e.g. 2
    ethyl  hexyl    oleate or methyl      oleate),  capric/caprylic triglycerides (GTCC),  and
    pentaerythrityl esters of fatty acids.
20  [0110] Other fatty acid esters that can be mentioned include isopropyl myristate and 2
    ethylhexyl nonanoate. Fatty acid esters based on polypropylene glycol ethers could also
    be contemplated, e.g. PPG-2 myristyl ether propionate.
    [0111] Branched fatty acid esters (e.g. pentaerythrityl esters) or unsaturated fatty acid
25  esters (e.g. methyl oleate) may be preferred as they have low pour points (< 00 C) and
    enable the formulations to be stable at temperatures down to -20 0 C. Dibasic esters such
    as diisobutyl esters of glutaric, succinic or adipic acids (e.g. RHODIASOLV@ DIB,
    RHODIASOLV@ IRIS or RHODIASOLV@ RPDE, available from Solvay) are also
    beneficial options.
30
    [0112] Preferably the water-insoluble organic carrier liquid has a viscosity of less than
    1000 Pa.s, such as from 1 to1000 Pa.s or from 1 to 800 Pa.s or from 1 to 600 Pa.s; more
    preferably it is from 1 to 500 Pa.s. The viscosity may be measured at room temperature
    using a Brookfield Viscometer.
35

                                                  23
   [0113] Any suitable ratio of primary surfactant to water-insoluble organic carrier liquid
   may be used in the formulations of the invention.
   [0114] In one embodiment the ratio of primary surfactant to water-insoluble organic
 5 carrier liquid is from 10:1 to 0.5:1, e.g. from 8:1 to 0.6:1, preferably from 7:1 to 0.7:1,
   e.g. from 6:1 to 0.8:1.
   [0115] In one embodiment the ratio of primary surfactant to water-insoluble organic
   carrier liquid is from 5:1 to 1:1, e.g. from 4:1 to 1:1, preferably from 3:1 to 1:1, e.g. from
10 2.5:1 to 1.5:1.
   [0116] The formulation preferably has a cloud point of from 50 to 90 0 C which means that
   the active ingredients are available to act as defoamers at the operating temperatures of
   industrial systems such as those in oilfield applications but are less likely to be deposited
15 as particulate material on surfaces in the industrial system.         The skilled reader will
   appreciate that the cloud point (i.e. the temperature at which the material is no longer
   completely soluble in water, precipitating as a second phase and giving the fluid a cloudy
   appearance) can be determined using the cloud point test for nonionic surfactants (e.g.
   ASTM D2024-09). The skilled reader would understand that selection of materials with
20 different cloud points would permit a viable formulation with a cloud point in the desired
   range to be obtained.
   [0117] The formulation may optionally include one or more co-surfactants. It may be that
   these are selected from C6-22 or C6-20 alcohols where the carbon chain is a branched or
25 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group (e.g. 2-ethyl hexanol), end capped alcohol ethoxylates
   (e.g. ANTAROX@ L330 available from Solvay), acetylenic alcohols, C6-18 fatty acids,
   lecithins, fatty acid ethoxylates, fatty acid diesters of polyethylene glycol (e.g. PEG 600
   dioleate), fatty acid diesters of polypropylene glycol, sorbitan esters and sorbitan ester
   ethoxylates. They may also be unsaturated C8-C24 fatty alcohols.
30
   [0118] Where reference is made to a "fatty" group in this regard, that is preferably a C8
   30 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, such as a C10-22 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl
   group, or a C11-20 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, e.g. a C12-18 unbranched alkyl or
   alkenyl group. In some embodiments, the "fatty" group may be a C12-24 unbranched
35 alkyl or alkenyl group.

                                                    24
   [0119] The formulation may optionally include a co-surfactant that is selected from
   surfactants with an HLB greater than 11, such as 12 or higher, e.g. from 12 to 20 or from
   13 to 18.      This co-surfactant may be non-ionic, amphoteric             or anionic.      In one
 5 embodiment     this   co-surfactant is    selected    from C6-10     alkyl  polyglucosides     (e.g.
   SIMULSOL@         SL8   available   from Seppic),       C6-10   alkyldimethyl    betaines,   C6-10
   alkylamidopropyl betaines (e.g. MACKAM@ OCT-50 LS available from Solvay), C6-10
   alkyl amphoacetates (e.g. MACKAM@ 2CY-75 available from Solvay), Sodium C6
   C1O alkyl amphohydroxysulfonate           (e.g. MACKAM@         JS available    from Solvay) or
10 Sodium C8 mixed carboxylates (e.g. MIRANOL@ JEM CONC available from Solvay),
   C6-10 alkyl ampho(di)propionates         (e.g. MACKAM@         OIP-40 or MACKAM@ CY-SF
   available from Solvay) or       C6-10 tertiary amine derivatives such as amine oxides (e.g.
   MACKAMINE@ 654 available from Solvay), acyl sarcosinates and acyl taurates, C8-10
   diester and half-ester sulfocuccinates, C8-10 alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates and phosphate
15 esters.
   [0120] Other     co-surfactants   that   can   be   mentioned    include   C8-18    fatty   alcohol
   ethoxylates, e.g. in particular C9-11 alcohol ethoxylates (e.g. RHODASURF@ 860P
   available   from    Solvay) and iso-decyl       alkoxylates   (e.g.  RHODASURF@          DA-630E
20 available from Solvay), C8-18 alkyl polyglucosides (e.g. SIMULSOL 816 available
   from    Seppic),   glyceryl  fatty   acid   esters  (e.g.  polyglyceryl-3    oleate),   fatty acid
   alkoxylates such as castor oil derivatives (e.g. ALKAMULS@ VO/2003 available from
   Solvay),   C8-18    alkyl dimethylamine       oxides,   C8-18   alkylamidopropyl betaines and
   hydroxysultaines
25
   [0121] In one embodiment, the co-surfactant is selected from lecithins, C6-C22 branched
   alcohols (e.g. 2-ethyl hexanol or isostearyl alcohol), unsaturated C8-C24 fatty alcohols,
   (e.g. oleyl alcohol), alkyl polyglucosides (e.g. C4-C18 alkyl polyglucosides), C6-C1O
   phosphate esters, C8-10 alkyl dimethyl and alkyl amidopropyl betaines, C8-C1O alkyl
30 iminopropionates and C8-C1O alkyl amphodipropionates.
   [0122] Additional co-surfactants may be included in the formulation to adjust the cloud
   point of the dispersion in the presence of electrolytes such as brines.

                                                 25
   [0123] Preferred co-surfactants include branched alkoxylates, polyglyceryl esters and
   alkylpolyglycosides.    Alkyl    polyglycosides    are most  preferred  because   they are
   considered to be environmentally benign and meet OSPARCOM guidelines for chemicals
   for offshore use.
 5
   [0124] A co-surfactant is not essential. When co-surfactant is included it is preferably
   included in an amount of from 2 to 50% w/w, such as from 5 to 50% w/w, or from 10 to
   45% w/w.
10 [0125] In one embodiment, the total amount of surfactant present is 7% w/w or more,
   such as 10% w/w or more, e.g. 15% w/w or more or 20% w/w or more. It may be from 7
                                      7
   to 80% w/w, such as from 10 to       5% w/w or more, e.g. from 15 to 70%w/w or from 20 to
   65 %w/w.
15 [0126] In one embodiment, the formulations may have fatty acid included. This is
   beneficial in that it acts to promote the formation of the antifoam particles when the
   formulation is added to the brine solution. The "fatty" group may, for example, be a C8
   30 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, such as a C10-22 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl
   group, or a C11-20 unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, e.g. a C12-18 unbranched alkyl or
20 alkenyl group. In some embodiments, the "fatty" group may be a C12-24 unbranched
   alkyl or alkenyl group.
   [0127] The surfactants     used in the invention can be prepared using conventional
   methods.
25
   [0128] In one embodiment, the ratio of total surfactant (primary surfactant plus co
   surfactant) to water-insoluble organic carrier liquid is greater than 0.8:1, greater than
   0.9:1 or greater than 1:1. In one embodiment the ratio of total surfactant (primary
   surfactant plus co-surfactant) to water-insoluble organic carrier liquid is from 15:1 to
30 1:1, such as from 12:1 to 1:1, preferably from 10:1 to 1:1, e.g. from 9:1 to 1:1.
   [0129] In one embodiment the ratio of total surfactant to water-insoluble organic carrier
   liquid is from 8:1 to 1.5:1, e.g. from 7:1 to 2:1.

                                                  26
   [0130] The formulation may optionally include a water-soluble defoaming additive,
   which will therefore be present in the aqueous phase of the formulation. Such additives
   are well known in the art and may, for example, be a C3-12 alkyl glucoside, such as a
   C4-10 alkyl glucoside, e.g. butyl glucoside (such as SIMULSOL@ SL4 available from
 5 Seppic). These additives act to improve the rate that foam is destroyed when the
   formulation is applied to the foam.
   [0131] The inclusion of a water-soluble defoaming additive is beneficial in that it will be
   able to suppress the foam without causing secondary problems, such as emulsification or
10 being solubilised by hydrocarbons in the system being treated. Some surfactants may
   partition preferentially in the non-aqueous phase (loss of efficacy) and there is a
   potential bioaccumulation risk with surfactants in aquatic organisms.
   [0132] A    water-soluble    defoaming    additive is not essential.  When    water-soluble
15 defoaming additive is included it is preferably included in an amount of from 2 to 30%
   w/w, such as from 3 to 25% w/w, preferably from 5 to 25% w/w, e.g. from 5 to 20% w/w.
   [0133] The formulation may optionally include a water-soluble coupling agent, which
   will therefore be present in the aqueous phase of the formulation.      Such additives are
20 well known in the art and include dibasic acid amides, e.g. methyl-5-dimethylamino-2
   methyloxopentanoate      (available  as   RHODIASOLV@      POLACLEAN        from    Solvay),
   carbohydrates (e.g. sucrose, glucose, or fructose) and glycol ethers, such as 2-butoxy
   ethanol (butyl cellosolve).      Examples of coupling agents known for use in oilfield
   applications include glycols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and butylene
25 glycol, polyols such as glycerol and sorbitol, polyethylene glycols and C1-6 alcohols
   such as iso-propanol, butanol, ethanol and methanol. Generally, one or more coupling
   agents may be included to enhance the stability of the formulation at low temperatures.
   [0134] The coupling agents may purely be used as winterising agents and therefore do
30 not necessarily need to be matched to the surfactant to enhance performance. Glycols,
   such as propylene glycol, hexylene glycol or polyethylene glycols, are well known to
   suppress   liquid  crystalline phase    formation by concentrated aqueous      solutions  of
   surfactants (e.g. dishwash detergent compositions, as described in US2004/171504A).

                                                    27
    [0135] A water-soluble coupling agent is not essential. When water-soluble coupling
    agent is included it is preferably included in an amount of from 0.5 to 15% w/w, such as
    from 0.5 to 12% w/w, preferably from 1 to 10% w/w, e.g. from 2 to 8% w/w.
  5 [0136] The formulation may optionally include a water-soluble or water-dispersable
    rheology modifying agent. This will therefore be present in the aqueous phase of the
    formulation. The agent may suitably be a polymer, which may be natural or synthetic.
    Examples of natural polymers include xanthan gum, guar gums, modified guars, pectin,
    gum arabic, carageenan, alginates, and modified cellulose (e.g. carboxymethylated or
10  hydroxypropyl cellulose). Synthetic polymers include polyacrylates and hydrophobically
    modified polyacrylates (e.g. RHEOMER@ 33 available from Solvay).
    [0137] A rheology modifying agent is not essential. When rheology modifying agent is
    included it is preferably included in an amount of from 0.05 to 3% w/w, such as from
15  0.05 to 2% w/w, preferably from 0.1 to 1% w/w, e.g. from 0.2 to 0.8% w/w.
    [0138] The formulation may optionally also include scale inhibitors (or sequestrants),
    which can prevent or reduce the formation of scale or aid the dissolution of scale. Scale
    is known to help stabilize foam and therefore it can be beneficial to inhibit scale and/or
20  dissolve   scale.    Examples     of   scale    inhibitors    include  polycarboxylates     (e.g.
    polyaspartate), phosphonates, sulfonate polymers and copolymers (e.g. salts of vinyl
    sulfonic   acid,   styrene   sulfonic    acid,   alkyloxy-2-hydroxypropylsulfonic      acid    or
    acrylamido (methylpropyl) sulfonic acid), succinates, citrates and end capped vinyl
    copolymers. Hexacyanoferrates,       nitrilotrialkanamides     and sulfonated polycarboxylate
25  copolymers may also be mentioned.
    [0139] A scale inhibitor is not essential. When scale inhibitor is included it is preferably
    included in an amount of from 0.05 to 8% w/w, such as from 0.05 to 6% w/w, preferably
    from 0.1 to 5% w/w, e.g. from 0.5 to 4% w/w.
30
    [0140] The formulation may optionally also include preservatives, which can act to
    inhibit bacterial or fungal growth. Examples include potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate,
    benzyl       alcohol,       dehydroxyacetic         acid,        phenoxyethanol,      parabens,
    methylchlorothiazolinone,     methylisothiazolinone,       and carbamates    (including  iodine
35  derivatives such as iodopropynyl butylcarbamate).

                                                  28
    [0141] A preservative is not essential. When preservative is included it may be added to
    the extent required, depending on the environment in which the formulation is to be
    stored and/or used. It may in one embodiment be included in an amount of from 0.05 to
  5 10% w/w, such as from 0.05 to 5% w/w, preferably from 0.1 to 3% w/w, e.g. from 0.5 to
    2% w/w.
    [0142] The pH of the formulation is suitably from 4 to 8, and preferably from 5 to 7.
10  [0143] In one embodiment, the microemulsion of the present invention is an emulsion
    whose mean droplet size is less than or equal to about 0.15pim. The size of the
    microemulsion droplets may be measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS).           This may
    involve   using   apparatus   such as,   for example,    a   Spectra-Physics  2020   laser,  a
    Brookhaven 2030 correlator and the associated computer-based equipment. If the sample
15  is concentrated, it may be diluted in deionized water and filtered through a 0.22plm filter
    to have a final concentration of 2% by weight. The diameter obtained is an apparent
    diameter.   The measurements      are taken at    angles   of 900 and 1350.     For the   size
    measurements, besides the standard analysis with cumulents, three exploitations of the
    autocorrelation function are used (exponential       sampling or EXPSAM described by
20  Professor Pike, the "Non Negatively Constrained Least Squares" or NNLS method, and
    the CONTIN method described by Professor Provencher), which each give a size
    distribution weighted by the scattered intensity, rather than by the mass or the number.
    The refractive index and the viscosity of the water are taken into account.
25  [0144] According     to   one   embodiment,     the  microemulsion     is  transparent.   The
    microemulsion may have, for example, a transmittance of at least 90% and preferably of
    at least 95% at a wavelength of 600 nm, for example measured using a Lambda 40 UV
    visible spectrometer.
30  [0145] According to another embodiment, the emulsion is an emulsion whose mean
    droplet size is greater than or equal to 0.15 pm, for example greater than 0.5 pm, or 1 pm,
    or 2 pm, or 10 pm, or 20 pm, and preferably less than 100 pm. The droplet size may be
    measured by optical microscopy         and/or laser granulometry      (Horiba LA-910     laser
    scattering analyzer).

   [0146] The foam control formulations of the invention may be used in the same manner
   as a conventional foam control formulation.
   [0147] The foam control formulations of the invention may suitably be used to prevent or
 5 reduce foam formation in an industrial aqueous system.
   [0148] The industrial aqueous system may, in one embodiment, be an aqueous system in
   a hydrocarbon       plant;   this may be a plant for exploration,         recovery, refining or
   distribution of hydrocarbon. For example, the aqueous system may be an oil or gas plant.
10 In one such embodiment the aqueous system is an oilfield system, such as an oilfield
   production system or an oilfield distribution system. In another such embodiment the
   aqueous system is a downstream oil-related system, such as an oil refining system.
   [0149] The industrial aqueous system may in an alternative embodiment be an aqueous
15 system in a chemical plant, e.g. a chemical manufacturing, processing or distribution
   plant.
   [0150] The industrial aqueous system may in another alternative embodiment be a water
   plant, e.g. an industrial water treatment or distribution system.
20
   [0151] The industrial aqueous system may in another alternative embodiment be a paper
   manufacturing plant.
   [0152] The aqueous fluid may be flowing or may be stationery. Thus the aqueous fluid
25 may, for example, be in a pipe or other conduit or may be in a tank or other storage
   container.
   [0153] Preferably the system is one where there is a high level of agitation. The present
   invention is particularly beneficial in being able to not only reduce levels of existing
30 foam (partially or fully) but also being able to prevent formation of new foam (partially
   or fully). This is an important characteristic in systems with a lot of agitation, which are
   prone to experiencing foam re-forming after the system has been treated with a defoamer.
   [0154] In one embodiment, the aqueous fluid is at a temperature of 120 0 C or less, such as
35 100 0 C or less, e.g. 95 0 C or less, such as from 10 to 90 0 C or from 20 to 85 0C.

   The formulations were prepared using the following procedure:
        i)     Charge primary surfactant(s) to a clean beaker. Heat contents if required to
 5             melt any solids or pastes. Surfactant mixture should be heated to 40 to
               500C to avoid gelling of the product as it is processed.
        ii)    Add the    dibasic ester/ fatty acid ester/oil components.       Mix until a
               homogeneous suspension is obtained.
        iii)   Add co-surfactant and mix until homogeneous.           Surfactants containing
10             water may produce a liquid crystalline dispersion (lamellar phase). Cool
               mixture to 40 to 50 0 C.
        iv)    Add 25% of the water charge to the mixture and mix until a homogeneous
               composition is obtained.
        v)     Add coupling agent and mix until homogeneous.

   Dynamic Foam Tests
   The performance      of the microemulsions     was benchmarked       against commercial
   defoamer/antifoam products using a dynamic foam test apparatus.            The equipment
25 comprised a jacketed 1000ml cylinder with graduations and a gas sparge tube (No 2
   frit). The gas sparge tube was connected to a flow meter rated for use at a gas pressure
   of 20 psi. A model brine and hydrocarbon mixture (200 ml) was used to simulate
   production fluids at 500 C. The brine/oil ratio (v/v) was 90/10 and the mixture was
   comprised of 5% w/w NaCl or 5% w/w NaCl/1% w/w CaCl 2 and Isopar M
30 respectively. An amphoteric surfactant, lauramidopropyl hydroxysultaine (MACKAM
   LSB-50 from Solvay) was used as the foaming agent for the tests.
   The brine and hydrocarbon mixture was allowed to equilibrate at 500 C before 5000
   ppm a.i amphoteric surfactant was introduced at the top of the apparatus using a
35 dropping pipette. The solution was sparged with 0.5 1/min of nitrogen gas and the

                                               37
   foam volume was allowed to increase until it reached a height of 400 ml in the
   measuring cylinder. The gas was turned off and the defoamer (500 - 5000 ppm) added
   using a pipette onto the foam. The foam decay rate was monitored for a period of up
   to five minutes in order to assess the defoaming performance of the formulation.
 5
   When the allotted time period had passed, nitrogen gas (0.5 1/min) was re-introduced
   to create more foam. The foam volume was allowed to increase to 300 ml before
   turning off the gas supply. The foam decay rate was then monitored for a further
   period of time (five minutes maximum). This test was used to assess the antifoam
10 performance of the formulation.
   Defoaming     and antifoam    performance    of the   microemulsion  formulations  were
   benchmarked      against two   commercially     available  antifoams  -  'silicone free'
   hydrophobic solid/oil dispersion and a silicone o/w emulsion - used to control foam in
15 oilfield applications. The products were used as supplied.
   Results
   Formulations F1-F1O
20
   The following results were obtained for the defoamer formulations in 5% w/w NaCl or
   5% w/w NaCl and 1% w/w CaCl 2 respectively at 50 0C.
   The defoamer performance was compared to the foam decay rate of 5000 ppm
25 surfactant (blank).
   The foam volumes measured were corrected for the volume of liquid in the column,
   i.e. 200 ml.

       Stability Tests
       Samples of the microemulsion formulations were stored at -5 0 C, 5 0C, ambient temperature
       and 40 0 C for a period of one month.
5
       Formulations that remained low viscosity dispersions at low temperature              and did not
       separate on storage at each respective temperature were assessed as being suitable for use.
       Microemulsion formulations which became translucent or opaque at low temperature, did
       not separate into distinct layers and cleared on heating to ambient temperatures were also
0      characterised as being stable. The opacity observed was attributed to the presence of
       saturated fatty acids (vegetable oils) and fatty alcohols present in the formulation.
       The microemulsions were also subjected to freeze/thaw tests to determine whether the
       formulations would separate or not.

          Discussion
          The microemulsion formulations of the invention were found to be effective defoamers. The
 [0       microemulsion formulations of the invention also had an adequate antifoam performance.
          The microemulsions were found to remove 80 - 90% of the foam generated in less than
          sixty seconds.
15        The microemulsion formulations of the invention were found to be very stable, across a
          wide temperature range. They were also very easy to manufacture.
          It is highly unlikely the formulations of the invention would persist in downstream
          operations, i.e. refining. They are also more benign to the environment; the majority of the
20        components in the formulations are biodegradable.
          The formulations are also they are non-depositing (do not contain solids).

                                                 45
  Further, it is relatively easy to adapt the formulation, demonstrating the flexibility of the
  technology.    For example, the formulations may have fatty acid included to promote the
  formation of the antifoam particles when the formulation is added to the brine solution.
5 The formulations were also found to be more effective defoamers and antifoams compared
  to the commercial solid/oil antifoam used to benchmark the performance.
  Accordingly, it is clear that the formulations of the invention are low viscosity dispersions
  and are stable over a wide temperature range compared to commercial antifoams. The
0 formulations have a clear or translucent appearance and are concentrated dispersions of
  surfactants and hydrophobic liquids. The formulations exhibited moderate to good antifoam
  performance and very effective de-foaming performance.
  Overall, the formulations of the invention provide a combination of properties that is highly
5 desirable; in particular the invention permits the provision of stable, low viscosity products,
  which can     therefore   be  easily  injected into  fluid  environments    and  therefore  are
  straightforward to disperse effectively, which are highly effective at de-foaming and also
  have an anti-foaming effect.
