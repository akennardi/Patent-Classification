   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
                The invention relates generally to treatment of hyperproliferative disorders such as cancer
   with compounds that inhibit P13 kinase activity. The invention also relates to methods of using
10 the compounds for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells, or
   associated pathological conditions.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
                Combinations of anti-cancer pharmaceutical therapeutics administered simultaneously or
   sequentially in a dosing regimen are now common in cancer treatment. Successful combination
15 therapy provides improved and even synergistic effect over mono-therapy, i.e. pharmaceutical
   treatment limited to one drug (Ouchi et al (2006) Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 57:693-702;
   Higgins et al (2004) Anti-Cancer Drugs 15:503-512). Preclinical research has been the basis for
   prediction of clinical stage synergy of anti-cancer pharmaceutical therapeutic combinations such
   as capecitabine and taxanes for the treatment of breast cancer (Sawada et al (1998) Clin. Cancer
20 Res. 4:1013-1019). Certain doses and schedules of combination therapy can improve safety
   without compromising efficacy (O'Shaughnessy et al (2006) Clin. Breast Cancer Apr 7(1):42
   50). Synergistic effects in vitro have been correlated with clinical stage synergy (Steinbach et al
   (2003) Clin. Inf. Dis. Oct 1:37 Suppl 3:S188-224).

                                                       -2
                Upregulation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is a
   common feature in most cancers (Yuan and Cantley (2008) Oncogene 27:5497-510). Genetic
   deviations in the pathway have been detected in many human cancers (Osaka et al (2004)
   Apoptosis 9:667-76) and act primarily to stimulate cell proliferation, migration and survival.
 5 Activation of the pathway occurs following activating point mutations or amplifications of the
   PIK3CA gene encoding the p1 10a P13K isoforms (Hennessy et al (2005) Nat. Rev. Drug Discov.
   4:988-1004). Genetic deletion or loss of function mutations within the tumor suppressor PTEN,
   a phosphatase with opposing function to PI3K, also increases P13K pathway signaling (Zhang
   and Yu (2010) Clin. Cancer Res. 16:4325-30. These aberrations lead to increased downstream
10 signaling through kinases such as Akt and mTOR and increased activity of the P13K pathway has
   been proposed as a hallmark of resistance to cancer treatment (Opel et al (2007) Cancer Res.
   67:735-45; Razis et al (2011) Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 128:447-56).
                Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (P13K) is a major signaling node for key survival and
   growth signals for lymphomas and is opposed by the activity of the phosphatase PTEN. The
15 P13K pathway is dysregulated in aggressive forms of lymphoma (Abubaker (2007) Leukemia
   21:2368-2370). Eight percent of DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) cancers have PI3CA
   (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase catalytic subunit alpha) missense mutations and 37% are PTEN
   negative by immunohistochemistry test.
                Phosphatidylinositol is one of a number of phospholipids found in cell membranes, and
20 which participate in intracellular signal transduction. Cell signaling via 3'-phosphorylated
   phosphoinositides has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, e.g., malignant
   transformation, growth factor signaling, inflammation, and immunity (Rameh et al (1999) J. Biol
   Chem. 274:8347-8350). The enzyme responsible for generating these phosphorylated signaling
   products, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (also referred to as PI 3-kinase or P13K), was originally
25 identified as an activity associated with viral oncoproteins and growth factor receptor tyrosine
   kinases that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its phosphorylated derivatives at the 3'
   hydroxyl of the inositol ring (Panayotou et al (1992) Trends Cell Biol 2:358-60).
   Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (P13K) are lipid kinases that phosphorylate lipids at the 3-hydroxyl
   residue of an inositol ring (Whitman et al (1988) Nature, 332:664). The 3-phosphorylated
30 phospholipids (PIP3s) generated by P13-kinases act as second messengers recruiting kinases with
   lipid binding domains (including plekstrin homology (PH) regions), such as Akt and PDK1,
   phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (Vivanco et al (2002) Nature Rev. Cancer 2:489; Phillips
   10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                            -3
   et al (1998) Cancer 83:41).
                The P13 kinase family comprises at least 15 different enzymes sub-classified by structural
   homology and are divided into 3 classes based on sequence homology and the product formed by
   enzyme catalysis. The class I P13 kinases are composed of 2 subunits: a 110 kd catalytic subunit
 5 and an 85 kd regulatory subunit. The regulatory subunits contain SH2 domains and bind to
   tyrosine residues phosphorylated by growth factor receptors with a tyrosine kinase activity or
   oncogene products, thereby inducing the P13K activity of the p110 catalytic subunit which
   phosphorylates its lipid substrate. Class I P13 kinases are involved in important signal
   transduction events downstream of cytokines, integrins, growth factors and immunoreceptors,
10 which suggests that control of this pathway may lead to important therapeutic effects such as
   modulating cell proliferation and carcinogenesis. Class I PI3Ks can phosphorylate
   phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5
   biphosphate (PIP2) to produce phosphatidylinositol-3 -phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol-3,4
   biphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, respectively. Class II PI3Ks
15 phosphorylate PI and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. Class III PI3Ks can only phosphorylate
   PI. A key P13-kinase isoform in cancer is the Class I P13-kinase, p1 l0a as indicated by recurrent
   oncogenic mutations in p1 10a (Samuels et al (2004) Science 304:554; US 5824492; US
   5846824; US 6274327). Other isoforms may be important in cancer and are also implicated in
   cardiovascular and immune-inflammatory disease (Workman P (2004) Biochem Soc Trans
20 32:393-396; Patel et al (2004) Proc. Am. Assoc. of Cancer Res. (Abstract LB-247) 95th Annual
   Meeting, March 27-31, Orlando, Florida, USA; Ahmadi K and Waterfield MD (2004)
   "Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase: Function and Mechanisms" Encyclopedia of Biological Chemistry
   (Lennarz W J, Lane M D eds) Elsevier/Academic Press), Oncogenic mutations of p 10 alpha
   have been found at a significant frequency in colon, breast, brain, liver, ovarian, gastric, lung,
25 and head and neck solid tumors. About 35-40% of hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast
   cancer tumors harbor a PIK3CA mutation. PTEN abnormalities are found in glioblastoma,
   melanoma, prostate, endometrial, ovarian, breast, lung, head and neck, hepatocellular, and
   thyroid cancers.
                P13 kinase is a heterodimer consisting of p85 and p1 10 subunits (Otsu et al (1991) Cell
30 65:91-104; Hiles et al (1992) Cell 70:419-29). Four distinct Class I PI3Ks have been identified,
   designated P13K a (alpha),         P (beta), 6 (delta), and co (gamma), each consisting of a distinct 110
   kDa catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit. Three of the catalytic subunits, i.e., p1 10 alpha,
   10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                      -4
   p 1 10 beta and p1 10 delta, each interact with the same regulatory subunit, p85; whereas p1 10
   gamma interacts with a distinct regulatory subunit, p101. The patterns of expression of each of
   these PI3Ks in human cells and tissues are distinct. In each of the P13K alpha, beta, and delta
   subtypes, the p85 subunit acts to localize P13 kinase to the plasma membrane by the interaction
 5 of its SH2 domain with phosphorylated tyrosine residues (present in an appropriate sequence
   context) in target proteins (Rameh et al (1995) Cell, 83:821-30; Volinia et al (1992) Oncogene,
   7:789-93).
                Measuring expression levels of biomarkers (e.g., secreted proteins in plasma) can be an
   effective means to identify patients and patient populations that will respond to specific therapies
10 including, e.g., treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. There is a need for more effective
   means for determining which patients with hyperproliferative disorders such as cancer will
   respond to which treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, and for incorporating such
   determinations into more effective treatment regimens for patients, whether the
   chemotherapeutic agents are used as single agents or combined with other agents.
15              The P13 kinase/Akt/PTEN pathway is an attractive target for cancer drug development
   since such agents would be expected to inhibit cellular proliferation, to repress signals from
   stromal cells that provide for survival and chemoresistance of cancer cells, to reverse the
   repression of apoptosis and surmount intrinsic resistance of cancer cells to cytotoxic agents. P13
   kinase inhibitors have been reported (Yaguchi et al (2006) Jour. of the Nat. Cancer Inst.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
                 Reference will now be made in detail to certain embodiments of the invention, examples
    of which are illustrated in the accompanying structures and formulas. While the invention will
    be described in conjunction with the enumerated embodiments, it will be understood that they
25  are not intended to limit the invention to those embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is
    intended to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents which may be included within
    the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims. One skilled in the art will recognize
    many methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein, which could be used
    in the practice of the present invention. The present invention is in no way limited to the
30  methods and materials described. In the event that one or more of the incorporated literature,
    10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                        -34
   patents, and similar materials differs from or contradicts this application, including but not
   limited to defined terms, term usage, described techniques, or the like, this application controls.
   DEFINITIONS
                The words "comprise," "comprising," "include," "including," and "includes" when used
 5 in this specification and claims are intended to specify the presence of stated features, integers,
   components, or steps, but they do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other
   features, integers, components, steps, or groups thereof.
                The terms "treat" and "treatment" refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or
   preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired
10 physiological change or disorder, such as the growth, development or spread of cancer. For
   purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to,
   alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state
   of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state,
   and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. "Treatment" can
15 also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment.
   Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those
   prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be
   prevented.
                The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of a compound of the
20 present invention that (i) treats the particular disease, condition, or disorder, (ii) attenuates,
   ameliorates, or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder,
   or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition,
   or disorder described herein. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the
   drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some
25 extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to
   some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or
   relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent
   the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or
   cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can be measured, for example, by assessing the time to
30 disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the response rate (RR).

                The term "detection" includes any means of detecting, including direct and indirect
   detection.
                The term "diagnosis" is used herein to refer to the identification or classification of a
   molecular or pathological state, disease or condition. For example, "diagnosis" may refer to
 5 identification of a particular type of cancer, e.g., a lung cancer. "Diagnosis" may also refer to the
   classification of a particular type of cancer, e.g., by histology (e.g., a non small cell lung
   carcinoma), by molecular features (e.g., a lung cancer characterized by nucleotide and/or amino
   acid variation(s) in a particular gene or protein), or both.
                The term "prognosis" is used herein to refer to the prediction of the likelihood of cancer
10 attributable death or progression, including, for example, recurrence, metastatic spread, and drug
   resistance, of a neoplastic disease, such as cancer.
                The term "prediction" (and variations such as predicting) is used herein to refer to the
   likelihood that a patient will respond either favorably or unfavorably to a drug or set of drugs. In
   one embodiment, the prediction relates to the extent of those responses. In another embodiment,
15 the prediction relates to whether and/or the probability that a patient will survive following
   treatment, for example treatment with a particular therapeutic agent and/or surgical removal of
   the primary tumor, and/or chemotherapy for a certain period of time without cancer recurrence.
   The predictive methods of the invention can be used clinically to make treatment decisions by
   choosing the most appropriate treatment modalities for any particular patient. The predictive
20 methods of the present invention are valuable tools in predicting if a patient is likely to respond
   favorably to a treatment regimen, such as a given therapeutic regimen, including for example,
   administration of a given therapeutic agent or combination, surgical intervention, chemotherapy,
   etc., or whether long-term survival of the patient, following a therapeutic regimen is likely.
                The term "increased resistance" to a particular therapeutic agent or treatment option,
25 when used in accordance with the invention, means decreased response to a standard dose of the
   drug or to a standard treatment protocol.
                The term "decreased sensitivity" to a particular therapeutic agent or treatment option,
   when used in accordance with the invention, means decreased response to a standard dose of the
   agent or to a standard treatment protocol, where decreased response can be compensated for (at

                A "biomarker" is a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an
   indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to
   a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers may be of several types: predictive, prognostic, or
   pharmacodynamics (PD). Predictive biomarkers predict which patients are likely to respond or
15 benefit from a particular therapy. Prognostic biomarkers predict the likely course of the patient's
   disease and may guide treatment. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers confirm drug activity, and
   enables optimization of dose and administration schedule.
                "Change" or "modulation" of the status of a biomarker, including a PIK3CA mutation or
   set of PIK3CA mutations, as it occurs in vitro or in vivo is detected by analysis of a biological
20 sample using one or more methods commonly employed in establishing pharmacodynamics (PD),
   including: (1) sequencing the genomic DNA or reverse-transcribed PCR products of the
   biological sample, whereby one or more mutations are detected; (2) evaluating gene expression
   levels by quantitation of message level or assessment of copy number; and (3) analysis of
   proteins by immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, ELISA, or mass spectrometry
25 whereby degradation, stabilization, or post-translational modifications of the proteins such as
   phosphorylation or ubiquitination is detected.
                The terms "cancer" and "cancerous" refer to or describe the physiological condition in
   mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A "tumor" comprises one or
   more cancerous cells. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma,
30 blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such
   cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g., epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer

   carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic
   carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer. Gastric cancer,
   as used herein, includes stomach cancer, which can develop in any part of the stomach and may
   spread throughout the stomach and to other organs; particularly the esophagus, lungs, lymph
10 nodes, and the liver.
                The term "hematopoietic malignancy" refers to a cancer or hyperproliferative disorder
   generated during hematopoiesis involving cells such as leukocytes, lymphocytes, natural killer
   cells, plasma cells, and myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocytes. Hematopoietic
   malignancies include non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large hematopoietic lymphoma,
15 follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma,
   acute myelogenous leukemia, and myeloid cell leukemia. Lymphocytic leukemia (or
   "lymphoblastic") includes Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Chronic lymphocytic
   leukemia (CLL). Myelogenous leukemia (also "myeloid" or "nonlymphocytic") includes Acute
   myelogenous (or Myeloblastic) leukemia (AML) and Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).
20              A "chemotherapeutic agent" is a biological (large molecule) or chemical (small molecule)
   compound useful in the treatment of cancer, regardless of mechanism of action.
                The term "mammal" includes, but is not limited to, humans, mice, rats, guinea pigs,
   monkeys, dogs, cats, horses, cows, pigs and sheep.
                The term "package insert" is used to refer to instructions customarily included in
25 commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications,
   usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and/or warnings concerning the use of such
   therapeutic products.
                The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically
   acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention. Exemplary salts include,
30 but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate,

   ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1 '-methylene-bis -(2
 5 hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of
   another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion
   may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound.
   Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its
   structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable
10 salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or
   more charged atoms and/or one or more counter ion.
                The desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method
   available in the art. For example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as
   hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, methanesulfonic acid, phosphoric
15 acid and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid,
   mandelic acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid,
   a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid, such as
   citric acid or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid,
   such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or
20 ethanesulfonic acid, or the like. Acids which are generally considered suitable for the formation
   of pharmaceutically useful or acceptable salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are
   discussed, for example, by P. Stahl et al, Camille G. (eds.) Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts.

                The term "synergistic" as used herein refers to a therapeutic combination which is more
   effective than the additive effects of the two or more single agents. A determination of a
   synergistic interaction between a compound of GDC-0032 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
   thereof and one or more chemotherapeutic agent may be based on the results obtained from the
 5 assays described herein. The results of these assays can be analyzed using the Chou and Talalay
   combination method and Dose-Effect Analysis with CalcuSyn software in order to obtain a
   Combination Index (Chou and Talalay, 1984, Adv. Enzyme Regul. 22:27-55). The combinations
   provided by this invention have been evaluated in several assay systems, and the data can be
   analyzed utilizing a standard program for quantifying synergism, additivism, and antagonism
10 among anticancer agents. The program utilized, for example in Figure 10, is that described by
   Chou and Talalay, in "New Avenues in Developmental Cancer Chemotherapy," Academic Press,
   1987, Chapter 2. Combination Index values less than 0.8 indicates synergy, values greater than
   1.2 indicate antagonism and values between 0.8 and 1.2 indicate additive effects. The
   combination therapy may provide "synergy" and prove "synergistic", i.e., the effect achieved
15 when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from
   using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active
   ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined,
   unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or
   (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be
20 attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., by different
   injections in separate syringes or in separate pills or tablets. In general, during alternation
   therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially,
   whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are
   administered together. Combination effects were evaluated using both the BLISS independence
25 model and the highest single agent (HSA) model (Lehir et al. 2007, Molecular Systems Biology
   3:80). BLISS scores quantify degree of potentiation from single agents and a BLISS score > 0
   suggests greater than simple additivity. An HSA score > 0 suggests a combination effect greater
   than the maximum of the single agent responses at corresponding concentrations.
                "ELISA" (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is a popular format of a "wet-lab" type
30 analytic biochemistry assay that uses one sub-type of heterogeneous, solid-phase enzyme
   immunoassay (EIA) to detect the presence of a substance in a liquid sample or wet sample
   (Engvall E, Perlman P (1971). "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Quantitative

   (1971). "Immunoassay using antigen-enzyme conjugates". FEBS Letters 15 (3): 232-236).
   ELISA can perform other forms of ligand binding assays instead of strictly "immuno" assays,
   though the name carried the original "immuno" because of the common use and history of
 5 development of this method. The technique essentially requires any ligating reagent that can be
   immobilized on the solid phase along with a detection reagent that will bind specifically and use
   an enzyme to generate a signal that can be properly quantified. In between the washes only the
   ligand and its specific binding counterparts remain specifically bound or "immunosorbed" by
   antigen-antibody interactions to the solid phase, while the nonspecific or unbound components
10 are washed away. Unlike other spectrophotometric wet lab assay formats where the same
   reaction well (e.g. a cuvette) can be reused after washing, the ELISA plates have the reaction
   products immunosorbed on the solid phase which is part of the plate and thus are not easily
   reusable. Performing an ELISA involves at least one antibody with specificity for a particular
   antigen. The sample with an unknown amount of antigen is immobilized on a solid support
15 (usually a polystyrene microtiter plate) either non-specifically (via adsorption to the surface) or
   specifically (via capture by another antibody specific to the same antigen, in a "sandwich"
   ELISA). After the antigen is immobilized, the detection antibody is added, forming a complex
   with the antigen. The detection antibody can be covalently linked to an enzyme, or can itself be
   detected by a secondary antibody that is linked to an enzyme through bioconjugation. Between
20 each step, the plate is typically washed with a mild detergent solution to remove any proteins or
   antibodies that are not specifically bound. After the final wash step, the plate is developed by
   adding an enzymatic substrate to produce a visible signal, which indicates the quantity of antigen
   in the sample.
                "Immunohistochemistry" (IHC) refers to the process of detecting antigens (e.g., proteins)
25 in cells of a tissue section by exploiting the principle of antibodies binding specifically to
   antigens in biological tissues. Immunohistochemical staining is widely used in the diagnosis of
   abnormal cells such as those found in cancerous tumors. Specific molecular markers are
   characteristic of particular cellular events such as proliferation or cell death (apoptosis). IHC is
   also widely used to understand the distribution and localization of biomarkers and differentially
30 expressed proteins in different parts of a biological tissue. Visualising an antibody-antigen
   interaction can be accomplished in a number of ways. In the most common instance, an antibody
   is conjugated to an enzyme, such as peroxidase, that can catalyze a color-producing reaction (see
   10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                      -41
   immunoperoxidase staining). Alternatively, the antibody can also be tagged to a fluorophore,
   such as fluorescein or rhodamine (see immunofluorescence).
                "Immunocytochemistry" (ICC) is a common laboratory technique that uses antibodies
   that target specific peptides or protein antigens in the cell via specific epitopes. These bound
 5 antibodies can then be detected using several different methods. ICC can evaluate whether or not
   cells in a particular sample express the antigen in question. In cases where an immunopositive
   signal is found, ICC also determines which sub-cellular compartments are expressing the
   antigen.

   single agents and in combination (Hoeflich et al (2012) Cancer Research, 72(1):210-219; US
   20110086837). Aberrant activation of the ERK pathway is common in human tumors. This
   pathway consists of a three-tiered kinase module comprising the kinases RAF, mitogen-activated
   protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) that
10 functions as a negative feedback amplifier to confer robustness and stabilization of pathway
   output. Because the ERK pathway is frequently dysregulated in human cancers, intense efforts
   are under way to develop selective inhibitors of the ERK pathway as anticancer drugs. The
   combination of GDC-0973 with the P13K inhibitor GDC-0941 resulted in combination efficacy
   in vitro and in vivo via induction of biomarkers associated with apoptosis, including Bcl-2

                Tamoxifen (NOLVADEX@, ISTUBAL@, VALODEX@, CAS Reg. No. 10540-29-1) is
   an antagonist of the estrogen receptor in breast tissue via its active metabolite,
   hydroxytamoxifen. In other tissues such as the endometrium, it behaves as an agonist, and thus
   may be characterized as a mixed agonist/antagonist (New Engl. J. Med. (2009) 361:766 Aug. 20,
15 2009). Tamoxifen is the usual endocrine (anti-estrogen) therapy for hormone receptor-positive
   breast cancer in pre-menopausal women, and is also a standard in post-menopausal women
   although aromatase inhibitors are also frequently used in that setting. Tamoxifen is currently
   used for the treatment of both early and advanced ER+ (estrogen receptor positive) breast cancer
   in pre- and post-menopausal women (Jordan, V. (1993) Br J Pharmacol 110(2): 507

   down-regulating and by degrading the estrogen receptor (Croxtall (2011) Drugs 71(3):363-380).
   Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor down-regulator (SERD). Fulvestrant is indicated for
   the treatment of hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women

15              Dexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid steroid hormone, with anti-inflammatory and
   immunosuppressant activity. In oncology, dexamethasone is given to cancer patients undergoing
   chemotherapy, to counteract certain side-effects of their antitumor treatment. Dexamethasone
   can augment the antiemetic effect of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists like ondansetron.
   Dexamethasone is also used in certain hematological malignancies, especially in the treatment of
20 multiple myeloma, in which dexamethasone is given alone or together with thalidomide (thal
   dex) or a combination of Adriamycin (doxorubicin) and vincristine (VAD). In brain tumors
   (primary or metastatic), dexamethasone is used to counteract the development of edema, which
   could eventually compress other brain structures. Dexamethasone is named as

   HER2 (US 6054297; US 6407213; US 6800738; US 6627196, US 6949245; US 7041292).
   Pertuzumab and trastuzumab target different extracellular regions of the HER-2 tyrosine kinase
   receptor (Nahta et al (2004) Cancer Res. 64:2343-2346). The hybridoma cell line expressing
10 2C4 (pertuzumab) was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801
   University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, USA as ATCC HB-12697 on April 8, 1999.
   Pertuzumab blocks the ability of the HER2 receptor to collaborate with other HER receptor
   family members, i.e. HER1I/EGFR, HER3, and HER4 (Agus et al (2002) Cancer Cell 2:127-37;
   Jackson et al (2004) Cancer Res 64:2601-9; Takai et al (2005) Cancer 104:2701-8; US
15 6949245). In cancer cells, interfering with the ability of HER2 to collaborate with other HER
   family receptors blocks cell signaling and may ultimately lead to cancer cell growth inhibition
   and death of the cancer cell. HDIs, because of their unique mode of action, have the potential to
   work in a wide variety of tumors, including those that do not overexpress HER2 (Mullen et al
   (2007) Molecular Cancer Therapeutics 6:93-100). Pertuzumab is being developed for the
20 treatment of metastatic HER2-positive (+) breast cancer.

15 framework regions with the complementarity-determining regions of a murine antibody (4D5)
   that binds to HER2. Trastuzumab binds to the HER2 antigen and thus inhibits the growth of
   cancerous cells. Trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit

   7060269; US 7169901; US 7297334) used in the treatment of cancer, where it inhibits tumor
   growth by blocking the formation of new blood vessels. Bevacizumab was the first clinically
 5 available angiogenesis inhibitor in the United States, approved by the FDA in 2004 for use in
   combination with standard chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic colon cancer and most
   forms of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Several late-stage clinical studies are underway
   to determine its safety and effectiveness for patients with: adjuvant / non-metastatic colon
   cancer, metastatic breast cancer, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, metastatic glioblastoma
10 multiforme, metastatic ovarian cancer, metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer, and
   metastatic metastatic or unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
                An anti-VEGF antibody will usually not bind to other VEGF homologues such as VEGF
   B or VEGF-C, nor other growth factors such as PlGF, PDGF or bFGF. Preferred anti-VEGF
   antibodies include a monoclonal antibody that binds to the same epitope as the monoclonal anti
15 VEGF antibody A4.6.1 produced by hybridoma ATCC HB 10709; a recombinant humanized
   anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody generated according to Presta et al. (1997) Cancer Res.
   57:4593-4599, including but not limited to bevacizumab which includes mutated human IgG1
   framework regions and antigen-binding complementarity-determining regions from the murine
   anti-hVEGF monoclonal antibody A.4.6.1 that blocks binding of human VEGF to its receptors.
20 Approximately 93% of the amino acid sequence of bevacizumab, including most of the
   framework regions, is derived from human IgG 1, and about 7% of the sequence is derived from
   the murine antibody A4.6. 1. Bevacizumab has a molecular mass of about 149,000 daltons and is
   glycosylated. Bevacizumab and other humanized anti-VEGF antibodies are further described in
   US 6884879. Additional anti-VEGF antibodies include the G6 or B20 series antibodies (e.g.,
25 G6-31, B20-4.1), as described in any one of Figures 27-29 of WO2005/012359. In one
   embodiment, the B20 series antibody binds to a functional epitope on human VEGF comprising
   residues F17, M18, D19, Y21, Y25, Q89,191, K1O1, E103, and C104. The A 4.6.1 (ATCC HB

                The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (P13K) signaling cascade, a key mediator of cellular
   survival, growth, and metabolism, is frequently altered in human cancer. Activating mutations in
   PIK3CA, the gene which encodes the a-catalytic subunit of P13K, occur in approximately 30% of
   breast cancers. These mutations result in constitutive activity of the enzyme and are oncogenic.
 5 Expression of mutant PIK3CA H1047R in the luminal mammary epithelium evokes
   heterogeneous tumors that express luminal and basal markers and are positive for the estrogen
   receptor. The PIK3CA H1047R oncogene targets a multipotent progenitor cells and recapitulates
   features of human breast tumors with PIK3CA H1047R (Meyer et al (2011). Cancer Res;
   71(13):4344-5 1). Hyperactivation of P13K can occur as a result of somatic mutations in
10 PIK3CA, the gene encoding the p1 10a subunit of P13K. The HER2 oncogene is amplified in
   25% of all breast cancers and some of these tumors also harbor PIK3CA mutations. P13K can
   enhance transformation and confer resistance to HER2-directed therapies. P13K mutations
   E545K and H1047R introduced in MCF1OA human mammary epithelial cells that also
   overexpress HER2 conferred a gain of function to MCF10A/HER2 cells. Aromatase-expressing
15 MCF7 cells convert androstenedione to estrogen in culture. Expression of H1047R P13K but not
   E545K P13K markedly upregulated the HER3/HER4 ligand heregulin (HRG) (Chakrabarty et al
   (2010) Oncogene 29(37):5193-5203).
   GDC-0032 SINGLE AGENT IN VITRO ACTIVITY
                The cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of GDC-0032 as a single agent was measured by:
20 establishing a proliferating mammalian tumor cell line in a cell culture medium, adding a test
   compound, culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days; and measuring
   cell viability (Example 3). Cell-based in vitro assays were used to measure viability, i.e.
   proliferation (IC 5 0 ), cytotoxicity (EC 5 ), and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation).
                The in vitro potency of GDC-0032 was measured by the cell proliferation assay of
25 Example 3; the CellTiter-Glo* Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, commercially available from
   Promega Corp., Madison, WI. This homogeneous assay method is based on the recombinant
   expression of Coleoptera luciferase (US 5583024; US 5674713; US 5700670) and determines
   the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of
   metabolically active cells (Crouch et al (1993) J. Immunol. Meth. 160:81-88; US 6602677). The
30 CellTiter-Glo* Assay was conducted in 96 or 384 well format, making it amenable to automated
   high-throughput screening (HTS) (Cree et al (1995) AntiCancer Drugs 6:398-404). The
   10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                                 -54
   homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo* Reagent)
   directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium. Cell washing, removal of medium and
   multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells/well in a 384
   well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing.
 5              The homogeneous "add-mix-measure" format results in cell lysis and generation of a
   luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The amount of ATP is directly
   proportional to the number of cells present in culture. The CellTiter-Glo* Assay generates a
   "glow-type" luminescent signal, produced by the luciferase reaction, which has a half-life
   generally greater than five hours, depending on cell type and medium used. Viable cells are
10 reflected in relative luminescence units (RLU). The substrate, Beetle Luciferin, is oxidatively
   decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP
   and generation of photons. The extended half-life eliminates the need to use reagent injectors
   and provides flexibility for continuous or batch mode processing of multiple plates. This cell
   proliferation assay can be used with various multiwell formats, e.g. 96 or 384 well format. Data
15 can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is
   presented as relative light units (RLU), measured over time.
                The anti-proliferative effects of GDC-0032, and GDC-0941 for comparison, were
   measured by the CellTiter-Glo* Assay (Example 3) against the tumor cell lines in Figures 1-4
   and Table 2. EC50 values were established for the experiments. The range of in vitro cell
20 potency activities was about 100 nM to about 10 pM.

  including HCC-1954 with the H1047R mutation. The top plot of Figure 1 shows that GDC-0032
  has a wider therapeutic window against PIK3CA mutant cell lines than the pan inhibitor GDC
  10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

   GDC-0941 in cell proliferation assays against PIK3CA wild type (WT), PIK3CA mutant, HER2
   expressing, and P13K mutant/HER2 expressing cell lines. Figures 1 and 2 show that GDC-0032
   is more potent against PIK3CA mutant cells and HER2+ breast cancer cells than GDC-0941.
 5 Cancer cell lines with HER2 amplification are about 44 times more sensitive to GDC-0032 than
   those without HER2 amplification, compared to 9 times more sensitive to GDC-0941.
                Figure 2 shows two plots of efficacy (EC50 micromolar) of GDC-0032 and GDC-0941 in
   cell proliferation assays against PIK3CA wild type (WT), PIK3 CA mutant, HER2 expressing,
   and PIK3CA mutant/HER2 expressing cell lines. Each dot represents a different cell line.
10              Figure 3 shows three plots of efficacy (EC50 micromolar) of GDC-0032 against: (3a,
   top) helical and kinase domain mutant cell lines; (3b, middle) P13K pathway wild type, PIK3CA
   mutant, PTEN null, and PTEN/PIK3CA cell lines; and (3c, bottom) P13K pathway wild type,
   PIK3CA mutant,, Ras mutant, and Ras/PIK3CA mutant cell lines. The results show that GDC
   0032 is less effective when PIK3CA mutant tumors have co-mutations in Ras or loss of PTEN.
15              Figure 4a shows the potency of GDC-0032 in an SW48 isogenic cell line set. SW48
   parental and knock-in mutant subclones harboring common P13K hotspot mutations E545K or
   H1047R were obtained from Horizon Discovery and GDC-0032 EC50 viability values were
   determined in these lines using a four day CellTiter-Glo (Promega) assay. Viability EC50 values
   for the three cell subtypes were 0.022 tM parental, 0.005 ptM E545K, and 0.008 IM
20 H1047R. Taken together, isogenic cell lines with P13K mutations demonstrate increased
   sensitivity to GDC-0032.
                Figure 4b shows autoradiograms of gel electrophoresis of lysates collected 18 hours post
   dosing of the SW48 isogenic cells; parental and P13K mutant knock-in mutants E545K and
   H1047R. GDC-0032 induces apoptosis in cells harboring P13K mutations at very low compound
25 concentrations. Similar effects were observed in P13K mutant isogenic cells from MCF10 breast
   cell line and HCC-1954 (P13K H1047R mutant breast cancer cell line).
   GDC-0032 AND CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC COMBINATION IN VITRO ACTIVITY
                The cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of combinations of GDC-0032 and exemplary
   chemotherapeutic agents was measured by: establishing a proliferating mammalian tumor cell
   10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                        -62
   line in a cell culture medium, adding a test compound, culturing the cells for a period from about
   6 hours to about 5 days; and measuring cell viability (Example 3). Cell-based in vitro assays
   were used to measure viability, i.e. proliferation (IC 5 0 ), cytotoxicity (EC 50 ), and induction of
   apoptosis (caspase activation).
 5              The in vitro potency of the combinations of GDC-0032 with chemotherapeutic agents
   was measured by the cell proliferation assay of Example 3; the CellTiter-Glo* Luminescent Cell
   Viability Assay, commercially available from Promega Corp., Madison, WI. This homogeneous
   assay method is based on the recombinant expression of Coleoptera luciferase (US 5583024; US
   5674713; US 5700670) and determines the number of viable cells in culture based on
10 quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells (Crouch et al (1993) J.
   Immunol. Meth. 160:81-88; US 6602677). The CellTiter-Glo* Assay was conducted in 96 or
   384 well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS) (Cree et al
   (1995) AntiCancer Drugs 6:398-404). The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the
   single reagent (CellTiter-Glo* Reagent) directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented
15 medium. Cell washing, removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The
   system detects as few as 15 cells/well in a 384-well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent
   and mixing.
                The anti-proliferative effects of combinations of GDC-0032 and chemotherapeutic agents
   were measured by the CellTiter-Glo* Assay (Example 3) against the tumor cell lines in Figures
20 5-12. EC50 values were established for the tested compounds and combinations. The range of in
   vitro cell potency activities was about 100 nM to about 10 pM.
                The individual measured EC50 values of GDC-0032 and of the chemotherapeutic agent
   against the particular cell are compared to the combination EC50 value. The combination index
   (CI) score is calculated by the Chou and Talalay method (Chou, T. and Talalay, P. (1984) Adv.
25 Enzyme Regul. 22:27-55). A CI less than about 0.7 indicates synergy. A CI between 0.8 and
   1.2 indicates additivity. A CI greater than 1.2 indicates antagonism. The strength of synergy is
   assessed according to Chou and Talalay. Certain therapeutic combinations in Figures 4-6 show
   the surprising and unexpected property of synergy in the in vitro cell proliferation assays with
   tumor type cell lines including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
30 (DLBCL), and multiple myeloma. Other combinations show no synergy; and only show mere
   additivity or antagonism. Certain combinations are synergistic with one or more tumor types,
   10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                      -63
   but not others. The synergy demonstrated in the in vitro cell proliferation assays provides a basis
   to expect a corresponding synergy in treating cancer in human patients.
                Figure 5a shows the effect of GDC-0032, paclitaxel (PTX), and the combination of GDC
   0032 and paclitaxel on breast cancer cell line MFM223 with H1047R, and D350N mutations.
 5 An in vitro cell survival and proliferation assay (Cell-Titer Glo, Promega) measured viable cells
   over varying inhibitor concentrations by dose titration (RLU = Relative Light Units) of GDC
   0032, paclitaxel (PTX), and the combination of GDC-0032 and paclitaxel. When the two drugs
   were combined a marked improvement in cell viability inhibition is observed.
                Figure 5b shows the Combination Indices (CI) of GDC-0032 + paclitaxel and GDC-0941
10 + paclitaxel combinations against PIK3CA wild type and mutant breast cancer cell lines of both
   the basal and luminal types. PIK3CA mutations include E545K and H1047R. A CI value below
   about 0.7 indicates synergy. Each dot represents a cancer cell line. The results show similar
   trends for the activity of the two combinations against the PIK3CA wild type and mutant breast
   cancer cell lines.
15              Figure 6a shows the effect of GDC-0032, eribulin, and the combination of GDC-0032
   and eribulin on breast cancer cell line Cal51 with E542K PIK3CA mutation and loss of PTEN
   protein expression of the basal subtype. An in vitro cell survival and proliferation assay (Cell
   Titer Glo, Promega) measured viable cells over varying inhibitor concentrations by dose titration
   (RLU        =  Relative Light Units) of GDC-0032, eribulin, and the combination of GDC-0032 and
20 eribulin. When the two drugs were combined a marked improvement in cell viability inhibition is
   observed.
                Figure 6b shows the Combination Indices (CI) of GDC-0032 + eribulin, GDC-0032 +
   docetaxel, GDC-0941 + eribulin, and GDC-0941 + docetaxel combinations against PIK3CA
   wild type, and E545K, H1047R, PTEN negative, and PTEN neg/E542K mutant breast cancer
25 cell lines of both the basal and luminal types. A CI value below about 0.7 indicates synergy.
   Each dot represents a cancer cell line. Synergy was observed for these combinations in the
   majority of evaluated cell lines.
                Figure 7 shows the Combination Indices (CI) of GDC-0032 + eribulin and GDC-0941 +
   eribulin combinations against PIK3CA wild type, and E545K, H1047R PIK3CA mutant breast

15              Endocrine therapies such as letrozole or fulvestrant are commonly used treatment options
   for metastatic Hormone Receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer but patients ultimately relapse.
   Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (P13K) regulate breast tumor cell growth, migration and survival.
   The alpha isoform of P13K is frequently mutated and activated in HR+ breast cancer and has
   been implicated in resistance to endocrine therapies. P13K inhibitors are therefore attractive for
20 combination with endocrine therapies. GDC-0032 is an orally bioavailable, potent, and selective
   inhibitor of Class I P13K alpha, delta, and gamma isoforms, with 30-fold less inhibition of the
   P13K beta isoform relative to the P13K alpha isoform. Preclinical data show that GDC-0032 has
   increased activity against P13K alpha isoform (PIK3CA) mutant and HER2-amplified cancer cell
   lines. Single agent and combination studies were carried out to determine if GDC-0032
25 enhances the anti-tumor activity of endocrine therapies in human breast cancer models. Figure
   37 shows the activity of letrozole and P13K inhibitor GDC-0032 in aromatase expressing MCF7
   cells. Sensitivity to endocrine therapies increases in MCF7-ARO cells grown with estrogen
   precursor androstenedione in media. Aromatase-expressing MCF7 cells convert
   androstenedione to estrogen in culture. MCF7 cells (Estrogen Receptor positive (ER+), P13K
30 alpha E545K mutant) were transfected with the aromatase gene and stable clones (MCF7-ARO)
   were selected that are capable of converting androstenedione to estrogen in culture. When

                                                      -71
   grown in the presence of androstenedione, MCF7-ARO cells were more reliant on estrogen for
   growth. Sensitivity to endocrine therapies increases in MCF7-ARO cells grown with estrogen
   precursor in media. Under these conditions the cells were treated with GDC-0032 in
   combination with endocrine therapies and assayed for cellular viability, modulation of P13K
 5 pathway and ER pathway markers and apoptosis induction. The combination of GDC-0032 and
   endocrine therapies decreased the cellular viability of MCF7-ARO cells and increased apoptosis
   relative to either single agent. The GDC-0032 and letrozole combination increases apoptosis in
   responsive cells because letrozole decreases P13K pathway signaling at mTOR and letrozole
   upregulates pAKT and HER2, as does fulvestrant.
10              Figure 38 shows GDC-0032 combines well with letrozole in vitro by quantitative scoring
   of inhibition of cell viability, BLISS, and HSA. Figure 39 shows cross-talk between the P13K
   and ER pathways was observed that suggests a mechanism of action for the combination of
   GDC-0032 and letrozole. Twenty-four hour treatment of cells with letrozole increases HER2
   and pAkt, but decreases pmTOR and pp70S6K. Figure 40 shows endocrine-resistant cells have
15 elevated P13K pathway signaling and are sensitive to GDC-0032. Endocrine-resistant MCF7
   ARO cells were obtained by letrozole dose escalation over about 4 months. The cells were
   resistant to exemestane, fulvestrant, tamoxifen and letrozole. The data provide rationale for
   evaluating GDC-0032 in combination with endocrine therapies for HR+ breast cancer treatment
   in the clinic.
20 GDC-0032 SINGLE AGENT IN VIVO TUMOR XENOGRAFT ACTIVITY
                The efficacy of GDC-0032 was measured in vivo by implanting xenografts of tumor cells
   representing breast, non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian, prostate, melanoma and colorectal
   cancers in immunocompromised mice and treating tumor-bearing animals with GDC-0032.
   Results are dependent on the cell line, the presence or absence of certain mutations in the tumor
25 cells, the dosing regimen of GDC-0032, and other factors. Subject mice were treated with drug(s)
   or control (Vehicle) and monitored over several weeks or more to measure the time to tumor
   doubling, log cell kill, and tumor inhibition (Example 4). Figures 13-22 show plots of tumor
   volume change over time after treatment of tumor-bearing mice with GDC-0032 according to the
   protocol of Example 4.
30              Figure 13 shows the fitted tumor volume change over 21 days in cohorts of

   0941, and GDC-0032. A dose-depended increase in tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was
 5 observed with daily dosing of GDC-0032 and a maximum TGI of 138% was achieved at the end
   of dosing on day 21. Tumor regressions were observed at doses of 12.5 and 25 mg/kg of GDC
   0032. The term uL means microliter.

                The efficacy of the combinations of GDC-0032 and various chemotherapeutic agents,
   including small-molecule and large-molecule targeted agents, was measured in vivo by
   implanting allografts or xenografts of cancer cells in rodents and treating the tumor-bearing
   animals with the drug combinations. Results are dependent on the cell line, the presence or
 5 absence of certain mutations in the tumor cells, the sequence of administration of GDC-0032 and
   chemotherapeutic agent, dosing regimen, and other factors. Subject mice were treated with
   drug(s) or control (Vehicle) and monitored over several weeks or more to measure the time to
   tumor doubling, log cell kill, and tumor inhibition (Example 4). Figures 23-36 show plots of
   tumor volume change over time after treatment of tumor-bearing mice treated with combinations
10 of GDC-0032 and various chemotherapeutic agents according to the protocol of Example 4.
                Figure 23 shows the mean tumor volume change over 51 days in cohorts of
   immunocompromised mice (nude) mice bearing MCF-7 neo/HER2 breast cancer tumor

   (DTX), GDC-0941, GDC-0032, and the combinations of docetaxel + GDC-0941 or docetaxel +
15 GDC-0032. GDC-0941 and GDC-0032 was dosed orally (PO) and daily (QD) for 21 days.
   Docetaxel was dosed intravenously and weekly (QW) for 3 weeks. After dosing ended on day
   21, mice were monitored for tumor regrowth for an additional 30 days. When compared to each
   single agent alone, the combination of GDC-0032 enhanced the anti-tumor activity of DTX by
   increasing tumor regressions. At the highest doses tested of GDC-0032 (20 mg/kg) in
20 combination with DTX was comparable in terms of %TGI to GDC-00941 in combination with
   DTX (Table 5).

 5 weekly (QW) for 3 weeks with 10 mg/kg of drug. After dosing ended on day 21, mice were
   monitored for tumor regrowth for an additional 4 days. GDC-0032 enhanced the anti-tumor
   activity of DTX at all doses of GDC-0032 tested, except 2.5 mg/kg. Maximum combination
   activity was observed with 15 mg/kg of GDC-0032 plus 10 mg/kg of DTX when compared to

   PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND FORMULATIONS
                Pharmaceutical compositions or formulations of the present invention include
20 combinations of GDC-0032, a chemotherapeutic agent, and one or more pharmaceutically
   acceptable carrier, glidant, diluent, or excipient.
                GDC-0032 and chemotherapeutic agents of the present invention may exist in unsolvated
   as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and
   the like, and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms.
25              The compounds of the present invention may also exist in different tautomeric forms, and
   all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. The term "tautomer" or
   "tautomeric form" refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via
   a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers)
   include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine
   10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                                -82
   isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the
   bonding electrons.
                Pharmaceutical compositions encompass both the bulk composition and individual
   dosage units comprised of more than one (e.g., two) pharmaceutically active agents including
 5 GDC-0032 and a chemotherapeutic agent selected from the lists of the additional agents
   described herein, along with any pharmaceutically inactive excipients, diluents, carriers, or
   glidants. The bulk composition and each individual dosage unit can contain fixed amounts of the
   aforesaid pharmaceutically active agents. The bulk composition is material that has not yet been
   formed into individual dosage units. An illustrative dosage unit is an oral dosage unit such as
10 tablets, pills, capsules, and the like. Similarly, the methods of treating a patient by administering
   a pharmaceutical composition is also intended to encompass the administration of the bulk
   composition and individual dosage units.
                Pharmaceutical compositions also embrace isotopically-labeled compounds of the present
   invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are
15 replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or
   mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified
   are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the invention, and their uses. Exemplary
   isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen,
   carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine and iodine, such as 2 H, 3H,                 11C,
20 13C, "C, 13N, "N,                  o, 170, 08o,32P, 33P 35, 1F, 36Cl, 123I and 12sI. Certain isotopically-labeled
   compounds of the present invention (e.g., those labeled with 3H and                  14C) are useful in compound
   and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated ( 3 H) and carbon-14 ( 14 C) isotopes are useful
   for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as
   deuterium (2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic
25 stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be
   preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as "0, 13N, "C and                     18F are
   useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy.
   Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following
   procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Examples herein below, by substituting an
30 isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.

                                                           -83
                GDC-0032 and chemotherapeutic agents are formulated in accordance with standard
   pharmaceutical practice for use in a therapeutic combination for therapeutic treatment (including
   prophylactic treatment) of hyperproliferative disorders in mammals including humans. The
   invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising GDC-0032 in association with one
 5 or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, glidant, diluent, additive, or excipient.
                 Suitable carriers, diluents, additives, and excipients are well known to those skilled in the
   art and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and/or swellable polymers,
   hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water and the like. The particular
   carrier, diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which the
10 compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on
   solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to a mammal.
   In general, safe solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic
   solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water, ethanol,
   propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG 400, PEG 300), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO),
15 cremophor (e.g. CREMOPHOR EL@, BASF), and mixtures thereof. The formulations may also
   include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents,
   emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing
   aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents and other known additives to
   provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or
20 pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product
   (i.e., medicament).
                The formulations may be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures.
   For example, the bulk drug substance (i.e., compound of the present invention or stabilized form
   of the compound (e.g., complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation
25 agent) is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the excipients
   described above. The compound of the present invention is typically formulated into
   pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable
   patient compliance with the prescribed regimen.
                The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a
30 variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an
   article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical
   10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                      -84
   formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well known to those skilled in the art
   and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal
   cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent
   indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon
 5 a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate
   warnings.
                Pharmaceutical formulations of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared
   for various routes and types of administration. For example, GDC-0032 having the desired
   degree of purity may optionally be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers,
10 excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1995) 18th edition, Mack Publ.
   Co., Easton, PA), in the form of a lyophilized formulation, milled powder, or an aqueous
   solution. Formulation may be conducted by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH,
   and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are
   non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. The pH of the formulation
15 depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but may range from
   about 3 to about 8.
                The pharmaceutical formulation is preferably sterile. In particular, formulations to be
   used for in vivo administration must be sterile. Such sterilization is readily accomplished by
   filtration through sterile filtration membranes.
20              The pharmaceutical formulation ordinarily can be stored as a solid composition, a
   lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution.
                The pharmaceutical formulations of the invention will be dosed and administered in a
   fashion, i.e., amounts, concentrations, schedules, course, vehicles and route of administration,
   consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the
25 particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of
   the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of
   administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical
   practitioners. The "therapeutically effective amount" of the compound to be administered will be
   governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate,
   10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                         -85
   or treat the coagulation factor mediated disorder. Such amount is preferably below the amount
   that is toxic to the host or renders the host significantly more susceptible to bleeding.
                The initial pharmaceutically effective amount of GDC-0032 administered orally or
   parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-1000 mg/kg, namely about 0.1 to 20
 5 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3
   to 15 mg/kg/day. The dose of GDC-0032 and the dose of the chemotherapeutic agent to be
   administered may range for each from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg per unit dosage form, or
   from about 10 mg to about 100 mg per unit dosage form. The doses of GDC-0032 compound
   and the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered in a ratio of about 1:50 to about 50:1 by
10 weight, or in a ratio of about 1:10 to about 10:1 by weight.
                Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the
   dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate and other
   organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as
   octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride,
15 benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl
   paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight
   (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or
   immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as
   glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides and
20 other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA;
   sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium;
   metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN T M,
   CREMOPHOR EL@, PLURONICSTM or polyethylene glycol (PEG). The active pharmaceutical
   ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation
25 techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin
   microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug
   delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano
   particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's
   Pharmaceutical Sciences 18th edition, (1995) Mack Publ. Co., Easton, PA.
30               Sustained-release preparations of GDC-0032 and chemotherapeutic compounds may be
   prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices
   10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                     -86
   of solid hydrophobic polymers containing GDC-0032, which matrices are in the form of shaped
   articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters,
   hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides
   (US 3773919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable
 5 ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON
   DEPOTTM (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and
   leuprolide acetate) and poly-D (-) 3-hydroxybutyric acid.
                The pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for the administration routes
   detailed herein. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may
10 be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and
   formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 18th Ed. (1995) Mack
   Publishing Co., Easton, PA. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the
   active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general
   the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active
15 ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary,
   shaping the product.
                Formulations of GDC-0032 and/or chemotherapeutic agent suitable for oral
   administration may be prepared as discrete units such as pills, hard or soft e.g., gelatin capsules,
   cachets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules,
20 emulsions, syrups or elixirs each containing a predetermined amount of GDC-0032 and/or a
   chemotherapeutic agent. The amount of GDC-0032 and the amount of chemotherapeutic agent
   may be formulated in a pill, capsule, solution or suspension as a combined formulation.
   Alternatively, GDC-0032 and the chemotherapeutic agent may be formulated separately in a pill,
   capsule, solution or suspension for administration by alternation.
25              Formulations may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the
   manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more
   agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in
   order to provide a palatable preparation. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in
   a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules,
30 optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing
   agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered
   10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                        -87
   active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or
   scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active
   ingredient therefrom.
                Tablet excipients of a pharmaceutical formulation of the invention may include: Filler (or
 5 diluent) to increase the bulk volume of the powdered drug making up the tablet; Disintegrants to
   encourage the tablet to break down into small fragments, ideally individual drug particles, when
   it is ingested and promote the rapid dissolution and absorption of drug; Binder to ensure that
   granules and tablets can be formed with the required mechanical strength and hold a tablet
   together after it has been compressed, preventing it from breaking down into its component
10 powders during packaging, shipping and routine handling; Glidant to improve the flowability of
   the powder making up the tablet during production; Lubricant to ensure that the tabletting
   powder does not adhere to the equipment used to press the tablet during manufacture. They
   improve the flow of the powder mixes through the presses and minimize friction and breakage as
   the finished tablets are ejected from the equipment; Antiadherent with function similar to that of
15 the glidant, reducing adhesion between the powder making up the tablet and the machine that is
   used to punch out the shape of the tablet during manufacture; Flavor incorporated into tablets to
   give them a more pleasant taste or to mask an unpleasant one, and Colorant to aid identification
   and patient compliance.
                Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically
20 acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These
   excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose,
   calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or
   alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as
   magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known
25 techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the
   gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a
   time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may
   be employed.
                For treatment of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations
30 are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an
   amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active
   10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                        -88
   ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base.
   Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream
   base.
                The aqueous phase of the cream base may include a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol
 5 having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol,
   sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The
   topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or
   penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such
   dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulfoxide and related analogs.
10              The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known
   ingredients in a known manner, including a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil,
   or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a
   lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without
   stabilizer(s) make up an emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat comprise an
15 emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of cream formulations.
   Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the invention include
   Tween@ 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono

                Pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such
   as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated
   according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending
   agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may be a solution
 5 or a suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in
   1,3-butanediol or prepared from a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and
   solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.
   In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending
   medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or
10 diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation
   of injectables.
                The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to
   produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode
   of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to
15 humans may contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an
   appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about
   95% of the total compositions (weight:weight). The pharmaceutical composition can be
   prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous
   solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 ig of the active
20 ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about
   30 mL/hr can occur.
                Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous
   sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes
   which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and
25 non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.
                Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein
   the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent
   for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a
   concentration of about 0.5 to 20% w/w, for example about 0.5 to 10% w/w, for example about
30 1.5% w/w.

   base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.
                Formulations suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size for
   example in the range of 0.1 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 0.1 and
   500 microns in increments microns such as 0.5, 1, 30 microns, 35 microns, etc.), which is
10 administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so
   as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the
   active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration may be
   prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents
   such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis disorders as described below.
15              Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons,
   creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient
   such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.
                The formulations may be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example
   sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried lyophilizedd) condition requiring
20 only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior
   to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders,
   granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are
   those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate
   fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.
25              The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active
   ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are
   materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or
   gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are
   compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered
30 parenterally, orally or by any other desired route.

   COMBINATION THERAPY
                GDC-0032 may be employed in combination with certain chemotherapeutic agents for
   the treatment of a hyperproliferative disorder, including solid tumor or hematopoietic
   malignancy, along with pre-malignant and non-neoplastic or non-malignant hyperproliferative
 5 disorders. In certain embodiments, GDC-0032 is combined with a chemotherapeutic agent in a
   single formulation as a single tablet, pill, capsule, or solution for simultaneous administration of
   the combination. In other embodiments, GDC-0032 and the chemotherapeutic agent are
   administered according to a dosage regimen or course of therapy in separate formulations as
   separate tablets, pills, capsules, or solutions for sequential administration of GDC-0032 and the
10 chemotherapeutic agent selected from 5-FU, docetaxel, eribulin, gemcitabine, GDC-0973, GDC
   0623, paclitaxel, tamoxifen, fulvestrant, dexamethasone, pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine,
   trastuzumab and letrozole. The chemotherapeutic agent has anti-hyperproliferative properties or
   is useful for treating the hyperproliferative disorder. The combination of GDC-0032 and
   chemotherapeutic agent may have synergistic properties. The chemotherapeutic agent of the
15 pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary
   activities to GDC-0032, and such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such compounds
   of the therapeutic combination may be administered in amounts that are effective for the purpose
   intended. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical formulation of this invention comprises GDC
   0032 and a chemotherapeutic agent such as described herein. In another embodiment, the
20 therapeutic combination is administered by a dosing regimen wherein the therapeutically
   effective amount of GDC-0032 is administered in a range from twice daily to once every three
   weeks (q3wk), and the therapeutically effective amount of the chemotherapeutic agent is
   administered separately, in alternation, in a range from twice daily to once every three weeks.
                Therapeutic combinations of the invention include a GDC-0032, and a chemotherapeutic
25 agent selected from 5-FU, docetaxel, eribulin, gemcitabine, GDC-0973, GDC-0623, paclitaxel,
   tamoxifen, fulvestrant, dexamethasone, pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine, trastuzumab and
   letrozole, for separate, simultaneous or sequential use in the treatment of a hyperproliferative
   disorder.
                The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen.
30 When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more
   administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate
   10134432 1 (GHMatters) P98407.AU.1

                                                        -92
   formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either
   order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously
   exert their biological activities.
                 Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and
 5 may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other
   chemotherapeutic agents or treatments, such as to increase the therapeutic index or mitigate
   toxicity or other side-effects or consequences.
                In a particular embodiment of anti-cancer therapy, the therapeutic combination may be
   combined with surgical therapy and radiotherapy, as adjuvant therapy. Combination therapies
10 according to the present invention include the administration of GDC-0032 and one or more
   other cancer treatment methods or modalities. The amounts of GDC-0032 and the
   chemotherapeutic agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to
   achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.
   ADMINISTRATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS
15              The therapeutic combinations of the invention may be administered by any route
   appropriate to the condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, parenteral (including
   subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, inhalation, intradermal, intrathecal,
   epidural, and infusion techniques), transdermal, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and
   sublingual), vaginal, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary and intranasal. Topical administration can
20 also involve the use of transdermal administration such as transdermal patches or iontophoresis
   devices. Formulation of drugs is discussed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed.,
   (1995) Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA. Other examples of drug formulations can be found in
   Liberman, H. A. and Lachman, L., Eds., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Decker, Vol 3,
   2 " Ed., New York, NY. For local immunosuppressive treatment, the compounds may be
25 administered by intralesional administration, including perfusing or otherwise contacting the
   graft with the inhibitor before transplantation. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may
   vary with for example the condition of the recipient. Where the compound is administered orally,
   it may be formulated as a pill, capsule, tablet, etc. with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,
   glidant, or excipient. Where the compound is administered parenterally, it may be formulated

   with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle or diluent, and in a unit dosage injectable
   form, as detailed below.
                A dose to treat human patients may range from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg of GDC
   0032, such as about 5 mg to about 20 mg of the compound. A dose may be administered once a
 5 day (QD), twice per day (BID), or more frequently, depending on the pharmacokinetic (PK) and
   pharmacodynamic (PD) properties, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
   of the particular compound. In addition, toxicity factors may influence the dosage and
   administration dosing regimen. When administered orally, the pill, capsule, or tablet may be
   ingested twice daily, daily or less frequently such as weekly or once every two or three weeks for
10 a specified period of time. The regimen may be repeated for a number of cycles of therapy.

   may further comprise a third container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as
   bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and
   dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user
10 standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.
                Where the kit comprises GDC-0032 and a second therapeutic agent, i.e. the
   chemotherapeutic agent, the kit may comprise a container for containing the separate
   compositions such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet, however, the separate
   compositions may also be contained within a single, undivided container. Typically, the kit
15 comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is
   particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different
   dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when
   titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.

                Example 3             In Vitro Cell Proliferation Assay
20              Efficacy of GDC-0032 and chemotherapeutic compounds were measured by a cell
   proliferation assay employing the following protocol (Mendoza et al (2002) Cancer Res.
   62:5485-5488).
                The CellTiter-Glo@ Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a homogeneous method to
   determine the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, which
25 signals the presence of metabolically active cells. The CellTiter-Glo@ Assay is designed for use
   with multiwell plate formats, making it ideal for automated high-throughput screening (HTS),
   cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding a
   single reagent (CellTiter-Glo@ Reagent) directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented
   medium. Cell washing, removal of medium or multiple pipetting steps are not required. The Cell

   Titer-Glo* Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, including reagents and protocol are commercially
   available (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, Technical Bulletin TB288).
                The assay assesses the ability of compounds to enter cells and inhibit cell proliferation.
   The assay principle is based on the determination of the number of viable cells present by
 5 quantitating the ATP present in a homogenous assay where addition of the Cell Titer-Glo*
   reagent results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal through the luciferase reaction.
   The luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of ATP present.
                Procedure:            Day 1 - Seed Cell Plates (384-well black, clear bottom, microclear, TC
   plates with lid from Falcon #353962), Harvest cells, Seed cells at 1000 cells per 54pl per well

                Cell viability assays and combination assays: Cells were seeded at 1000-2000 cells/well
   in 384-well plates for 16 h. On day two, nine serial 1:2 compound dilutions were made in
   DMSO in a 96 well plate. The compounds were further diluted into growth media using a
   Rapidplate@ robot (Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, MA). The diluted compounds were then added to
 5 quadruplicate wells in 384-well cell plates and incubated at 37 'C and 5% CO 2 . After 4 days,
   relative numbers of viable cells were measured by luminescence using Cell Titer-Glo@
   (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and read on a Wallac Multilabel
   Readers (PerkinElmer, Foster City). EC50 values were calculated using Prism 4.0 software
   (GraphPad, San Diego). Drugs in combination assays were dosed starting at 4X EC50
10 concentrations. If cases where the EC50 of the drug was >2.5 pM, the highest concentration
   used was 10 pM. GDC-0032 and chemotherapeutic agents were added simultaneously or
   separated by 4 hours (one before the other) in all assays.
                An additional exemplary in vitro cell proliferation assay includes the following steps:
                 1.            An aliquot of 100 ptl of cell culture containing about 104 cells (see Table 3 for cell
15 lines and tumor type) in medium was deposited in each well of a 384-well, opaque-walled plate.
                2.             Control wells were prepared containing medium and without cells.
                3.             The compound was added to the experimental wells and incubated for 3-5 days.
                4.             The plates were equilibrated to room temperature for approximately 30 minutes.
                5.             A volume of CellTiter-Glo      Reagent equal to the volume of cell culture medium
20 present in each well was added.
                6.             The contents were mixed for 2 minutes on an orbital shaker to induce cell lysis.
                7.             The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes to stabilize the
   luminescence signal.
                 8.            Luminescence was recorded and reported in graphs as RLU = relative
25 luminescence units.

                Alternatively, cells were seeded at optimal density in a 96 well plate and incubated for 4
 5 days in the presence of test compound. Alamar BlueTM was subsequently added to the assay
   medium, and cells were incubated for 6 h before reading at 544 nm excitation, 590nm emission.
   EC50 values were calculated using a sigmoidal dose response curve fit.
                Alternatively, Proliferation/Viability was analyzed after 48 hr of drug treatment using
   Cell Titer-Glo@ reagent (Promega Inc., Madison, WI). DMSO treatment was used as control in
10 all viability assays. IC5 0 values were calculated using XL fit software (IDBS, Alameda, CA)
                The cell lines were obtained from either ATCC (American Type Culture Collection,
   Manassas, VA) or DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH,
   Braunschweig, DE). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal
   bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Life
15 Technology, Grand Island, NY) at 37 'C under 5% CO 2.

                Mice: Female severe combined immunodeficiency mice (Fox Chase SCID, C.B
   17/IcrHsd, Harlan) or nude mice (Taconic Farms, Harlan) were 8 to 9 weeks old and had a BW
   range of 15.1 to 21.4 grams on Day 0 of the study. The animals were fed ad libitum water
20 (reverse osmosis, 1 ppm Cl) and NIH 31 Modified and Irradiated Lab Diet consisting of 18.0%
   crude protein, 5.0% crude fat, and 5.0% crude fiber. The mice were housed on irradiated
   ALPHA-Dri bed-o'cobs Laboratory Animal Bedding in static microisolators on a 12-hour
   light cycle at 21-22 'C (70-72 'F) and 40-60% humidity. PRC specifically complies with the
   recommendations of the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals with respect to restraint,
25 husbandry, surgical procedures, feed and fluid regulation, and veterinary care. The animal care

                Tumor Implantation: Xenografts were initiated with cancer cells. Cells were cultured in
   RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL
   penicillin, 100 pg/mL streptomycin sulfate and 25 pg/mL gentamicin. The cells were harvested
   during exponential growth and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a
 5 concentration of 5 x 106 or 10             x 106 cells/mL depending on the doubling time of the cell line.
   Tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously in the right flank, and tumor growth was monitored
   as the average size approached the target range of 100 to 150 mm3. Twenty-one days after
   tumor implantation, designated as Day 0 of the study, the mice were placed into four groups each
   consisting of ten mice with individual tumor volumes ranging from 75-172 mm3 and group
10 mean tumor volumes from 120-121 mm3 (see Appendix A). Volume was calculated using the
   formula:
                Tumor Volume (mm3)            = (w 2 x 1)/2, where w = width and 1= length in mm of a tumor.
   Tumor weight may be estimated with the assumption that 1 mg is equivalent to 1 mm3 of tumor
   volume.
15              Therapeutic Agents:          GDC-0032 was supplied as a dry powder in salt form, which
   contained 73% active agent, and was stored at room temperature protected from light. Drug
   doses were prepared weekly in 0.5% methylcellulose: 0.2% Tween 80 in deionized water
   ("Vehicle") and stored at 4'C. The salt form containing 73% active agent was accounted for in
   the formulation of G-033829 doses. Doses of GDC-0032 were prepared on each day of dosing
20 by diluting an aliquot of the stock with sterile saline (0.9% NaCl). All doses were formulated to
   deliver the stated mg/kg dosage in a volume of 0.2 mL per 20 grams of body weight (10 mL/kg).
                Treatment:            All doses were scaled to the body weights of the individual animals and
   were provided by the route indicated in each of the figures.
                Endpoint:             Tumor volume was measured in 2 dimensions (length and width), using
25 Ultra Cal IV calipers (Model 54 10 111; Fred V. Fowler Company), as follows: tumor volume
   (mm 3)       =  (length x width 2 ) x 0.5 and analyzed using Excel version 11.2 (Microsoft Corporation).
   A linear mixed effect (LME) modeling approach was used to analyze the repeated measurement
   of tumor volumes from the same animals over time (Pinheiro J, et al. nlme: linear and nonlinear
   mixed effects models. R package version 3.1 92. 2009; Tan N, et al. Navitoclax enhances the
30 efficacy of taxanes in non-small cell lung cancer models. Clin. Cancer Res. 2011;17(6):1394

                                                               -104
   1404). This approach addresses both repeated measurements and modest dropouts due to any
   non-treatment-related death of animals before study end. Cubic regression splines were used to
   fit a nonlinear profile to the time courses of log2 tumor volume at each dose level. These
   nonlinear profiles were then related to dose within the mixed model. Tumor growth inhibition as
 5 a percentage of vehicle control (% TGI) was calculated as the percentage of the area under the
   fitted curve (AUC) for the respective dose group per day in relation to the vehicle, using the
   following formula: % TGI                 = 100 x (1 - AUCdose/ AUCveh). Using this formula, a TGI value of
   100% indicates tumor stasis, a TGI value of > 1% but < 100% indicates tumor growth delay, and
   a TGI value of > 100% indicates tumor regression. Partial response (PR) for an animal was
10 defined as a tumor regression of >50% but <100% of the starting tumor volume. Complete
   response (CR) was defined as 100% tumor regression (i.e., no measurable tumor) on any day
   during the study.
                Toxicity:               Animals were weighed daily for the first five days of the study and twice
   weekly thereafter. Animal body weights were measured using an Adventurer Pro AV812 scale
15 (Ohaus Corporation). Percent weight change was calculated as follows: body weight change (%)
   =   [(weightay           new   - weightay o)/weightay a] x 100. The mice were observed frequently for overt
   signs of any adverse, treatment- related side effects, and clinical signs of toxicity were recorded
   when observed. Acceptable toxicity is defined as a group mean body weight (BW) loss of less
   than 20% during the study and not more than one treatment-related (TR) death among ten treated
20 animals. Any dosing regimen that results in greater toxicity is considered above the maximum
   tolerated dose (MTD). A death is classified as TR if attributable to treatment side effects as
   evidenced by clinical signs and/or necropsy, or may also be classified as TR if due to unknown
   causes during the dosing period or within 10 days of the last dose. A death is classified as NTR
   if there is no evidence that death was related to treatment side effects.
