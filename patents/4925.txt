    The disclosure of the complete specification of Australian Patent Application No.
   2013231009, as originally filed and as amended, is incorporated herein by reference.
   Field of the invention
10
    The present invention relates generally to pallets, preferably but not exclusively
    constructed from cardboard or paperboard, and to a method for the assembly of such
   pallets.
15 Background
    Pallets used to transport consumer goods and other items are typically constructed of wood
    or plastics material and assembled using fasteners or adhesives. A disadvantage of these
   pallets is their weight. A further disadvantage is the cost associated with managing the
20  distribution, retrieval and maintenance of such pallets.
   It is also known to produce pallets from cardboard or paperboard. These pallets are much
    lighter than their wooden or plastic counterparts, thus reducing transportation costs.
   However, assembly of these known cardboard pallets requires the use of adhesives and/or
25  fasteners such as staples or the like. In the case of pallets using staples, should it be desired
   to recycle the pallet material there is additional cost and difficulty in doing so.
   It would be desirable to provide a pallet which alleviates one or more of the above
    difficulties, or at least to provide a useful alternative.

    Summary of the invention

   I: \tId\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\15958298_l.doc-3 I 2017
                                                              -2
   In a first aspect, the present invention provides a pallet, including:
              first bearers and second bearers; and
              a deck including a plurality of tabs;
 5           wherein the first bearers include:
                     first locking members coupled to corresponding notches of the second bearers to
              couple the first bearers transversely to the second bearers to form an interlocked array
              of bearers, and
                     second locking members coupled with the tabs of the deck to couple the array of
10           bearers to the deck.
   Advantageously, the use of first and second locking members on the first bearers to couple
   them to the second bearers and to the deck means that preferred embodiments of the
    invention do not require adhesives as part of the assembly process, therefore being able to
15 be assembled at a lower cost, especially in the case of cardboard pallets. In addition,
   preferred embodiments do not require specific machinery as part of the assembly process.
   By providing a pallet which can be assembled without glue, it may be possible to provide a
    'one way pallet' which is 100% recyclable and which can therefore be regarded as an
    environmentally sound alternative to existing wooden, plastic or cardboard pallets.
20
   Preferably, the first locking members and the second locking members are in paired
   relationship. Pairs of first and second locking members may be associated with slots of the
    first bearers, and first and second locking members within a pair may be located opposite
    each other. Preferably, gaps between respective pairs of locking members have a width
25 which is less than a width of the second bearers.
   In certain embodiments, the first locking members and/or the second locking members
    each include a convex upper surface over which the second bearers are slideable into the
    slots of the first bearers, and a lower surface engageable with the notches of the second
30 bearers and/or with the tabs of the deck.

   In certain embodiments, the first locking members and/or the second locking members are
    located at respective openings of the respective slots.
   In certain embodiments, the slots of the first bearers include tab-receiving slots each
 5  defined by first and second sidewalls and a floor, and the first sidewall or the second
    sidewall includes a recess to accommodate a tab of the tabs of the deck.
   Preferably, the tabs of the deck each include a ledge for engagement with the second
    locking members.
10
   In a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a blank for a first bearer of a
   pallet, the pallet including a plurality of such first bearers, a plurality of second bearers
    coupled to the first bearers to form an interlocked array of bearers, and a deck coupled to
   the array of bearers, the blank including:
15                           a first panel including a plurality of slots, each slot having first and second side
             walls and an end wall, and a pair of locking portions located at or near an opening of
             the slot; and
                             a second panel which is a mirror image of the first panel and which is separated
              from the first panel by a line of separation;
20                           wherein, when the blank is folded about the line of separation and the first and
              second panels are brought into alignment, locking portions of the first panel align with
              locking portions of the second panel to form pairs of locking members for coupling the
              first bearers to the second bearers.
25 In a third aspect, the present invention provides a method of assembling a pallet, the
   method including:
                     providing first bearers including a series of slots with which are associated pairs of
    first and second locking members, the first and second locking members of respective pairs
   being located on respective first and second sides of respective slots;

   Detailed description of preferred embodiments
25
   Referring to Figures 1 and 2, there is shown a pallet 100 including a top deck 110 and a
    interlocked array 120 of bearers, including a first set of bearers 122 and a second set of
   bearers 124. As depicted in the Figures, the first bearers 122 are "short" bearers which run
   transverse to "long" bearers 124 when coupled together in interlocked array 120. It will be
30  appreciated, though, that the lengths of "short" and "long" bearers can be varied as
    appropriate, and that the bearers may all be of equal length, or first bearers 122 may be

                                                              -6
    longer than second bearers 124, for example.
    The top deck 110 includes side edges 116 and end edges 118. Side edges 116 include a
   plurality of tabs 112 which are used to couple the top deck 110 to the interlocked array 120
 5  of bearers 122, 124 (Figure 2) in a manner which will be described below.
   Long bearers 124 each include two recesses 130 so as to provide access for tines of a
    forklift for lifting a loaded pallet 100. In some embodiments the short bearers 122 may also
    include similar recesses.
10
   Referring now to Figure 3, a short bearer 122 is depicted in more detail. The short bearer
    122 includes two substantially identical plies or panels 122a, 122b of a corrugated or fluted
    cardboard or paperboard material. The grade of material and the thickness of the panels
   may be chosen based on the load to be borne by the pallet 100 and may be a B or C flute,
15  or an AC flute, for example. The panels 122a, 122b may be single-, double- or triple
    walled corrugated cardboard. Short bearer 122 has outer slots 310 and central slot 320.
    Each outer slot 310 is defined by a first sidewall 312, a second sidewall 314 and a floor
    316. Each sidewall 312, 314 has a locking member in the form of a locking lug 332 or 334
20  associated with it. In particular, an outer locking lug 332 is located at an upper end of the
    first sidewall 332 and an inner locking lug 334 is located at an upper end of a recessed
   portion 318 of the second sidewall 314. Central slot 320 is defined by a pair of identical
    sidewalls 322 and a floor 326. A pair of locking lugs 342 is located at respective upper
    ends of the sidewalls 322. The locking lugs 332, 334, 342 each have a convex upper
25  surface which curves inwardly towards the slot 310 or 320 such that a gap G between pairs
    of lugs (Figure 4) is slightly smaller than the combined thickness of the panels 124a, 124b,
    124c of long bearers 124 (Figure 6).
    Locking members 332, 334 are in paired relationship, and are located opposite each other
30  at or near an opening of slot 310. Likewise, locking members 342 are in paired
    relationship, and are located opposite each other at or near an opening of slot 320.

                                                              -7
   A blank 400 for forming the bearer 122 is depicted in Figure 4. The blank has symmetrical
    first 122a and second 122b panels which are foldable about a line of separation 410, as
    shown in the partially folded configuration of Figure 5. The line of separation 410 is a cut
 5  line which is made in the liner on one side of the cardboard blank 400, such that a hinge is
    formed by the liner on the opposite side of the blank. Alternatively, in some embodiments,
   the line of separation 410 may be a fold line, for example formed by scoring the blank in
   known fashion. The reference numerals used in Figure 4 for respective parts of the first
    and second panels 122a and 122b are the same as those used in Figure 3, but with a suffix
10  of either "a" or "b" depending on whether the respective component belongs to the first or
    the second panel.
    First panel 122a includes a cut-out section or slot 310a with sidewall portions 312a and
    314a, which respectively include lug portions 332a and 334a. Likewise, second panel 122b
15  includes a cut-out section or slot 310b with sidewall portions 312b and 314b, which
   respectively include lug portions 332b and 334b. When the panels 122a and 122b are
    folded about line of separation 410 and the cut-out sections 31 0a and 31 Ob are brought into
    alignment, sidewall portions 312a and 312b together form the sidewall 312 of slot 310 of
   the bearer 122, lug portions 332a and 332b together form the outer locking lug 332, and so
20  on.
    Turning now to Figure 6, there is shown a long bearer 124 having three plies or panels
    124a, 124b, 124c. An upper end of the bearer 124 includes three notches 610 and a lower
    end includes three elongate slots 620. Notches 610 each include a floor 612 and
25  downwardly facing slots 620 each include an upper wall 622. The bearer 124 may be
    formed from a blank 700 as shown in Figures 7 and 8. The numbering convention used in
   Figures 6 to 8 is similar to that used in Figures 3 to 5. In particular, reference numerals
    ending in "a" are used to label components of panel 124a, and so on.
30  The blank 700 includes a first line of separation formed by cut lines 710, which extend
   through the blank 700, and lines of perforation 712. A second line of separation (cut line)

   I: \tId\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\15958298_l.doc-3 I 2017
                                                              -8
    720 extends through the liner on a first surface 702 of the blank 700 but stops short of the
    liner on the opposite surface (not shown), such that the liner on the opposite surface forms
    a hinge about which the blank 700 can be folded, as shown in Figure 8. In some
    embodiments the cut line 720 may extend through the blank 700 so that panel 124c may be
 5  completely separated from the blank and then stacked together with folded panels 124a,
    124b during assembly of the pallet 100.
    To form the bearer 124, the perforations 710 are ruptured on the side of the blank 700
    opposite to the first surface 702, and panel 124a is folded towards panel 124b in a first
10  direction about hinged sections formed by the unruptured parts of the liner on surface 702.
    Panel 124c is then folded towards panel 124b in a second direction opposite the first
    direction.
   Assembly of the bearer array 120 is illustrated schematically in Figure 9. Once the bearers
15  122 and 124 are assembled from the blanks 400 and 700, long bearers 124 are fitted to
    short bearers 122 by pushing the elongate slots 620 of a long bearer 124 into outer 310 or
    central 320 slots of the three short bearers 122. As the long bearer 124 is pushed into slot
    310 or 320, it slides over the curved part of the locking lugs until the lugs lock over the
    floor portions 612 of the notches 610 at the top of the long bearer 124, and the upper wall
20  622 of downwardly facing slot 620 rests on floor 316 or 326, such that the long bearer 124
    is retained between locking lug 332 and floor 316 of the outer slots 310, or between the
   pair of locking lugs 342 and floor 326 of the central slot 320.
    Further, the width w2 of the elongate slots 620 (Figure 7) is chosen to be approximately
25  equal to the combined thickness of the panels 122a, 122b of the short bearers 122, and the
    height h2 approximately equal to the height hI of the outer 310 or central 320 slot (Figures
    4 and 7), such that a loose interference fit is formed between the long 124 and short 122
   bearers at the bottom, in addition to the locking arrangement described above.
30  Figure 10 shows a blank 1000 for forming a top deck 110 of the pallet 100. The blank may
   be formed of a lower grade cardboard than that used for the bearers 122, 124. Blank 1000

   I: \tId\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\15958298_l.doc-3 I 2017

    includes a series of cut lines 1020 to allow tabs 112 to be formed by folding along score
    lines 1010.
    Turning now to Figures 11 to 13, the coupling of the top deck 110 to the bearers 122, 124
 5  is depicted schematically. The particular views shown are a detail of the attachment of a
   tab 112 at one of the corners. It will be understood that the attachment of the other tabs 112
   may be achieved in similar fashion.
   As shown in Figure 11, after the long bearers 124 and short bearers 122 have been coupled
10 together to form interlocked array 120, a gap will remain between the sidewalls 314 of
    outer slots 310 of long bearers 124, and short bearers 122. This is due to the recessed
    region 318 of sidewalls 314, which is sized and shaped to accommodate a tab 112 of the
    deck 110. To fit a tab 112 of deck 110, the tab 112 is folded such that it has a plane which
    is parallel to the slot 310 and to the plane defined by long bearer 124, and is pushed into
15  this gap by sliding over the curved portion of locking lug 334 (Figure 12) until it locks
    over a seat or ledge 114 formed in tab 112 (Figure 13).
   Alternative methods of coupling the top deck 110 to the bearers 122, 124 are also possible.
    For example, short bearers 122 may include additional slots specifically to accommodate
20  tabs of deck 110, such as elongate transverse slots similar to slots 310 but having a
    narrower width to accommodate the narrower width of the material of the deck 110. In
    these embodiments, the location of the tabs 112 would be shifted to suit the location of the
    additional slots, and outer slots 310 may be modified to be essentially the same as central
    slot 320. Alternatively, rather than being coupled to short bearers 122, the tabs could be
25  coupled to slots in long bearers 124, with the tabs being foldable such that they have a
   plane which is perpendicular to the plane defined by long bearer 124. In a yet further
    alternative, rather than being formed in side edges 116, the tabs 112 could be formed in
    end edges 118 and arranged to fold into apertures of the side walls of short bearers 122,
    each aperture including at least one locking member which couples to a tab 112.

    The pallet 100 may be provided in assembled form, or alternatively may be provided in kit

   bearers, and three blanks 700 for the long bearers. The kit may also include instructions for
    folding and assembly of the blanks.
 5 Many modifications to the above embodiments are possible within the scope of the
    invention. For example, the central slots 320 of the short bearers may be configured in
    similar fashion to the outer slots 310, with a recessed sidewall, such that further tabs
    formed along a centreline of the deck can be inserted into these modified central slots to
    improve locking of the deck to the interlocked array of bearers. In a further embodiment,
10 printing can be applied to the deck or bearer blanks so as to allow branding or the like to be
    displayed on the pallet. In another alternative, apertures can be formed in the bearers to act
    as catch points for shrink wrapping film to be attached as part of a shrink wrapping process
    carried out by shrink wrapping machinery.
