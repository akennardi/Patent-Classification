          The entire disclosure in the complete specification of our Australian Patent Application
   No. 2013224004 is by this cross-reference incorporated into the present specification.
          The present disclosure relates to asymmetric antibodies comprising an IgG4 heavy chain
 5 or fragment which is mutated and a second heavy chain or fragment which is distinct from
   said IgG4 chain. The disclosure also extends to compositions comprising said asymmetric
   antibodies and use of the antibodies and compositions comprising same for treatment. In a
   further aspect the disclosure extends to methods of preparing the antibodies and formulations,
   and vectors encoding the antibodies and hosts expressing same.
10        The biopharmaceutical                 industry encompassing    recombinant proteins,   monoclonal
   antibodies (mAbs) and nucleic acid-based drugs is growing rapidly. Antibody engineering
   has resulted in the design and production of antibody fragments or alternative formats.
   Preferred molecular format along with other aspects such as production yield, protein quality
   and storage stability are taken into consideration when selecting an antibody-based protein as
15 a therapeutic agent.
          The basic structure of all immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules comprises two identical heavy
   chains (HCs) and two identical light chains (LCs) which are coupled by disulphide bonds.
   Each LC consists of a variable (VL) and constant domain (CL). Based on the HC, five main
   Ig classes are recognized: IgG, IgA, IgD, IgE and IgM. For IgG, the HC consists of one
20 variable domain (VH) and three constant domains (CH1-3).                  The CH2 and CH3 domains form
   the Fc part of the molecule that is responsible for stimulating effector function and is linked
   to the Fab fragment (VHVL and CHCL) by a hinge region which confers flexibility to the IgG
   molecule. Two antigen recognition sites are located at the ends of the VL and VH domains.
   IgG is further subdivided into 4 different isotypes: IgGI, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4.
25        Fc-mediated                effector functions i.e. antibody  dependent cytotoxicity  (ADCC)    or
   complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) are isotype dependent. Each isotype has evolved
   to perform a specific function within the body.                   The IgGI isotype is currently the most
   widely used as a therapeutic due to its extended half-life, enhanced ADCC activation and
   complement activation. Other isotypes are employed as therapeutic agents depending on the
30 target and desired effect. For instance, when target antigens are simply to be neutralized and
   effector functions are less important, alternative isotypes such as IgG2 and IgG4 can be used.
   Alternatively, IgG with re-engineered Fc/effector function may be considered.
          IgG2 also has minimal associated effector function but is prone to dimerisation which is
   not fully understood.
35        IgG4 remains a useful isotype because of its relative lack of effector function induction.
   However, use of IgG4 also has some inherent practical difficulties namely its shorter serum
   half-life and its ability to undergo "Fab-arm exchange" (also referred to as dynamic heavy
   chain exchange or heavy chain exchange), wherein the heavy chain and its attached light
   chain of one antibody is exchanged with the heavy chain and its attached light chain of
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                               2
   another antibody to form a whole antibody composed of two heavy chains and two attached
   light chains (van der Neut Kolfschoten et al., 2007 Science 317, 1554-1557).
         In vivo, Fab-arm exchange results in bispecific antibodies that, due to their different
   variable domains, can co-engage distinct target antigens. This produces a large percentage of
 5 circulating             IgG4      which   have   been    observed   to  be  bispecific, but   functionally
   monovalent.                  (Schuurman,J.,  Van    Ree,R., Perdok,G.J., Van Doorn,H.R., Tan,K.Y.,
   Aalberse,R.C., 1999. Normal human immunoglobulin G4 can be bispecific: it has two
   different antigen-combining sites. Immunology 97, 693-698).
         In vitro, when IgG4 antibodies are analysed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, they have been
10 observed to form so called ' halfmolecules'                 each comprising a single covalently assatiated
   heavy-light chain pair caused by the absence of inter heavy chain disulphide bonds typically
   due to the formation of intra heavy chain disulphide bonds within the hinge region of one
   heavy chain. The heavy chain of a "half-molecule" may non-covalently associate with its
   heavy chain paired partner, the association being maintained by CH3 :CH 3 domain
15 interactions. In solution such ' halfmolecules'               areactually observed using methods such as
   size exclusion chromatography to be full sized, that is approximately 150kDa but on non
   reducing SDS-PAGE are comprised of 75kDa LC:HC pairings (so-called "half-molecule").
         A Ser to Pro mutation at position 241 (numbered according to the Kabat numbering
   system) in the hinge reduces the appearance of these ' half molecules' byion-reducing, SDS
20 PAGE (Angal,S. et al., 1993. A single amino acid substitution abolishes the heterogeneity of
   chimeric mouse/human (IgG4) antibody as observed during SDS-PAGE analysis Mol
   Immunol 30, 105-108).                   In addition, this point mutation does not influence the compact
   structure of IgG4 thereby allowing IgG4 to retain its reduced ability to activate complement.
         Following the discovery of the S241P mutation, further mutations to IgG4 have been
25 investigated in order to understand the inter-heavy chain interaction in IgG4 antibodies,
   reduce IgG4 effector function and enhance structural stability. In Schuurman et al.
   (Schuurman,J et al., 2001. The inter-heavy chain disulphide bonds of IgG4 are in equilibrium
   with intra-heavy chain disulphide bonds. Molecular Immunology 38, 1-8), the observed
   instability of inter-heavy chain disulphide bonds of IgG4 was investigated using IgG4
30 mutants. In mutant M1 Cys 131 (numbered according to EU numbering system or Cys 127
   according to Kabat numbering system), which is involved in the inter-heavy-light chain (CL
   CHI) disulphide bond, was replaced by serine and it was found that this mutant resulted in the
   formation of dimers of light chains and dimers of heavy chains. In mutant M2 cysteine 226
   (226 numbered according to EU numbering system or 239 according to Kabat numbering
35 system), which is involved in an inter-heavy chain disulphide bond in the hinge, was replaced
   by serine and it was found that this mutant had a more stable inter-heavy chain linkage
   compared to IgG4 and prevents the formation of an intra-heavy chain disulphide bond.
          The alteration of the number of cysteine residues present in the hinge region of antibodies
   has been previously investigated. US 5677425 Bodmer et al. discloses that the number of
40 cysteine residues in the hinge region may be increased in order to facilitate the use of the
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                       3
   cysteine thiol groups for attaching effector or reporter molecules. US 5677425 also teaches
   that the number of cysteine residues in the hinge region may be reduced to one in order to
   facilitate the assembly of the antibody molecules, since it will only be necessary to form a
   single disulphide bond, which will provide a specific target for attaching the hinge region
 5 either to another hinge region or to an effector or reporter molecule.
          Given that IgG4 antibodies administered to a subject are susceptible to dynamic heavy
   chain exchange to form "mixed antibodies" this process can exploited in the present
   disclosure to prepare in vitro the antibodies of the present disclosure. Advantageously, this
   allows the characteristics of the antibodies to be manipulated.
10        There is still a need to provide new antibodies for use as a therapeutic. The present
   invention provides new mutant antibodies which may have advantageous properties including
   improved biophysical properties, for example compared to wild-type antibodies.
         It is to be understood that if any prior art publication is referred to herein, such reference
   does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of the common general
15 knowledge in the art in Australia or any other country.
          Summary of the Invention
          The present disclosure provides an asymmetric mixed antibody comprising two heavy
   chains or heavy chain fragments each comprising at least a variable region, a hinge region
20 and a CHI domain,
         wherein a first heavy chain or fragment thereof is a class IgG 4 and has:
          a) the inter-chain cysteine at position 127, numbered according to the Kabat numbering
                system, in the CHI domain is substituted with another amino acid; and
         b) optionally one or more of the amino acids positioned in the upper hinge region is
25              substituted with cysteine.
   wherein the second heavy chain or fragment thereof is characterised in that part of all of the
   chain has a different amino acid sequence to said first heavy chain in at least the region
   outside the variable region.
                In an alternative aspect the present disclosure relates to an asymmetric mixed
30 antibody comprised of an IgG4 heavy chain or heavy chain fragment wherein the heavy chain
   or fragment comprises a variable region, a hinge region and a CHI domain wherein the hinge
   is mutated to be an IgGI type hinge.
          There is also provided an asymmetric mixed antibody comprising a first and second
   heavy chain or heavy chain fragments each comprising at least a variable region, a hinge
35 region and a CHI domain wherein the first heavy chain or fragment thereof is a class IgG4
   and has an IgGI type hinge and the second heavy chain or fragment thereof has a different
   amino acid sequence to said first heavy chain in at least the region outside the variable
   region.
         In one embodiment the hinge sequence of the two heavy chains is similar or identical.
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                             4
                The present disclosure is advantageous because it allows manipulation and control of
   the antibody properties by methods that are convenient and readily accessible.
                The antibodies of the present invention may demonstrate reduced heavy chain
   exchange compared to wild-type IgG4, which provides an asymmetric (such as a bispecific
 5 antibody) which demonstrates little or no exchange with wild-type IgG4 in vivo due to its
   reduced propensity to exchange compared to IgG4 and also due to the relatively low
   concentration of an asymmetric mixed antibody in vivo compared to natural circulating IgG4
   antibodies.
                The antibodies of the present invention may demonstrate reduced heavy change
10 exchange at concentrations greater than in vivo concentrations, for example concentrations of
   0.5mM or greater compared to IgG4 wild type.                    Whilst the antibodies of the invention
   demonstrate reduced heavy chain exchange compared to wild type IgG4, they do demonstrate
   a degree of heavy chain exchange, compared to IgGI wt and IgG4 S241P, which is sufficient
   to create an asymmetric mixed (such as a bispecific antibody) from two different antibodies
15 (such as two antibodies having different antigen specificities) in vitro.
                Thus in one embodiment antibodies of the present disclosure can be exchange in vitro
   with 5mM GSH but not with 0.5mM GSH. The latter more closely mimics in vivo exchange
   barrier. Fig20 illustrates this in that Ab28 (C127S Y229C) does exchange with WT, S241G
   S241A or S241T at 5mM GSH, but not at 0.5mM.
20              Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method of generating an
   asymmetric mixed antibody, comprising the steps of taking a symmetrical antibody
   comprising a first heavy chain sequence or a fragment thereof as defined herein and mixing
   the said antibody in vitro with a second symmetrical antibody comprising a second heavy
   chain sequence or a fragment thereof which is different to said first heavy chain sequence,
25 under conditions conducive to heavy chain exchange between the two antibodies, and
   optionally isolation of the asymmetric mixed antibody obtained therefrom.                      In one
   embodiment the method provides a bispecific antibody, which comprises mixing two
   antibodies, wherein the antigen specificity of variable regions in the first antibody is different
   to the antigen specificity of the variable regions in the second antibody.
30              In one embodiment the antibodies are monovalent.
                The method of the present disclosure allows the properties to the antibody to be
   completely manipulated to provide final therapeutic molecule that is customized and
   optimized for the intended therapeutic use.
         In addition the antibodies according the present disclosure may be advantageous in that
35 they have low levels of effector function and/or do not participate in cross-linking.

                               second antibody is IgG4 wild-type at two concentrations of GSH. The figures
                               show that the mutants have a little less exchange than the wild-type IgG4
                               antibodies and significantly greater exchange than the IgGI wild-type
                               antibody and the IgG4 P antibody. This is advantageous in that the exchange

                               which in vivo have less susceptibility to undergo exchange than wild type
                               IgG4 antibodies.      In some instances increasing the concentration of the
                               reducing agent, such as GSH increases the amount of exchange observed.

         Detailed Description
                An asymmetric antibody as employed herein is an antibody where the two heavy
   chains or fragments thereof have amino acid sequences which are partially or completely
   different in the regions outside the variable regions, for example having a similarity less than
25 98% over the relevant portion, such less than 97, 96 95% over the relevant portion. In one
   embodiment there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 amino acids different or added in a region of 10
   consecutive amino acids. The amino acid sequences may also be different lengths which by
   necessity will result in a difference in the amino acid sequence. Parts of the heavy chains may
   have similar or identical sequences, for example the variable regions in the heavy chain may
30 be the same or different.
                In one embodiment the heavy chain sequences in the antibodies of the present
   disclosure are covalently linked, for example through an inter-chain disulfide bond, for
   example a bond that is present naturally in the corresponding wild-type fragment or a bond
   that has been genetically engineered to be present in the desired location in the chains.
35        In one aspect the antibodies of the present disclosure are characterized in that the first
   heavy chain IgG4 sequence or fragment has an IgGI type hinge.
         In one aspect the antibodies of the present disclosure are characterized in that both of the
   heavy chain sequences or fragments have an IgGI type hinge.
          The wild-type IgGI upper and core hinge has the sequence EPKSCDKTHTCPPCP SEQ
40 ID NO: 316.
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                      9
          The wild-type IgG4 upper and core hinge has the sequence ESKYGPPCPSCP SEQ ID
   NO: 317.
         IgGI type hinge as employed herein is intended to refer to wherein one or more, for
   example 1 to 5, such as 1, 2 or 3 amino acids are inserted into the IgG4 hinge, in particular
 5 between EPKYGPP SEQ ID NO: 318 and CPSC and/or one or more of the amino acids
   YGPP in the IgG4 hinge are replaced, for example to correspond to an amino acid in the
   IgGI hinge, in particular G (from YGPP in the IgG4 hinge) is replaced with C or where Y
   (from YGPP in the IgG4 hinge) is replaced with C or S.
                Thus the present invention also provides an asymmetric mixed antibody comprising a
10 first IgG4 heavy chain with an upper hinge, core and lower hinge, and said upper hinge and
   core in the heavy chain or each heavy chain therein is 13 to 17, such as 15 amino acids in
   length.
                In one embodiment the asymmetric mixed antibody with a first IgG4 heavy chain has
   an upper hinge and core of 15 amino acids in length.
15              In one embodiment the upper hinge and core of at least the first heavy chain
   comprises the natural 12 amino acids found in an IgG4 hinge and a further three amino acids,
   for example 3 alanine residues, or 3 glycine residues or a combination thereof.
                In one embodiment the hinge has the one of the following sequences:

   the disclosure consists a natural IgGI hinge i.e. EPKSCDKTHTCPPC SEQ ID No: 96 or a

                                                                10
                Generally the hinge region in each of the heavy chains of the asymmetric mixed
   antibody will at least be compatible.                   That is to say when heavy chains are paired the
   arrangement will not be unstable, for example due to internal strain in the hinge region.
                In one embodiment the hinge region of each heavy chain comprises a sequence
 5 independently selected from a hinge sequence disclosed herein.
                In one embodiment the hinge in each of the heavy chains is similar or identical. This
   may be advantageous in that it may minimize incompatibility of the hinge regions of the two
   chains.
                In a further aspect the invention provides an asymmetric mixed antibody comprising
10 two IgG4 heavy chains which each comprises a variable region, a CHI domain and a hinge
   region, wherein in the first heavy chain:
                a. the inter-chain cysteine at position 127, numbered according to the Kabat
                       numbering system, in the CH I domain is substituted with another amino acid; and
                b. the hinge in the heavy chain or each heavy chain therein is in the range 12 to 17,
15                      such as 15 amino acids in length
   wherein part or all of the second heavy chain has a different amino acid sequence to said first
   heavy chain in at least the region outside the variable region.
                Suitable hinges are described above.
                In a further aspect, the present invention also provides an asymmetric antibody
20 comprising two IgG4 heavy chains which each comprises a CHI domain and a hinge region,
   wherein in the first heavy chain:
                        a. the cysteine at position 127, numbered according to the Kabat numbering
                               system, is substituted with another amino acid; and
                       b. the cysteine at position 239 or the cysteine at position 242, numbered
25                             according to the Kabat numbering system, are substituted with another amino
                               acid
   wherein part or all of the second heavy chain has a different amino acid sequence to said first
   heavy chain in at least the region outside the variable region.
                In one embodiment according to the latter aspect of the invention at least the IgG4
30 heavy chain contains 22 amino acids in the hinge, for example as described above.
                The second heavy chain sequences and fragments include any antibody heavy chain,
   including IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4 (including of the type described above), IgD and IgM.
                In a further embodiment, the present invention also provides an asymmetric mixed
   antibody comprising two IgG3 heavy chains which each comprises a CHI domain and a hinge
35 region, for example wherein in the first heavy chain
                        a. the cysteine in the CHI domain which forms an inter-chain disulphide bond
                               with a cysteine in a light chain is substituted with another amino acid; and
                       b. one or more of the amino acids positioned in the upper hinge region is
                               substituted with cysteine.
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                                11
   wherein part or all of the second heavy chain has a different amino acid sequence to said first
   heavy chain in at least the region outside the variable region.
                In a further embodiment, the present invention provides an asymmetric mixed
   antibody further comprising two IgM heavy chains which each comprises a CHI domain and
 5 a CH2 domain, for example wherein in the first heavy chain:
                        a. the cysteine in the CHI domain which forms an inter-chain disulphide bond
                               with a cysteine in a light chain is substituted with another amino acid; and
                       b. one or more of the amino acids positioned in the CHI domain or CH2 domain
                               is substituted with cysteine;
10 wherein part or all of the second heavy chain has a different amino acid sequence to said first
   heavy chain in at least the region outside the variable region.
                In a further embodiment, the present invention provides an asymmetric mixed
   antibody further comprising two IgD heavy chain, for example which each comprise a CHI
   domain and a hinge region, wherein in the first heavy chain:
15                      a. the cysteine in the CHI domain which forms an inter-chain disulphide bond
                               with a cysteine in a light chain is substituted with another amino acid; and
                       b. one or more of the amino acids positioned in the hinge region is substituted
                               with cysteine
   wherein part or all of the second heavy chain has a different amino acid sequence to said first
20 heavy chain in at least the region outside the variable region.
                Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory it is suspected that the CH3 region of the
   IgG4 antibodies has a function to play in the dynamic exchange process. Therefore
   replacement of CH3 region of a non-IgG4 class antibody with a CH3 domain from an IgG4
   antibody may render the mutated antibody more conducive to exchange.
25              In one embodiment the one or more cysteine(s) which would naturally be involved in
   the formation of an interchain disulphide bond between the light chain and heavy chain is
   replaced by a non-cysteine amino acid, as described in W02005/003170 and
   W02005/003171 both incorporated herein by reference.
                In one embodiment the human kappa light in an antibody or fragment according to the
30 present disclosure has one or more of residues 171, 156, 202 or 203 replaced as described in
   W02008/038024 incorporated herein by reference.
                The skilled person will appreciate that the mutations made to the IgG4 antibody may
   also be applied to other antibody isotypes or classes which have the same disulphide bond
   arrangement as an IgG4 antibody in order to provide an improved antibody. Specific
35 examples of antibodies which have the same disulphide bond arrangement as an IgG4
   antibody are IgG3 antibodies, IgM antibodies and IgD antibodies. As shown in Figure 1b,
   IgG3 and IgM have a cysteine at position 127 in the CHI domain and IgD has a cysteine at
   position 128 in the CHI domain which is equivalent to the C127 in the CHI domain of IgG4
   which forms an inter-chain disulphide bond with a cysteine in the light chain. Further, it can
40 also be seen from Figure lb that upper hinge regions of IgG3 and IgD and the C-terminal
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                             12
   region of the CHI domain and the N-terminal region of the CH2 domain in IgM do not contain
   a cysteine residue which is equivalent to the residues of the upper hinge region of IgGI.
   Accordingly, the present invention further provides an IgG3 antibody, an IgD antibody and
   an IgM antibody wherein the cysteine in the CH1 domain which forms an inter-chain
 5 disulphide bond with a cysteine in a light chain is substituted with another amino acid and
   wherein one or more amino acids which are in a structurally analogous position to the upper
   hinge region of IgGI or IgG4 are substituted with cysteine. These mutated heavy chains may
   be employed, for example as the second heavy chain of antibodies according to the
   disclosure.
10              In one embodiment the antibody according to the disclosure comprises two IgG4 class
   heavy chains.
                In one embodiment the antibody according to the present disclosure further comprises
   two light chains.
                In one embodiment the antibody according to the present disclosure comprises two
15 variable regions.
                In one embodiment the two variable regions have the same specificity, that is to say
   they are specific to the same antigen.
                In one aspect the present disclosure provides an asymmetric mixed antibody with
   wherein the variable regions are have a different specificity, i.e. a bi-specific antibody. That
20 is to say where the antibody comprises two heavy chain variable regions each variable region
   is specific for a different antigen.
                In one embodiment each variable region can independently bind the target antigen.
                The present antibody format is advantageous in that is readily accessible from routine
   antibody production methods and utilizing naturally occurring mechanisms.
25              In one embodiment the one or both heavy chain C-terminus is/are fused to a domain
   antibody, for example with specificity for a distinct antigen, that is an antigen that the
   variable regions of the heavy chains are not specific to.
                Single variable domains also known as single domain antibodies or dAbs for use in
   the present invention can be generated using methods known in the art and include those
30 disclosed in W02005118642, Ward et al., 1989, Nature, 341, 544-546 and Holt et al., 2003,
   Trends in Biotechnology, 21, 484-490. In one embodiment a single domain antibody for use
   in present invention is a heavy chain variable domain (VH) or a light chain domain (VL).
   Each light chain domain may be either of the kappa or lambda subgroup.                  Methods for
   isolating VH and VL domains have been described in the art, see for example EP0368684
35 and Ward et al., supra. Such domains may be derived from any suitable species or antibody
   starting material.                In one embodiment the single domain antibody may be derived from a
   rodent, a human or other species.                  In one embodiment the single domain antibody is
   humanised.
                In one embodiment the single domain antibody is derived from a phage display
40 library, using the methods described in for example, W02005/118642, Jespers et al., 2004,

   Nature Biotechnology, 22, 1161-1165 and Holt et al., 2003, Trends in Biotechnology, 21,
   484-490. Preferably such single domain antibodies are fully human but may also be derived
   from other species. It will be appreciated that the sequence of the single domain antibody
   once isolated may be modified to improve the characteristics of the single domain antibody,
 5 for example solubility, as described in Holt et al., supra.
                In one embodiment the or each domain antibody is a VH or VHH.
                In one embodiment there are two domain antibodies, one fused to each heavy chain,
   wherein the two domain antibodies form a VH/VL pairing which bind to the antigen to which
   they are specific co-operatively.
10              In one embodiment the antibody of the disclosure is isolated, that is to say not located
   in a human or an animal body.
                The terms "protein" and "polypeptide" are used interchangeably herein, unless the
   context indicates otherwise. "Peptide" is intended to refer to 10 or less amino acids.
                The terms "polynucleotide" includes a gene, DNA, cDNA, RNA, mRNA etc unless
15 the context indicates otherwise.
                As used herein, the term "comprising" in context of the present specification should
   be interpreted as "including".
                The term "wild-type" in the context of the present invention means an antibody as it
   may occur in nature or may be isolated from the environment, which does not comprise any
20 genetically engineered mutations.
                The designation for a substitution mutant herein consists of a letter followed by a
   number followed by a letter. The first letter designates the amino acid in the wild-type
   protein. The number refers to the amino acid position where the amino acid substitution is
   being made, and the second letter designates the amino acid that is used to replace the wild
25 type amino acid.
                The residues in antibody variable and constant domains are conventionally numbered
   according to a system devised by Kabat et al. This system is set forth in Kabat et al., 1987,
   in Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, US Department of Health and Human
   Services, NIH, USA (hereafter "Kabat et al. (supra)").
30              The Kabat residue designations do not always correspond directly with the linear
   numbering of the amino acid residues. The actual linear amino acid sequence may contain
   fewer or additional amino acids than in the strict Kabat numbering corresponding to a
   shortening of, or insertion into, a structural component, whether framework or
   complementarity determining region (CDR), of the basic variable domain structure. The
35 correct Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment of
   residues of homology in the sequence of the antibody with a "standard" Kabat numbered
   sequence.
                Alternatively, the numbering of amino acid residues may be performed by the EU
   index or EU numbering system (also described in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

   Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health,
   Bethesda, MD. (1991)).
                A further numbering system of amino acid residues in antibodies is the IMGT
   numbering system (Lefranc, M.-P. et al., Dev. Comp. Immunol., 29, 185-203 (2005)).
 5              The Kabat numbering system is used in the present specification except where
   otherwise indicated that the EU numbering system or IMGT numbering system is used.
                Between the four IgG isotypes, the intrachain disulphide bonding arrangements in the
   heavy and light chain are similar whereas the interchain disulphide bonding arrangements are
   unique for each isotype [Reviewed by (Wypych,J., Li,M., Guo,A., Zhang,Z., Martinez,T.,
10 Allen,M.J., Fodor,S., Kelner,D.N., Flynn,G.C., Liu,Y.D., Bondarenko,P.V., Ricci,M.S.,
   Dillon,T.M., Balland,A., 2008. Human IgG2 antibodies display disulphide-mediated
   structural isoforms. J Biol Chem. 283, 16194-16205)].
                As shown in Figure 1b, the hinge region sequences of the four IgG isotypes differ.
   The complete or genetic hinge region typically consists of residues 226 to 251 (numbering
15 based on Kabat numbering system). Figure lb shows the upper, core and lower sections of
   the hinge regions of the four IgG isotypes. For the IgGI isotype, the upper hinge region is
   residues 226 to 238, the core hinge region is residues 239 to 243 and the lower hinge region
   is residues 244 to 251. For the IgG4 isotype, the upper hinge region is residues 226 to 238,
   the core hinge region is residues 239 to 243 and the lower hinge region is residues 244 to
20 251.
                Thus the hinge comprising the upper hinge, core and lower hinge in an IgGI is 23
   amino acids in length as shown in Figure la. The upper hinge is 10 amino acids. The core is
   5 amino acids and the lower hinge is 8, see for example Figure lb.
                The hinge comprising the upper hinge, core and lower hinge in an IgG4 is 20 amino
25 acids in length as shown in Figure la. The upper hinge is 7 amino acids. The core is 5
   amino acids and the lower hinge is 8, see for example Figure lb.
                The new mutant IgG4 antibodies according to the present invention have been
   developed by modifying the interchain disulphide bond arrangements within IgG4,
   specifically the CL-CH1 interchain disulphide bond arrangement between the light chain (LC)
30 and heavy chain (HC) has been modified.
                Figure lb shows sections of the human IgG heavy and light chain sequences for the
   IgG 1-4 isotypes indicating the cysteine positions (underlined) that form the CL-CHl
   interchain disulphide bonds. The inter CL-CH1 disulphide bond of IgGI is formed between
   the LC C214 (Kabat numbering system) and C233 (Kabat numbering system) of the HC just
35 before the hinge region. In contrast, the CHI-CL disulphide bond for IgG2, 3 and 4 is formed
   between the LC C214 and C127 N-terminal to the intrachain disulphide bond of the HC. The
   LC and HC sequences surrounding the cysteine residues involved in the CL-CH1 disulphide
   bond formation are shown and aligned in Figure lb.

                The present invention has investigated how the CL-CH1 disulphide bond affects the
   properties of an IgG4 antibody including the thermostability, structural stability, disulphide
   isoform heterogeneity, affinity and half-molecule exchange of the antibody.
          Mutants of IgG4 may be generated by substitution of the cysteine residue in CHI at
 5 position 127 with another amino acid as well as substituting one or more of the amino acids
   in the upper hinge region, preferably amino acids at positions selected from 227, 228, 229
   and 230, numbered according to the Kabat numbering system of IgG4, with cysteine.
   Positions 227, 228, 229 or 230 are at or near to the equivalent structural position that the
   IgGI cysteine 233 is situated.
10       Each heavy chain may comprise further mutations including the substitution of one or
   both cysteine residues 239 and 242 in the IgG4 hinge region with another amino acid. A
   mutation to lengthen the IgG4 upper hinge region by three amino acids between positions
   238 and 239 to be the same length as the IgGI hinge may also be included in some
   antibodies. The S241P mutation was also introduced in some antibodies.
15              Hence in one embodiment, an IgG4 antibody is provided in which the cysteine 127 is
   substituted for another amino acid and the cysteine of the light chain is linked via a
   disulphide bond to an engineered cysteine at position 227, 228, 229 or 230.
                In one embodiment the upper hinge and core region is selected from one of the
   following sequences:

                In one embodiment the core hinge region in one or both heavy chain sequences or
35 fragments thereof has the sequence CPPCP SEQ ID NO: 322.
                Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory it is thought that this sequence is likely to
   block dynamic exchange of the antibody arms at "in vivo" type concentrations for example
   concentration of less than 0.5mM reductant, in particular concentrations of reductant in the
   order of 5uM are thought to be physiologically relevant (Zilmer et al., 2005 Drug Design

                The mutations to the antibodies of the present invention will now be described in
   further detail. The methods for replacing amino acids are well known in the art of molecular
   biology. Such methods include for example site directed mutagenesis using methods such as
   PCR to delete and/or substitute amino acids or de novo design of synthetic sequences.
 5              Figure 2a shows the hinge residues of IgGI wild type, IgG4 wild type and the
   positions where mutations have been introduced in the antibodies of the present invention.
   Numbering based on Kabat numbering system.
                The antibodies according to the present invention comprise a mutation at position 127
   (C127), wherein the cysteine residue is replaced by another amino acid, preferably an amino
10 acid that does not contain a thiol group. By replace or substitute we mean that where the
   interchain cysteine 127 would normally be found in the antibody heavy chain another amino
   acid is in its place. The mutation at C127 may be any suitable mutation to one, two or three
   of the nucleotides encoding the amino acid at position 127 which changes the amino acid
   residue from cysteine to another suitable amino acid. Examples of suitable amino acids
15 include serine, threonine, alanine, glycine or any polar amino acid. A particularly preferred
   amino acid is serine.
                The substitution of the cysteine at position 127 with another amino acid removes the
   cysteine in the CHI domain which normally forms a disulphide bond with a cysteine in the
   light chain in the wild-type IgG4. Therefore, in order to form a light chain and heavy chain
20 pairing via an inter-chain disulphide bond the light chain must form a disulphide bond with a
   cysteine which is positioned in the hinge region of the heavy chain.
                In a first aspect of the invention, antibodies according to the present invention
   comprise a heavy chain wherein one or more of the amino acids at positions selected from
   227, 228, 229 and 230, numbered according to the Kabat numbering system, is substituted
25 with cysteine. Accordingly, antibodies according to the present invention may carry one or
   more of the following mutations: S227C; K228C; Y229C; G230C.
                Preferably only one residue selected from 227, 228, 229 and 230 is substituted with a
   cysteine residue.
                Particularly preferred antibodies of the present invention carry the mutation Y229C or
30 G230C.
                The inclusion of a cysteine residue at a position selected from 227, 228, 229 and 230,
   in the hinge region of the heavy chain provides a new position for an inter-chain disulphide
   bond to form between the heavy chain and the light chain.
                Further mutations may be introduced to the antibodies of this aspect of the present
35 invention. In one embodiment the cysteine at position 239 (C239) and/or the cysteine at
   position 242 (C242), numbered according to the Kabat numbering system, in the heavy chain
   are substituted with another amino acid, preferably an amino acid that does not contain a thiol
   group. By replace or substitute we mean that where the cysteine 239 and/or the cysteine 242
   would normally be found in the antibody heavy chain another amino acid is in its place. The
40 mutation at C239 and/or C242 may be any suitable mutation to one, two or three of the
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                      19
   nucleotides encoding the amino acid which changes the amino acid residue from cysteine to
   another suitable amino acid. Examples of suitable amino acids include serine, threonine,
   alanine, glycine or any polar amino acid. A particularly preferred amino acid is serine.
                In one embodiment the cysteine at position 239 in the heavy chain is substituted with
 5 another amino acid and the cysteine at position 242 in the heavy chain is substituted with
   another amino acid. In this embodiment, the substitution of both C239 and C242 removes
   both cysteine residues in the hinge region of the heavy chain which normally form inter
   heavy chain disulphide bonds with the corresponding cysteines in another heavy chain. The
   resulting half-molecules may form whole antibody molecules through non-covalent bonding
10 between two heavy chains.
                In an alternative embodiment the cysteine at position 239 in the heavy chain is
   substituted with another amino acid. In this embodiment the cysteine at position 242 is not
   substituted with another amino acid.
                In a further alternative embodiment the cysteine at position 242 in the heavy chain is
15 substituted with another amino acid. In this embodiment the cysteine at position 239 is not
   substituted with another amino acid.
                The substitution of either C239 or C242, leaves one cysteine in the heavy chain which
   is capable of forming an inter-heavy chain disulphide bond with a cysteine in another heavy
   chain. Without being bound by theory it is thought that the substitution of one cysteine in the
20 hinge region, particularly substitution of C239, reduces the formation of an intra-chain
   disulphide bond in the hinge region and therefore may reduce the formation of half antibody
   molecules.
                In one embodiment of the present invention the proline at position 240 may be
   substituted with another amino acid.
25              In one embodiment of the present invention the serine at position 241 may be
   substituted with another amino acid.
                In one embodiment of the present invention, wherein the serine at position 227 is
   substituted with a cysteine, the antibody preferably does not comprise mutations at positions
   C239 and C242. In another embodiment, wherein the serine at position 227 is substituted
30 with a cysteine, the cysteine at position 239 in the heavy chain is preferably substituted with
   another amino acid but the cysteine at position 242 is not substituted with another amino
   acid.
                In one embodiment the antibodies of the present invention comprise an IgG4 heavy
   chain which is mutated to insert one or more amino acids between amino acids 226-243. The
35 number of amino acids inserted may be 1 to 10, 1 to 5, 1 to 3, preferably 1, 2, 3 or 4 amino
   acids are inserted. The amino acids are preferably inserted between amino acids 238 and
   239. Any suitable amino acids may be inserted in the hinge region, such as alanines,
   glycines, serines or threonines and combinations thereof. Preferably three alanines (AAA),
   three glycines (GGG), three serines (SSS) or three threonines (TTT) are inserted or a
40 threonine, histidine and another threonine (THT). It is believed that antibodies of the present
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                             20
   invention comprising an IgG4 heavy chain which has been mutated to insert three amino
   acids in the hinge region show improved stability, for example thermostability.
                A further mutation which may be introduced in the antibodies according to the
   present invention is the mutation S241P. This mutation has been previously shown to reduce
 5 the formation of half molecules at biologically relevant concentrations (Angal,S. et al., 1993.
   A single amino acid substitution abolishes the heterogeneity of chimeric mouse/human
   (IgG4) antibody. Mol Immunol 30, 105-108).                    It has been surprisingly found that mutant
   antibodies of the present invention which comprise the S241P mutation demonstrate some
   heavy chain exchange in vitro under strong reducing conditions compared to IgG4 P (IgG4
10 with S241P).                 This allows the creation of bispecific antibodies in vitro from mutant IgG4
   antibodies of the present invention.
                The antibodies according to the present invention may comprise one or more further
   mutations in the hinge region. For example the antibodies may further comprise one or more
   of the following mutations S227P, Y229S, P237D and P238K.
15              In one embodiment the antibody according to the present invention effectively
   comprises an IgGI hinge region from residue 226 to 243 (upper hinge and core hinge).
   Accordingly, the antibody of the present invention comprises a hinge region wherein the
   glycine at position 230 is substituted with cysteine, the serine at position 227 is substituted
   with proline, the tyrosine at position 229 is substituted with serine, the proline at position 237
20 is substituted with aspartic acid, the proline at position 238 is substituted with lysine, the
   amino acid sequence threonine-histidine-threonine is inserted between positions 238 and 239
   and the serine at position 241 is substituted with proline.                 These mutations may also be
   written as S227P, Y229S, G230C, P237D, P238KTHT and S241P, as shown in Figure 2a.
                The antibody according to the present invention preferably has an IgG4 lower hinge
25 from residue 244 to 251 (APEFLGGP SEQ ID NO: 321). Without being bound by theory it
   is believed that the IgG4 lower hinge region contributes to the lack of effector function of an
   IgG4 antibody.
                In a second aspect of the present invention, the asymmetric mixed antibody of the
   present disclosure comprises a heavy chain wherein the cysteine at position 127 is substituted
30 with another amino acid, as described above, and the cysteine at position 239 or the cysteine
   at position 242, numbered according to the Kabat numbering system, in the heavy chain is
   substituted with another amino acid. In this second aspect, none of the residues at positions
   227, 228, 229 and 230 are substituted with a cysteine residue.                      Accordingly, there is
   provided:
35              an asymmetric mixed antibody comprising two heavy chains each comprising at least
   a variable region, a hinge region and a CHI domain, wherein in a first heavy chain or
   fragment thereof is characterised in that it is a class IgG4 and has:
                        a. the inter-chain cysteine at position 127, numbered according to the Kabat
                               numbering system, is substituted with another amino acid; and
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                           21
                        b. optionally the cysteine at position 239 or the cysteine at position 242,
                               numbered according to the Kabat numbering system, is substituted with
                               another amino acid
   wherein the second heavy chain or fragment thereof is characterised in that it has a different
 5 amino acid sequence to said first heavy chain in a region outside the variable region.
                In the second aspect of the present invention, the antibody may comprise one or more
   further mutations. In one embodiment the antibody comprises at least a first IgG4 heavy
   chain which is mutated to insert three amino acids between amino acids 226-243, preferably
   between amino acids 238 and 239, as described above.                      In a further embodiment the
10 antibody comprises the mutation S241P. In a further embodiment, the antibody may further
   comprise one or more of the following mutations S227P, Y229S, P237D and P238K.
                In a one embodiment, the present invention provides an asymmetric mixed antibody
   comprising two heavy chains which each comprise a variable region, a CHI domain and

                Accordingly          the present invention provides an      asymmetric  mixed antibody
   comprising two heavy chains each comprising at least a variable region, a hinge region and a
   CHI domain, wherein a first heavy chain and second heavy chain sequences are IgG4 heavy
   chain sequences selected from the combinations of first and second heavy chain sequence
 5 mutations listed in Table 2.
                The asymmetric mixed antibody may comprise a first and second heavy chain,
   wherein each heavy chain constant sequence comprises mutations to the CHI domain and
   hinge region as described above, and wherein the mutations to the CHI domain and hinge
   region in each heavy chain are different.               Alternatively, the first heavy chain constant
10 sequences may comprise mutations to the CHI domain and hinge region as described above
   and the second heavy chain constant sequence is IgG4 wild type or IgG4 wild type with
   S241P mutation.
                In one embodiment of the present invention, the asymmetric mixed antibody is a
   bispecific antibody, wherein each heavy chain has different variable regions. The antibody
15 preferable also comprises two light chains, wherein each heavy-light chain pair (Fab) has
   different variable regions.
                "Different variable regions" as employed herein is intended to refer to wherein the
   said variable regions have specificity for different antigens. That is to say that the antigen to
   which each variable region is specific is a different antigen or a different part of an antigen,
20 eg a different epitope.
                "Specific" as employed herein refers to the fact the binding domains recognized a
   target antigen with greater affinity and/avidity than other antigens to which it is not specific
   (for example 10, 20, 50, 10 or 1000 greater). It does not necessarily imply that the specific

   is such that it can be used to purify the target antigen (to which it is specific) from a complex
   mixture of antigens, including antigens in the same family of proteins.
                In one embodiment the antibody according to the present disclosure is isolated.
                Isolated as employed herein is intended to refer to an antibody that is isolated from
 5 the human body, for example: prepared by recombinant techniques, purified using a
   technique such as chromatography, and/or in a pharmaceutical formulation.
                The term ' antibody' as used herein inuiles intact (whole) antibodies and functionally
   active fragments which comprise two heavy chains which each comprise a VH domain, a CHI
   domain and a hinge region. The antibody according to the present invention preferably
10 comprises at least one light chain. Accordingly, the term "antibody" in the present invention
   covers bi, tri or tetra-valent antibodies, a dimer of Fab'        and F(ab' 2)fragments and whole
   antibody molecules comprising two light chain and heavy chain pairings.
                As is well known in the art, a typical Fab'   molecule comprises a heavy and alight
   chain pair in which the heavy chain comprises a variable region VH, a constant domain CHI
15 and a hinge region and the light chain comprises a variable region VL and a constant domain
   CL
                In one embodiment there is provided a dimer of Fab'          according d the present
   disclosure for example dimerisation may be through the hinge.
                In one embodiment the heavy chain comprises a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain and
20 optionally a CH4 domain. In one embodiment the antibody comprises two heavy chains each
   of which is as defined above in the first or second aspect of the present invention. The
   antibodies according to the present invention also preferably comprise two light chains,
   which may be the same or different. In the embodiment of the present invention which
   provides a bispecific antibody which comprises two heavy chains, as defined above, and two
25 light chains, the two light chains have different variable regions and may have the same or
   different constant regions.
                In one embodiment the CH2 and CH3 domains employed may be mutated, for example
   in order to reduce the formation of aggregates of IgG4 antibodies.               US 2008/0063635
   Takahashi et al. has investigated a mutant of IgG4 in which arginine at position 409 (409
30 numbered according to EU numbering system or 440 numbered according to the Kabat
   numbering system) in the CH3 domain is substituted with lysine, threonine, methionine or
   leucine in order to inhibit aggregate formation at low pH. Further mutations at L235, D265,
   D270, K322, P329 and P331 (L235, D265, D270, K322, P329 and P331 numbered according
   to EU numbering system or L248, D278, D283, K341, P348 and P350 numbered according
35 to the Kabat numbering system) are also taught in order to attenuate CDC activity.
   W02008/145142 Van de Winkel et al. discloses stable IgG4 antibodies that have a reduced
   ability to undergo "Fab-arm exchange" (referred to herein as dynamic heavy chain exchange)
   by substitution of the arginine residue at position 409, the Phe residue at position 405 or the
   Lys at position 370 (R409, F405 and K370 numbered according to EU numbering system or
40 R440, F436 and K393 numbered according to the Kabat numbering system) even in the

   absence of the S228P (S228 numbered according to EU numbering system or S241 according
   to the Kabat numbering system) mutation in the hinge region.
                In one embodiment the antibody of the present invention is a whole asymmetric
   mixed antibody comprising two light chains and two heavy chains, wherein each heavy chain
 5 comprises an IgG4 CHI wherein the cysteine at position 127, numbered according to the
   Kabat numbering system is substituted with another amino acid, an IgG1 upper and middle
   hinge region, an IgG4 lower hinge region, a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain.
                The complete hinge region of an IgG4 antibody typically consists of residues 226 to
   251 (numbering based on Kabat numbering system.                  However the hinge region may be
10 shortened or lengthened as required. For example, antibodies according to the first aspect of
   the present invention, the wild type amino acid is substituted with a cysteine residue at
   position 227, 228, 229 or 230, the hinge region may end after the new cysteine residue at
   position 227, 228, 229 or 230.               Antibodies according to the present invention may also
   comprise one or more further amino acids positioned N-terminal and/or C-terminal of the
15 hinge region. In addition other characteristics of the hinge can be controlled, such as the
   distance of the hinge cysteine(s) from the light chain interchain cysteine, the distance
   between the cysteines of the hinge and the composition of other amino acids in the hinge that
   may affect properties of the hinge such as flexibility e.g. glycines may be incorporated into
   the hinge to increase rotational flexibility or prolines may be incorporated to reduce
20 flexibility.              Alternatively combinations of charged or hydrophobic residues may be
   incorporated into the hinge to confer multimerisation or purification properties.             Other
   modified hinge regions may be entirely synthetic and may be designed to possess desired
   properties such as length, composition and flexibility.
                The constant region domains, in particular in the Fc domain, where present, employed
25 in the present invention, are preferably of IgG4 isotype where antibody effector functions are
   not required. According each heavy chain preferably comprises an IgG4 CH2 domain and a
   CH3 domain, as shown in SEQ ID NO: 64.
                It will be appreciated that sequence variants of the Fc constant region domains may
   also be used.
30              In one embodiment each heavy chain comprises IgG4 CH2 and CH3 domains wherein
   the arginine at position 409 (EU numbering) is substituted with lysine, threonine, methionine
   or leucine in order to inhibit aggregate formation at low pH (US 2008/0063635 Takahashi et
   al.)     Mutations at L235, D265, D270, K322, P331 and P329 (numbered according to EU
   numbering system) are also taught in order to attenuate CDC activity (US 2008/0063635
35 Takahashi et al.).
                Each heavy chain may comprise the mutations as taught in W02008/145142 Van de
   Winkel et al. which discloses stable IgG4 antibodies that have a reduced ability to undergo
   Fab-arm exchange by substitution of the arginine residue at position 409, the Phe residue at
   position 405 or the Lys at position 370 (numbered according to EU numbering system).

                In one embodiment each heavy chain comprises an IgG4 CH2 domain and an IgGI
   CH3      domain, as shown in SEQ ID NO: 65.
                In the embodiment of the present invention wherein the antibody is a mutated IgG3,
   IgD or IgM antibody, each heavy chain preferably comprises a CH2 domain and a CH3
 5 domain, and optionally a CH4 domain. In the IgG3 antibody each heavy chain preferably
   comprises IgG3 CH2 domain and a IgG3 CH3 domain. In the IgD antibody each heavy chain
   preferably comprises IgD CH2 domain and a IgD CH3 domain. In the IgM antibody each
   heavy chain preferably comprises 1gM CH2 domain, a IgM CH3 domain and a IgM CH4
   domain.
10              In one embodiment, the antibody is a monoclonal, fully human, humanized or
   chimeric antibody fragment. In one embodiment the antibody is fully human or humanised.
                Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared by any method known in the art such as the
   hybridoma technique (Kohler & Milstein, Nature, 1975, 256, 495-497), the trioma technique,
   the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al., Immunology Today, 1983, 4, 72) and
15 the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., "Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy",
   pp. 77-96, Alan R. Liss, Inc., 1985).
                Antibodies for use in the invention may also be generated using single lymphocyte
   antibody methods by cloning and expressing immunoglobulin variable region cDNAs
   generated from single lymphocytes selected for the production of specific antibodies by, for
20 example, the methods described by Babcook, J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1996,
   93(15), 7843-7848, WO 92/02551, W02004/051268 and W02004/106377.
                Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species having one or
   more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a
   framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule which optionally comprise one
25 or more donor residues from the non-human species (see, for example, US 5,585,089).
                The antibodies for use in the present invention can also be generated using various
   phage display methods known in the art and include those disclosed by Brinkman et al., J
   Immunol. Methods, 1995, 182, 41-50; Ames et al., J Immunol. Methods, 1995, 184, 177-186;

   transgenic mice, or other organisms, including other mammals, may be used to generate
35 humanized antibodies.
                Fully human antibodies are those antibodies in which the variable regions and the
   constant regions (where present) of both the heavy and the light chains are all of human
   origin, or substantially identical to sequences of human origin, not necessarily from the same
   antibody. Examples of fully human antibodies may include antibodies produced for example
40 by the phage display methods described above and antibodies produced by mice in which the

   murine immunoglobulin variable and/or constant region genes have been replaced by their
   human counterparts eg. as described in general terms in EP0546073 BI, US 5,545,806, US
   5,569,825, US 5,625,126, US 5,633,425, US 5,661,016, US5,770,429, EP 0438474 BI and
   EP0463151 BI.
 5              The antibody starting material for use in the present invention may be prepared by the
   use of recombinant DNA techniques involving the manipulation and re-expression of DNA
   encoding the antibody variable and constant region(s).                 Standard molecular biology
   techniques may be used to modify, add or delete amino acids or domains as desired. Any
   alterations to the variable or constant regions are still encompassed by the terms ' variable'
10 and ' constant' regions as used herein.
                The antibody starting material may be obtained from any species including for
   example mouse, rat, rabbit, hamster, camel, llama, goat or human. Parts of the antibody may
   be obtained from more than one species, for example the antibody may be chimeric. In one
   example, the constant regions are from one species and the variable regions from another.
15 The antibody starting material may also be modified. In another example, the variable region
   of the antibody has been created using recombinant DNA engineering techniques. Such
   engineered versions include those created for example from natural antibody variable regions
   by insertions, deletions or changes in or to the amino acid sequences of the natural
   antibodies. Particular examples of this type include those engineered variable region
20 domains containing at least one CDR and, optionally, one or more framework amino acids
   from one antibody and the remainder of the variable region domain from a second antibody.
   The methods for creating and manufacturing these antibodies are well known in the art (see
   for example, Boss et al., US 4,816,397; Cabilly et al., US 6,331,415; Shrader et al., WO
   92/02551; Ward et al., 1989, Nature, 341, 544; Orlandi et al., 1989, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.
25 USA, 86, 3833; Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature, 322, 323; Bird et al, 1988, Science, 242,

   Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev, 10, 1-142; Verma et al., 1998, Journal of Immunological
   Methods, 216, 165-181).
                In one embodiment the antibody comprises a variable domain pair forming a binding
30 domain is a cognate pair. Cognate pair as employed herein is intended to refer to a natural
   pair of variable domains, that is to say isolated from a single antibody or antibody expressing
   cell.
                Variable domains may have been optimized and/or humanized.
                Optimised/humanized variable domains derived from a cognate pair will still be
35 considered a cognate pair after optimization/humanization.
                Thus the invention extends to human, humanized or chimeric molecules.
                In one embodiment the molecule specifically binds a target antigen. Specifically
   binds as employed herein is intended to refer to molecules having high affinity for a target
   antigen (to which it is specific) and which binds antigens to which it is not specific with a

                                                      31
   low or much lower affinity (or not at all). Methods of measuring affinity are known to those
   skilled in the art and include such assays as BIAcoreTM.
                The antibody molecules of the present invention suitably have a high binding affinity,
   in particular, nanomolar or picomolar. Affinity may be measured using any suitable method
 5 known in the art, including BIAcoreTM. In one embodiment the molecule of the present
   invention has a binding affinity of about 100 pM or better. In one embodiment the molecule
   of the present invention has a binding affinity of about 50pM or better. In one embodiment
   the molecule of the present invention has a binding affinity of about 40pM or better. In one
   embodiment the molecule of the present invention has a binding affinity of about 30pM or
10 better. In one embodiment the molecule of the present invention is fully human or
   humanised and has a binding affinity of about 100pM or better.
                A derivative of a naturally occurring domain as employed herein is intended to refer
   to where one, two, three, four or five amino acids in a naturally occurring sequence have
   been replaced or deleted, for example to optimize the properties of the domain such as by
15 eliminating undesirable properties but wherein the characterizing feature(s) of the domain
   is/are retained.
                In one embodiment the antibody molecules of the present invention comprise one or
   more albumin binding peptides. In vivo the peptide binds albumin, which increases the half
   life of the molecule.
20              The albumin binding peptide may be appended from one or more variable regions, a
   hinge or C-terminal of the molecule or any location that does not interfere with the molecules
   antigen binding properties.
                Examples of albumin binding peptides are provided in WO 2007/106120.
                It will also be understood by one skilled in the art that the antibody may undergo a
25 variety of posttranslational modifications. The type and extent of these modifications often
   depends on the host cell line used to express the molecule as well as the culture conditions.
   Such modifications may include variations in glycosylation, methionine oxidation,
   diketopiperazine formation, aspartate isomerization and asparagine deamidation. A frequent
   modification is the loss of a carboxy-terminal basic residue (such as lysine or arginine) due to
30 the action of carboxypeptidases (as described in Harris, RJ. Journal of Chromatography
   705:129-134, 1995).
                If desired a molecule for use in the present invention may be conjugated to one or
   more effector molecule(s). It will be appreciated that the effector molecule may comprise a
   single effector molecule or two or more such molecules so linked as to form a single moiety
35 that can be attached to the antibody molecule of the present invention. Where it is desired to
   obtain an antibody according to the invention linked to an effector molecule, this may be
   prepared by standard chemical or recombinant DNA procedures in which the antibody is
   linked either directly or via a coupling agent to the effector molecule. Techniques for
   conjugating such effector molecules to an antibody are well known in the art (see, Hellstrom
40 et al., Controlled Drug Delivery, 2nd Ed., Robinson et al., eds., 1987, pp. 623-53; Thorpe et

   al., 1982 , Immunol. Rev., 62:119-58 and Dubowchik et al., 1999, Pharmacology and
   Therapeutics, 83, 67-123).                    Particular chemical procedures include, for example, those
   described in WO 93/06231, WO 92/22583, WO 89/00195, WO 89/01476 and WO03031581.
   Alternatively, where the effector molecule is a protein or polypeptide the linkage may be
 5 achieved using recombinant DNA procedures, for example as described in WO 86/01533 and
   EP0392745.

25 polymers include one or more hydroxy, methyl or methoxy groups.
                Specific examples of synthetic polymers include optionally substituted straight or
   branched chain poly(ethyleneglycol), poly(propyleneglycol) poly(vinylalcohol) or derivatives
   thereof,               especially    optionally     substituted     poly(ethyleneglycol)  such    as
   methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) or derivatives thereof.
30              Specific naturally occurring polymers include lactose, amylose, dextran, glycogen or
   derivatives thereof.
                "Derivatives" as used herein is intended to include reactive derivatives, for example
   thiol-selective reactive groups such as maleimides and the like. The reactive group may be
   linked directly or through a linker segment to the polymer. It will be appreciated that the
35 residue of such a group will in some instances form part of the product as the linking group
   between the antibody of the disclosure and the polymer.
                The size of the polymer may be varied as desired, but will generally be in an average
   molecular weight range from 50ODa to 50000Da, for example from 5000 to 40000Da such as
   from 20000 to 40000Da. The polymer size may in particular be selected on the basis of the
40 intended use of the product for example ability to localize to certain tissues such as tumors or

   extend circulating half-life (for review see Chapman, 2002, Advanced Drug Delivery
   Reviews, 54, 531-545). Thus, for example, where the product is intended to leave the
   circulation and penetrate tissue, for example for use in the treatment of a tumour, it may be
   advantageous to use a small molecular weight polymer, for example with a molecular weight
 5 of around 5000Da. For applications where the product remains in the circulation, it may be
   advantageous to use a higher molecular weight polymer, for example having a molecular
   weight in the range from 20000Da to 40000Da.
                Suitable polymers include a polyalkylene polymer, such as a poly(ethyleneglycol) or,
   especially, a methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) or a derivative thereof, and especially with a
10 molecular weight in the range from about 15000Da to about 40000Da.
                In one example an antibody for use in the present invention is attached to
   poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) moieties. In one particular example the PEG molecules may be
   attached through any available amino acid side-chain or terminal amino acid functional group
   located in the antibody, for example any free amino, imino, thiol, hydroxyl or carboxyl
15 group.         Such amino acids may occur naturally in the antibody or may be engineered into the
   antibody using recombinant DNA methods (see for example US 5,219,996; US 5,667,425;
   WO 98/25971). In one example the molecule of the present invention is a modified antibody
   wherein the modification is the addition to the C-terminal end of its heavy chain one or more
   amino acids to allow the attachment of an effector molecule. Multiple sites can be used to
20 attach two or more PEG molecules.
                In one embodiment a PEG molecule is linked to a cysteine 171 in the light chain, for
   example see W02008/038024 incorporated herein by reference.
                Suitably PEG molecules are covalently linked through a thiol group of at least one
   cysteine residue located in the antibody. Each polymer molecule attached to the modified
25 antibody may be covalently linked to the sulphur atom of a cysteine residue located in the
   antibody.             The covalent linkage will generally be a disulphide bond or, in particular, a
   sulphur-carbon bond. Where a thiol group is used as the point of attachment appropriately
   activated effector molecules, for example thiol selective derivatives such as maleimides and
   cysteine derivatives may be used. An activated polymer may be used as the starting material
30 in the preparation of polymer-modified antibody as described above. The activated polymer
   may be any polymer containing a thiol reactive group such as an a-halocarboxylic acid or
   ester, e.g. iodoacetamide, an imide, e.g. maleimide, a vinyl sulphone or a disulphide. Such
   starting materials may be obtained commercially (for example from Nektar, formerly
   Shearwater Polymers Inc., Huntsville, AL, USA) or may be prepared from commercially
35 available starting materials using conventional chemical procedures.               Particular PEG
   molecules include 20K methoxy-PEG-amine (obtainable from Nektar, formerly Shearwater;
   Rapp Polymere;                    and SunBio) and M-PEG-SPA    (obtainable from Nektar, formerly
   Shearwater).
                The present invention also provides isolated DNA encoding an antibody molecule
40 described herein.

                General methods by which the vectors may be constructed, transfection methods and
   culture methods are well known to those skilled in the art. In this respect, reference is made

                Any suitable host cell/vector system may be used for expression of the DNA
   sequences encoding the molecule of the present invention. Bacterial, for example E. coli, and
   other microbial systems may be used or eukaryotic, for example mammalian, host cell
10 expression systems may also be used.                Suitable mammalian host cells include CHO,
   myeloma or hybridoma cells.
                The present invention also provides a process for the production of an antibody
   molecule as described herein comprising culturing a host cell containing a vector (and/or
   DNA) of the present invention under conditions suitable for leading to expression of protein
15 from DNA encoding an antibody molecule of the present invention, and isolating an antibody
   molecule.
                For production of products comprising both heavy and light chains, the cell line may
   be transfected with two vectors, a first vector encoding a light chain polypeptide and a second
   vector encoding a heavy chain polypeptide. Alternatively, a single vector may be used, the
20 vector including sequences encoding light chain and heavy chain polypeptides.
                The antibody molecules according to the present disclosure are expressed at suitable
   levels from host cells making them conducive to commercial processing.
                The antibody may be specific for any target antigen. The antigen may be a cell
   associated protein, for example a cell surface protein on cells such as bacterial cells, yeast
25 cells, T-cells, endothelial cells or tumour cells, or it may be a soluble protein. Antigens of
   interest may also be any medically relevant protein such as those proteins upregulated during
   disease or infection, for example receptors and/or their corresponding ligands.             Particular
   examples of cell surface proteins include adhesion molecules, for example integrins such as
   PlI   integrins e.g. VLA-4, E-selectin, P selectin or L-selectin, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7,

   necrosis factor-p, colony stimulating factors such as G-CSF or GM-CSF, and platelet derived
   growth factors such as PDGF-a, and PDGF-p, WISP-1 and where appropriate receptors
 5 thereof. Other antigens include bacterial cell surface antigens, bacterial toxins, viruses such
   as influenza, EBV, HepA, B and C, bioterrorism agents, radionuclides and heavy metals, and
   snake and spider venoms and toxins.
                In one embodiment, the antibody may be used to functionally alter the activity of the
   antigen of interest. For example, the antibody may neutralize, antagonize or agonise the
10 activity of said antigen, directly or indirectly.
                In one embodiment the present disclosure extends to a method of generating an
   asymmetric mixed antibody according to the present disclosure comprising the steps of
   taking a symmetrical antibody (i.e. one where both the heavy chains are the same/identical)
   comprising a first heavy chain sequence or a fragment thereof as defined herein and mixing
15 the said antibody in vitro with a second symmetrical antibody comprising a second heavy
   chain sequence or a fragment thereof which is different to said first heavy chain sequence,
   under conditions conducive to heavy chain exchange between the two antibodies, and
   optionally isolation of the asymmetric mixed antibody.
                In vitro conditions conducive to dynamic exchange include reducing conditions.
20 Suitable reducing agents include GSH, 2-mercaptoethanol, 2-mercaptoethylamine, TBP,
   TCEP, cysteine-HCl and DTT.
                Suitable concentrations of the reducing agents are in the range 0.01 to 10mM such as
   0.5 to 5mM. In addition, reduction may be achieved using redox buffers, that is to say
   different relative ratios of oxidised and reduced variants of reagents such as for example:
25 GSH :GSSG and Cys:diCys
                Suitable conditions include ratios of antibodies are in the range 0.5:5 to 5:05, such as
    1:1 or 1:2.
                Suitable temperature include 15 to 40'C, such as 370 C.
                The reducing conditions may be selected to be between the reductive stabilities of the
30 homodimers and the heterodimers.
                In an alternative embodiment the antibodies if the disclosure are prepared employing
   a mixed cell culture, for example~50% exchange occurs. This may yield in the region of 1
   2g/l of the desired bispecific.
                In one embodiment there is provided an asymmetric antibody obtained or obtainable
35 from a method described herein and a formulation comprising same, in particular for use in
   treatment.
                The antibody molecules of the present invention are useful in the treatment and/or
   prophylaxis of a pathological condition.
                Thus there is provided an antibody according to the present invention for use in
40 treatment, by administering a therapeutically effective amount thereof, for example in a
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                     37
   pharmaceutical formulation. In one embodiment the antibody according to the invention is
   administered topically to the lungs, for example by inhalation.
                The antibodies provided by the present invention are useful in the treatment of
   diseases or disorders including inflammatory diseases and disorders, immune disease and
 5 disorders, fibrotic disorders and cancers.
                The term "inflammatory disease" or "disorder" and "immune disease or disorder"
   includes rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, still's disease, Muckle Wells disease,
   psoriasis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), asthma,
   allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, Type I diabetes mellitus,
10 transplantation and graft-versus-host disease.
                The term "fibrotic disorder" includes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), systemic
   sclerosis          (or scleroderma), kidney fibrosis, diabetic nephropathy, IgA nephropathy,
   hypertension, end-stage renal disease, peritoneal fibrosis (continuous ambulatory peritoneal
   dialysis), liver cirrhosis, age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), retinopathy, cardiac
15 reactive fibrosis, scarring, keloids, burns, skin ulcers, angioplasty, coronary bypass surgery,
   arthroplasty and cataract surgery.
                The term "cancer" includes a malignant new growth that arises from epithelium,
   found in skin or, more commonly, the lining of body organs, for example: breast, ovary,
   prostate, lung, kidney, pancreas, stomach, bladder or bowel. Cancers tend to infiltrate into
20 adjacent tissue and spread (metastasize) to distant organs, for example: to bone, liver, lung or
   the brain.
                The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical or diagnostic composition
   comprising an antibody of the present invention in combination with one or more of a
   pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier. Accordingly, provided is the use of
25 an antibody of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament.             The composition will
   usually be supplied as part of a sterile, pharmaceutical composition that will normally include a
   pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention
   may additionally comprise a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant.
                The present invention also provides a process for preparation of a pharmaceutical or
30 diagnostic composition comprising adding and mixing the antibody of the present invention
   together with one or more of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier.
                The antibody of the disclosure may be the sole active ingredient in the pharmaceutical
   or diagnostic composition or may be accompanied by other active ingredients including other
   antibody ingredients, for example anti-TNF, anti- IL-i anti -T cell, anti-IFNy or anti-LPS
35 antibodies, or non-antibody ingredients such as xanthines. Other suitable active ingredients
   include antibodies capable of inducing tolerance, for example, anti-CD3 or anti-CD4
   antibodies.
                In a further embodiment the antibody or composition according to the disclosure is
   employed in combination with a further pharmaceutically active agent, for example a
40 corticosteroid (such as fluticasone propionate) and/or a beta-2-agonist (such as salbutamol,
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                      38
   salmeterol or formoterol) or inhibitors of cell growth and proliferation (such as rapamycin,
   cyclophosphmide, methotrexate) or alternative a CD28 and /or CD40 inhibitor. In one
   embodiment the inhibitor is a small molecule. In another embodiment the inhibitor is an
   antibody specific to the target.
 5              The pharmaceutical compositions suitably comprise a therapeutically effective
   amount of the antibody of the invention. The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used
   herein refers to an amount of a therapeutic agent needed to treat, ameliorate or prevent a
   targeted disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic or preventative effect.
   The therapeutically effective amount can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays or
10 in animal models, usually in rodents, rabbits, dogs, pigs or primates. The animal model may
   also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration.
   Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in
   humans.
                The precise therapeutically effective amount for a human subject will depend upon
15 the severity of the disease state, the general health of the subject, the age, weight and gender
   of the subject, diet, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction
   sensitivities and tolerance/response to therapy. This amount can be determined by routine
   experimentation and is within the judgment of the clinician. Generally, a therapeutically
   effective amount will be from 0.01 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg, for example 0.1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg.
20 Pharmaceutical compositions may be conveniently presented in unit dose forms containing a
   predetermined amount of an active agent of the invention per dose.
                Compositions may be administered individually to a patient or may be administered
   in combination (e.g. simultaneously, sequentially or separately) with other agents, drugs or
   hormones.
25              The dose at which an antibody of the present invention is administered depends on the
   nature of the condition to be treated, for example the extent of the disease/inflammation
   present and on whether the molecule is being used prophylactically or to treat an existing
   condition.
                The frequency of dose will depend on the half-life of the antibody and the duration of
30 its effect. If the antibody has a short half-life (e.g. 2 to 10 hours) it may be necessary to give
   one or more doses per day. Alternatively, if the antibody has a long half-life (e.g. 2 to 15
   days) it may only be necessary to give a dosage once per day, once per week or even once
   every 1 or 2 months.
                The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier should not itself induce the production of
35 antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition and should not be toxic.
   Suitable carriers may be large, slowly metabolised macromolecules such as proteins,
   polypeptides, liposomes, polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric
   amino acids, amino acid copolymers and inactive virus particles.
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                         39
                Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used, for example mineral acid salts, such as
   hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates and sulphates, or salts of organic acids, such as
   acetates, propionates, malonates and benzoates.
                Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers in therapeutic compositions may additionally
 5 contain liquids such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol. Additionally, auxiliary
   substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering substances, may be present
   in such compositions. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical compositions to be formulated
   as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries and suspensions, for ingestion
   by the patient.
10              Suitable forms for administration include forms suitable for parenteral administration,
   e.g. by injection or infusion, for example by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Where
   the product is for injection or infusion, it may take the form of a suspension, solution or
   emulsion in an oily or aqueous vehicle and it may contain formulatory agents, such as
   suspending, preservative, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the molecule of
15 the disclosure may be in dry form, for reconstitution before use with an appropriate sterile
   liquid.
                Once formulated, the compositions of the invention can be administered directly to
   the subject. The subjects to be treated can be animals. However, in one or more
   embodiments the compositions are adapted for administration to human subjects.
20              Suitably in formulations according to the present disclosure, the pH of the final
   formulation is not similar to the value of the isoelectric point of the antibody, for example if
   the pH of the formulation is 7 then a pI of from 8-9 or above may be appropriate. Whilst not
   wishing to be bound by theory it is thought that this may ultimately provide a final
   formulation with improved stability, for example the antibody remains in solution.
25              The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by any
   number of routes including, but not limited to, oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-arterial,
   intramedullary, intrathecal, intraventricular, transdermal, transcutaneous (for example, see
   W098/20734), subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, enteral, topical, sublingual,
   intravaginal or rectal routes. Hyposprays may also be used to administer the pharmaceutical
30 compositions of the invention. Typically, the therapeutic compositions may be prepared as
   injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions. Solid forms suitable for solution in, or
   suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection may also be prepared.
                Direct delivery of the compositions will generally be accomplished by injection,
   subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously or intramuscularly, or delivered to the
35 interstitial space of a tissue. The compositions can also be administered into a lesion. Dosage
   treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule.
                It will be appreciated that the active ingredient in the composition will be an antibody.
   As such, it will be susceptible to degradation in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, if the
   composition is to be administered by a route using the gastrointestinal tract, the composition
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                                 40
   will need to contain agents which protect the antibody from degradation but which release the
   antibody once it has been absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
                A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically                   acceptable carriers is available in
   Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Company, N.J. 1991).
 5              In one embodiment the formulation is provided as a formulation for topical
   administrations including inhalation.
                Suitable            inhalable preparations    include   inhalable powders, metering      aerosols
   containing propellant gases or inhalable solutions free from propellant gases. Inhalable
   powders according to the disclosure containing the active substance may consist solely of the
10 abovementioned active substances or of a mixture of the abovementioned active substances
   with physiologically acceptable excipient.
                These inhalable powders may include monosaccharides (e.g. glucose or arabinose),
   disaccharides (e.g. lactose, saccharose, maltose), oligo- and polysaccharides (e.g. dextranes),
   polyalcohols (e.g. sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol), salts (e.g. sodium chloride, calcium carbonate)
15 or mixtures of these with one another. Mono- or disaccharides are suitably used, the use of
   lactose or glucose, particularly but not exclusively in the form of their hydrates.
                Particles for deposition in the lung require a particle size less than 10 microns, such as
    1-9 microns for example from 0.1 to 5 [tm, in particular from 1 to 5 [tm. The particle size of
   the active ingredient (such as the antibody) is of primary importance.
20              The propellent gases which can be used to prepare the inhalable aerosols are known in
   the art. Suitable propellent gases are selected from among hydrocarbons such as n-propane,
   n-butane or isobutane and halohydrocarbons such as chlorinated and/or fluorinated
   derivatives of methane, ethane, propane, butane, cyclopropane or cyclobutane.                              The
   abovementioned propellent gases may be used on their own or in mixtures thereof.
25              Particularly suitable propellent gases are halogenated alkane derivatives selected from
   among TG 11,                      TG 12, TG 134a and TG227. Of the abovementioned halogenated
   hydrocarbons,                     TG134a     (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane)      and   TG227      (1,1,1,2,3,3,3
   heptafluoropropane) and mixtures thereof are particularly suitable.
                The propellent-gas-containing inhalable aerosols may also contain other ingredients
30 such as cosolvents, stabilisers, surface-active agents (surfactants), antioxidants, lubricants
   and means for adjusting the pH. All these ingredients are known in the art.
                The propellant-gas-containing inhalable aerosols according to the invention may
   contain up to 5 % by weight of active substance. Aerosols according to the invention contain,
   for example, 0.002 to 5 % by weight, 0.01 to 3 % by weight, 0.015 to 2 % by weight, 0.1 to 2

   Other antibodies prepared are described in the table above.
   The heavy chain of antibody 48 (Sequence ID NO: 266) was generated by PCR and
   restriction enzyme cloning. The PCR product was generated by a forward oligo encoding the
   IgG1 upper and core hinge region sequence and a restriction site BglII and a reverse oligo
 5 encoding the restriction enzyme DrallI.               The PCR fragment was then digested with above
   mentioned enzymes and ligated into the hG4 single gene vector containing the appropriate
   variable region.
   2. Expression of the mutated I!G4 antibodies
   All mutant DNA was transfected into CHOKI cells. Cells (2x10 8 cells/ml) were resuspended
10 in 1 ml Earles Balance Salt Solution (Sigma) and mixed with 400 ptg of DNA (200 pag heavy
   chain DNA and 200 tg kappa light chain DNA). 800pl aliquots were transferred to 0.4 cm
   cuvettes (Biorad). For a 500 ml culture, six cuvettes were electroporated under the following
   parameters:              1 ms, 9.6 Amps; 10 ms, 0 Amps; 40 ms, 3.2 Amps. The transfected cells were

                                                         44
   incubated for 24 hrs, shaking at 140 rpm in a 5% CO 2 humidified environment at 37'C and
   continued from day 2 post transfection at 32'C for 10-13 days. On day 4 post transfection 1.6
   mls 1 M sodium butyrate was added to the culture. Once the cells reached 40% viability or
   up to day 13, the supernatant was harvested. Cultures were centrifuged for 45 minutes at
 5 4000 rpm.               The supernatant was put through a 0.22 [M Stericup filter (Millipore) to be
   purified.
   3. Purification of mutated I!G4 antibodies
   Supernatants (200-500 ml) were purified using a Protein A 5 ml HiTrap MabSelect SuRe
   column (GE Healthcare, Amersham UK). Samples were prepared by adding                   1 /5 0 th of the
10 supernatant volume of 2 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5. Samples were loaded onto the column at 1
   ml/min. The column was washed with PBS pH 7.4. To elute the samples, 0.1 M sodium
   citrate, pH 3.4 was run through the column at 1 ml/min and 0.5 ml fractions were collected.
   Peak fractions were neutralised by adding 0.125 ml of 2 M Tris-HCl pH8.5 to each. UV
   detection was set at 280 nm.
15 4. Characterization of purified mutated I!G4 antibodies
   SDS PAGE analysis:
   Crude supernatant was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 mins and quantified on the OCTET.
   Antibody samples (25-30ng) were prepared by adding the appropriate amounts of antibody,
   4x Loading Buffer (Invitrogen) and 2 p 100mM NEM. A total volume of 20 ptl was made
20 up using dH 20. The samples were then boiled for 3 mins at 100'C and loaded onto a 15 well
    1.5 mm 4-20% Tris-Glycine gel. Gels were run at 150 V for 1.5 hrs in 1x Tank buffer.
   Antibodies were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot dry transfer system
   set to transfer for 8 mins. The membrane was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) in
   PBS-TM on a shaking platform, followed by incubation with a rabbit anti-human IgG Fc
25 HRP conjugated antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) or goat anti-human Kappa light chain
   HRP conjugated antibody (Bethyl) for 1 hr, shaking at RT. This was followed by 3 washes
   of 5 mins each with PBS-T. The blots were revealed using a metal enhanced DAB substrate
   kit according to the manufacturer' s instructions (Rerce).
   The results of the immuno-blot analysis is shown in Figures 7, 8, 9 and 10. In Figure 7-10, H
30 stands for heavy chain and L for light chain, H2L2 is a whole antibody molecule comprising
   two heavy chains and two light chains and HL is a half molecule comprising one heavy chain
   and one light chain.
   Figure 7 shows the immuno-blot analysis for antibodies 15, 16, 6, 7, 8, 17, 18, 19, 5, 5P, 9,
    10, 11, 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 13 and 14. It can be seen from Figure 7 that the antibodies show a good
35 level of H2L2 except for antibodies 4, 8 and 14 which show no or very little H2L2 due to the
   presence of both hinge mutations C239S and C242S. However, antibodies 4, 8 and 14 can
   form H2L2 by non-covalent bonding between the heavy chains. Mutant 3 also shows little
   H2L2, this mutant retains C239 but is unable to form inter heavy chain disulphides in the
   hinge, presumably due to efficient formation of a disulphide between the C-terminal light
40 chain (LC) cysteine and the hinge C239. It can also be seen that antibodies which comprise
   9995452_1 (GHMatters) P97849.AU.1

                                                             45
   the mutation C239S but not C242S (antibodies 2, 6, 9 and 12) show reduced formation of HL
   compared to antibodies which comprise neither C239S nor C242S or antibodies which
   comprise C242S but not C239S. Antibodies 5P and 16 which comprise the S241P mutation
   also show reduced formation of HL. A comparison of mutants 2 and 3 shows the extent of
 5 the ' reach'             of the Germinal cysteine of light chain to form a disulphide bond with the heavy
   chain, it appears that the light chain cysteine bonds more efficiently to C239 than to C242 in
   the heavy chain.
   Figure 8 shows the immuno-blot analysis for antibodies 15, 6, 7, 8, 28, 29, 30, 31, 17, 19, 32,
   33, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39. It can be seen from Figure 8 that the antibodies show a
10 good level of H2L2 except for antibodies 8, 31, 35 and 39 which show no or very little H2L2
   due to the presence of mutations C239S and C242S in the hinge region and therefore no
   disulphide bonds form between two heavy chains. However, antibodies 8, 31, 35 and 39 can
   form H2L2 by non-covalent bonding between the heavy chains.                       It can also be seen that
   antibodies which comprise the mutation C239S but not C242S (antibodies 6, 29, 33 and 37)
15 show reduced formation of HL compared to antibodies which comprise neither C239S nor
   C242S or antibodies which comprise C242S but not C239S.                      Mutant 15 is able to form a
   disulphide bond between the light chain and G230C in the CHI and inter heavy chain
   disulphides hence resulting in a fully assembled and disulphide bonded protein. Furthermore,
   a comparison of mutants 15(C127S G230C), 28(C127S Y229C), 32(C127S K228C) and
20 36(C127S S227C) shows that the position of the introduced cysteine in the upper hinge
   improves inter LC-HC disulphide bond formation. G230 and Y229 are particularly preferred
   positions to introduce a cysteine. Mutant 28 (C 127S Y229C) shows a low level of HL and H2
   and therefore has low disulphide bond heterogeneity.
   Figure 9 shows the immuno-blot analysis for antibodies 15, 6, 7, 8, 44, 45, 46, 47, 17 and 19.
25 It can be seen from Figure 9 that the antibodies show a good level of H2L2 except for
   antibodies 8 and 47 which show no or very little H2L2 due to the presence of mutations
   C239S and C242S in the hinge region and therefore no disulphide bonds form between two
   heavy chains.                 However, antibodies 8 and 47 can form H2L2 by non-covalent bonding
   between the heavy chains. It can also be seen that antibodies which comprise the mutation
30 C239S but not C242S (antibodies 6 and 45) show reduced formation of HL compared to
   antibodies which comprise neither C239S nor C242S or antibodies which comprise C242S
   but not C239S. In particular, mutant 44 shows that insertion of three amino acids in the upper
   hinge can also reduce the formation of HL and H2 and hence has lower levels of disulphide
   heterogeneity than the comparable mutant 15.
35 Figure 10, shows the immuno-blot analysis for antibodies 48, 17, 18 and 19. It can be seen
   from Figure 10, that antibody 48 shows a good level of H2L2 and very little HL. Mutant 48
   contains the IgGI upper hinge sequence EPKSCDKTHT SEQ ID NO: 319 in place of the
   IgG4 upper hinge sequence along with a core hinge S241P mutation. Hence mutant 48 has
   the upper and core hinge sequence EPKSCDKTHTCPPCP SEQ ID NO: 320. Mutant 48
40 shows lower levels of disulphide bond heterogeneity compared to the wild type IgG4

   antibody 17 and approximately equivalent low levels of disulphide bond heterogeneity
   compared to the IgG4 S241P mutant 18 and wild type IgGI antibody 19.
   Thermofluor assay:
   Thermostabilities of purified mAbs were analyzed in a thermofluor assay using SYPRO@
 5 Orange to monitor the thermal unfolding process of proteins. 5 pl of mAb at 1 mg/ml, 5 pl of
   30xdye, and 40 pl of PBS were added together.                    Ten pl of the mix was dispensed in
   quadruplicate to a 384 PCR optical well plate and was run on the 7900HT Fast Real-Time
   PCR System (Agilent Technologies UK Ltd, Wokingham UK). This PCR System contains a
   heating device for accurate temperature control set at 20'C to 99'C; a charged coupled device
10 simultaneously monitors the fluorescence changes in the wells.
   Figures 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 show the results of the thermostability analysis of the IgG4
   Antibody mutants compared to wild-type IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies.
   A comparison of mutant 15 with wild type IgG4 (mutant 17) shows and increase in the Fab
   Tm due to the altered disulphide arrangement. A comparison of mutant 15 and 28 shows
15 further improvement in Fab Tm for mutant 28 comprising Y229C mutation compared to
   mutant 15 comprising G230C mutation. A comparison of mutant 15 and 44 shows that the
   Fab Tm of a G230C mutant can be further increased further by insertion of three amino acids
   in the upper hinge. Comparison of mutants 17 and 18 show that the S241P middle hinge
   mutation does not increase Fab Tm even though it significantly reduces HL formation.
20 Mutant 48 also shows significantly improved Fab Tm when compared to both wild type IgG4
   (mutant 17) and mutant 15.
   Figure 15 shows the overall ranking of the thermostabilites of selected IgG4 mutants
   according to the present invention. Mutants 48, 44, 44P, 46, 45, 6, 29, 30, 28, 28P, 31, 8, 47
   and 15 all show significantly higher Fab Tm values compared to the wild type IgG4 (mutant
25  17) and wild type IgG4 S241P (mutant 18).
   5. Fab arm exchange
   a) In vitro heavy chain exchange
   A first IgG4 antibody and a second IgG4 antibody, each having different antigen specifities,
   were mixed in a 1:2 molar ratio at a total concentration of 100 ug/ml in phosphate buffered
30 saline (PBS) (in mM: 150 NaCl, 10 NaH 2 PO 4 ; pH 7.4). To allow disulphide bond reduction,
   samples were supplemented with reduced Glutathione (GSH; Sigma) to a final concentration
   of 0, 0.5 or 5 mM. At the start of the experiment (t = 0 hours) an aliquot of the mixture was
   taken, quenched with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; Sigma) to a final concentration of 10 mM (to
   inactivate potentially reactive thiol groups) and incubated alongside the rest of the mixture
35 for 16 hours at 37oC (t           = 16 hours). After incubation, the t = 16 hours sample was quenched
   as above.

   The exchange of heavy chains between antibody 1 and 2 in the table above provides
   asymmetric antibodies with a heavy chain from each of the relevant antibodies.
   b)Detection and quantificationof heavy chain exchange in vitro
   The presence of functionally active bispecific antibodies was determined using a sandwich
 5 MSD assay in which quenched reaction samples provided in Example 5 a), serially diluted in
    1 % BSA in PBS (PB), were pre-incubated with 1 ug/ml biotinylated-antigen 1 (antigen of
   first antibody) in PB for 1 h at RT with agitation (200 r.p.m) before being transferred to PB
   pre-blocked streptavidin coated MSD plates (Meso Scale Diagnostics).       After 1 h incubation
   at RT with agitation, wells were washed three times with PBS/0.1 % Tween-20 before being
10 incubated with 1 ug/ml of sulfo-tagged antigen 2 (antigen of second antibody) in PB. After
   incubation, plates were washed as above and signals revealed and measured using the
   manufactures read buffer and Image Sector 6000 instrument, respectively. Background
   values obtained from control parallel reactions in which biotinylated-antigen was substituted
   for a non-biotinylated alternative, were subtracted from all signals. Duplicate values from at
15 least 3 independent experiments were used in all calculations. The higher the MSD signal the
   larger the amount of heavy chain exchange that has occurred.
   Figure 16 shows heavy chain exchange at 16 hours wherein the first antibody is selected from
   IgGI wild-type, IgG4 wild-type and various mutant antibodies and the second antibody is
   IgG4 wild-type at two concentrations of GSH. The figures show that the mutants have less
20 exchange than the wild-type IgG4 antibodies and significantly greater exchange than the
   IgGI wild-type antibody. This is advantageous in that the exchange can be used to prepare
   the asymmetric antibodies of the present disclosure in vitro, which in vivo have less
   susceptibility to undergo exchange than wild type IgG4 antibodies.          In some instances
   increasing the concentration of the reducing agent, such as GSH increases the amount of
25 exchange observed.
   In good agreement with the literature (Labrijn 2011, Lewis 2009, Stubenrauch 2010, Labrijn
   2009) we show that the S241P mutation in the IgG4 core-hinge represents a tool for
   preventing Fab-arm exchange (Figure 16).            It can also be seen that mutant bispecific
   antibodies of the present invention would demonstrate less Fab arm exchange than has been
30 shown at 0.5 mM GSH, which is 100 times higher than the 4-6 uM physiological GSH
   concentration of plasma (Zilmer. et al, 2005. Drug Design Reviews). Accordingly, bispecific
   antibodies may be created in vitro by Fab arm exchange under reducing conditions, which
   would then have significantly reduced Fab arm exchange in vivo compared to IgG4 wt.

   Figure 17 shows that a glycine at position 241 can readily exchange with IgG4 mutants with
   either an alanine or threonine at this position. An IgG4 with an alanine at position 241 will
   exchange somewhat more with a mutant with a threonine at this position than a mutant with a
   glycine at this position. Similarly an IgG4 mutant with a Threonine at position 241 showed
 5 reduced exchanged activity if in a reaction with S241G compared to a symmetric assay.
   Exchange with IgG4 S241A was similar to the symmetric assay. In summary, this suggests
   that IgG4 S241T exchanges at similar levels to IgG4 WT and is more likely to exchange
   compared to mutants S241A and S24 1G.
   Antibody Affinity:
10 The affinity of selected mutant IgG4 antibodies of the present invention to the target soluble
   cytokine may be measured by BlAiacoreTM. The assay format is capture of the IgG' s on an
   anti-Fc surface followed by titration of soluble cytokine.
   The term "kd" (s -1), refers to the dissociation rate constant of the antibody-antigen
   interaction. Said value is also referred to as the koff value.
15 The term "ka" (M -1 s -1), as used herein, refers to the association rate constant of the
   antibody-antigen interaction.
   The term "KD" (M) or "KD" (pM), as used herein, refers to the dissociation equilibrium
   constant of the antibody-antigen interaction.
   Size exclusion (SEC) HPLC Analysis:
20 Approximately 50ug purified antibody was run on the HPLC using a S200 column. Abs 1 to
    19 were used for the analysis.     This result shows that non-covalently associated H2L2 is
   formed despite alterations to the DSB arrangements of a human IgG4 molecule.
