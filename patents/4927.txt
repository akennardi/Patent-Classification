                                              ABSTRACT
The present invention generally relates to succinimide-activated nitroxyl compounds and methods for
the synthesis of succcinimide-activated nitroxyl compounds. The present invention also relates to the
use of succinimide-activated nitroxyl compounds to prepare nitroxylated proteins, for example
nitroxylated heme proteins (e.g., nitroxylated hemoglobin and nitroxylated myoglobin). The
nitroxylated proteins are optionally also conjugated to a polyalkylene oxide (PAO), for example to a
polyethylene glycol (PEG). Polynitroxylated heme proteins are useful as oxygen therapeutic agents

 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
        [0002]    Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers ("HBOC") have long been associated with
vasoconstriction that has been attributed to nitric oxide (NO) scavenging by heme. Oxygen
carriers that are useful as oxygen therapeutics (sometimes referred to as "oxygen-carrying plasma
expanders"), such as stabilized hemoglobin (Hb), have been shown to have limited efficacy
because they scavenge nitric oxide, causing vasoconstriction and hypertension. The propensity
of these oxygen carrying solutions to cause vasoconstriction can manifest as hypertension in
animals and man. Although the mechanisms underlying the vasoconstrictive effects of HBOCs
are not well understood, it has been suggested that the heme iron may combine rapidly and
irreversibly with endogenous NO, a powerful vasodilator, thereby causing vasoconstriction.
        [0003]    In part because of these vasoconstrictive effects, no oxygen carrier to date has
been entirely successful as an oxygen therapeutic agent (OTA), although products comprising
modified cell-free Hb have been the most promising. Human Hb cross-linked between a-chains
with bis-dibromosalicyl-fumarate (aaHb) was developed by the U.S. Army as a model red cell
substitute, but was abandoned after it exhibited severe increases in pulmonary and systemic
vascular resistance (Hess, J. et al., 1991, Blood 78:356A). A commercial version of this product
                                                    1

 WO 2013/151776                                                                PCT/US2013/032704
was also abandoned after a disappointing Phase III clinical trial (Winslow, R. M., 2000, Vox
Sang 79:1-20).
         [0004] Two molecular approaches have been advanced in attempting to overcome the
NO binding activity of Hb. The first approach used site-directed mutagenesis of the distal heme
pocket in an attempt to create a recombinant hemoglobin with reduced NO-binding affinity (Eich,
R.F. et al., 1996, Biochem. 35:6976-83). The second approach used a chemical modification
approach wherein the size of the Hb was enhanced through oligomerization in an attempt to
reduce or possibly completely inhibit the extravasation of Hb from the vascular space into the
interstitial space (Hess, J.R. et al., 1978, J. Appl. Physiol. 74:1769-78; Muldoon, S.M. et al.,
1996, J. Lab. Clin. Med. 128:579-83; Macdonald, V.W. el al., 1994, Biotechnology 22:565-75;
Furchgott, R., 1984, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. 24:175-97; and Kilbourne, R. et al., 1994, Biochem.
Biophys. Res. Commun. 199:155-62).
         [0005] In fact, recombinant Hbs with reduced association binding rates for NO have
been produced that are less hypertensive in top-load rat experiments (Doherty, D.H. etg al. 1998,
Nature Biotechnology 16:672-676 and Lemon, D.D. et al.1996, Biotech 24:378). However,
studies suggest that NO binding may not be the only explanation for the vasoactivity of Hb. It
has been found that certain large Hb molecules, such as those modified with polyethylene glycol
(PEG), were virtually free of vasoconstriction, even though their NO association rates were
identical to those of the severely hypertensive aaHb (Rohlfs, R.J. et al. 1998, J Biol. Chem.
273:12128-12134). Furthermore, it was found that PEG-Hb was extraordinarily effective in
preventing the consequences of hemorrhage when given as an exchange transfusion prior to
hemorrhage (Winslow, R.M. et al. 1998, J. Appl. Physiol. 85:993-1003).
         [0006] The conjugation of PEG to Hb reduces its antigenicity and extends its circulation
half-life. However, the PEG conjugation reaction has been reported to result in dissociation of
Hb tetramers into a-dimer subunits causing gross hemoglobinuria in exchange-transfused rats
receiving PEG-conjugates of Hb monomeric units below 40,000 Daltons ("Da") (Iwashita and
Ajisaka Organ-Directed Toxicity: Chem. Indicies Mech., Proc. Symp., Brown et al. 1981, Eds.
Pergamon, Oxford, England pgs 97-101). A polyalkylene oxide ("PAO") conjugated Hb having a
molecular weight greater than 84,000 Daltons was prepared by Enzon, Inc. (U.S. Pat. No.
5,650,388) that carried about 10 copies of PEG-5,000 chains linked to Hb at its a and c-amino
groups. This degree of substitution was described as avoiding clinically significant nephrotoxicity
associated with hemoglobinuria in mammals. However, the conjugation reaction resulted in a
                                                      2

  WO 2013/151776                                                                PCT/US2013/032704
heterogeneous conjugate population and contained other undesirable reactants that had to be
removed by column chromatography.
         [0007] PEG conjugation is typically carried out through the reaction of an activated PEG
moiety with a functional group on the surface of biomolecules. The most common functional
groups are the amino groups of lysine, imidazole groups of histidine residues, and the N-terminus
of proteins; thiol groups of cysteine residues; and the hydroxyl groups of serine, threonine and
tyrosine residues and the C-terminus of the protein. PEG is usually activated by converting the
hydroxyl terminus to a reactive moiety capable of reacting with these functional groups in a mild
aqueous environment. One of the most common monofunctional PEGs used for conjugation of
therapeutic biopharmaceuticals is methoxy-PEG ("mPEG-OH"), which has only one functional
group (i.e. hydroxyl), thus minimizing cross-linking and aggregation problems that are associated
with bifunctional PEG. However, mPEG-OH is often contaminated with high molecular weight
bifunctional PEG (i.e. "PEG diol"), which can range as high as 10 to 15% (Dust J.M. et al. 1990,
Macromolecule 23:3742-3746) due to its production process. This bifunctional PEG diol has
roughly twice the size of the desired monofunctional PEG. The contamination problem is further
aggravated as the molecular weight of PEG increases. The purity of mPEG-OH is especially
critical for the production of PEGylated biotherapeutics, because the FDA requires a high level of
reproducibility in the production processes and quality of the final drug product.
         [0008] Conjugation of Hb to PAOs has been performed in both the oxygenated and
deoxygenated states. U.S. Pat. No. 6,844,317 describes conjugating Hb in the oxygenated, or "R"
state by equilibrating Hb with the atmosphere prior to conjugation to enhance the oxygen affinity
of the resultant PEG-Hb conjugate. Others describe a deoxygenation step prior to conjugation to
diminish the oxygen affinity and increase structural stability, enabling the Hb to withstand the
physical stresses of chemical modification, diafiltration and/or sterile filtration and pasteurization
(U.S. Pat. No. 5,234,903). For intramolecular cross-linking of Hb, it is suggested that
deoxygenating Hb prior to modification may be required to expose lysine 99 of the a-chain to the
cross-linking reagent (U.S. Pat. No. 5,234,903).
         [0009] The kinetics of Hb thiolation with 2-iminothiolane prior to conjugation with PEG
was investigated by Acharya et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 7,501,499). It was observed that increasing the
concentration of iminothiolane from 10-fold, which introduced an average of five extrinsic thiols
per tetramer, to 30-fold nearly doubled the number of extrinsic thiols on Hb. However, the size
enhancement seen after PEG conjugation was only marginal, even with double the number of
                                                   3

  WO 2013/151776                                                                 PCT/US2013/032704
thiols. This suggested that the conjugation reaction in the presence of 20-fold molar excess of
maleimidyl PEG-5000 covered the surface of the Hb with less reactive thiols, resulting in steric
interference that resisted further modification of Hb with more reactive thiols. Consequently, to
achieve the desired degree of conjugation of modified Hb (i.e. 6+1 PEG per Hb molecule),
Acharya et al. thiolated Hb with an 8-15 molar excess of iminothiolane, and then reacted the
thiolated Hb with a 16-30 fold molar excess of maleimidyl PEG-5000. However, these high
molar excess reactant concentrations in large-scale production significantly increase the cost for
preparing the HBOC and increase the heterogeneity of the final product. Moreover, such high
molar excess of the maleimidyl PEG-5000 also results in a more heterogeneous product with the
production of a greater number of unwanted side reactants.
        [0010] In previous studies, it was observed that the molecular size of surface modified
hemoglobin has to be large enough to avoid being cleared by the kidneys and to achieve the
desired circulation half-life. Blumenstein, J. et al., determined that this could be achieved at, or
above, a molecular weight of 84,000 Daltons ("Da") ("Blood Substitutes and Plasma Expanders,"
Alan R. Liss, editors, New York, N.Y., pages 205-212 (1978)). In that study, the authors
conjugated dextran of varying molecular weight to Hb. They reported that a conjugate of Hb
(with a molecular weight of 64,000 Da) and dextran (having a molecular weight of 20,000 Da)
"was cleared slowly from the circulation and negligibly through the kidneys." Further, it was
observed that increasing the molecular weight above 84,000 Da did not significantly alter these
clearance curves. Intramolecular cross-linking chemically binds together subunits of the
tetrameric hemoglobin unit to prevent the formation of dimers which are prematurely excreted by
the kidney. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,296,465)
        [0011] Nitroxides are well-established antioxidant compounds of low toxicity that
attenuate oxidative damage in animal models of inflammatory disease and preserve bioavailable
NO gas. They are believed to exert protective effects principally by acting as SOD mimetics or
radical scavengers. Thus, polynitroxylated compounds have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
properties. This is not to be confused with combining HBOCs with nitric oxide (NO) donor
molecules, which have been reported to enhance vascular relaxation. See, e.g., U.S. Patent
Application Publication No. 2010/0311657. However, SOD-mimetic nitroxides have a short
plasma half-life due to their small size, and thus it is difficult to maintain the antioxidant efficacy
of these molecules in vivo.

        [0012] In view of the foregoing, there is a need in the art for oxygen therapeutic agents
that do not cause vasoconstriction and hypertension and that have antioxidant and anti
inflammatory properties.
        [0013] Moreover, current methods for activating nitroxides for use as nitroxylating
agents are multistep and expensive processes. There is therefore a need in the art for methods for
simple and inexpensive methods for making activated nitroxide compounds for use as
nitroxylating agents.

DEFINITIONS
         [0034] When the terms "one," "a" or "an" are used in this disclosure, they mean "at least
one" or "one or more," unless otherwise indicated.
         [0035] "Activated polyalkylene oxide" or "activated PAO" as used herein refer to a PAO
molecule that has at least one functional group. A functional group is a reactive moiety that
interacts with free amines, sulfhydryls or carboxyl groups on a molecule to be conjugated with
PAO. For example, one such functional group that reacts with free sulfhydryls is a maleimide
group. A functional group that reacts with free amines is a succinimide group.
         [0036] "Deoxyhemoglobin" or "unliganded hemoglobin" means any hemoglobin to
which no exogenous ligand is bound to heme.
         [0037] "Hemoglobin" or "Hb" refers generally to a heme protein that transports oxygen.
In humans, each molecule of Hb has 4 subunits, 2 a-chain subunits and 2 f-chain subunits,
which are arranged in a tetrameric structure. Each subunit also contains one heme group, which
is the iron-containing center that in the ferrous (Fe 2 ) binds the ligands 02, NO or CO. Thus,
each Hb molecule can bind up to 4 ligand molecules, making HbO2, HbNO, or HbCO liganded
compounds, respectively. Additionally, the hemoglobin may be liganded with mixtures of 02,
NO and CO.
         [0038] "Hemoglobin based oxygen carriers" (HBOCs) refers to hemoglobins that carry
oxygen, but are also useful for carrying other molecular gases, such as carbon monoxide and
nitric oxide.
         [0039] "High oxygen affinity" refers to hemoglobin that has been modified to exhibit an
oxygen affinity greater than that of stroma free-hemoglobin (SFH). Thus, a "high oxygen
                                                   10

WO 2013/151776                                                              PCT/US2013/032704
affinity" Hb has a P50 less than that of SFH, which has a P50 of 15 mmHg as measured at 370 C
and pH 7.4.
         [0040] "Liganded hemoglobin" means hemoglobin to which an exogenous ligand is
bound to heme. Common preferred ligands include oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide.
         [0041] "MalPEG" refers to maleimidyl polyethylene glycol, and includes a maleimidyl
moiety attached to polyethylene glycol via a linker.
         [0042] "MalPEG-Hb" refers to Hb to which maleimidyl-activated PEG has been
conjugated. The conjugation is performed by reacting MaIPEG with thiol groups (and to a lesser
extent, amino groups) on the Hb to form MalPEG-Hb. Thiol groups are found in cysteine
residues present in the amino acid sequence of Hb, such as the two intrinsic thiols at pCys 93,
and can also be introduced by modifying surface amino groups to contain a thiol group. An
exemplary MalPEG-Hb known as MP4 (Sangart, Inc.) has the following formula:
wherein Hb is hemoglobin; S is a thiol group on the hemoglobin; n is the number of oxyethylene
units of the 5,000-Dalton polyalkylene oxide polymer; and m is the average number of
maleimidyl-activated polyalkylene oxide polymers conjugated to the hemoglobin and is 7-8.
         [0043] "Methemoglobin" or "metHb" refer to an oxidized form of Hb that contains iron
in the ferric state. MetHb does not function as an oxygen or CO carrier. The term
"methemoglobin %" as used herein refers to the percentage of oxidized Hb to total Hb.
         [0044] "Methoxy-PEG" or "mPEG-OH" refer to PEG wherein the hydrogen of the
hydroxyl terminus is replaced with a methyl (-CH3) group.
         [0045] "Modified hemoglobin" or "modified Hb" refers to Hb that has been altered by a
chemical reaction, such as intra- and inter-molecular crosslinking, polymerization, conjugation,
and /or recombinant techniques, such that the Hb is no longer in its "native" state. As used
                                                 11

herein, the terms "hemoglobin" or "Hb" refer to both native unmodified Hb and modified Hb,
unless otherwise indicated.
         [0046] "Nitrite reductase activity" or "NRA" is the ability of hemoglobin or a
hemoglobin-based protein to reduce nitrite to nitric oxide. "Maximal nitrite reductase activity"
is the maximum rate that hemoglobin or a hemoglobin-based protein is able to reduce nitrite to
nitric oxide. "Initial nitrite reductase activity" is the initial rate that hemoglobin or a
hemoglobin-based protein reduces nitrite to nitric oxide when nitrite is added to the fully
deoxygenated protein.
         [0047] The term "non-oxygenated" means that the heme protein or hemoglobin is in the
non-liganded, deoxygenated state, or it is liganded with a gas other than 02, such as NO or CO.
         [0048] "Oxygen affinity" refers to the avidity with which an oxygen carrier, such as Hb,
binds molecular oxygen. This characteristic is defined by the oxygen equilibrium curve, which
relates the degree of saturation of Hb molecules with oxygen (Y axis) with the partial pressure
of oxygen (X axis). The position of this curve is denoted by the "P50" value, which is the partial
pressure of oxygen at which the oxygen carrier is half-saturated with oxygen, and is inversely
related to oxygen affinity. Hence, the lower the P50 , the higher the oxygen affinity. The oxygen
affinity of whole blood (and components of whole blood, such as red blood cells and Hb) can be
measured by a variety of methods known in the art. (see, e.g., Winslow, R.M. et al, J. Biol.
Chem. 1977, 252:2331-37). Oxygen affinity may also be determined using a commercially
available HEMOXTM Analyzer (TCS Scientific Corporation, New Hope, PA). (see, e.g.,
Vandegriff and Shrager in "Methods in Enzymology" (Everse et al, eds.) 232:460 (1994)) ; and
Vandegriff, et al., Anal. Biochem. 256(1): 107-116 (1998)).
         [0049] The term "oxygen therapeutic agent" as used herein refers to a heme protein that
is capable of binding to and carrying molecular oxygen to cells/tissues/organs in need thereof.
When administered in the form of a CO- or NO-liganded heme protein, once the CO or NO is
released from the heme moiety, the heme groups are then free to bind to and carry molecular
oxygen.
         [0050] "Polyethylene glycol" or "PEG" refer to a polymer of the general chemical
formula H(OCH 2CH 2)n OH where "n" is greater than or equal to 4, preferably about 45 to about
500, more preferably about 70 to about 250, and most preferably about 90 to about 140, or about
                                                    12

115. The polymer can be substituted or unsubstituted, and the terminal hydroxy group can be
replaced with a different conventional terminal group, such as methoxy or carboxy. PEGs are
commercially available from many sources (e.g., Carbowax T M (Dow Chemical, Midland, MI),
Poly-G@ (Arch Chemicals, Norwalk, CT) and Solbase).
        [0051] "Polyethylene glycol-conjugated hemoglobin," "PEG-Hb conjugate" or "PEG
Hb" refer to Hb to which at least one PEG is covalently attached.
        [0052] "Solution" refers to a liquid mixture and the term "aqueous solution" refers to a
solution that contains some water and may also contain one or more other liquid substances with
water to form a multi-component solution.
        [0053] "Stroma-free hemoglobin" or "SFH" refer to Hb from which red blood cell
membranes have been removed.
        [0054] "Surface-modified hemoglobin" refers to hemoglobin to which chemical groups,
usually polymers, have been attached, such as dextran or polyalkylene oxide. The term "surface
modified oxygenated hemoglobin" refers to Hb that is in the "R" state when it is surface
modified.
        [0055] "Terminal activity" is an indication of the percentage of PAO that is
functionalized with a moiety capable of reacting with a reactive group of the heme protein or
hemoglobin. "100% Terminal activity" indicates that the molar excess of the PAO used in the
conjugation reaction is expressed on a basis that all of the PAO has a moiety capable of reacting
with a reactive group of the heme protein or hemoglobin. For example, if an available Mal-PEG
has 80% terminal activity such that 80% of the PEGs are functionalized with Mal, and the Mal
PEG is used in 20-fold molar excess over hemoglobin, then this molar ratio can be expressed as
a 16-fold molar excess of Mal-PEG over hemoglobin based on 100% terminal activity.
        [0056] "Thiolation" refers to a process that increases the number of sulfhydryl groups on
a molecule. For example, reacting a protein with 2-iminothiolane ("2-IT") converts free amines
on the surface of the protein to sulfhydryl groups. These sulfhydryl groups are then available for
reaction with a thiol reactive moiety, such as a maleimide.
        [0057] "Unliganded hemoglobin" refers to any hemoglobin containing at least one heme
moiety that is not liganded to a molecular gas such as oxygen, carbon monoxide or nitric oxide.
                                                 13

As such, the hemoglobin is considered "unliganded" if only one of the heme moieties is not
liganded to a molecular gas.
         [0058] The term "heme protein" as used herein to any single or multiple chain protein
that bears a heme moiety that binds gases, such as oxygen, nitric oxide or carbon monoxide.
         [0059] The term "nitroxide" as used herein refers to stable nitroxide free radicals, their
precursors and derivatives thereof. This term is not to be confused with nitric oxide donor
molecules.
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
         [0060] The present invention generally relates to succinimide-activated nitroxyl
compounds that can be used to nitroxylate proteins. For example, such nitroxyl compounds can
be used to nitroxylate a heme protein such as hemoglobin. Nitroxylation of a heme protein with
the succinimide-activated nitroxyl compounds counteracts the oxidation of NO and other
biomolecules by oxidative substances, such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. The
polynitroxylated heme proteins of the present invention are useful as (OTAs) that are capable of
delivering molecular oxygen, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and mixtures thereof.
Succinimidyl Nitroxide Reagents
         [0061] The present invention relates to succinimidyl nitroxide reagents that can be used
to nitroxylate the amino groups of proteins. The succinimidyl nitroxide reagents generally
comprise a succinimide linked to a nitroxide group, for example a TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl
piperidine-1-oxyl) or PROXYL (2,2,5,5-tetriamethylpyrrolidine-N-oxyl) nitroxide group. The
linkage between the succinimide and the nitroxide can be, for example, a carboxy linkage or a
carbonate linkage. Such reagents, for example nitroxyl succinimidyl carbonates, are highly
reactive, making coupling between the amines of proteins and succinimide highly efficient.
         [0062] For example, the present invention relates to a nitroxylating agent of formula (I):

As shown above, 4-hydroxy-TEMPO (4-Hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl) is used
to prepare 4-succinmidyl- TEMPO-carbonate using one-step activation chemistry. Activation of
TEMPOL to 4-Succinimidyl-TEMPO-Carbonate is achieved by reaction of TEMPOL with
N,N'-Disuccinimidyl-Carbonate in presence of triethylamine. The organic base (TEA in the
reaction scheme above) is used as a catalyst that deprotonates the -OH group of the hydroxyl
nitroxide (TEMPOL in the reaction scheme above), making it more reactive such that it can act
as a nucleophile and attack the electrophilic carbonyl of N,N'-Disuccinimidyl-Carbonate (DSC).

The PAO has a molecular weight of about 2,000 to about 20,000 Daltons, preferably from about
3,000 to about 10,000 Daltons, more preferably from 4,000 to about 6,000 Daltons, and most
preferably about 5,000 Daltons. The most common PAO presently used to modify the surface of
proteins is PEG because of its pharmaceutical acceptability and commercial availability. PEG is
available in a variety of molecular weights based on the number of repeating subunits of
ethylene oxide (i.e. -CH 2CH 20-) within the molecule, to achieve a desired molecular weight
based on the number and size of the PEG molecules conjugated to a protein.
        [0097] One or both of the terminal end groups of the PAO polymer are converted into a
reactive functional group ("activated"). For example, PEG-OH has been used to prepare PEG
halide, mesylate or tosylate, which is then converted to PEG-amine ("PEG-NH 2") by performing
a nucleophilic displacement reaction with aqueous ammonia (Zalipsky, S. et al., 1983, Eur.
Polym. J. 19:1177-1183), sodium azide or potassium phthalimide. The activated PEG can then
be conjugated to a protein through the interaction of the PEG amine group (-"NH 2 ") with a
carboxyl group ("-COOH") of the protein.
        [0098] In addition to functionalizing PEG with an amine group and converting it to a
maleimide group, PEGs that are activated therewith, are known to be used in the art. For
example, PEG may be activated with p-nitrophenyl carbonate, aldehyde, aminopropyl,
aminoethyl, thiol, aminoxy, hydrazide, and iodoacetamide, to name a few. Such functional PEG
can be conjugated to the surface amino acid side chains of proteins using known methods.
        [0099] PEG-NH 2 can be further functionalized to conjugate with groups other than
carboxyl. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,828,401 discloses the reaction of PEG-NH 2 with
maleimide to form mPEG-maleimide. In this reaction, mPEG-OH is reacted with a tosylating
reagent (p-toluenesulfonyl chloride) and a base catalyst (triethyleneamine) in the presence of an
organic solvent (dichloromethane) to produce mPEG-tosylate. The mPEG-tosylate is then
reacted with 28% ammonia water and maleic acid anhydride in an organic solvent mixture of N,
N-dimethylacetamide ("DMAc") and N-cyclohexylpyrrolidinone ("CHP") to produce a
maleamic acid compound. This compound is then reacted with
                                                 22

pentafluorophenyltrifluoroacetate in the presence of dichloromethane to produce the mPEG
maleimide.
          [00100]         Alternatively, mPEG-maleimide can be made by reacting mPEG-OH with
a tosylating reagent (p-toluenesulfonyl chloride) and a base catalyst (triethyleneamine) in the
presence of an organic solvent (dichloromethane) to produce mPEG-tosylate. The mPEG
tosylate is then reacted with 28% ammonia to prepare mPEG-NH 2. The mPEG-NH 2 is then
reacted with N-methoxy carbonyl maleimide (MCM) in the presence of saturated sodium
hydrocarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) to produce mPEG-maleimide.

          [00102]         One method to increase the number of available conjugation sites on Hb
is to introduce sulfhydryl groups (also known as thiolation), which tend to be more reactive with
MalPEG than free amines. A variety of methods are known for protein thiolation. In one
method, protein free amines are reacted with succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate
followed by reduction with dithiothreitol ("DTT"), or tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine ("TCEP").
This reaction releases the 2-pyridinethione chromophore, which can be used to determine the
degree of thiolation. Amines can also be indirectly thiolated by reaction with
                                                    23

succinimidylacetylthioacetate, followed by 50 mM hydroxylamine, or hydrazine at near-neutral
pH.
         [00103]         Another method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,484 maintains the
positive charge of the amino (a- or P-) group of the Hb after conjugation. This method involves
amidination of the c-amino groups of Hb by 2-IT to introduce sulfhydryl groups onto the
protein. This approach has at least two additional advantages over the previously used
succinimidyl chemistry: 1) the high reactivity and selectivity of maleimide groups with
sulfhydryl groups facilitates the near quantitative modification of the thiols, with a limited
excess of reagents and 2) the thiol group of 2-IT is latent and is generated only in situ as a
consequence of the reaction of the reagent with the protein amino groups. These advantages
provide one additional benefit; they allow simultaneous incubation of Hb with both the
thiolating and PEGylation reagent for surface decoration.
         [00104]         For example, MalPEG can be conjugated to Hb by thiolating an amine of
the Hb to introduce thiol groups on the surface of the Hb. The two intrinsic thiol groups of Hb
that are available for reaction are at pCys93, and added thiol groups on the surface of the Hb can
react with the maleimide of the maleimidyl PAO to form a pegylated Hb conjugate.
         [00105]         The maleimide-PEG includes a linker to attach the maleimide to the PEG.
Linkers can include, but are not limited to, alkylene such as ethylene, propylene, or
isopropylene, phenylene, amide (-NH-C(O)-), or phenyl carbamate (e.g., -Ph-NH-C(O)-).
         [00106]        Non-limiting examples of amino acid residue side chains that can be
modified using thiol reactive chemistry are presented in Table 2 below:

         [00107]         The molecular weight of the PAO-Hb can be regulated by the conjugation
reaction. Conventional thought suggested that increasing the molar ratios of the reactants would
increase the number of PEG molecules bound to Hb. This included both the thiolation process
                                                   24

of Hb (i.e. increasing the molar ratio of thiolating agent to Hb) and the conjugation process (i.e.
increasing the molar ratio of thiol activated PEG to thiolated Hb). However, these excess molar
ratios resulted in the binding of only 61 PEG molecules per Hb (see U.S. Pat. No. 7,501,499).
         [00108]         Recently it was determined that a greater number of PAO molecules could
be bound to Hb using lower molar ratios of reactants. The number of available thiol groups on
Hb, before and after thiolation and after conjugation, was determined using the dithiopyridine
colorimetric assay (Ampulski, R.S. et al., 1969, Biochem. Biophys. Acta 32:163-169). Human
Hb contains two intrinsic, reactive thiol groups at the   p93cysteine residues, which was
confirmed by the dithiopyridine reaction. After thiolation of SFH with 2-IT, the number of
reactive thiol groups increased from two to over seven. In this example, an average of 8 PEG
molecules was bound to Hb. This was achieved using a 7.5-fold molar excess of 2-IT over SFH
in the thiolation reaction and a 12-fold molar excess of MalPEG over thiolated Hb in the
conjugation reaction.
         [00109]         Hemoglobin is conjugated with polyalkylene oxide when it is in the
oxygenated state to increase the oxygen affinity of the Hb-PAO conjugate.

         [00148]       The hemoglobin tetramers described herein wherein the hemoglobin is
conjugated to on average 5 to 10 PAO molecules per tetramer, the hemoglobin is conjugated to
on average 7.1 to 8.9 PAO molecules per tetramer.
         [00149]       The hemoglobin tetramer wherein the hemoglobin is oxygenated.
         [00150]       The hemoglobin tetramer wherein the hemoglobin is deoxygenated.
         [00151]       The hemoglobin tetramer wherein the hemoglobin is liganded with CO,
NO, or a mixture of CO and NO.
         [00152]       The hemoglobin conjugates of the invention can be in oxygenated or
deoxygenated form, can be liganded to CO or NO, or can be a mixture including two or more of
these four forms. HbO 2 is prepared by equilibrating non-oxygenated hemoglobin with air, pure
02 gas or 02 / nitrogen gas mixtures.
         [00153]       Deoxygenation can be performed by any method known in the art. One
simple method is to expose the hemoglobin solution to an inert gas, such as nitrogen, argon or
helium. To assure that deoxygenation is relatively homogeneous, the Hb solution is circulated
in this process. Monitoring deoxygenation to attain desired levels may be performed by using a
Co-oximeter 682 (Instrument Laboratories). If partial reoxygenation is desired, deoxygenated
Hb may be exposed to oxygen or to a gas mixture containing oxygen, such as air.
         [00154]       Gas exchange to replace molecular oxygen with another gas may be
accomplished through a gas-permeable membrane, such as a polypropylene or cellulose acetate
membrane. See, for example, published U.S. Patent Application No. 2006/0234915.
Commercially available gas-exchange devices utilizing these membranes include the Celgard TM
polypropylene microporous hollow fiber device from Hoechst-Celanese (Dallas, TX) or the
Cell-PharmTM hollow fiber oxygenator from American Laboratory (East Lyme, CT). In the
Hoechst-Celanese CelgardTM device, oxygenated Hb is deoxygenated by passing an aqueous Hb
solution through polypropylene microporous hollow filters at 10-100 ml/min/ft2 while the
system is purged with nitrogen at 5-20 psi. The Hb is generally circulated for about 5 to 30
minutes to achieve the desired percentage of deoxyHb. Another method for producing

deoxygenated Hb comprises exposing a Hb solution to a chemical reducing agent such as
sodium ascorbate, sodium dithionate and sodium bisulfite. Hb is partially deoxygenated by
adjusting the reducing agent concentration, reaction time and temperature. Alternatively, a
reducing agent may be used to substantially deoxygenate Hb, and then oxygen may be
reintroduced to form a partially deoxygenated product. For example, Hb can be exposed to a
100 mM concentration of sodium bisulfite for about one hour before adding antioxidants.
         [00155]        Hb can be liganded to CO using any known methods for forming
oxyhemoglobin, simply by substituting CO for 02. This generally involves introducing a source
of CO to a solution of hemoglobin such that the hemoglobin becomes liganded with CO instead
of 02 (K. D. Vandegriff, et al., Biochem. J. 3 82:183-189 (2004)). Since hemoglobin has a higher
affinity for CO than it does for oxygen, it is not necessary to first deoxygenate the hemoglobin.
Accordingly, the most convenient way of forming CO-Hb complexes is by introducing 100%
gaseous CO to a solution of hemoglobin.
         [00156]        HbNO can be prepared by reacting deoxygenated hemoglobin with nitric
oxide gas, or by exposing CO-Hb to NO gas such that the NO exchanges for CO. HbNO can
also be made by reacting deoxygenated hemoglobin with a small NO-donor molecule like
PROLI NONOateTM (i.e., I -(hydroxy-NNO-azoxy)-L-proline, disodium salt; Cayman Chemical,
Ann Arbor, Michigan).
         [00157]        It should be noted that hemoglobin to which NO, a free radical, is bound
to the amino acid side groups in the globin chain are not NO-Hb complexes as defined herein,
since such compounds do not contain diatomic (nonionic) NO as a ligand in the heme pocket
instead of oxygen. For example, nitrosylhemoglobin is formed when native hemoglobin is
exposed to a NO donor under conditions that cause it to bind to free sulfhydryl groups (U.S. Pat.
No. 6,627,738). Such nitrosylhemoglobins still carry oxygen, whereas the NO-Hb complexes of
the present invention do not. Furthermore, when the modified hemoglobin is formed by a
reaction directed towards sulfhydryl moieties such as described above, these moieties are no
longer available for NO binding.

Pharmaceutical Compositions
         [00193]        The PAO-Hb conjugates of the present invention can be formulated as a
pharmaceutical composition comprising the PAO-Hb conjugate in a pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier for parenteral administration, such as an aqueous diluent. The concentration of the PAO
Hb conjugate in the carrier can vary according to the application. Preferably, the PAO-Hb
conjugate concentration ranges from about 0.1 g/dl to about 10 g/dl, more preferably from about
2.0 g/dl to about 8.0 g/dl, and most preferably about 4.0 to about 6.0 g/dl. The selection of an
appropriate concentration of hemoglobin depends on the colloidal osmotic (oncotic) properties
of the final hemoglobin product. Preferably, the compositions of the invention are normo
oncotic as compared to whole blood or hyperoncotic as compared to plasma. The hemoglobin
concentration can be adjusted to obtain the desired oncotic pressure for each indication.
         [00194]        When the composition is formulated as a parenteral, the solution generally
comprises a physiologically compatible electrolyte carrier isosmotic with whole blood and
which maintains the reversible oxygen-, CO- or NO-carrying and delivery properties of the
hemoglobin.
         [00195]        The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be an aqueous diluent. The
aqueous diluent can comprise an aqueous solution of a colloid or an aqueous solution of a non
oxygen carrying component, such as an aqueous solution of proteins such as albumin, an
aqueous solution of glycoproteins, an aqueous solution of polysaccharides, or a combination
thereof. The aqueous diluent can comprise an aqueous cell-free solution.
         [00196]         Suitable aqueous diluents include, but are not limited to, physiological
saline, a saline-glucose mixture, Ringer's solution, lactated Ringer's solution, Locke-Ringer's
solution, Krebs-Ringer's solution, Hartmann's balanced saline, heparinized sodium citrate-citric
acid-dextrose solution, an acetate solution, a multiple electrolyte solution (e.g., Plasma Lyte@ or

WO 2013/151776                                                                 PCT/US2013/032704
Plasma Lyte-A@ from Baxter International, Deerfield, IL), a lactobionate solution, and
polymeric plasma substitutes, such as polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl
alcohol, an ethylene oxide-propylene glycol condensate, or a combination thereof.
          [00197]         The composition can additionally comprise pharmaceutically-acceptable
fillers, salts, and other materials well-known in the art, the selection of which depends on the
dosage form, the condition being treated, the particular purpose to be achieved according to the
determination of the ordinarily skilled artisan in the field and the properties of such additives.
For example, the composition can include physiological buffers, carbohydrates (e.g. glucose,
mannitol, or sorbitol), alcohols or poly alcohols, pharmaceutically acceptable salts (e.g., sodium
or potassium chloride), surfactants (e.g., polysorbate 80), anti-oxidants, anti-bacterial agents,
oncotic pressure agents (e.g. albumin or polyethylene glycols) or reducing agents (e.g., ascorbic
acid, glutathione, or N-acetyl cysteine).
          [00198]         The pharmaceutical compositions have a viscosity of at least about 2
centipoise (cP). More specifically, the viscosity ranges from about 2 to about 5 cP, and
particularly about 2.5 to about 4.5 cP.
          [00199]         In order to avoid complications in administration, the pharmaceutical
composition is of high purity, i.e. free from stroma, phospholipids, and pyrogens, having an
endotoxin level of no more than 0.25 EU/ml, as measured by the LAL (limulus amebocyte
lysate) test, and having less than 8% methemoglobin.
          [00200]         Pharmaceutical compositions can be administered parenterally, such as by
subcutaneous, intravenous, or intramuscular injection, or as large volume parenteral solutions.
The compositions can also be administered by gavage.
          [00201]          A typical dose of hemoglobin conjugate as a therapeutic agent can be
from about I to about 15,000 milligrams of hemoglobin per kilogram of patient body weight.
For example, when used as an oxygen therapeutic, the dosage will range between 100 to 7500
mg/kg patient body weight, more preferably 500 to 5000 mg/kg body weight, and most
preferably 700 to 3000 mg/kg body weight. Thus, a typical dose for a human patient might be
from a gram to over 1000 grams. It will be appreciated that the unit content of active ingredients
contained in an individual dose of each dosage form need not in itself constitute an effective
amount, as the necessary effective amount could be reached by administration of a number of
                                                   40

being treated, and the particular purpose to be achieved according to the determination of those
skilled in the art.
Methods of Treatment
         [00202]          The PAO-Hb conjugates and pharmaceutical compositions can be used to
deliver oxygen, CO and/or NO to a subject. A method of delivering oxygen, nitric oxide, carbon
monoxide or mixtures thereof to tissue and reducing nitrite to produce further endogenous nitric
oxide (NO) in the microvasculature includes administering the hemoglobin conjugate or the
composition to a subject in need thereof, wherein following administration, the hemoglobin
becomes unliganded and converts nitrite to nitric oxide in the microvasculature.
         [00203]          The hemoglobin conjugates and compositions thereof of the invention can
be used: to treat acute liver failure, beta thalassemia, a bum, chronic critical limb ischemia,
carbon dioxide or cyanide poisoning, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (e.g., acute
exacerbations), congestive heart failure (e.g., acute heart failure, chronic heart failure), hypoxia
(e.g., high altitude use including for pulmonary edema, decompression sickness), malaria (e.g.,
cerebral malaria (Falciparum occlusive events), organ ischemia (e.g., acute bowel ischemia
(torsion), acute bowel ischemia (embolism), cardiogenic shock, acute vascular organ ischemia,
stroke (before CAT scan), stroke (after CAT scan), myocardial infarction / severe cardiac
ischemia), peripheral vascular disease, porphyria, pre-eclampsia in pregnancy, sepsis, sickle cell
disease (e.g., stroke/transient ischemic attack, splenic sequestration, hepatic sequestration,
priapism), retinal disease / intra-ocular condition (e.g., central retinal artery occlusion, central
venous occlusion), testicular torsion, trauma / shock (e.g., traumatic hemorrhagic shock, non
traumatic hemorrhagic shock, pre-hospital / field use (military / emergency), traumatic brain
injury / blast), ulcers, or vasospasm; as an adjunct to angioplasty, as an adjunct for plastic
surgery (skin flaps) (e.g., acute treatment, chronic treatment), or as an adjunct in implanting a
ventricular assist device; as a blood substitute (e.g., for acute blood loss, Jehovah's Witness,
difficult to cross-match patient, rare blood group, sickle aplastic crisis, sickle cell anemia
perioperative management, acute hemolytic anemia (autoimmune), acute hemolytic anemia
(toxin), or other refractory anemia), a cardioprotectant, a cryopreservative, a hemodialysis
adjunct, an oncology agent (e.g., adjunct to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, solid tumors), an
organ preservative (e.g., ex vivo, in donor, in recipient), a performance enhancement agent (e.g.,
civilian / athletic, military), a surgery adjunct (e.g., cardiopulmonary bypass (prime),

WO 2013/151776                                                                PCT/US2013/032704
cardiopulmonary bypass (adjustment), lung ischemia, pre-surgery conditioning, ruptured aortic
aneurysm, replacement of thoracic aorta (dissection or aneurysm)), or a wound healing agent; in
imaging (x-ray or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)); to improve lung function (e.g., acute
lung injury, chronic lung injury, transient viral pneumonia, neonatal distress syndrome); or a
combination thereof. Such uses include administration of the conjugate or composition to a
subject in need thereof.
          [00204]        Further, the hemoglobins and compositions of the invention can be used
to treat non-traumatic hemorrhagic shock, pre-hospital setting trauma, traumatic hemorrhagic
shock, acute lung injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome, traumatic brain injury, stroke, solid
tumor cancer, organ degradation (ex-vivo), organ degradation (in recipient), severe sepsis /
septic shock, myocardial infarction / cardiac ischemia, cardiogenic shock, acute heart failure,
pulmonary embolism, various conditions by surgery (e.g., adjunct to angioplasty, adjunct to
thoracic aortic repairs, adjunct to cardiopulmonary bypass, priming solution for
cardiopulmonary bypass), or a combination thereof.
          [00205]        The numerous clinical settings in which the hemoglobins and
compositions of the present invention are useful include the following:
          [00206]        Trauma. An acute loss of whole blood can result in a fluid shift from the
interstitial and intracellular spaces to replace the lost volume of blood while shunting of blood
away from the low priority organs including the skin and gut. Shunting of blood away from
organs reduces and sometimes eliminates 02 levels in these organs and results in progressive
tissue death. The primary goal is to oxygenate affected tissues. This trauma can be in a pre
hospital setting or can result in traumatic hemorrhagic shock or traumatic brain injury.
          [00207]        Ischemia. The conjugates and compositions thereof can also be used to
deliver oxygen, CO, and/or NO to areas that red blood cells or many other oxygen therapeutics
cannot penetrate. These areas can include any tissue areas that are located downstream of
obstructions to red blood cell flow, such as areas downstream of thrombi, sickle cell occlusions,
arterial occlusions, angioplasty balloons, surgical instrumentation, and any tissues that are
suffering from oxygen starvation or are hypoxic. All types of tissue ischemia can be treated
including, for example, stroke, emerging stroke, transient ischemic attacks, myocardial stunning
and hibernation, acute or unstable angina, emerging angina, infarct, and the like. In particular,
conditions resulting in ischemia include acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, myocardial
                                                   42

WO 2013/151776                                                                PCT/US2013/032704
infarction / cardiac ischemia, stroke, pulmonary embolism, non-traumatic hemorrhagic shock, or
cerebrovascular trauma.
         [00208]         Hemodilution. In this application, the therapeutic is administered to
replace (or substitute for) the 02 levels of the removed autologous blood. This permits the use
of the removed autologous blood for necessary transfusions during and after surgery. One such
surgery requiring pre-operative blood removal would be a cardiopulmonary bypass procedure.
         [00209]         Sepsis / Septic Shock. In sepsis, some patients may become hypertensive
in spite of massive fluid therapy and treatment with vasoconstrictor agents. In this instance, the
overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) results in lowered blood pressure. Therefore hemoglobin is
a desirable agent for treatment of these patients because hemoglobin binds NO with a high
avidity.
         [00210]         Hypoxemia. When a patient has acute lung injury caused by either
pneumonia or pancreatitis, hypoxemia can be observed and can be alleviated by providing the
hemoglobins or compositions of the invention to oxygenate the affected tissues.
         [00211]         Cancer. Delivery of 02 to the hypoxic inner core of a solid tumor mass
increases its sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Because the microvasculature of a
tumor is unlike that of other tissues, sensitization through increasing 02 levels requires 02 be
unloaded within the hypoxic core. In other words, the P50 should be very low to prevent early
unloading of the 02, increasing the 02 levels, to insure optimal sensitization of the tumor to
subsequent radiation and chemotherapy treatments.
         [00212]         Surgery. The hemoglobins and compositions of the invention can be used
during various surgical procedures. For example, they can be used as an adjunct to angioplasty,
thoracic aortic repairs, during a cardiopulmonary bypass procedure or as a cardiopulmonary
priming solution.
         [00213]         Organ Perfusion. During the time an organ is maintained ex vivo or in an
organ donation recipient, maintaining 02 content helps preserve structural and cellular integrity
and minimizes infarct formation. The hemoglobins and compositions can sustain the oxygen
requirements for such an organ.
         [00214]         The hemoglobins and compositions thereof can also be used in non
humans, such as domestic animals (e.g., livestock and companion animals such as dogs, cats,
horses, birds, reptiles. It is contemplated that the present invention finds utility in the
emergency treatment of domestic and wild animals suffering a loss of blood due to injury,
hemolytic anemias, etc. Veterinary uses include treatment of loss of blood due to injury,

        One gram of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPOL) was dissolved in
20mL anhydrous acetonitrile and mixed for five minutes at room temperature. Once the
TEMPOL dissolved, 2.975 g of N,N'-Disuccinimidyl carbonate (DSC) (2 eq) and 2.425mL of
triethylamine (3.0 eq) were added to the reaction. The reaction was performed at room
temperature, under anaerobic condition for 6-8 hours. After reaction completion, the solvent
was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed
with saturated aqueous CuSO 4 solution. The organic phase was separated and 0.5g of Na 2 SO 4
per gram of TEMPOL was added to the organic phase. The solution was mixed for 15min at
room temperature followed by filtration. Filtered solution was evaporated under reduced

Carboxy TEMPO dissolved, 0.632 g of N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (1.leq) and 1.15g of
N,N'-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (1.1 eq) were added to the reaction. The reaction was
performed at room temperature under anaerobic conditions for 24 hours. After reaction
completion, the solution was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was
dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed with water. The organic phase was separated and 0.5g of
Na 2 SO4 per gram of 4-Carboxy TEMPO was added to the organic phase. The solution was
mixed for 15 min at room temperature followed by filtration. Filtered solution was evaporated
under the reduced pressure. The product, 4-Succinimidyl-Carboxy-TEMPO was precipitated by
adding n-Heptane, filtered, and dried under vacuum at room temperature.
