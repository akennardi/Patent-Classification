                                     FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[003] The present invention relates to physical exercise machines and more
particularly to an exercise apparatus that enables users to perform simulated
walking, running or other back and forth leg movement exercise that is resisted by a
resistance mechanism.
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[004] Exercise machines for simulating walking or running are known and used for
directing the movement of a user's legs and feet in a variety of repetitive paths of
travel. The user typically performs an exercise using such a walking or running
machine for an extended period of time such as one to 30 minutes without
interruption and without stopping to perform a different exercise using a different
machine such as a user might perform in a circuit protocol of exercise. The
machines typically include an electrically powered mechanism that the user can
activate to adjust some aspect of the machine such as degree of resistance.
Running or walking simulation machines commonly referred to as elliptical path
machines have been designed to pivot the foot pedals on which the user's feet
reside guiding the pedals and the user's feet to travel in an elliptical or arcuate path.
The degree of resistance to performance of the exercise in such prior art machines
                                                1

typically varies linearly with the degree of force or speed exerted by the user to a
moving mechanical component of the apparatus. The path of travel of the foot pedal
in such prior machines is not adjustable other than to change the shape of the
ellipse. The foot travels along a different path from back to front than from front to
back in such elliptical machines.

apparatus that is readily observable by the user,
        wherein the processor includes control instructions that instruct the processor
to send processed signals to the visual display that are indicative of one or more of
instantaneous power and rate of back and forth movement of the foot support
exerted by the user in response to movement of the foot support by the user's foot.
[006] In accordance with a further aspect of the invention there is provided an
exercise apparatus comprising:
        a foot support supported by a linkage system on a frame having a laterally
forward end and a laterally rearward end,
        the foot support being supported on the frame by the linkage system for
reciprocal movement along a master arcuate path of travel having a furthest forward
to furthest rearward position,
        the foot support being arranged on the frame in a disposition for receiving a
user's foot to support the user in a standing upright position,
        the foot support being interconnected to a non-linearly force dependent
resistance mechanism,
        the interconnection of the foot support and the non-linearly force dependent
resistance mechanism comprising an adjustment device that is actuatable by the
user to selectively adjust positioning of the force resistance mechanism in or to any
one of a plurality of predetermined fixed mechanical positions relative to the foot
support,
        wherein actuation of the adjustment device to position the non-linearly force
dependent resistance mechanism in or to one of the predetermined fixed mechanical
                                             3

positions of the non-linearly dependent force resistance mechanism limits travel of
the foot support to a selectable segment of the master arcuate path of travel having
a forwardmost segment position and rearwardmost segment position that are defined
by and peculiar to the fixed position of the non-linearly dependent resistance
mechanism,
        the foot support being mechanically movable along any selectable segment
by a user standing in an upright position and exerting a laterally forward to rearward
directed force of selected degree on the foot support with the foot of the user,
        the non-linearly force dependent resistance mechanism being adapted to
mechanically vary resistance to movement of the foot support to a degree that varies
non-linearly with the selected degree of speed, velocity, force, work or power exerted
by the user on the foot support or the resistance assembly.
[007]     The term "non-linear" or "non-linearly" is meant to encompass and include an
exponential or geometric relationship between the degree of increase in resistance
and the degree of increase in velocity or speed of movement of a mechanical
component of the apparatus as a result of force exerted by the user on the
mechanical component such as the translational movement of a foot pedal or the
rotational movement of a fan wheel. Also, as discussed below, the term "force" is
intended to encompass and include user exerted power, energy or work which are all
directly proportional to force. As shown generically in Fig. 3B, in embodiments
described herein where the resistance assembly includes a fan such as wheel 200,
the degree of resistance or opposing force OF that the finned or fan wheel 200
exerts in response to a user's input of force, work or power increases non-linearly
310, Fig. 3B, with increasing speed or rate of rotation SR of the wheel 200. Typically
the degree of such resistance increases exponentially or geometrically and more
specifically by a cube or cubed factor of or with the degree of speed of rotation SR of
a fan wheel. The degree of increase in resistance may vary in another or different
mathematically determinable non-linear manner with respect to a translational,
sliding, arcuate or pivoting movement of another or different mechanical component
of the apparatus such as a lever or tie bar or the like. Other resistance mechanisms
other than a finned 210 wheel 200 such as an Eddy current controlled brake
mechanism with programmable controls that can be employed that increase,
decrease or vary in degree of resistance relative to the force F exerted by the user in
a non-linear, geometric or exponential manner or relationship.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[068] Figs. 1-13 illustrate various embodiments an arc segment selectable exercise
apparatus 10 that can be used in conjunction with a user interface 20 and associated
processor 500 and sensor(s) or detector(s) D, Fig. 14-21, in accordance with the
invention to enable a user to perform a variety of circuit or interval exercise routines
or regimes in accordance with another aspect of the invention. The processor 500 is
typically mounted within the housing 20h of the user interface but can alternatively
be mounted remotely from the interface 20 and apparatus communicating wirelessly
or via cables or wires with the visual display components of the user interface. A
"processor," as used herein, refers to electrical, electromechanical and electronic
control apparati that can comprise a single box or multiple boxes (typically
interconnected and communicating with each other) that contain(s) all of the
separate electronic processing, memory and electrical or electronic signal generating
components that are necessary or desirable for carrying out, creating, enabling and
implementing the methods, functions and apparatuses described herein. Such
electronic and electrical components include RAM, ROM and solid state or non-solid
state memory devices, programs, algorithms, chips, chipsets, programs, processors,
microprocessors, computers, PID controllers, voltage regulators, current regulators,
                                            20

circuit boards, motors, batteries and instructions for controlling any variable element
discussed herein such as length of time, degree of electrical signal output and the
like. For example a component of a processor, as that term is used herein, includes
programs, data, algorithms, controllers and the like that perform functions such as
storing and processing data, sending and receiving signals from sensors or
detectors, or sending and receiving signals that instruct, and functions such as
monitoring, alerting, initiating, executing or instructing an LCD or other visual display
to display numbers, data or other information in a visually observable format by a
human user.
[069] Figs. 14-21 illustrate a user interface component 20 of an apparatus
according to the invention that serves to facilitate certain forms of cardiovascular
training that have recently emerged: circuit training and interval training. Both
workout techniques use a cycle of brief, high energy activity, followed by a rest
period of similar length, as the fundamental building block for all workout routines.
Interval training consists of a user or group of users repeatedly performing cycles of
a single exercise, alternating between exercise and rest, while maintaining some
form of timing scheme or plan. Circuit training consists of a user or group of users
consecutively performing cycles of different exercises that each exercise different
muscle groups, "circling" from one exercise station to the next while maintaining
some form of timing scheme or plan. At any given step, different users with different
body sizes and fitness levels will operate the same given device, making ease of use
and speed of configuration important factors for any circuit training device.
[070]     As shown in Figs. 12, 14 a detector D can be used to detect any one or more
movements or properties of the apparatus 10 or the user or a component of the
apparatus 10 such as the speed and time of rotation or other movement of the
resistance assembly, in the case of the Figs. 2-3A, 5-12 embodiments a fan 200.
The speed detector can comprise an optical detector, a magnetic field detector, a
Hall effect sensor, a potentiometer, one or more limit switches or any other detector
that is capable of sensing a relevant measurable movement (rotational, translational
or the like) of a mechanical element or component of a relevant mechanical element
such as a wheel like fan wheel 200, an axle like crankshaft 32, 252h, a belt like belts
251, 253, a pulley like pulleys 250, 252, a foot support like supports 24a, 24b, a
support pivot arm like arms 26a-26c or any other moving element of the apparatus,
the rate of movement of which can be converted by an algorithm to the output results
                                             21

desired to be displayed on a visual display on the display area 20a of the user
interface 20. The rate of movement or property detected by the detector D is
generically designated as FR in Figs. 12, 14 for purposes of explanation, it being
understood that FR can alternatively comprise a value indicative of a movement
other than the rotational speed of the fan wheel that can be used in an algorithm to
generate a calculation of a result indicative the mechanical power or work input into
the resistance assembly, a result such as power, energy, velocity, strides per minute,
distance of movement by foot or by a bicycle of predetermined configuration.
[071]    As shown, the detector D sends a signal indicative of FR to the processor
500 which processes the signal according to a predetermined algorithm to calculate
a value indicative of any desired aspect of the user's performance of exercise or the
result of the user's exertion of force or energy in performance of the back and forth
movement of the foot pedals 24a, 24b of the apparatuses shown in Figs. 1-13. In
the examples of Figs. 14-21, the algorithm included in the processor is designed to
use the variable input of FR to calculate for example, the number of watts of power
exerted by the user, the number of meters that the user would have travelled if riding
a bicycle having a preselected configuration while generating such power as
calculated from FR and the number of strides per minute that the user would have
achieved exerting the power or force calculated by the algorithm based on the FR
input as a variable to the algorithm. Where the rotational speed of the fan wheel 200
is sensed and used in an algorithm, other values or parameters peculiar to the wheel
200, such as the number, size and shape of fan blades, are included in the algorithm
in order to generate a value for the moment of inertia of fan wheel 200 (alternatively,
the value for the moment of inertia may be provided to the algorithm in advance, in
the form of a static variable) the moment of inertia being used to calculate the
desired result such as watts, power, energy, work, distance travelled, number of
strides and the like. As can be readily imagined, one or more additional or different
detectors could alternatively be used to sense a rotational or translational movement
and send a signal to processor 500 that is indicative of the speed or velocity of such
movement such as of a shaft 32, 252h, a belt 251, 253, a pulley 250, 252, a foot
support 24a, 24b, a support pivot arm 26a-26d and, a signal indicative of such
movements could be used in an appropriate algorithm to generate and display one
or more visual results indicative of watts, energy or power exerted by the user,
                                            22

number of meters that the user would have travelled if riding a bicycle, number of
strides per minute and the like.
[072] The aforementioned algorithm can include instructions that carry out a
mathematical compensation that accounts for the effects of air temperature and
pressure dependencies in the determination of the mechanical power expressed by
the rotation of fan wheel 200. While the derivation of a power figure based on a
measurement of the angular, or rotational, velocity of a spinning fan is generally
known in the art, such calculations assume a constant value for the density of the
surrounding air. Pressure and temperature sensors (not shown) can provide
additional inputs to the processor 500, allowing a real-time and accurate
measurement of air density to be made and used in the algorithm that generates the
desired output results for display on the user interface. For a gas, such as air, the
relationship between the pressure (P), volume (V), and temperature (T) exhibits a
known and mathematically predictable relationship, generally approximated via the
Ideal Gas Law. It may be further derived that density is directly proportional to the
pressure of the gas, and inversely proportional to the temperature of the gas.
Therefore, the use of temperature and pressure sensor readings and inputs to
processor 500 can enable a calculation of air density for purposes of calculating a
more accurate value for the power generated by rotation of fan blade 200.
[073] Figs. 1-13 illustrate a typical back and forth stride-like foot and leg driven
apparatus that provides a user-exerciser with a low impact workout yet offers the
potential for an intensive cardiovascular workout by eliminating the unnatural motion
and awkward foot alignments typical of many stair-climbing and elliptical training
devices. The apparatus 10 provides one or more foot supports 24a, 24b movable
along an arcuate path defined around a point P of rotation. The arcuate path is
selectively divisible into machine defined, user selectable arc segments. The
apparatus 10 includes a frame 16a, 16b, 16c, 16d, a frame linkage 26a, 26b, 26c,
26d movably engaged with the frame, one or more foot supports 24a, 24b movably
engaged with the frame linkage, a crank 40a, 40b movably engaged with the frame,
and in the embodiments shown, an arc segment selection or adjustment mechanism
that pivots the location of the crank assembly with respect to the frame, and a drive
linkage 28a, 28b movably engaging the frame linkage.
[074] In alternative embodiments (not shown), the arc segment selection device or
assembly can comprise an assembly of mechanical components that enable the
                                           23

user to select an arc segment without pivoting or moving the crank or resistance
assembly relative to the frame.
[075] Figs. 14-21 illustrate a typical embodiment of a user interface 20 that is
mounted and arranged on the frame 16 of the apparatus 10 such that a visual
display and manually actuatable or engageable interface area 20a of the interface 20
is both readily manually accessible by a user and readily visually observable by a
user when a user is standing on a foot support 24a, 24b in particular when standing
upright on a foot support.
[076] FIG. 1-3, 4-11 are view of various embodiments of an arc segment selectable
exercise device that includes a frame 10 having a front region 12, a rear user
disposition region 14, frame legs 16a, 16b, 16c and 16d, and frame upper supports
18a, 18b, 18c, and 18d. Upper supports 18c and 18d comprise the upper links of a
pair of four bar linkages and part of the arcuate portion of the frame, terminate in
legs 16c and 16b respectively and are an integral part of frame 10. A display/control
panel 20 and hand grips 22a and 22b are secured to the upper supports 18a and
18b.
[077] Foot supports 24a and 24b are sized to receive the foot of a user. Foot
supports 24a and 24b are movably connected to, and supported by, forward linkages
or legs 26a and 26b, and rear linkages 26c and 26d. Linkages 26a-26d are movably
connected to the rear region 14 of frame 10 by upper supports or links 18d and 18c.
Although the device is shown with opposing pairs of linkages supporting each foot
support, other embodiments are contemplated having fewer or more linkages
supporting and controlling the range and path of motion of foot supports 24a and 24b
associated with the linkage(s).
[078] The foot supports 24a and 24b approximate a shoed human foot in size and
shape. They can include a non-skid surface and be bounded by one or more low lips
to help a shoe remain in place on the foot supports during use. Alternately, straps
may maintain each foot within the foot support to further retain the user's foot in
place during use. However, as used herein, a "foot support" can also encompass
any designated support such as a pedal, a pad, a toe clip, or other foot/toe/leg and
device interface structure as is known in the art.
[079] The forward linkages or legs 26a and 26b are movably connected to drive
linkages 28a and 28b; and the drive linkages are in turn connected to the resistance
mechanism (illustrated in FIGS. 2A, 3 and 4 and described below) concealed by a
                                            24

housing 30. In other embodiments, the drive linkages 28a and 28b can be connected
directly to the foot supports 24a and 24b. Additionally, foot supports can be on or
integral to either the forward linkages or to the one or more linkages joined to the
frame.
[080] As illustrated in Figs. 1-3, 4-11, representative movable connectors 31a, 31b,
31c, and 31d include pivot assemblies, as known in the art, that provide smooth and
easy relative rotation or reciprocal motion by elements joined by the pivot
assemblies. Movable connectors 31b and 31d rotatably couple forward linkages or
legs 26b and 26a, respectively, to upper supports or links 18c and 18d. Movable
connectors 31c and 31a rotatably couple rear linkages 26c and 26d, respectively, to
upper supports or links 18c and 18d. Other connection assemblies that permit similar
motion are contemplated by the invention. The movable connectors allow for a
smooth and controlled swinging of foot supports 24a and 24b in an arcuate path.
[081] FIG. 2 is a front perspective view of one specific embodiment of an apparatus
10 as shown in FIG. 1 illustrating the elements described above from a different
angle and showing in addition a manually engageable and actuatable screwable arc
segment selectable mechanism 225 that is mechanically interconnected between the
frame component 17 and the pivotable resistance assembly mounting bracket or arm
38. This illustration shows the device from the front region 12 perspective. Once
again it can be seen that foot supports 24a and 24b are suspended from their
respective linkages. Drive linkages 28a and 28b (not shown in FIG. 2) are coupled at
their first ends to the substantial mid-point of front linkages or legs 26a and 26b,
respectively. Drive linkages 28a and 28b are coupled at their second ends to a crank
assembly 40a, 40b, 40c, 40d contained within housing 30, which contains the
resistance assembly shown in FIG. 4 and described in greater detail below.
[082] As shown in Figs. 2, 3, 3A, the screw 225 has a crank or wheel handle 227
connected to a proximal end of the screw 225 that is mounted so as to be readily
manually accessible and engageable by a user located in the user disposition region
14 of the apparatus 10. The handle is readily rotatable or turnable by hand by a
typical human user so as enable the user to readily effect rotation T of the screw 225
to any desired degree of rotation quickly and immediately upon manual engagement.
The screw 225 is screwably engaged at distal position with a screw receiving bracket
or nut 38a, Fig. 3, that is attached to the mounting bracket or arm 38 such that when
the screw 225 is rotated either counterclockwise or clockwise, the bracket or arm 38
                                            25

will pivot back and forth FB a selectable distance depending on the degree of
rotation T of the screw. In the same manner as described below with reference to
the manually drivable piston embodiments of Figs. 5-8 the degree of such pivoting
back and forth FB of bracket or arm 38 as determined by the degree and direction of
rotation T of screw 225 enables the user to selectively change the identity of the
particular arc segment through which the foot pedals will travel when the pedals are
driven between a forwardmost upward and rearwardmost downward position.
Depending on the particular arc segment chosen by the user, the degree of incline of
the foot pedals and thus the degree of difficulty of driving the foot pedals 24a, 24b
back and forth will vary. As shown in Fig. 3 the bracket or arm 38 is disposed in a
first generally vertical disposition similar to the disposition shown in Fig. 5 where the
horizontal component of the force F required is FH1 and vertical component of the
force F required to move the foot pedals is FV1. As shown in Fig. 3A, the screw has
been turned T such that the bracket or arm 38 is now disposed at an angle A relative
to the position of Fig. 3 (similar to the difference in arm and foot pedal positions
between Fig. 6 and Fig. 5) and the horizontal FH2 and FV2 components of force
required to drive the foot pedals 24a, 24b through the new arc segment associated
with the new pivoted position A of the bracket or arm 38 has changed relative to the
position of the arm in Fig. 3 and thus degree of difficulty of the force F needed to
perform an exercise cycle has been selectively changed by the user.
[083] In each of the embodiments described herein the arc segment selection
device is manually actuatable by the user to exert a selectable amount of manual
force on the selection device that operates to selectively position, vary or adjust the
resistance assembly in or to any one of a plurality of predetermined fixed mechanical
positions that vary according to the selectable amount of manual force exerted by
the user on the selection device. Such user force or energy exerted, manually driven
arc segment selection systems are preferred so that a user can immediately without
delay change an arc segment during the course of performing a circuit of different
exercises in rapid sequential succession using different machines or otherwise
performing different exercises that exercise different muscle groups at different
periods of time during the course of the entire circuit of sequential different
exercises.
                                              26

[084]    In alternative embodiments, the selection device can be controllably driven by
a motor or other electrically or electronically powered device rather than via exertion
of a user's manual energy or force.
[085] As shown in Figs. 3, 3A, 5-9, 11-13, the resistance assembly can comprise a
rotatably drivable R wheel 200 having fan blades 210 having surfaces 210a that
engage against ambient air when the wheel is driven R. The degree of resistance to
rotation R of the finned 210 wheel 200 increases or varies exponentially or non
linearly with the degree of speed of rotation R of the finned 210 wheel 200. Typically
the degree of resistance RES, Figs. 3A, 12 to rotation R of a fan or finned wheel 200
increases or varies by a cube or cubed factor of or with the degree of speed of
rotation R. Other resistance mechanisms other than a finned 210 wheel 200 such
as an Eddy current controlled brake mechanism can be employed that increase,
decrease or vary in degree of resistance relative to the force F exerted by the user in
a non-linear, geometric or exponential manner or relationship.
[086] In the embodiment shown in Figs. 2, 3, 3A, 5-8, 11 the axis of the resistance
wheel 200 is connected directly to the axle 32 of a crankshaft such that the wheel
200 rotates R at the same speed of rotation as the crankshaft. Crank arms 40a and
40b are secured to each end of the crankshaft 32 and are movably coupled to the
drive linkages 28a and 28b, respectively. As linkages 28a, 28b are driven back and
forth as a result of back and forth foot driven movement of pedals 24a, 24b, crank
arms 40a, 40b are rotatably R driven which in turn via their interconnection to shaft
32 rotatably R drive shaft 32 around its axis.
[087]     In alternative embodiments shown in Figs. 9, 10, 12, 13 intermediate drive
pulleys or wheels 250, 252 and associated belts 251, 253 are typically employed
whereby the hub 200h of wheel 200 is not directly connected to and does not rotate
in unison with shaft 32 but instead is rotatably driven at a higher rate XR than shaft
32 which is driven at rotation rate R. As shown, in Figs. 12, 13 the crankshaft 32 is
directly connected to the hub 250a of intermediate drive pulley 250 driving pulley at
rate R. Drive pulley 250 in turn drives a second intermediate drive pulley or wheel
252 via belt 251 at a higher rotational rate of YR by way of an intermediate hub 252h
that has a smaller radius than the radius of both of pulleys 250, 252. Intermediate
drive pulley 252 in turn drives fan wheel 200 via belt 253 at an even higher rotational
rate of XR by way of another intermediate hub 200hh to wheel 200 that has a smaller
radius than radius of both pulleys 252 and 250. In a typical embodiment the ratio of
                                             27

XR to R is between about 10:1 and 20:1, most typically between about 13:1 and
15:1.
[088] Rotation of the resistance wheel 200 as described herein whether the wheel
200 rotates in unison with the shaft 32 or at a higher rotational rate creates a
resistance to the force F exerted by the user such that the degree of force resistance
RES created by the wheel 200 varies exponentially or geometrically with the rate of
rotation R or the amount of force exerted by the user on account the interaction of
the surface 21 Oa of the fan blades 210 that are mounted to the axle 220 of the wheel
200 with air. The faster that wheel 200 rotates the amount of air resistance against
surfaces 210a of blades 210 increases exponentially or geometrically. Similarly, the
rate of rotation generally varies non-linearly (exponentially or geometrically), with the
degree of speed, velocity, force, work or power exerted by the user on the foot
supports 24a, 24b or resistance assembly 200 et al.. Typically the degree of
resistance to rotation R of a fan wheel 200 increases or varies by a cube or cubed
factor of or with the degree of speed of rotation of the wheel.
[089] Top bearings 36a and 36b receiving the axle or crankshaft 32 are secured to
a pivotable mounting bracket or arm 38 such that as pivotable bracket or arm 38 is
pivoted forwardly and rearwardly, shaft 32 and its associated wheel 200 is pivoted
forwardly and backwardly together with bracket or arm 38.
[090] As shown in Figs. 2-8 in order to drive the foot pedals through any selected
arc segment, the user must exert a force F on foot pedals 24a, 24b that has a
horizontal (or forward-rearward) component FH, FH1, FH2 and a vertical (or upward
downward) component FV, FV1, FV2.         The degree of incline of the arc segment that
the foot supports must travel through is determined by and will vary with the precise
degree of the forward to rearward pivot position of bracket or arm 38 As shown in
FIGs 3-8 the mounting bracket or arm 38 pivots around the axis AA of bottom
bearings 46a and 46b so as to be rotatable forwardly and rearwardly FB.
[091] FIG. 4 is a side view of an exercise apparatus 10. In this view, the foot
supports 24a and 24b, forward linkages or legs 26a, 26b and rear linkages or legs
26c, 26d are presented from a perspective that allows ready visualization of the path
that foot supports 24a and 24b, and thus a user's feet, will traverse as the foot
supports move fore and aft while suspended from the forward and rear linkages. It
will be noted that as foot supports 24a and 24b move fore and aft, the forward and
aft limit of motion is not unbounded. Rather, the range of motion is defined by the
                                           28

length of the crank arms 40a and 40b (shown in FIG. 4), which provide an
appropriate stride length. Further, because the foot supports 24a and 24b are
pivotally connected to, and swing with, the forward linkages 26a, 26b and rear
linkages 26c, 26d, the foot supports travel a curved or arcuate path, and not an
elliptical path, to provide more favorable biomechanics.
[092] The motion path for the foot supports 24a and 24b can be selectively adjusted
by adjusting the pivot position of mounting bracket or arm 38. As described above,
the mounting 38 is pivotally mounted to the frame member 48 and pivots fore and aft
upon selective manual actuation of a mechanical adjustment mechanism. As is
evident by reference to the Figures, pivoting the mounting 38 forward moves the
components such as wheel 200 secured directly or indirectly thereto forwardly.
Likewise, pivoting the mounting 38 rearward causes the components secured
directly or indirectly thereto to move rearward. This selective positioning FB of
bracket or arm 38 causes the arcuate segment or motion path of the foot supports
24a and 24b to move to a different location along an arcuate path around a point of
rotation "p", shown between pivot assemblies 31b and 31c, at a distance established
by the length of the forward and rear linkages or legs 26a, 26b, 26c and 26d. Thus,
the specific location on the master arc or arc segment ("the motion path") is user
selectable to increase or decrease stride angle and location from a number of user
selectable points, or arc segments, defined around the point of rotation.
[093] In operation, a user approaches the device from the rear region 14, grasps
the hand grips 22a and 22b, and places a foot on each of the foot supports 24a and
24b. The user's feet and legs begin to move fore and aft in a comfortable stride. The
user selects an exercise program or manually adjusts the device by imputing
commands via the display/control panel 20. Also, in response to command input, the
mounting 38 is moved fore or aft. As shown, when the mounting 38 moves forward,
the motion path of the foot supports is on a more inclined or vertical defined arc
segment. To discontinue use of the device, a user simply stops striding, thereby
causing the movement of the device to stop, and dismounts from the foot supports.
[094] Fig. 4 illustrates one of the four bar linkage support mechanisms in a
forwardmost, 26a', 26d' and a rearward 26a, 26d position along the pivot stroke of
the four bar linkage. The four bar linkage has opposing pivot widths (or opposing
pivot link, 18c/24b, 18d/24a widths), W' and W", and opposing pivot lengths (or
opposing pivot link, 26a/26d, 26b/26c lengths), L' and L" that form the functional four
                                            29

bar linkage for purposes of pivotably mounting/supporting the foot pedal 24a from an
upper portion 18d (or foot pedal 24b from upper portion 18c) of the overhead support
arm or leg, 16b, 16c, of the frame. The foot pedals 24a, 24b themselves comprise a
structural portion or the whole of the lower pivot link of the four bar linkages in the
embodiments shown in Figs. 1-10. The distances between the width pivot points
31a and 31d, W' and between the width pivot points 31e and 31f, W" are preferably
equal or substantially equal. And, the distances between the length pivot points 31d
and 31e, L' and between the length pivot points 31a and 31f, L" are also preferably
equal or substantially equal such that the difference between angles Al and A2, i.e.
the degree of rotation or pivot of the foot pedal 24a from back to front and front to
back along the arcuate path of translation of the foot pedal from front to back and
vice versa is less than about 3 degrees, typically less than about 2.5 degrees. The
foot pedals have a foot sole receiving upper surface that defines a generally planar
orientation or plane in which the sole of the foot of the user is maintained when
standing on a foot pedal. Angle Al is the angle between the foot sole orientation
plane PP1 in which the foot sole surface resides at the backwardmost end of the
front to back path of translation and a fixed selected reference plane RP. Angle A2
is the angle between the sole orientation plane PP2 in which the foot sole surface
resides at the forwardmost end of the front to back path of translation and the fixed
selected reference plane RP. In this preferred embodiment, the difference between
angles Al and A2, at any point/position along the back to front/front to back path of
translation of the food pedal 26a is preferably less than about 3 degrees (typically
less than about 2.5 degrees), i.e. the plane in which the foot sole surface of the
pedal 24a resides does not rotate or pivot more than about 3 degrees at any time
during movement through the arcuate path of translation.
[095] As can be readily seen from Figs. 1-10, the foot pedals always travel in the
same overall or master arcuate or other configuration of path of travel from front to
rear and from rear to front. The master arcuate path of travel J, Fig. 5, that the
pedals 24 a, b may travel in remains the same regardless of what degree of pivot the
bracket or arm 38 is positioned in.   Pivoting the support bracket or arm 38 to
different pivot positions only changes the arc "segment" (e.g. segment AP, Fig. 5, or
segment AP', Fig. 6, or segment AP", Fig. 8) through which the pedals may travel
from rearwardmost to forwardmost positions but does not change the overall or
master path of arcuate travel J. The master arcuate path of travel J is defined by
                                            30

the machine or apparatus itself, i.e. by the mounting, positioning, lengths and widths
of the links 18c, d, 24a, b and 26a-d. The user may select a segment of the overall
machine defined arcuate path of foot pedal travel J depending on the degree of
pivoting of bracket or arm 38 that the user selects for any given exercise session. As
described below each segment selected will have a different degree of incline, e.g.
H1 for segment AP and H2 for segment AP'.
[096] In an alternative embodiment as shown in Figs. 5-8 mounting bracket or arm
38 can be manually pivoted FB via extension or contraction of a mechanical arm 230
that acts as a tilt actuator to pivot the mounting bracket or arm 38 forwardly or
backwardly as desired by the user. As can be readily imagined, arm 230 is manually
actuatable by the user such as by the user's exerting a selectable degree of manual
force by manually actuating a mechanical pumping or screwing mechanism 230a
that mechanically causes the arm 230 to extend or contract to a desired degree that
varies with the degree of mechanical force or energy exerted by the user and in turn
mechanically pivots FB the bracket or arm 38 to a desired degree. As shown, the
resistance mechanism 200 pivots forwardly and backwardly FB about the pivot axis
A of bracket or arm 38 which is orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the frame 10.
Both of the pedals 24a and 24b are synchronized together by the motion of
crankshaft 32.
[097] Figs. 5 and 6 more clearly illustrate the previously described selectability of an
arc segment when the mounting member 38 and its associated wheel 200 or other
resistance device is/are pivoted or tilted from one orientation to another. As shown
in Fig. 5, the pivotable mounting bracket or arm 38 is positioned with its longitudinal
axis X arranged in about a vertical orientation.   In this orientation, the maximum
difference in height or incline H1 between the rearwardmost position 24b' of the foot
pedal 24b and forwardmost position 24b" of the foot pedal 24b is less than the
maximum difference in height or incline H2 of Fig. 8 where the axis of the mounting
member 38 and its associated components 30 have been tilted or pivoted forwardly
by an angle A from the position of Fig. 5. As shown, the arcuate path AP of the
pedals 24b in Fig. 5, going from position 24b' to 24b", is less steep or upwardly
inclined than the arcuate path AP' of the pedals going from position 24b"' to 24b"" in
Fig. 6. Thus, as shown, the user can select the degree of arc of travel of the pedals
by selecting the position of tilt of assembly 30 to which the linkage bars 28b are
attached.
                                             31

[098] As also shown in Figs. 5 and 6 the pedals travel along the same selected
arcuate segment path AP or AP' from front to rear and from rear to front one the
pivot position of bracket or arm 38 is selected.
[099] Figs. 7 and 8 show an embodiment where a pair of pivoting upper body input
arms 100a, 100b are provided that the user can manually grasp by hand at an upper
region such as handles 106a, 106b, the handles 106a, b being a rigidly connected
extension of arms 100a, 100b respectively and moving/pivoting together with the
arms forward or backward. The handles 106a, 106b and arms 100a, 100b are
pivotably interconnected to both the frame and to the pedals. As shown the handles
106a, 106b and arms 100a, 100b are pivotably interconnected to the frame via a
cross bar member 500, the bottom ends of the arms being freely pivotably mounted
via pin/aperture joints 104a, 104b at their bottom ends, the joints being attached to
bar support member 500 at appropriate distances from each other along the length
of bar support 500. Arm linkage members 102a, 102b, are pivotably attached at
one end to the arms at joints 108a, 108b which allow the linkage members to
rotate/pivot on and with respect to the arms. Linkage members 102a, 102b are also
pivotably attached at another end to some component of the arcuate path traveling
assembly of foot pedal, and four bar linkage supports 26. As shown in Figs. 9, 10
an end of the linkages 102a, 102b distal from the arm connection point are pivotably
attached to the forward longitudinal four bar linkage members 26d, 26a respectively
via joints 11 0a, 11 Ob that allow the linkage members to rotate around the axes of the
joints, the joints interconnecting the linkage members 102a, b and the longitudinal
four bar linkage members 26d, a.
[0100]As shown in Figs. 7, 8 as the foot pedal assemblies 24, 26 travel along the
arcuate path AP" from either front to back or from back to front, the handles 106 and
arms 100 follow the front to back movement of the pedals with a pivoting front to
back or back to front movement. That is, when the right pedal 24a moves forwardly
the right handle 106a and arm 100a pivot or move forwardly; when the right pedal
24a moves backwardly the right handle 106a and arm 100a pivot or move
rearwardly; when the left pedal 24b moves forwardly the handle 106b and arm 100b
pivot or move forwardly; when the left pedal 24b moves rearwardly the handle 106b
and arm 100b pivot or move rearwardly. Such following motion is shown for
example with reference to four bar linkage arm 26d in three sequential front to back
positions 26d1, d2 and d3 which correspond respectively to arm 100a positions,
                                             32

100a1, a2, a3. The degree of front to back pivoting of the arms 100a, b can be
predetermined at least by selective positioning of the pivot joints 108a, 108b, 110a,
11 Ob, selective positioning of cross bar 500 and selection of the lengths of linkage
arms 102a, 102b.
[0101] In the Figs. 7, 8 embodiments, the user can reduce or transfer the amount of
energy or power required by the user's legs and/or feet to cause the foot pedals to
travel along the arcuate path AP" from back to front by pushing forwardly on the
upper end of the arms 102a, 102b during the back to front pedal movement. And,
the user can increase the speed of forward movement by such pushing; or reduce
the speed and increase the power or energy required by the legs to effect forward
movement by pulling. Conversely the user can reduce or transfer the amount of
power or energy required to cause the pedals to move from front to back by pulling
backwardly on the upper end of the arms. And, the user can increase the speed of
rearward movement by such pulling or reduce the speed by pushing; or reduce the
speed and increase the power or energy required by the legs to effect rearward
movement by pushing.
[0102] The four bar linkage foot assemblies, 24a, 26a, d, 18d and 24b, 26c, b, 18c
that are pivotably linked via the linkages 102a, 102b to the pivotably mounted arms
100a, 100b can be configured to enable the foot pedal and the plane in which the
sole of the foot is mounted to either not rotate or to rotate/pivot to any desired degree
during front to back movement by selecting the lengths L' and L" and widths W' and
W", Fig. 4 appropriately to cause the desired degree of rotation/pivoting. These four
bar linkage assemblies also, via the above described linkages to the arms 100a, b,
cause the arms to travel along the same path of pivot from front to back and back to
front.
[0103]    In the embodiment shown in Figs. 4-8, the linkages 28a, 28a', 28a", 28a"'
and 28b, 28b', 28b", 28b"' are interconnected to the wheel 200 via the four bar
linkage and the linkages 28a, 28b at opposing 180 degree circle positions 40c and
40d from the center of rotation of the crank arms 40a, b and/or shaft 32, i.e. the
linkages are connected at maximum forward and maximum rearward drive positions
respectively. This 180 degree opposing interconnection causes the right 24b, 24b',
24b", 24b"' and left 24a, 24a', 24a" and 34a"' foot pedals to always travel in
opposite back and forth translational directions, i.e. when the right pedal is traveling
forward the left pedal is traveling backwards and vice versa. Similarly, the pivotably
                                            33

mounted arms 100a and 100b are interconnected to the bracket or arm 38 and
wheel 200 via the four bar linkage, the links 28a, 28b and the links 102a, 102b such
that when the right arm is moving forward the left arm is moving backward and vice
versa. As shown in Figs. 7, 8 the arms 100a, 100b travel forwardly or backwardly
together with their associated foot pedals 28a and 28b respectively.
[0104] In any event, the left and right side pedals 24a, b and input arms 100a, b are
linked to the resistance 200 or drive assembly 28a, 28b, 40a, 40b, 32 such that when
the left side components (i.e. left pedal and associated input arm) are traveling
forward the right side components (i.e. right pedal associated input arm) are traveling
backward for at least the majority of the travel path and vice versa.
[0105] The upper body input arms 100a, b are interconnected or interlinked to the
same pivotable mounting member 38 as described above via the links 102a, b, four
bar linkage members 26a, b and links 28a, b as shown in Figs. 7, 8. In the same
manner as forward or backward pivoting of the mounting member 38 changes the
degree of incline and/or path of travel of foot pedals 24a, b as described above with
reference to Figs. 5, 6, a forward or backward pivoting of the mounting member 38
also changes the degree of back to front pivoting and/or the degree of path of travel
of arms 100a, b. Thus, in the same manner as the user is able to select the degree
of incline of the path of travel of the foot pedals, e.g. arc path segment AP versus arc
path segment AP' as shown in Figs. 5, 6 and also described above with regard to
mount member 38 enabling the user to select the degree of arc segment stride
length and angle/incline, the user is able to select the degree of back to front/front to
back pivot stroke or travel path of input arms, 100a, b, by adjusting the front to back
pivot position FB of the center of rotation of rotation connection/interconnection
points 40c and 40d.
[0106] The input arms 100a, b are linked to the foot pedals 24a, b in a manner that
causes an input arm (e.g. 100a) to move forwardly as its associated foot pedal (24a)
moves forwardly and upwardly, or conversely that causes an input arm to move
backwardly as its associated foot pedal moves backwardly and downwardly along
the user selected arc segment.
[0107] Figs. 9-10 illustrate an alternative manually actuatable mechanism for
mechanically adjusting FB the position of bracket or arm 38 and thus the selection of
a particular arc segment. In the Figs. 9-10 embodiment, the manually adjustable
element comprises a U-shaped handle assembly 300 that is attached to pivoting
                                              34

bracket or arm 38. The handle assembly includes a locking arm 307 that is spring
load biased in a downward DN direction such that the distal end tooth 308 is biased
into being received within a selected one of forward to back FB fixed position slots
306a, 306b, 306c, etc that are provided within fixedly mounted arm 306.      Pivotable
movement of the handle assembly 300 in the FB direction pivots the bracket or arm
38 and any associated resistance mechanism such as fan 200 in unison around
pivot point AA thus changing the arc segment depending on the degree of movement
of the handle assembly 300 in the FB direction. As shown the handle assembly 300
can be pivoted around axis AA between a plurality of preselected fixed back and
forth positions, 306a, 306b, 306c, etc depending on the number and precise location
of slots 306a, 306b, 306c, etc that are provided within the upper surface of
positioning bar 306 that is fixedly attached or interconnected to the frame 16a-16d,
18a-18d. Back forth positioning of the handle assembly 300 and its fixedly
interconnected bracket or arm 38 between preselected fixed positions can be
achieved by the user's manually grabbing the upper handle element 304 and
simultaneously squeezing upwardly UP, Fig. 10 on the underside surface 302a of
spring loaded trigger 302 to cause the trigger 302 and its interconnected arm 307
that is slidably mounted within an arm housing 300h to move upwardly UP, Fig. 10
toward the handle 304 such that the distal end of the arm 307 which comprises a
tooth 308 complementary in shape to the slots 306a, 306b, 306c, etc becomes
disengaged and is withdrawn out of whichever slot 306a, 306b, 306c, etc that the
tooth is locked into by the downward DN spring load that is exerted on trigger 302
and arm 307 by the spring mechanism (not shown). As in the Figs. 2-3, 5-8
embodiments, in such a Fig. 9-10 embodiment therefore, depending on the degree
or amount of manual force exerted by the user in the FB' direction on handle
assembly 300, an arc segment AP, AP' having a selected and different degree of
incline and requiring a selected and different degree of force F to move horizontally
FH1, FH2 and vertically FV1, FV2 can be manually selected by the user by the
exertion of a selected amount of manual force on the arc segment selection device
300.
[0108]     Figs. 11-12 illustrate another alternative manually actuatable mechanism for
mechanically adjusting the position FB of bracket or arm 38 and thus the selection of
a particular arc segment. In the Figs. 11-12 embodiment, the manually adjustable
element comprises an elongated cylindrical handle assembly 400 comprising a tube
                                              35

or tubular handle 404 pivotably mounted to the frame 16a-1 6b, 18a-1 8b, for back
and forth FB' movement, a rod or trigger 406 slidably mounted within the handle 404
rod that is spring load biased in an upward UP direction by a spring (not shown), a
bracket 402 with upwardly extending slots 402a, 402b, 402c and a lever assembly
404 that is pivotably interconnected between the handle 404 and the resistance
mounting bracket or arm 38. Back forth FB' positioning of the handle 400 and FB its
pivotally interconnected bracket or arm 38 between preselected back and forth fixed
positions that correspond to slots 402a, 402b, 402c can be achieved by the user's
manually grabbing the handle 404 and simultaneously pushing downwardly DN, Fig.
12 on the top surface 406a of spring loaded trigger 406 to cause the trigger 406
slidably mounted within handle 404 to move downwardly DN such that a pin 406b
that projects laterally from the sliding rod or trigger 406 is disengaged from within
whichever of slots 402a, 402b, 402c that the pin 406b is received within. Once the
trigger 406 is manually actuated downwardly DN a distance sufficient to release pin
406a from a slot 402a, 402b, 402c, the user can manually exert a selected amount of
back and forth FB' directed force that in turn pivots the mounting bracket or arm 38
and its associated resistance assembly to a selected back and forth FB position.
Once a desired back and forth FB' position is reached, the user releases downward
force on the trigger surface 406a, the trigger 406 is urged upward UP and the locking
pin 406b is allowed to be received into a selected one of the slots 402a, 402b, 402c
thus locking the handle assembly 400 and mounting arm into a selected forward to
back FB position. As in the Figs. 2-3, 5-8 embodiments, in such a Fig. 11-12
embodiment, therefore, depending on the degree or amount of manual force exerted
by the user in the FB' direction on handle assembly 400, an arc segment AP, AP'
having a selected and different degree of incline and requiring a selected and
different degree of force F to move horizontally FH1, FH2 and vertically FV1, FV2
can be manually selected by the user by the exertion of a selected amount of manual
force on the arc segment selection device 400.
[0109]    Although the wheel 200 with fan blades 210 is the preferred resistance
assembly, other resistance devices that create resistance that varies non-linearly
with the degree of speed, velocity, force F, work or energy exerted by the user on the
foot supports or resistance assembly are known to those skilled in the art and can be
interconnected to the foot pedals 24a, 24b.

[0110]     FIG. 14 is a detailed view of the interface console region 20 of the present
invention, consisting of an LCD type visual display 21a and user operated panel of
manually actuatable or engageable push-buttons 21 b. By its nature, the LCD type
visual display is capable of executing multiple different interfaces or information
carrying images, described in detail below. The panel of push-buttons remains fixed,
with each button achieving a specified function.
[0111]     Button 128, labeled "CIRCUIT I INTERVAL" permits the user to quickly and
easily select the desired mode of operation - accordingly, he or she simply
depresses the top portion 128a to enter Circuit Training Mode, and depresses the
lower portion 128b to enter Interval Training Mode. Up and down arrow keys, 130a
and 130b respectively, allow the user to toggle between consecutive numerical
values when setting inputs such as desired time or desired number of intervals.
Button 124, labeled "GO ENTER", functions as a confirmation tool, allowing the user
to begin the workout routine as well as approve input values or any other user
system dialogues and interactions. Button 126, labeled "STOP REVIEW", serves the
opposite purpose, allowing the user to terminate the workout routine and/or enter
review mode.
[0112]     As shown in FIG. 14, a user interface 20 is comprised of an LCD visual
display 21a that displays the default interface for a Circuit Training Mode,
characterized by a menu label 122d reading "CIRCUIT TRAINING", such that the
user may easily ascertain the selected mode of operation at any given moment in
time. All output values read "0", as the user has not yet begun the workout routine.
In this interface, the primary visual display area 120 displays the user's
instantaneous output power, measured in units of Watts. The secondary visual
display area 122 displays more detailed information in the form of meters traveled
(122a), SPM or Strides Per Minute (122b), and time elapsed (122c).
[0113]     After mounting the exercise device, the user simply presses the "Go" button
124 and begins the workout routine. Time counter 122c begins tracking elapsed
time, updating every second. The SPM display 122b measures the rate at which the
user actuates the movable foot supports back and forth, with periodic updates on the
order of one second. The meters traveled visual display 122a tracks cumulative
distance over the course of the entire workout routine, updating only when a new
integer value of distance is achieved. Of course, this figure refers not to a literal
                                             37

distance traveled by the user's body, but rather, the cumulative distance of the
path(s) executed by the user's feet.
[0114] The user is not required to press the "Go" button 124 to begin a workout
routine providing an additional degree of flexibility and ease of use to the hurried or
novice user. By simply actuating the movable foot supports into their back and forth
motion, the interface console is activated, the only difference being that a more
limited set of information is subsequently presented to the user. Primary display area
120 will provide a reading of instantaneous power output in Watts exactly as
described above, and SPM 122b will likewise function in an unchanged manner,
because these instantaneous values are not time dependent in their measurement.
However, display areas 122a and 122c, meters and elapsed time, respectively, will
have no output. They are accumulated, time-dependent values, and as such, cannot
be accurately displayed in the absence of a discrete, user-defined starting point.
[0115] FIG. 15 illustrates an example in which a user has begun a workout routine.
The display interface itself is identical to that of FIG. 1, the only change being in the
values presented. Accordingly, display area 122c indicates that the workout routine
has been performed for 5 seconds, in which time the user has traveled a distance of
26 meters. Note that the presence of values in display areas 122a and 122c
indicates that the "Go" button 124 was used to initiate this workout routine. Display
areas 120 and 122b display the user's instantaneous output in terms of Power and
SPM, respectively. As this workout is ongoing, input commands from buttons in
panel 21b would have no effect, with the one exception being "Stop" button 126,
which is employed to terminate the workout routine and all timing mechanisms.
[0116] After completing the workout routine and pressing "Stop" button 126, the
interface of display 21a is replaced with a review interface, seen in FIG. 16. Label
131 in the top left corner indicates at all times to the user that the mode of operation
is and was set to Circuit Training Mode, and furthermore, that the interface console
is in the review interface. This review interface is only accessible after those
workouts which were initiated by pressing the "Go" button 124. For those cases in
which the button was not pressed, the display will return to the default interface
depicted in FIG. 1 after the user ceases operation of the exercise device.
[0117]    The review interface is designed to be simple and easy to understand,
introducing no new measurements or other factors. It presents the user with just four
values, tabulated into either averaged or accumulated form. Display areas 132a and
                                              38

132b, average SPM and average Power, respectively, are averages that are
measured over the complete duration of the workout routine, and provide a
convenient form for the user to characterize his or her overall physical performance
or output. Display areas 132c and 132d are the accumulated values for meters
traveled and time elapsed, respectively.
[0118]    FIGS. 17-21 illustrate the interfaces and operation of an Interval (as
opposed to Circuit) Training Mode. FIG. 17 depicts the first of three input interfaces,
which are presented to the user prior to the beginning of the workout routine. Menu
label 122d has changed to read "INTERVAL TRAINING", such that the user may
easily ascertain the selected mode of operation at any given moment in time.
Command prompt 134 reads "SET WORK TIME", informing the user that he or she
is choosing the amount of exercise time that each interval should consist of. Primary
display area 120 provides a display of the currently selected amount of work time, in
seconds. Arrow keys 130a and 130b are used to increment or decrement the work
time as desired. Once the work time is suitably adjusted, the user presses "Enter"
button 124 and is taken to the second input interface screen, seen in FIG. 5.
[0119]    Two changes distinguish FIGS. 17 and 18. FIG. 18 uses an inverted color
scheme as compared to FIG. 17, and the command prompt 134 has updated to
"SET REST TIME", in order to inform the user that he or she is choosing the amount
of resting, non-exercise time that each interval should consist of. By utilizing an
inverted color scheme, it becomes far easier for the user to distinguish between the
two discrete input steps, as he or she would be more likely to fail to recognize the
change if only command prompt 134 updated between the two input steps. The
amount of time that the rest period shall consist of is set in a manner identical to the
one described above. The amount of work time and rest time need not be equal.
Once the rest time is suitably adjusted, the user presses "Enter" button 124 and is
taken to the final input interface screen, seen in FIG. 19.
[0120]    As between FIGS. 18 and 19, the color scheme inverts once again,
continuing the process of aiding the user in recognizing requests for new information
or inputs. Command prompt 134 has updated to "SET TOTAL INTERVALS",
informing the user that he or she is choosing the number of intervals that the workout
routine shall consist of. Note that one interval consists of a single work period
followed immediately by a single rest period. As in the previous two input interfaces,
primary display area 120 displays the adjustable, currently selected input value. As
                                             39

before, this value is incremented or decremented by arrow keys 130a and 130b. A
smaller display area, 120b, is introduced in this interface, and provides the user with
a convenient readout of how long the total workout routine will last, based on the
prior inputs of work time and rest time and the current input of total intervals. This
readout is re-calculated and adjusted concurrent with any adjustments that the user
may make to the total number of intervals. After pressing "Go" button 124, the user
now begins the interval workout routine.
[0121]    FIG. 20 illustrates the interface presented while the interval training workout
is ongoing. Note the similarity between said interface and the circuit training interface
of FIG. 1 and 2. While these two interface screens would never be seen one after
another, the difference between the two screens is nevertheless emphasized by the
use of contrasting color schemes. The bottom three display areas 122a-c are highly
similar between the two different interface modes. 122a and 122c are identical to as
described above, and 122b is identical to the Power measurement display described
above, but relocated to a different zone of the display.
[0122]     In Interval Training Mode, display label 122d has changed to read
"INTERVAL       SETS 5", such that the user may easily ascertain that he or she is
currently in Interval Training Mode, and such that the user may furthermore keep
track of the number of intervals, or sets, remaining. While the number five is seen in
FIG. 20, note that this is solely for purposes of example, as in reality, the number
seen on the display updates in real-time to indicate the number of intervals
remaining in the workout routine. D
[0123] Immediately after the workout routine is initiated by the user, the first interval
begins, starting with the work/exercise portion. The user's current state, or position in
the cycle of the interval, is indicated in the top left corner of primary display area 120,
by a label reading either "WORK" or "REST". In both the work and rest steps, a large
counter fills primary display area 120, beginning at the predetermined amount of time
selected by the user via the process described above. The counter then decrements
second by second, until it expires at zero.
[0124] When the counter expires at zero, the next step of work or rest commences,
and this cycle of intervals continues until the user presses "Stop" button 126 or the
input number of total intervals is completed in full. Once the workout routine is either
terminated or expires on its own, the user is presented with the review interface of
FIG. 21. Label 131 in the top left corner indicates at all times to the user that the
                                              40

mode of operation is and was set to Interval Training Mode, and furthermore, that the
interface console is in the review interface. The review interface is designed to be
simple and easy to understand, introducing no new measurements or other factors. It
presents the user with just four values, all tabulated into accumulated form. Display
area 132a presents the user with the total number of full sets performed over the
duration of the workout routine, and 132b similarly presents the user with the total
distance, in meters, executed by his or her foot path(s). Display area 132c is shown
depicting the average power output of the user, in watts, while display area 132d
presents the total amount of elapsed time spent performing the interval training
routine.
[0125]Where the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or "comprising" are
used in this specification (including the claims) they are to be interpreted as
specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components, but
not precluding the presence of one or more other features, integers, steps or
components, or group thereof.
