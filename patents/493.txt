                                         TECHNICAL FIELD
The disclosure is directed to predictive methods, personalized therapies, transmittable forms of
information and methods for treating patients having asthma.
                              BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
Asthma presents a major global health burden. Despite existing therapies, there is still significant
unmet medical need in asthma, with an estimated 300 million people affected worldwide. The
World Health Organization estimates that 15 million disability-adjusted life years are lost annually
due to asthma, representing 1% of the total global burden. Annual worldwide deaths have been
estimated at 250,000. Uncontrolled asthma has a prevalence of greater than 6 million patients
worldwide.
Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is a cytokine produced by type 2 helper T cells (Th2), mast cells,
eosinophils, and basophils (Kelly-Welch A, (2005), Sci STKE; 293:pcm 8) that promotes the
production of inflammatory cytokines, up-regulates MHC class II and CD23 expression on
monocytes, induces anti-CD40-dependent IgE class switch, and induces IgG and IgM synthesis
in B cells (Joshi BH, (2006), Vitam Horm; 74:479-504). IL-13 has been shown to play a major
role in the several biological processes, including airway hyper-responsiveness, allergic
inflammation, tissue eosinophilia, parasite elimination, mast cell hyperplasia, IgE antibody
synthesis, goblet cell metaplasia, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis (Belperio JA, (2002) Am J
Respir Cell Mol Biol; 27(4): 419-427; Brombacher F (2000) Bioessays; 22: 646-656; Wynn TA,
(2004), Immunol Rev; 201:156-67; Kolodsick JE, (2004), J Immunol;172: 4068-4076). In

particular, IL-13 has been shown to be a central mediator of allergic asthma in an animal model
(Wills-Karp M, (1998), Science; 282: 2258-2261). This observation has been complemented by
data showing that anti-IL-13 Ab inhibits asthma progression in mice (Yang G, (2005), J
Pharmacol Exp Ther; 3 13(1): 8-15). IL-13 engages two related receptors on responsive cells, IL
13Rul and IL-13Ru2 (Wills-Karp M, (2008), Sci Signal; 1(51) pe55).              IL-13Rul forms a
complex with the IL-4Ra receptor subunit, which signals through the JAK/STAT pathway to
phosphorylate STAT6, which acts as a transcription factor promoting the expression of eotaxin
and other products involved in Th2-dependent inflammation.          The second IL-13Ru2 receptor
also binds IL-13, but does not appear to produce signals involved in allergy.          Thus, the IL
l3Rul/IL-4Ra receptor complex provides a key common point in both IL-13 and IL-4 signaling
pathways. See also Ingram and Kraft (2012) J Allergy Clin Immunol 130(4): 829-842.
W005007699, W007036745, WO12049278, and W008106116 refer to anti-IL-13 antibodies
and/or IL- 13 antagonists for treatment of asthma.
There has been an ongoing search for biomarkers that define different asthma phenotypes
(Wenzel SE (2012), Nat Med; 18(5): 716-725). W012083132 refers to a method of identifying
an asthma patient or a respiratory disorder patient who is likely to be responsive to treatment
with a TH2 Pathway Inhibitor encompassing using an Eosinophilic Inflammation Diagnostic
Assay.
Slager RE, (2012), J Allergy Clin Immunol; 130(2): 516-22, refer to a series of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SN-Ps) in the IL-4Ra receptor associated with a reduced risk of asthma
exacerbations in patients treated with an IL-4 inhibitor. WO 11156000 refers to use of methods
and kits for determining the major allele in certain SNIPs in the IL-4Ra receptor as an indication
of likely response to IL-4/IL13 (IL-4 and IL-13) antagonist treatment, such as treatment with
mutant human 11-4 protein.
                         BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
There exists a need for identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) as being
predictive of whether a patient having asthma will respond to a treatment with an IL-13
                                                 -2-

antagonist, as a pharmacogenomic biomarker approach to diagnosis and treatment of asthma.
Provided herein are predictive methods and personalized therapies for patients having asthma
that maximize the benefit and minimize the risk of IL-13 antagonism in these populations by
identifying the patients likely to respond favorably, prior to treatment with an IL-13 antagonist.
The inventive methods described herein are related to the discovery that patients with particular
responsive genotypes had substantial reductions in the frequency of asthma exacerbations upon
treatment antibody 01951/G12 (SEQ ID No. 14 and 16), a human IgGl/K anti-Il-13 monoclonal
antibody further described in W02007/045477.         The responsive genotypes in the patients are
specific responsive alleles in SNPs of the IL-4Ru receptor gene and are provided in Table 1.

Table 1 sets forth the SNP nucleotide sequences for the IL-4Ra receptor as designated by the
corresponding rs number.       The SNP sequences are also provided in the dbSNP database as
referenced in further detail below. The alternative alleles are shown in brackets. The inventive
responsive allele is shown in Table 1 in bold type, and respectively designated as anti-Il-13
response marker ("AIR marker" hereinafter).       Accordingly, the designation AIR marker is in
reference to the responsive allele only and excludes the non-responsive allele. In this regard, it is
further recognized that a patient can be homozygous or heterozygous with respect to a particular
                                                -3 -

AIR marker. Thus, for example, a patient that is determined to be homozygous for AIR marker
3, has an AA genotype for the rs1805010 SNP, whereas the patient that is heterozygous for AIR
marker 3 has an AG genotype for this SNP. In the inventive methods of the invention, a patient
is positive for a particular AIR marker, and therefore for the responsive allele, where the patient
is homozygous or heterozygous for the responsive allele.            A patient that is negative for a
particular AIR marker is homozygous for the non-responsive allele. For example, a patient that
is negative for AIR marker 3 has a GG for the rs1805010 SNP.
The invention provides a method of selectively treating a patient having asthma, comprising
identifying a patient having at least one AIR marker selected from the group consisting of AIR

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE
        It is envisioned that testing subjects for the presence of at least one of the aforementioned
response alleles (AIR markers) will be useful in a variety of pharmaceutical products and
methods that involve identifying asthma patients, including severe to moderate asthma patients
who are more likely to respond to IL-13 antagonsim and in helping physicians decide whether to
prescribe IL-13 antagonists (e.g. antibody 01951/G12) to those patients or whether to prescribe
an alternative pharmaceutical agent.

        Accordingly, in one aspect the invention provides methods of treating a patient having
asthma by administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of an IL-13 antagonist,
e.g., an IL-13 antibody, such as antibody 01951/G12, based on certain aspects of the patient's
genotypic profile. In a related aspect, the invention further provides methods of identifying a
patient having asthma who is more likely to respond to treatment of with an IL-13 antagonist,
e.g., an IL-13 antibody, such as antibody 01951/G12, based on certain aspects of the patient's
genotypic profile. In a further related aspect, the invention provides methods of determining the
likelihood that a patient having asthma will respond to treatment with an IL-13 antagonist, e.g.,
an IL-13 antibody, such as antibody 01951/G12, based on certain aspects of the patient's
genotypic profile.      In another related aspect, the invention provides various methods of
selectively treating a patient having asthma.
        The inventive methods described herein encompass utilizing at least one AIR marker
selected from a group consisting of nine specified AIR markers set forth herein. The term "at
least one AIR marker" contemplates that one, two, three, four, 5, six, seven, eight, or nine AiR
markers can be combined and utilized in the methods of the invention. Furthermore, each AIR
marker member of such combinations can be in heterozygous or homozygous form. Particular
embodiments of the invention set forth specific combinations of nine AIR markers (AIR
markers- 1 to 9) and further specify desired zygosities with respect to a particular AIR marker.
        The term "comprising" encompasses "including"             as well as "consisting,"     e.g. a
composition "comprising" X may consist exclusively of X or may include something additional,
e.g., X + Y.
        The term "about" in relation to a numerical value x means +/-10% unless the cotext
dictates otherwise.
        The term "assaying" is used to refer to the act of identifying, screening, probing, testing
measuring or determining, which act may be performed by any conventional means. For
example, a sample may be assayed for the presence of a particular genetic or protein marker by
using an ELISA assay, a Northern blot, imaging, serotyping, cellular typing, gene sequencing,
phenotyping, haplotyping, immunohistochemistry, western blot, mass spectrometry, etc. The
term "detecting" (and the like) means the act of extracting particular information from a given
                                                - 10 -

    WO 2015/155710                                                               PCT/IB2015/052551
source, which may be direct or indirect. In some embodiments of the predictive methods
disclosed herein, the presence of a given thing (e.g., allele, level of protein, etc.) is detected in a
biological sample indirectly, e.g., by querying a database. The terms "assaying" and
"determining" contemplate a transformation of matter, e.g., a transformation of a biological
sample, e.g., a blood sample or other tissue sample, from one state to another by means of
subjecting that sample to physical testing.
       The term "obtaining" means to procure, e.g., to acquire possession of in any way, e.g., by
physical intervention (e.g., biopsy, blood draw) or non-physical intervention (e.g, transmittal of
information via a server), etc.
         The phrase "assaying a biological sample ..." and the like, is used to mean that a sample
may be tested (either directly or indirectly) for either the presence of a given AIR marker. It will
be understood that, in a situation where the presence of a substance denotes one probability and
the absence of a substance denotes a different probabiltity, then either the presence or the
absence of such substance may be used to guide a therapeutic decision. For example, one may
determine if a patient has AIR marker by determining the actual existence of particular response
allele in the patient or by determining the absence of the particular response allele in the patient.
In both such cases, one has determined whether the patient has the presence of the AIR marker.
The disclosed methods involve, inter alia, determining whether a particular individual has an
AIR marker. This determination is undertaken by identifying whether the patient has one or
more of the AIR markers disclosed in Table 1 set forth above. Each of these determinations (i.e.,
presence or absence), on its own, provides the allelic status of the patient and thus each of these
deteriminations equally provide an indication of whether a particular individual would or would
not respond more favorably to IL-13 antagonism. To provide an indication of increased
responsiveness for an asthma patient, a biological sample need only be assayed for one or more
AIR marker set forth in Table 1.
       "IL-13 antagonist" as used herein refers to a molecule that antagonizes (e.g., reduces,
inhibits, decreases, delays, eliminates) IL-13 function, expression and/or signalling by blocking
the binding of IL- 13 to the IL- 13 receptor complex. In a particular embodiment of the invention,
the IL-13 antagonist prevents IL-13 binding to IL-13 Rul.           In another, the IL-13 antagonist
                                                 -11 -

    WO 2015/155710                                                              PCT/IB2015/052551
prevents binding to IL-13 Rul, but allows binding to IL1-13 Ru2 (also known as the decoy
receptor). See Ingram and Kraft (2012) J Allergy Clin Immunol 130(4): 829-842.
       The binding reaction may be shown by standard methods (qualitative or quantitative
assays) including, for example, a binding assay, competition assay or a bioassay for determining
the inhibition of IL-13 binding to its receptor or any kind of binding assays, with reference to a
negative control test in which an antibody of unrelated specificity, but ideally of the same
isotype, e.g., an anti-CD25 antibody, is used. Such methods incude those set forth below in the
EXAMPLES.
       The term "antibody" as referred to herein includes whole antibodies and any antigen
binding portion or single chains thereof        A naturally occurring "antibody" is a glycoprotein
comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide
bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as
VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three
domains, CHI, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region
(abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is
comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of
hypervariability, termed hypervariable regions or complementarity determining regions (CDR),
interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and
VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus
in the following order: FRI, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the
heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant
regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or
factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first
component (C Iq) of the classical complement system.
       The term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody as used herein, refers to fragments of an
antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., IL-13). It has been shown
that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length
antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term "antigen-binding
portion" of an antibody include a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH,
                                                  - 12 -

CL and CHI domains; a F(ab)2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments
linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHI
domains; a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; a
dAb fragment (Ward et al., 1989 Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and an
isolated CDR. Exemplary antigen binding sites include the CDRs set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 1-6
and 11-13 (Table 2), preferably the heavy chain CDR3. Furthermore, although the two domains
of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using
recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein
chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain
Fv (scFv); see, e.g., Bird et al., 1988 Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al., 1988 Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. 85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed
within the term "antibody". Single chain antibodies and antigen-binding portions are obtained
using conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art.
       An "isolated antibody", as used herein, refers to an antibody that is substantially free of
other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that
specifically binds IL-13is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other
than IL-13). The term "monoclonal antibody" or "monoclonal antibody composition" as used
herein refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. The term
"human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable regions in
which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from sequences of human origin. A
"human antibody" need not be produced by a human, human tissue or human cell. The human
antibodies of the disclosure may include amino acid residues not encoded by human sequences
(e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro, by N-nucleotide
addition at junctions in vivo during recombination of antibody genes, or by somatic mutation in
vivo). In some embodiments of the disclosed methods, the IL-13 antagonist is a human antibody,
an isolated antibody, and/or a monoclonal antibody.
       The term "KD" is intended to refer to the dissociation rate of a particular antibody-antigen
interaction. The term "KD", as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant, which
is obtained from the ratio of Kd to Ka (i.e. Kd/Ka) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M).
KD  values for antibodies can be determined using methods well established in the art. A method

for determining the KD of an antibody is by using surface plasmon resonance, or using a
biosensor system such as a Biacore@ system.
        The term "affinity" refers to the strength of interaction between antibody and antigen at
single antigenic sites. Within each antigenic site, the variable region of the antibody arm interacts
through weak non-covalent forces with antigen at numerous sites; the more interactions, the
stronger the affinity. Standard assays to evaluate the binding affinity of the antibodies toward
IL-13 of various species are known in the art, including for example, ELISAs, western blots and
RIAs. The binding kinetics (e.g., binding affinity) of the antibodies also can be assessed by
standard assays known in the art, such as by Biacore analysis.
        An antibody that "inhibits" one or more of these IL-13 functional properties (e.g.,
biochemical, immunochemical, cellular, physiological or other biological activities, or the like)
as determined according to methodologies known to the art and described herein, will be
understood to relate to a statistically significant decrease in the particular activity relative to that
seen in the absence of the antibody (or when a control antibody of irrelevant specificity is
present). An antibody that inhibits IL-13 activity affects a statistically significant decrease, e.g.,
by at least about 10% of the measured parameter, by at least 50%, 80% or 90%, and in certain
embodiments of the disclosed methods, the IL- 13 antibody used may inhibit greater than 95%,
98% or 99% of IL-13 functional activity.
       The term "derivative", unless otherwise indicated, is used to define amino acid sequence
variants, and covalent modifications (e.g., pegylation, deamidation, hydroxylation,
phosphorylation, methylation, etc.) of an IL-13 antagonist (e.g., IL-13 antibody or antigen
binding portion thereof), e.g., of a specified sequence (e.g., a variable domain). A "functional
derivative" includes a molecule having a qualitative biological activity in common with the
disclosed IL-13 antagonists. A functional derivative includes fragments and peptide analogs of
an IL- 13 antagonist as disclosed herein. Fragments comprise regions within the sequence of a
polypeptide according to the present disclosure, e.g., of a specified sequence. Functional
derivatives of the IL- 13 antagonists disclosed herein preferably comprise VH and/or VL domains
that have at least about 65%, 75%, 85%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or even 99% overall sequence

identity with the VH and/or VL sequences of the IL-13 binding molecules disclosed herein (e.g.,
the VH and/or VL sequences of Table 2), and substantially retain the ability to bind human IL- 13.
        The phrase "substantially identical" means that the relevant amino acid or nucleotide
sequence (e.g.,   VH or VL domain) will be identical to or have insubstantial differences (e.g.,
through conserved amino acid substitutions) in comparison to a particular reference sequence.
Insubstantial differences include minor amino acid changes, such as 1 or 2 substitutions (e.g.,
conservative substitutions, such as swapping a serine for a threonine, or substitutions at positions
not involved in antibody activity, structural integrity, complement fixation, etc.) in a 5 amino
acid sequence of a specified region (e.g.,   VH or VL domain). In the case of antibodies, the
second antibody has the same specificity and has at least 50% of the affinity of the same.
Sequences substantially identical (e.g., at least about 85% sequence identity) to the sequences
disclosed herein are also part of this disclosure. In some embodiments, the sequence identity of a
derivative anti-IL-13 antibody (can be about 9 0% or greater, e.g.,   9
                                                                        0%, 9

95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or higher relative to the disclosed sequences.
        "Identity" with respect to a native polypeptide and its functional derivative is defined
herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with
the residues of a corresponding native polypeptide, after aligning the sequences and introducing
gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent identity, and not considering any
conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Neither N- or C-terminal extensions
nor insertions shall be construed as reducing identity. Methods and computer programs for the
alignment are well known. The percent identity can be determined by standard alignment
algorithms, for example, the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) described by Altshul
et al. ((1990) J. Mol. Biol., 215: 403 410); the algorithm of Needleman et al. ((1970) J. Mol.
Biol., 48: 444 453); or the algorithm of Meyers et al. ((1988) Comput. Appl. Biosci., 4: 11 17).
A set of parameters may be the Blosum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend
penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. The percent identity between two amino acid or
nucleotide sequences can also be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller
((1989) CABIOS, 4:11-17) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0),
using a PAMI 20 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4.

       "Amino acid(s)" refer to all naturally occurring L-a-amino acids, e.g., and include D
amino acids. The phrase "amino acid sequence variant" refers to molecules with some
differences in their amino acid sequences as compared to the sequences according to the present
disclosure. Amino acid sequence variants of an IL-13 antagonist polypeptide according to the
present disclosure, e.g., of a specified sequence, still have the ability to bind the human IL-13 or.
Amino acid sequence variants include substitutional variants (those that have at least one amino
acid residue removed and a different amino acid inserted in its place at the same position in a
polypeptide according to the present disclosure), insertional variants (those with one or more
amino acids inserted immediately adjacent to an amino acid at a particular position in a
polypeptide according to the present disclosure) and deletional variants (those with one or more
amino acids removed in a polypeptide according to the present disclosure).
       The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means a nontoxic material that does not interfere
with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredient(s).
       The term "administering" in relation to a compound, e.g., an IL-13 binding molecule or
another agent, is used to refer to delivery of that compound to a patient by any route.
       As used herein, a "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount of an IL- 13
antagonist, (e.g., anti-IL-13 antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof) that is effective, upon
single or multiple dose administration to a patient (such as a human) for treating, preventing,
preventing the onset of, curing, delaying, reducing the severity of, ameliorating at least one
symptom of a disorder or recurring disorder, or prolonging the survival of the patient beyond that
expected in the absence of such treatment. When applied to an individual active ingredient (e.g.,
an IL-13 antagonist, administered alone, the term refers to that ingredient alone. When applied
to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the
therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously.
        The term "treatment" or "treat" refer to both prophylactic or preventative treatment (as
the case may be) as well as curative or disease modifying treatment, including treatment of a
patient at risk of contracting the disease or suspected to have contracted the disease as well as
patients who are ill or have been diagnosed as suffering from a disease or medical condition, and
includes suppression of clinical relapse or exacerbation. The treatment may be administered to a

patient having a medical disorder or who ultimately may acquire the disorder, in order to
prevent, cure, delay the onset of, reduce the severity of, or ameliorate one or more symptoms of a
disorder or recurring disorder, or in order to prolong the survival of a patient beyond that
expected in the absence of such treatment.
       The phrase "responds to treatment" is used to mean that a patient, upon being delivered a
particular treatment, e.g., an IL-13 antagonist, shows a clinically meaningful benefit from said
treatment. In the case of asthma, including severe to moderate asthma, such criteria include
reduction in exacerbations. The phrase "respond to treatment" is meant to be construed
comparatively, rather than as an absolute response. For example, an asthma patient having an
AIR marker is predicted to have more benefit from treatment with an IL- 13 antagonist than a
patient who does not have the AIR marker. These carriers of AIR markers respond more
favorably to treatment with the IL-13 antagonist, and "respond to treatment" with an IL-13
antagonist. In certain embodiments of the invention, the patient that responds to treatment with
an IL-13 antagonist according to the methods disclosed herin, has determinably reduced
exacerbation of asthma for at least 24 weeks, at least 24-52 weeks, at least 52 weeks, or longer.
In particular embodiments of the invention, the reduction in exacerbations is at least 50%, at
least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or 100% in the patient that responds to
treatment with an IL-13 antagonist according to the methods disclosed herein.
       The phrase "receiving data" is used to mean obtaining possession of information by any
available means, e.g., orally, electronically (e.g., by electronic mail, encoded on diskette or other
media), written, etc.
       As used herein, "selecting" and "selected" in reference to a patient is used to mean that a
particular patient is specifically chosen from a larger group of patients on the basis of (due to)
the particular patient having a predetermined criteria, e.g., the patient has an AIR marker.
Similarly, "selectively treating" refers to providing treatment to a patient having a particular
disease, where that patient is specifically chosen from a larger group of patients on the basis of
the particular patient having a predetermined criteria, e.g., an asthma patient specifically chosen
for treatment due to the patient having a AIR marker. Similarly, "selectively administering"
refers to administering a drug to a patient that is specifically chosen from a larger group of
                                                 - 17 -

patients on the basis of (due to) the particular patient having a predetermined criteria, e.g., a
particular genetic or other biological marker. By selecting, selectively treating and selectively
administering, it is meant that a patient is delivered a personalized therapy based on the patient's
particular biology, rather than being delivered a standard treatment regimen based solely on the
patient having a particular disease. Selecting, in reference to a method of treatment as used
herein, does not refer to fortuitous treatment of a patient that has an AIR marker, but rather
refers to the deliberate choice to administer an IL-13 antagonist to a patient based on the patient
having an AIR marker. Thus, selective treatment differs from standard treatment, which delivers
a particular drug to all patients, regardless of their allelic status.
       As used herein, "predicting" indicates that the methods described herein provide
information to enable a health care provider to determine the likelihood that an individual having
asthma will respond to or will respond more favorably to treatment with an IL-13 antagonist. It
does not refer to the ability to predict response with 100% accuracy. Instead, the skilled artisan
will understand that it refers to an increased probability.
       As used herein, "likelihood" and "likely" is a measurement of how probable an event is to
occur. It may be used interchangably with "probability". Likelihood refers to a probability that
is more than speculation, but less than certainty. Thus, an event is likely if a reasonable person
using common sense, training or experience concludes that, given the circumstances, an event is
probable. In some embodiments, once likelihood has been ascertained, the patient may be
treated (or treatment continued, or treatment proceed with a dosage increase) with the IL- 13
antagonist or the patient may not be treated (or treatment discontinued, or treatment proceed with
a lowered dose) with the IL-13 antagonist.
       The phrase "increased likelihood" refers to an increase in the probability that an event will
occur. For example, some methods herein allow prediction of whether a patient will display an
increased likelihood of responding to treatment with an IL-13 antagonist or an increased
likelihood of responding better to treatment with an IL- 13 antagonist in comparison to a patient
having asthma who does not have an AIR.
       As used herein "SNP" refers to "single nucleotide polymorphism". A single nucleotide
polymorphism is a DNA sequence variation occurring when a single nucleotide in the genome

(or other shared sequence) differs between members of a biological species or paired
chromosomes in an individual. Most SNPs have only two alleles, and one is usually more
common in the population. A SNP may be present in an exon or an intron of a gene, an upstream
or downstream untranslated region of a gene, or in a purely genomic location (i.e., non
transcribed). When a SNP occurs in the coding region of a gene, the SNP may be silent (i.e., a
synonymous polymorphism) due to the redundancy of the genetic code, or the SNP may result in
a change in the sequence of the encoded polypeptide (i.e., a non-synonymous polymorphism).
In the instant disclosure, SNPs are identified by their Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database
(dbSNP) rs number, e.g. rs1805010. The dbSNP is a free public archive for genetic variation
within and across different species developed and hosted by the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in collaboration with the National Human Genome Research
Institute (NHGRI).
       A polymorphic site, such as a SNP, is usually preceded by and followed by conserved
sequences in the genome of the population of interest and thus the location of a polymorphic site
can often be made in reference to a consensus nucleic acid sequence (e.g., of thirty to sixty
nucleotides) that bracket the polymorphic site, which in the case of a SNP is commonly referred
to as the "SNP context sequence". Context sequences for the SNPs disclosed herein may be
found in the NCBI SNP database available at: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp. Alternatively, the
location of the polymorphic site may be identified by its location in a reference sequence (e.g.,
GeneBank deposit) relative to the start of the gene, mRNA transcript, BAC clone or even relative
to the initiation codon (ATG) for protein translation.    The skilled artisan understands that the
location of a particular polymorphic site may not occur at precisely the same position in a
reference or context sequence in each individual in a population of interest due to the presence of
one or more insertions or deletions in that individual's genome as compared to the consensus or
reference sequence. It is routine for the skilled artisan to design robust, specific and accurate
assays for detecting the alternative alleles at a polymorphic site in any given individual, when the
skilled artisan is provided with the identity of the alternative alleles at the polymorphic site to be
detected and one or both of a reference sequence or context sequence in which the polymorphic
site occurs. Thus, the skilled artisan will understand that specifying the location of any
polymorphic site described herein by reference to a particular position in a reference or context

       As recognized by the skilled artisan, nucleic acid samples containing a particular SNP may
be complementary double stranded molecules and thus reference to a particular site on the sense
strand efers as well to the corresponding site on the complementary antisense strand. Similarly,
reference to a particular genotype obtained for a SNP on both copies of one strand of a
chromosome is equivalent to the complementary genotype obtained for the same SNP on both
copies of the other strand.
       As used herein, "genomic sequence" refers to a DNA sequence present in a genome, and
includes a region within an allele, an allele itself, or a larger DNA sequence of a chromsome
containing an allele of interest.
       Products of the AIR markers of the invention can include nucleic acid products and
polypeptide products. "Polypeptide product" refers to a polypeptide including the amino acid
encoded by an AIR marker and fragments thereof "Nucleic acid product" refers to any DNA
                                                  - 21 -

(e.g., genomic, cDNA, etc.) or RNA (e.g., pre-mRNA, mRNA, miRNA, etc.) products of an AIR
markers and fragments thereof
       An "equivalent genetic marker" refers to a genetic marker that is correlated to an allele of
interest, e.g., it displays linkage disequilibrium (LD) or is in genetic linkage with the allele of
interest. Equivalent genetic markers may be used to determine if a patient has an AIR marker,
rather than directly interrogating a biological sample from the patient for the allele per se.
Various programs exist to help determine LD for particular SNPs, e.g, HaploBlock (available at
bioinfo.cs.technion.ac.il/haploblock/), HapMap, WGA Viewer.
       The term "probe" refers to any composition of matter that is useful for specifically
detecting another substance, e.g., a substance related to an AIR marker. A probe can be an
oligonucleotide (including a conjugated oligonucleotide) that specifically hybridizes to a
genomic sequence of an AIR marker, or a nucleic acid product of an AIR marker. A conjugated
oligonucleotide refers to an oligonucleotide covalently bound to chromophore or molecules
containing a ligand (e.g., an antigen), which is highly specific to a receptor molecule (e.g., an
antibody specific to the antigen). The probe can also be a PCR primer, e.g., together with
another primer, for amplifying a particular region within an AIR marker. Further, the probe can
be an antibody that specifically binds to polypeptide products of these alleles. Further, the probe
can be any composition of matter capable of detecting (e.g., binding or hybridizing) an
equivalent genetic marker of an AIR marker. In preferred embodiments, the probe specifically
hybridizes to a nucleic acid sequence (preferably genomic DNA) or specifically binds to a
polypeptide sequence of an allele of interest.
       The phrase "specifically hybridizes" is used to refer to hybrization under stringent
hybridization conditions. Stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be
found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6.
Aqueous and nonaqueous methods are described in that reference and either can be used. One
example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization in 6X sodium chloride/sodium
citrate (SSC) at about 45'C, followed by at least one wash in 0.2X SSC, 0.l1% SDS at 50C. A
second example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization in 6X SSC at about 45'C,
followed by at least one wash in 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55C. Another example of stringent

hybridization conditions is hybridization in 6X SSC at about 45C, followed by at least one wash
in 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 600 C. A further example of stringent hybridization conditions is
hybridization in 6X SSC at about 45C, followed by at least one wash in 0.2X SSC, 0. 1% SDS at
65C. High stringent conditions include hybridization in 0.5 M sodium phosphate, 7% SDS at
65C, followed by at least one wash at 0.2X SSC, 1% SDS at 65 0 C.
       The phrase "a region of a nucleic acid" is used to indicate a smaller sequence within a
larger sequence of nucleic acids. For example, a gene is a region of a chromosome, an exon is a
region of a gene, etc.
       The term "specifically binds" in the context of polypeptides is used to mean that a probe
binds a given polypeptide target (e.g., a polypeptide product an AIR marker) rather than
randomly binding undesireable polypeptides. However, "specifically binds" does not exclude
some cross reactivity with undesireable polypeptides, as long as that cross reactivity does not
interfere with the capability of the probe to provide a a useful measure of the presence of the
given polypeptide target.
       The term "capable" is used to mean that ability to achieve a given result, e.g., a probe that
is capable of detecting the presence of a particular substance means that the probe may be used
to detect the particular substance.
       An "oliogonucelotide" refers to a short sequence of nucleotides, e.g., 2-100 bases.
       The term "biological sample" as used herein refers to a sample from a patient, which may
be used for the purpose of identification, diagnosis, prediction, or monitoring. Preferred samples
include synovial fluid, blood, blood-derived product (such as buffy coat, serum, and plasma),
lymph, urine, tear, saliva, hair bulb cells, cerebrospinal fluid, buccal swabs, feces, synovial fluid,
synovial cells, sputum, or tissue samples (e.g., cartilage samples). In addition, one of skill in the
art would realize that some samples would be more readily analyzed following a fractionation or
purification procedure, for example, isolation of DNA from whole blood.
       The term "IL-13" includes wild-type IL-13 from various species (e.g., human, mouse, and
monkey), polymorphic variants of IL-13, and functional equivalents of IL-13. Functional
equivalents of IL-13 according to the present disclosure preferably have at least about 85%, 95%,

96%, 97%, 98%, or even 99% overall sequence identity with the wild-type IL-13 (e.g., human
IL-13). More particularly, IL-13 refers to the polypeptide sequence set forth as in the following
paragraph.
       The IL-13 polypeptide has the below sequence. The N-terminal 34 amino acid residues (in
italics) is a signal peptide. The mature cytokine thus has 112 amino acid residues. Anti-IL-13
antibodies will bind to an epitope on the mature polypeptide.

       In principle any anti-IL- 13 antagonists, including antibodies, which inhibit or neutralize
the activity of IL-13 may be used in the invention, so long as the anti-IL-13 antagonist or
antibody determinably and selectively reduces exacerbations in an asthma patient that is positive

acid comprises two or more SNPs selected from the group set forth in Table 1. In another, the
nucleic acid comprises 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 or more SNPs selected from the group set forth
in Table 1.
         In another embodiment, the one or more probes specifically hybridize under stringent
conditions to a nucleic acid comprising the responsive allele in SNP rs 8832, and/or rs 1050 .
         In another, the one or more probes and/or primers comprise probes and/or primers for use
in nucleic acid amplification reaction.
Techniques for Assaying, Diagnostic Methods and Methods of Producing a Transmittable Form
of Information
         The disclosed methods are useful for the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of asthma
diseases, as well as predicting the likelihood of an asthma patient's response to treatment with an
IL-13 antagonist. These methods employ, inter alia, determining whether a patient has an AIR
marker in a sample from the patient.

    WO 2015/155710                                                              PCT/IB2015/052551
        A biological sample from the patient may be assayed for the presence of an AIR marker
by any applicable conventional means, which will be selected depending on whether the
particular marker falls within an exon, an intron, a non-coding portion of mRNA or a non
conding genomic sequence.
       Numerous biological samples may be used to identify the presence of alleles or proteins,
the level of expression of genes or proteins, and the activity of a protein, e.g., blood, synovial
fluid, buffy coat, serum, plasma, lymph, feces, urine, tear, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, buccal
swabs, sputum, or tissue. Various sources within a biological sample may be used in the
disclosed methods, e.g., one may assay genomic DNA obtained from a biological sample to
detect an AIR marker, or one may assay products of a an AIR marker, e.g., nucleic acid products
(e.g., DNA, pre-mRNA, mRNA, micro RNAs, etc.) and polypeptide products (e.g., expressed
proteins) obtained from a biological sample.
       The inventive discovery encompasses the determination that the various AIR markers of
Table 1 are useful for predicting certain patient's response to treatment by IL-13 antagonism. Of
the SNPs in Table 1, most are found in genomic DNA and introns, such that a patient's allelic
status may be determined by interrogating, e.g., pre-mRNA or genomic DNA. However, the
presence of the AIR markers corresponding to exonic locations may be determined by assaying
genomic DNA, RNA and/or protein sequence.            Accordingly, a skilled artisan will understand
that one may identify whether a subject has a given AIR marker by assaying a nucleic acid
product of an AIR marker, a polypeptide product of an AIR marker, or an equivalent genetic
marker of an AIR marker, as appropriate. In preferred embodiments, a genomic sequence of an
AIR marker is analyzed to determine whether a subject has an AIR marker.
        Numerous methods and devices are available to identify the presence of an AIR marker
or polymorphism that results in a decreased level of expression, level of the coded protein or
level of the protein's activity. DNA (genomic and cDNA) for SNP detection can be prepared
from a biological sample by methods well known in the art, e.g., phenol/chloroform extraction,
PUREGENE DNA@ purification system from GentAS Systems (Qiagen, CA). Detection of a
DNA sequence may include examining the nucleotide(s) located at either the sense or the anti
sense strand within that region. The presence of polymorphisms in a patient may be detected
                                                - 31 -

from DNA (genomic or cDNA) obtained from PCR using sequence-specific probes, e.g.,
hydrolysis probes from Taqman, Beacons, Scorpions; or hybridization probes that detect the
marker or polymorphism. For the detection of the polymorphism, sequence specific probes may
be designed such that they specifically hybridize to the genomic DNA for the alleles of interest
or, in some cases, an RNA of interest. Primers and probes for polymorphic sites (e.g., SNP) may
be designed based on context sequences found in the NCBI SNP database available at:
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp. These probes may be labeled for direct detection or contacted by a
second, detectable molecule that specifically binds to the probe. The PCR products also can be
detected by DNA-binding agents. Said PCR products can then be subsequently sequenced by
any DNA sequencing method available in the art. Alternatively the presence of allele can be
detected by sequencing using any sequencing methods such as, but not limited to, Sanger-based
sequencing, pyrosequencing or next generation sequencing (Shendure J. and Ji, H., Nature
Biotechnology (1998), Vol. 26, Nr 10, pages 1135-1145). Optimised allelic discrimination
assays for SNPs may be purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, California, USA).
        Various techniques can be applied to interrogate a particular polymorphism (e.g., SNP),
including, e.g., hybridization-based methods, such as dynamic allele-specific hybridization
(DASH) genotyping, polymorphic site (e.g., SNP) detection through molecular beacons
(Abravaya K., et al. (2003) Clin Chem Lab Med. 41:468-474), Luminex xMAP technology,
Illumina Golden Gate technology and commercially available high-density oligonucleotide
SNP arrays (e.g., the Affymetrix Human SNP 5.0 GeneChip@ performs a genome-wide assay
that can genotype over 500,000 human SNPs), BeadChip@ kits from Illumina, e.g,
Human660W-Quad and Human 1.2M-Duo); enzyme-based methods, such as restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), PCR-based methods (e.g., Tetra-primer ARMS-PCR),
Invader assays (Olivier M. (2005) Mutat Res. 573(1-2):103-10), various primer extension assays
(incorporated into detection formats, e.g., MVALDI-TOF Mass spectrometry, electrophoresis,
blotting, and ELISA-like methods), TaqMan@ assays, and oligonucleotide ligase assays; and
other post-amplification methods, e.g., analysis of single strand conformation polymorphism
(Costabile et al. (2006) Hum. Mutat. 27(12):1163-73), temperaure gradient gel electrophoresis
(TGGE), denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, high-resolution melting analysis,
DNA mismatch-binding protein assays (e.g., MutS protein from Thermus aquaticusbinds

different single nucleotide mismatches with different affinities and can be used in capillary
electrophoresis to differentiate all six sets of mismatches), SNPLex (proprietary SNP detecting
system available from Applied Biosystems), capillary electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and
various sequencing methods, e.g., pyrosequencing and next generation sequencing, etc.
Commercial kits for SNP genotyping include, e.g., Fluidigm Dynamic Array IFCs (Fluidigm),
TaqMan@ SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems), MassARRAY@ iPLEX Gold
(Sequenom), Type-it Fast SNP Probe PCR Kit (Quiagen), etc.
         In some embodiments, the presence of a polymorphic site (e.g., SNP) in a patient is
detected using a hybridization assay. In a hybridization assay, the presence of the genetic marker
is determined based on the ability of the nucleic acid from the sample to hybridize to a
complementary nucleic acid molecule, e.g., an oligonucleotide probe. A variety of hybridization
assays are available. In some, hybridization of a probe to the sequence of interest is detected
directly by visualizing a bound probe, e.g., a Northern or Southern assay. In these assays, DNA
(Southern) or RNA (Northern) is isolated. The DNA or RNA is then cleaved with a series of
restriction enzymes that cleave infrequently in the genome and not near any of the markers being
assayed. The DNA or RNA is then separated, e.g., on an agarose gel, and transferred to a
membrane. A labeled probe or probes, e.g., by incorporating a radionucleotide or binding agent
(e.g., SYBR@ Green), is allowed to contact the membrane under low-, medium- or high
stringency conditions. Unbound probe is removed and the presence of binding is detected by
visualizing the labeled probe. In some embodiments, arrays, e.g., the MassARRAY system
(Sequenom, San Diego, California, USA) may be used to genotype a subject.
         Traditional genotyping methods may also be modified for use in genotyping. Such
traditional methods include, e.g., DNA amplification techniques such as PCR and variants
thereof, direct sequencing, SSO hybridization coupled with the Luminex xMAP@ technology,
SSP typing, and SBT.
         Sequence-Specific Oligonucleotide (SSO) typing uses PCR target amplification,
hybridization of PCR products to a panel of immobilized sequence-specific oligonucleotides on
the beads, detection of probe-bound amplified product by color formation followed by data
analysis. Those skilled in the art would understand that the described Sequence-Specific
                                                  - 33 -

Oligonucleotide (SSO) hybridization may be performed using various commercially available
kits, such as those provided by One Lambda, Inc. (Canoga Park, CA) or Lifecodes HLA Typing
Kits (Tepnel Life Sciences Corp.) coupled with Luminex@ technology (Luminex, Corporation,
TX). LABType@ SSO is a reverse SSO (rSSO) DNA typing solution that uses sequence-specific
oligonucleotide (SSO) probes and color-coded microspheres to identify HLA alleles. The target
DNA is amplified by polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and then hybridized with the bead probe
array. The assay takes place in a single well of a 96-well PCR plate; thus, 96 samples can be
processed at one time.
         Sequence Specific Primers (SSP) typing is a PCR based technique which uses sequence
specific primers for DNA based typing. The SSP method is based on the principle that only
primers with completely matched sequences to the target sequences result in amplified products
under controlled PCR conditions. Allele sequence-specific primer pairs are designed to
selectively amplify target sequences which are specific to a single allele or group of alleles. PCR
products can be visualized on agarose gel. Control primer pairs that matches non-allelic
sequences present in all samples act as an internal PCR control to verify the efficiency of the
PCR amplification. Those skilled in the art would understand that low, medium and high
resolution genotyping with the described sequence-specific primer typing may be performed
using various commercially available kits, such as the Olerup SSPTM kits (Olerup, PA) or
(Invitrogen) or Allset and TMGold DQA1 Low resolution SSP (Invitrogen).
         Sequence Based Typing (SBT) is based on PCR target amplification, followed by
sequencing of the PCR products and data analysis.
        In some cases, RNA, e.g., mature mRNA, pre-mRNA, can also be used to determine the
presence of particular polymorphisms (see Table 1).     Analysis of the sequence of mRNA
transcribed from a given gene can be performed using any known method in the art including,
but not limited, to Northern blot analysis, nuclease protection assays (NPA), in situ
hybridization, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), RT-PCR ELISA,
TaqMan-based quantitative RT-PCR (probe-based quantitative RT-PCR) and SYBR green-based
quantitative RT-PCR. In one example, detection of mRNA levels involves contacting the
isolated mRNA with an oligonucleotide that can hybridize to mRNA encoded by an AIR marker.

    WO 2015/155710                                                             PCT/IB2015/052551
The nucleic acid probe can typically be, for example, a full-length cDNA, or a portion thereof,
such as an oligonucleotide of at least 7, 15, 30, 50, or 100 nucleotides in length and sufficient to
specifically hybridize under stringent conditions to the mRNA. Hybridization of an mRNA with
the probe indicates that the marker in question is being expressed. In one format, the RNA is
immobilized on a solid surface and contacted with a probe, for example by running the isolated
RNA on an agarose gel and transferring the mRNA from the gel to a membrane, such as
nitrocellulose. Amplification primers are defined as being a pair of nucleic acid molecules that
can anneal to 5' or 3' regions of a gene (plus and minus strands, respectively, or vice-versa) and
contain a short region in between. In general, amplification primers are from about 10 to 30
nucleotides in length and flank a region from about 50 to 200 nucleotides in length. Under
appropriate conditions and with appropriate reagents, such primers permit the amplification of a
nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence flanked by the primers. PCR products
can be detected by any suitable method including, but not limited to, gel electrophoresis and
staining with a DNA-specific stain or hybridization to a labeled probe.
        The level of expression of a gene may be determined by measuring RNA (or reverse
transcribed cDNA) levels using various techniques, e.g., a PCR-based assay, reverse
transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay, Northern blot, etc. Quantitative RT-PCR with standardized
mixtures of competitive templates can also be utilized.
        In some cases, the presence of a polymorphism in a patient can be determined by
analyzing polypeptide products of the AIR markers (see Table 1). Detection of polypeptide
products can be performed using any known method in the art including, but not limited, to
immunocytochemical staining, ELISA, flow cytometry, Western blot, spectrophotometry, HPLC,
and mass spectrometry.
        The use of immobilized antibodies specific for the proteins or polypeptides is also
contemplated by the present disclosure. The antibodies can be immobilized onto a variety of
solid supports, such as magnetic or chromatographic matrix particles, the surface of an assay
place (such as microtiter wells), pieces of a solid substrate material (such as plastic, nylon,
paper), and the like. An assay strip can be prepared by coating the antibody or a plurality of
antibodies in an array on solid support. This strip can then be dipped into the test sample and
                                                 - 35 -

    WO 2015/155710                                                             PCT/IB2015/052551
then processed quickly through washes and detection steps to generate a measurable signal, such
as a colored spot.
         In a two-step assay, immobilized polypeptide products of an AIR marker or ERAPI
protein may be incubated with an unlabeled antibody. The unlabeled antibody complex, if
present, is then bound to a second, labeled antibody that is specific for the unlabeled antibody.
The sample is washed and assayed for the presence of the label. The choice of marker used to
label the antibodies will vary depending upon the application. However, the choice of the marker
is readily determinable to one skilled in the art. The antibodies may be labeled with a radioactive
atom, an enzyme, a chromophoric or fluorescent moiety, or a colorimetric tag. The choice of
tagging label also will depend on the detection limitations desired. Enzyme assays (ELISAs)
typically allow detection of a colored product formed by interaction of the enzyme-tagged
                                                                                    32
complex with an enzyme substrate. Some examples of radioactive atoms include           P, 1251, 3H,
and 14 P. Some examples of enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta
galactosidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Some examples of chromophoric
moieties include fluorescein and rhodamine. The antibodies may be conjugated to these labels by
methods known in the art. For example, enzymes and chromophoric molecules may be
conjugated to the antibodies by means of coupling agents, such as dialdehydes, carbodiimides,
dimaleimides, and the like. Alternatively, conjugation may occur through a ligand-receptor pair.
Some suitable ligand-receptor pairs include, for example, biotin-avidin or -streptavidin, and
antibody-antigen.
         In one aspect, the present disclosure contemplates the use of a sandwich technique for
detecting polypeptide products in biological samples. The technique requires two antibodies
capable of binding the protein of interest: e.g., one immobilized onto a solid support and one free
in solution, but labeled with some easily detectable chemical compound. Examples of chemical
labels that may be used for the second antibody include but are not limited to radioisotopes,
fluorescent compounds, and enzymes or other molecules which generate colored or
electrochemically active products when exposed to a reactant or enzyme substrate. When
samples containing polypeptide products are placed in this system, the polypeptide products
binds to both the immobilized antibody and the labeled antibody. The result is a "sandwich"
immune complex on the support's surface. The complexed protein is detected by washing away
                                                 - 36 -

    WO 2015/155710                                                               PCT/IB2015/052551
nonbound sample components and excess labeled antibody, and measuring the amount of labeled
antibody complexed to protein on the support's surface. The sandwich immunoassay is highly
specific and very sensitive, provided that labels with good limits of detection are used.
        Preferably, the presence of polypeptide products in a sample is detected by
radioimmunoassays or enzyme-linked immunoassays, competitive binding enzyme-linked
immunoassays, dot blot, Western blot, chromatography, preferably high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC), or other assays known in the art. Specific immunological binding of
the antibody to the protein or polypeptide can be detected directly or indirectly.
        Dot blotting is routinely practiced by the skilled artisan to detect a desired protein using
an antibody as a probe (Promega Protocols and Applications Guide, Second Edition, 1991, Page
263, Promega Corporation). Samples are applied to a membrane using a dot blot apparatus. A
labeled probe is incubated with the membrane, and the presence of the protein is detected.
        Western blot analysis is well known to the skilled artisan (Sambrook et al., Molecular
Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 1989, Vol. 3, Chapter 18, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). In
Western blot, the sample is separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel is transferred to a membrane. The
membrane is incubated with labeled antibody for detection of the desired protein.
        The assays described above involve steps such as but not limited to, immunoblotting,
immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, or immunoprecipitation. In some embodiments, an
automatic analyzer is used to determine the presence of an AIR marker.
        In performing any of the methods described herein that require determining the presence
of an AIR marker or polymorphism, such determination may be made by consulting a data
repository that contains sufficient information on the patient's genetic composition to determine
whether the patient has the marker of interest. Preferably, the data repository lists the genotype
present (or absent) in the individual. The data repository could include the individual's patient
records, a medical data card, a file (e. g., a flat ASCII file) accessible by a computer or other
electronic or non-electronic media on which appropriate information or genetic data can be
stored. As used herein, a medical data card is a portable storage device such as a magnetic data
card, a smart card, which has an on-board processing unit and which is sold by vendors such as
                                                   - 37 -

by a computer; such files may be located on various media, including: a server, a client, a hard
disk, a CD, a DVD, a personal digital assistant such as a smart phone, Palm Pilot, a tape
recorder, a zip disk, the computer's internal ROM (read-only-memory) or the internet or
worldwide web. Other media for the storage of files accessible by a computer will be obvious to
one skilled in the art.
        Typically, once the presence of an AIR marker or polymorphism is determined,
physicians or genetic counselors or patients or other researchers may be informed of the result.
Specifically the result can be cast in a transmittable form of information that can be
communicated or transmitted to other researchers or physicians or genetic counselors or patients.
Such a form can vary and can be tangible or intangible. The result in the individual tested can be
embodied in descriptive statements, diagrams, photographs, charts, images or any other visual
forms. For example, images of gel electrophoresis of PCR products can be used in explaining
the results. Diagrams showing where a variant occurs in an individual's allele are also useful in
indicating the testing results. Statements regarding the presence of an AIR marker or
polymorphism are also useful in indicating the testing results. These statements and visual forms
can be recorded on a tangible media such as papers, computer readable media such as floppy
disks, compact disks, etc., or on an intangible media, e.g., an electronic media in the form of
email or website on internet or intranet. In addition, the result can also be recorded in a sound
form and transmitted through any suitable media, e.g., analog or digital cable lines, fiber optic
cables, etc., via telephone, facsimile, wireless mobile phone, internet phone and the like. All such
forms (tangible and intangible) would constitute a "transmittable form of information". Thus, the
information and data on a test result can be produced anywhere in the world and transmitted to a
different location. For example, when a genotyping assay is conducted offshore, the information
and data on a test result may be generated and cast in a transmittable form as described above.
The test result in a transmittable form thus can be imported into the U.S. Accordingly, the
present disclosure also encompasses a method for producing a transmittable form of information
containing the presence or absence of an AIR marker or polymorphism in an individual. This
form of information is useful for predicting the responsiveness of a patient having asthma, and
for selectively treating a patient based upon that information.

Methods of Treatment and Uses of IL-1 3Antagonists
         The disclosed methods allow clinicians to provide a personalized therapy for asthma
patients, i.e., they allow determination of whether to selectively treat the patient with an IL-13
antagonist. In this way, a clinician can maximize the benefit and minimize the risk of IL-13
antagnoism in the entire population of patients afflicted with asthma. It will be understood that
IL- 13 antagonists are useful for the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of asthma, including
moderate or severe asthma. The IL- 13 antagonists, may be used in vitro, ex vivo, or incorporated
into pharmaceutical compositions and administered to individuals (e.g., human patients) in vivo
to treat, ameliorate, or prevent asthma, e.g., in patients who have an AIR marker. A
pharmaceutical composition will be formulated to be compatible with its intended route of
administration (e.g., oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier).
Other nonlimiting examples of routes of administration include parenteral (e.g., intravenous),
intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal
administration. The pharmaceutical compositions compatible with each intended route are well
known in the art.
         The IL- 13 antagonists, may be used as a pharmaceutical composition when combined
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such a composition may contain, in addition to an
IL-13 antagonist, carriers, various diluents, fillers, salts, buffers, stabilizers, solubilizers, and
other materials well known in the art. The characteristics of the carrier will depend on the route
of administration.
         Antibodies, e.g., antibodies to IL-13, are typically formulated either in aqueous form
ready for parenteral administration or as lyophilisates for reconstitution with a suitable diluent
prior to administration. In some embodiments of the disclosed methods and uses, the IL-13
antagonist, e.g., IL-13 antibody, is formulated as a lyophilisate. Suitable lyophilisate
formulations can be reconstituted in a small liquid volume (e.g., 2ml or less) to allow
subcutaneous administration and can provide solutions with low levels of antibody aggregation.
The use of antibodies as the active ingredient of pharmaceuticals is now widespread, including
the products HERCEPTIN (trastuzumab), RITUXAN@ (rituximab), SYNAGIS
                                                  - 39 -

(palivizumab), etc. Techniques for purification of antibodies to a pharmaceutical grade are well
known in the art. When a therapeutically effective amount of an IL-13 antagonistis administered
by intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, the IL-13 antagonist will be in the form of
a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable solution. A pharmaceutical composition for intravenous,
cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection may contain, in addition to the IL-13 antagonist, an isotonic
vehicle such as sodium chloride, Ringer's, dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated
Ringer's, or other vehicle as known in the art.
         The appropriate dosage will, of course, vary depending upon, for example, the particular
IL- 13 antagonists to be employed, the host, the mode of administration and the nature and
severity of the condition being treated, and on the nature of prior treatments that the patient has
undergone. Ultimately, the attending health care provider will decide the amount of the IL-13
antagonist with which to treat each individual patient.
        In practicing some of the methods of treatment or uses of the present disclosure, a
therapeutically effective amount of an IL-13 antagonistis administered to a patient, e.g., a
mammal (e.g., a human). While it is understood that the disclosed methods provide for selective
treatment of patients depending on the presence of an AIR marker, this does not preclude that, if
the patient is ultimately treated with an IL- 13 antagonist, such IL- 13 antagonist therapy is
necessarily a monotherapy. Indeed, if a patient is selected for treatment with an IL- 13
antagonist, then the IL-13antagonist may be administered in accordance with the method of the
disclosure either alone or in combination with other therapeutics for treating asthma. When
coadministered with one or more additional therapeutics, an IL-13 antagonist may be
administered either simultaneously with the other therapeutic, or sequentially. If administered
sequentially, the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering
the IL- 13 antagonist in combination with other therapeutics, as well as the appropriate dosages
for co-delivery.
        An IL-13 antagonist, is conveniently administered parenterally, intravenously, e.g., into
the antecubital or other peripheral vein, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. The duration of
intravenous (i.v.) therapy using a pharmaceutical composition of the present disclosure will vary,
depending on the severity of the disease being treated and the condition and personal response of

composition of the present disclosure. The health care provider will decide on the appropriate
duration of i.v. or s.c. therapy and the timing of administration of the therapy, using the
pharmaceutical composition of the present disclosure.
        Doses may be delivered based on weight, e.g., 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, or as a
fixed amount, e.g., 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 1000 mg depending on the severity of the disease.
Kits
        The invention also encompasses kits for detecting an AIR marker or polymorphism,
expression level, protein level or activity, in a biological sample (a test sample) from an asthma
patient. Such kits can be used to predict if a patient having asthma is likely to respond (or have a
higher response) to treatment with an IL- 13 antagonist. For example, the kit can comprise a
probe (e.g., an oligonucleotode, antibody, labeled compound or other agent) capable of detecting
an AIR marker or polymorphism, products of those alleles and/or an equivalent genetic marker
of those alleles in a biological sample. The kit may also comprise instructions for providing a
prediction of the likelihood that the patient will respond to treatment with the IL- 13 antagonist.
        Probes may specifically hybridize to genomic sequences, nucleic acid products, or
polypeptide products. Exemplary probes are oligonucleotides or conjugated oligonucleotides
that specifically hybridizes to the responsive alleles of Table 1; an antibody that is capable of
differentiating between polypeptide products encoded by the disclosed alleles; primer-extension
oligonucleotides, allele-specific primers, a combination of allele-specific primers, allele-specfic
probes, and primer extension primers, etc. Optionally, the kit can contain a probe that targets an
internal control allele, which can be any allele presented in the general population. Detection of
an internal control allele is designed to assure the performance of the kit. The disclosed kits can
also comprise, e.g., a buffering agent, a preservative, or a protein stabilizing agent. The kit can
also comprise components necessary for detecting the detectable agent (e.g., an enzyme or a
substrate). The kit can also contain a control sample or a series of control samples that can be
assayed and compared to the test sample contained. Each component of the kit is usually
enclosed within an individual container, and all of the various containers are within a single
package along with instructions for use.

         Such kits may also comprise an IL-13 antagonist or a pharmaceutical composition
comprising the IL-13 antagonist. Such kits are useful in the selective treatment of asthma
patients using an IL-13 antagonist. Additionally, such kits may comprise means for
administering the IL-13 antagonist (e.g., a syringe and vial, a prefilled syringe, a prefilled pen)
and instructions for use. These kits may contain additional therapeutic agents for treating
asthma, e.g., for delivery in combination with the enclosed IL-13 antagonist..
         The phrase "means for administering" is used to indicate any available implement for
systemically administering a drug top a patient, including, but not limited to, a pre-filled syringe,
a vial and syringe, an injection pen, an autoinjector, an i.v. drip and bag, a pump, etc. With such
items, a patient may self-administer the drug (i.e., administer the drug on their own behalf) or a
physician may administer the drug.

Identification of 11-13 antagonists
        For the purposes of the invention, IL- 13 antagonists that compete with a specified anti
IL-13 antibody set forth herein, including antibody 01951/G12 (SEQ ID NO:14 and 16) for
binding to IL- 13 can be identified by methods known in the art, and further as described in the
following methodology.
All experiments are performed using a Biacore T200 instrument. Biacore T200 Control software
and Biacore T200 Evaluation software are used for the control and analysis of experiments,
respectively.
PART 1: The anti-human IL-13 antibody ANTIBODY 01951/G12 is immobilized to a CM5
sensorchip surface using the amine coupling method. Briefly, the surface of the measuring flow
cell is activated with EDC/NHS, followed by a 700 second addition of 50 p.g/mL ANTIBODY
                                                - 43 -

    WO 2015/155710                                                         PCT/IB2015/052551
01951/G12 in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5. Based on previous experiments, these buffers and
injection times are sufficient to allow saturation of the chip surface with ANTIBODY
01951/G12 , though exposure time could be reduced if saturation was achieved prior to 700
seconds. Immobilization buffers that are potentially more suitable could be determined by buffer
scouting.   Any remaining active surface groups are subsequently blocked with ethanolamine.
The surface of the reference flow cell is activated with EDC/NHS and subsequently blocked with
ethanolamine without immobilization of protein (blank immobilization) or by the addition of an
isotype control antibody.       Based on previous        studies using ANTIBODY       01951/G12
immobilization, an appropriate running buffer is HBS-EP+ containing 10 niM HEPES, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.005 % (w/v) polysorbate 20 and 3 mM EDTA at pH 7.4.
PART 2:      A concentration-response curve for human IL-13 is performed to determine the
appropriate concentration of IL-13 to use in the subsequent epitope competition studies. IL-13 is
diluted in running buffer and, beginning at 25 nM, is flowed over the reference and measuring
flow cell at a flow rate of 30 pL/min. The optimal rate can be adjusted experimentally. The
association time is 120 seconds and dissociation time is 120 seconds, although dissociation time
could be extended to 180 seconds, or 600 seconds or more if an affinity (KD) measurement is
required. Regeneration of the surface with a 30 second injection of 10 mM Glycine at pH 2.0, at
a flow rate of 10 pL/min, is necessary to remove IL-13 from ANTIBODY 01951/G12 after the
dissociation step. A second regeneration step immediately after the first is sometimes required.
These steps are repeated over the following dilution series of IL-13: 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.13, 1.56
and 0 nM. Based on previous studies, this dilution series would be suitable for preliminary
experiments, but may need to be changed accordingly. The dilution series is run twice to provide
n = 2. Analysis temperature is 25 'C. Running buffer is HBS-P+ containing 10 mM HEPES,
150 mM NaCl, 0.005 % (w/v) and polysorbate 20 at pH 7.4. Data is evaluated using a 1:1
binding model with Biacore T200 Evaluation software.
PART 3: Epitope competition studies are done using a dual binding method. Based on the data
from Part 2, a concentration of IL-13 that gives approximately 50 RU binding to ANTIBODY
01951/G12 is injected for 120 seconds at 30 pL/min. There is NO dissociation phase; instead a
second injection of a competitor anti-IL- 13 antibody immediately follows, at a 10-fold* greater
                                                - 44 -

concentration than IL-13. Previous studies with respect to IL-25 have used an association phase
of 120 seconds, with a flow rate of 30 ptL/min, mirroring the IL-13 addition. Any competitor
that binds to IL-13 using a different epitope to that of ANTIBODY 01951/G12 will give a
binding response. Those that bind to IL-13 using the same epitope as ANTIBODY 01951/G12
will give no binding response. A variable dissociation period can apply, followed by an acidic
wash step to remove both the IL- 13 and the competitor addition. This step can be reversed, with
competitor antibody immobilized to the chip surface and ANTIBODY 01951/G12 as the second
addition, to confirm results. Running buffer is HBS-P+ containing 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.005 % (w/v) and polysorbate 20 at pH 7.4.
EXAMPLE 2
Identification of the antibody 01951/G12 epitope residues:
Peptide mapping:
The sequence of IL- 13 was probed at the peptide level to identify the binding site with
ANTIBODY 01951/G12.            Thirty four 15-mer peptides were synthesized in order to scan the
entire sequence with 12 residue overlap starting from the N-terminus. The synthesis of the
peptides, preparation of the peptide-array slides, incubation with antibodies and data analysis
where done as described by Maksimov et al. (PLoS ONE 7(3): e34212).
The results are shown in Table 4. The binding signal intensity (light unit) observed is reported
for each peptide, in column 1 against a control unrelated human antibody and in column 2
against ANTIBODY 0195 1/G12. Signals above 10000 Light Units are considered as being
significant. 2 overlapping peptides in the set of the 34 peptides produced a signal above that
threshold, peptide 22 (TQRMLSGFCPHKVSA) (SEQ ID NO: 31) and peptide 23
(MLSGFCPHKVSAGQF) (SEQ ID NO: 32). The overlapping sequence between both peptides
is MLSGFCPHKVSA (SEQ ID NO: 33).
In order to verify that this sequence is important for the binding of IL- 13 to ANTIBODY
01951/G12 and eventually narrow it down further, a substitution analysis was performed.
For this substitution analysis, a peptide array was created where each residue of the sequence
MLSGFCPHKVSA was exchanged against every possible 20 standard amino acid, creating a set
of 240 peptides in which 228 peptides differ from the original sequence by 1 amino acid at a
                                                 - 45 -

time. The result of the binding study with ANTIBODY 01951/G12 is presented in Figure 1. The
boxed region indicates residues for which binding is strongly reduced or abolished when they are
replaced by almost any amino acid. Therefore this sequence stretch, FCPHKV (SEQ ID NO: 67),
represent the minimal binding region of IL-13 to ANTIBODY 0195 1/G12.

EXAMPLE 3
Pharmaco2enetic analysis of IL4-Ra SNPs and discovery of AIR markers 1-9:
ANTIBODY 01951/G12 is a fully human IgG1/K monoclonal antibody. CQAX576A2207 was a
Phase II clinical study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ANTIBODY 01951/G12 in
patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma following multiple doses, when added to
existing asthma therapy.
To assess associations of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL4-Ra gene
and risk of asthma exacerbation in patients treated with ANTIBODY 01951/G12, DNA was
collected from patients enrolled in the CQAX576A2207 trial and nine SNPs in the IL4-RU gene
were genotyped in these samples. Statistical tests of association were performed to assess the
evidence for association of SNPs in the IL4-Ra gene with risk of asthma exacerbation, as well as
with other asthma clinical endpoints, in patients treated with ANTIBODY 0195 1/G12.
In this manner, a pharmacogenetic analysis was undertaken, with the objective:
*   To evaluate whether certain SNPs in the IL4-Ra gene are associated with risk of asthma
    exacerbation in patients treated with ANTIBODY 01951/G12.
*   To evaluate whether certain SNPs are associated with change from baseline in ACQ7 score,
    FEVI, or IgE level in patients treated with ANTIBODY 01951/G12.

Genome-wide association study (GWAS)
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using the Illumina Omni5Exome
chip. All SNPs that map to the IL4-Ra gene were evaluated.
Resequencing of the IL4-Rca gene
Sanger sequencing was performed on most exons in the IL4-Ra gene, as well as the 3'
untranslated region (UTR), to determine whether any additional variants could be identified that
were not included on the Omni5Exome chip.

GWAS
Genotype data for the GWAS were generated using the Illumina HumanOMNI5Exome
microarray platform.
Resequencing of the IL4-Rca gene
SNPs were identified by Sanger sequencing in IL4Ru (NT_010393.15).       PCR was performed
using unique primers carrying M13 universal sequence tags. Amplicons for each coding region
were bi-directionally sequenced with unique or universal primers and BigDye Terminator v3.1
(Applied Biosystems, 4337456).        Sequencing products were cleaned up with CleanSEQ
(Beckman, A29154) and run on a 3730xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) with POP-7
for sequence detection. Traces were aligned to reference sequences for each amplicon from
NCBI using PhredPhrap (University of Washington) and were then visually inspected for
discrepancies from canonical sequence using Consed (University of Washington, version 19.0).
Sequence variations were noted and any corresponding coding changes characterized where
possible.

                                         Statistical methods:
Analysis of asthma exacerbation risk
All tests of association between SNPs and risk of asthma exacerbations were conducted by way
of a conditional logistic regression model using PROC LOGISTIC in SAS version 9.3, with
country as the conditioning factor.      All tests were designed to evaluate the hypothesis of an
additive relationship between genotype and exacerbation risk (on the logit scale), meaning that
the risk among heterozygotes is intermediate to that within the two homozygous classes. The
additive hypothesis was tested by specifying genotype as a continuous variable equal to the
number of copies of the minor (i.e., less common in the CQAX576A2207 sample) allele carried
by the patient.
Race and ethnicity are known to be common confounding factors in genetic association studies;
as such, it is advisable to adjust for race and ethnicity in association tests where possible. In the
CQAX576A2207 study the distributions of race and ethnicity were too imbalanced to enable
adjustment for these factors, so the logistic regression was instead conditioned on country as a
proxy for those factors.
The score statistic was used to assess statistical significance.      No adjustment was made for
multiple testing.
Analysis of change from baseline in ACQ7, FEV1, and IgE
All tests for association between SNPs and absolute change from baseline in ACQ7, percent
change from baseline in FEVI, and percent change from baseline in IgE were conducted by way
of a linear model using PROC GENMOD in SAS version 9.3. All tests evaluated the hypothesis
of an additive relationship between genotype and the endpoint, as described in Section 3.4.1.
Country, history of atopy, maintenance oral corticosteroid use, and baseline level of the
corresponding endpoint were included in the model as covariates. A Wald chi-square test was
used to assess statistical significance. No adjustment was made for multiple testing.

Permutation test to assess overall significance
A permutation test was performed to assess the likelihood of finding that each of the top 7 SNPs
in Table 5 (i.e. excluding the bottom 2 SNP's: rs1029849, and rs4787956) would be found to
have a homozygous genotype class in which there were no exacerbations among ANTIBODY
01951/Gi2-treated patients, if in reality there were no association between any of the SNPs and
ANTIBODY 01951/G12 exacerbation risk.
The permutation test proceeded according to the following steps:
* For the first permutation, exacerbation status (yes/no) was randomly permuted for the 94
     ANTIBODY 01951/G12-treated patients, such that it remained the case that only 12 of the
     94 patients experience an exacerbation but these 12 patients were selected at random. All
     genotype data remained unchanged.
* Using this permuted dataset, each SNP was evaluated to determine whether it had a
     homozygous genotype class in which there were no exacerbations. If all 7 SNPs were found
    to have such a genotype class, the permuted dataset was flagged to record that finding.
*    The first 2 steps were iterated 1000 times. The percentage of permuted datasets that were
     flagged to indicate that each of the 7 SNPs had a homozygous genotype class with no
     exacerbations represented the empirical significance level of this finding. Thus, a small
     percentage of flagged datasets would indicate a low likelihood of observing such a result by
     random chance, and would be taken as evidence that risk of asthma exacerbation among
     ANTIBODY 0195 1/G12-treated patients is influenced by SNPs in the IL4-Ra gene.
Calculation of r-squared values in the linkage disequilibrium graph
The r 2 values in the LD graph were computed using Haploview software (Barrett et al, 2004).
Cross-validation analysis to assess optimal number of SNPs for prediction
Cross-validation is a statistical method that can be used to compare alternative approaches to
building predictive models to assess which approach is most likely to yield the model with
highest predictive accuracy.      The method entails dividing the available set of patients into a
training set and a test set, applying alternative model-building approaches to the training set only,
using the resulting models to predict the outcome of the patients in the test set, and determining
                                                  - 52 -

    WO 2015/155710                                                         PCT/IB2015/052551
which model predicted most accurately. This procedure is repeated many times, the predictions
are averaged across the test sets.     If a particular approach tends to result in more accurate
predictions than the other approaches, it suggests that this approach may also result in a model
with the highest predictive accuracy when applied to future studies.
In this application of cross-validation, once the selected SNPs were determined for each of the
model-building approaches listed below, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was applied to build
the predictive model. The set of markers available for selection consisted of 6 of the top 7 IL4
Ru SNPs listed in Table 5. rs3024530 was removed because it was almost perfectly correlated
with rs1805010.      The procedure was then applied to patients treated with ANTIBODY
01951/G12 to compare the following model-building approaches:
* Include the most significant SNP from each of the 2 linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks
* Include the 2 SNPs selected above, as well as the next most significant SNP
* Include the 2 most significant SNPs from each of the 2 LD blocks
* Include the 4 SNPs selected above, as well as the next most significant SNP
* Include all 6 SNPs.
The results were compared to evaluate whether a predictive model that includes additional SNPs
would be likely to have substantially higher predictive accuracy than one which contains only the
single most significant SNP from each of the 2 LD blocks.
Results:
                             Genotype frequencies of IL4-Ra SN]Ps
A total of 94 ANTIBODY 01951/G12-treated patients and 102 placebo-treated patients were
genotyped for the 9 SNPs in the IL4-Ra gene listed in Table 5. Two patients, both placebo
treated, had a discrepancy between gender as recorded in the clinical database vs. as determined
genetically, and were removed from the analysis. Both were from the same country, suggesting
a possible sample switch.
Twelve of the 94 ANTIBODY 01951/G12-treated patients (12.8%) experienced at least one
asthma exacerbation during the study, compared to 23 of 100 placebo-treated patients (23.0%).
The distribution was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for each SNP.

Genotype frequencies were calculated by combining the ANTIBODY 01951/G12 and placebo arms.
                 Association between IL4-Ra SNIPs and risk of exacerbation
The proportion of ANTIBODY 01951/Gi2-treated patients who experienced at least one asthma
exacerbation during the study is shown in Figure 2 by genotype class for each of the 9 genotyped
SNPs, along with significance levels for the corresponding tests of association between SNP and
exacerbation risk.   Six of these 7 SNIPs were also significantly associated with response to
ANTIBODY 01951/G12, with p-values ranging from 0.005 to 0.015, while the remaining SNP
approached significance with a p-value of 0.066.       Moreover, the SNPs generally showed an
                                                - 54 -

    WO 2015/155710                                                           PCT/IB2015/052551
additive effect on exacerbation risk in both studies, meaning that the risk for heterozygotes was
generally intermediate to that for the two homozygous classes, suggesting that exacerbation risk
for both therapies increases with the number of risk alleles carried by an individual at an
associated SNP.
Since race is well known to be a common confounding factor in genetic association studies, the
association tests for ANTIBODY 01951/G12-treated patients were repeated using only self
reported Caucasian patients, but the p-values were unchanged. This is likely because 89 of the
94 patients (94.7%) were Caucasian, and the 5 non-Caucasians were all from countries in which
there were no exacerbations.
Of particular note in the ANTIBODY 01951/G12 study, for each of the 7 SNPs there was one
homozygous class for which no exacerbations were observed among ANTIBODY 01951/G12
treated patients, a result that would be unlikely to occur by random chance.
The results for the two bottom SNPs listed in Table 5, which code for amino acid changes in the
IL-4RA receptor, showed weaker evidence for association with p-values 0.091 and 0.10.
The proportion of placebo-treated patients in the ANTIBODY 01951/G12 study who
experienced at least one asthma exacerbation is shown in Figure 3 by genotype class for the 9
genotyped SNPs.         Unlike the results for the ANTIBODY 01951/G12 arm, placebo-treated
patients show no evidence of association between genotype and exacerbation risk for any of the
SNPs.
The SNPs shown in all tables and figures for this pharmacogenetic analysis are ordered
according to their physical location within the gene.
                  Association between IL4-Ra SN]Ps and other asthma endpoints
The 9 genotyped SNPs were also evaluated in ANTIBODY 01951/G12-treated patients for
evidence of association with 3 other asthma endpoints: change from baseline in ACQ7 score,
percent change from baseline in FEVI, and percent change from baseline in IgE. All endpoints
were evaluated at Week 24. Since all association tests evaluated the hypothesis of an additive
allelic effect (i.e., that the mean response among heterozygotes is intermediate to those of the
                                                 - 55 -

     WO 2015/155710                                                             PCT/IB2015/052551
two homozygous classes), Table 6 shows the effect of one additional copy of the minor allele
(i.e., less common allele in this sample) on each of these 3 endpoints. For example, under the
additive model, carrying one additional copy of the minor allele at rs8832 -- whether carrying 1
copy instead of 0, of 2 copies instead of 1 -- is associated with a mean increase from baseline in
FEVI of 7.6%. Thus, carrying 2 copies instead of 0 is associated with a mean increase of 15.2%.
The corresponding results for the asthma exacerbation endpoint are also provided for
comparison. In this case the effect size represents the odds ratio associated with one additional
copy of the minor allele. Hence, carrying one additional copy of the minor allele at rs8832 is
associated with 3.8-fold increase in the odds of experiencing an exacerbation. Since odds ratios
are multiplicative, carrying 2 copies instead of 0 is associated with a 3.8 2, or 14.6-fold increase in
odds of experiencing an exacerbation.
No SNPs attained or approached statistical significance for the ACQ7 or IgE endpoints, even
without any adjustment for multiple testing.           For the FEVI endpoint, 4 SNPs attained
significance, including a cluster of 3 SNPs with p<0.002 (rs8832, rs1029489, and rs4787956).
However, the effect of these 3 SNPs on response to ANTIBODY 01951/G12 was in the opposite
direction of that observed for asthma exacerbations: specifically, for each of the 3 SNPs the
minor (less common in the sample) allele was associated with higher risk of exacerbation but
also with a mean increase from baseline in FEVI.           Another SNP, rs1 110470, also attained
borderline significance, but also in the opposite direction of that observed for exacerbations, and
no other SNPs in its neighborhood attained or approached significance.

Permutation test to evaluate overall significance of exacerbation associations A permutation test
was performed to evaluate how likely it would be to obtain association results similar to the
ANTIBODY 01951/G12 exacerbation results if there were actually no association between the
SNPs and exacerbation risk - i.e., as an artifact of random chance. Of particular interest was the
finding that for each of the top 7 SNPs listed in Table 5, the ANTIBODY 01951/G12 analysis
yielded one homozygous class in which there were no exacerbations; therefore, the permutation
test was focused on how often this would be expected to occur by random chance. Among 1000
permuted datasets generated, only 2 yielded a result in which each of the 7 SNIPs had one
homozygous class with no exacerbations. Hence the probability of observing this result if there
were no true associations was estimated to be 0.002.

                          Linkage disequilibrium analysis of the SNPs
Alleles that are located near each other on a chromosome tend to be inherited together. When
these alleles also have similar population frequencies, they are likely to be correlated with each
other, such that knowing a subject's genotype at a given SNP can enable one to predict the same
subject's genotype at a nearby SNP with relatively high accuracy. This concept is referred to as
"linkage disequilibrium" (LD). The relevance to genetic association studies is that multiple
SNPs in a small region may show evidence of association with a phenotype; however, because
these SNPs may be in LD with each other, any given SNP may not provide a substantial amount
of independent evidence of association with the phenotype beyond that already obtained from
other nearby SNPs.
LD is known to occur in a "block" structure throughout the genome. Each block, or "cluster",
contains a group of SNPs such that the correlations between pairs of SNPs within the same block
are relatively high whereas the correlations between pairs of SNPs in different blocks are
relatively low. An analysis of LD between the top 7 SNPs listed in Table 5 and ANTIBODY
01951/G12 exacerbation risk revealed the presence of 2 LD blocks, as illustrated in Figure 4.
The numerical values in the cell represent the r 2 value (multiplied by 100), a standard measure of
correlation - or strength of LD - between the corresponding pair of SNPs. An r 2 value of 100
indicates that 2 SNPs are perfectly correlated, while 0 indicates complete independence.
As can be seen from the figure, the first 4 SNPs form one block, within which correlations
between pairs of SNPs range from 56 to 95.             SNPs rs3024530 and rs1805010 are almost
perfectly correlated. The last 3 SNPs form the second block, with pairwise correlations ranging
from 59 to 80. In contrast, no SNP from the first block shows high correlation with any SNP
from the second block, the highest pairwise correlation being 32.
Cross-validation analysis to assess optimal number of SNPs for prediction
A cross-validation analysis was conducted to compare strategies for utilizing the 6 of the top 7
IL4-Ra SNPs listed in Table 5 (rs3024530 was excluded because it was nearly perfectly
correlated with rs 1805010) to predict a patient's risk of asthma exacerbation after treatment with
ANTIBODY 01951/G12.          Because the LD analysis identified 2 largely independent blocks of
                                                - 58 -

SNPs that each show evidence of association with exacerbation risk, it is reasonable to expect
that a predictive model with representation from both blocks would likely have greater ability to
identify patients at low risk of exacerbation than one with representation from only one block.
However, this raised the question of whether it would be sufficient to select only one SNP from
each block or whether it would be beneficial to include additional SNPs. The cross-validation
analysis showed that the expected ability of a predictive model to identify patients at low risk of
asthma exacerbation would not improve substantially if additional SNPs were included beyond
one from each block.

The 7 top SNPs listed in Table 5 were found in this study to associate with exacerbation risk
among patients treated with ANTIBODY 01951/G12. Six of the 7 SNPs yielded significant p
values ranging from 0.005 to 0.015, while the remaining SNP approached significance.            The
same p-values were obtained when the analysis was restricted to Caucasian patients to mitigate
the risk of confounding.          Moreover, the particular pattern of association with response to
ANTIBODY 01951/G12 with most SNPs exhibited an additive relationship with exacerbation
risk; i.e., the risk within heterozygotes was observed to be intermediate to that within the 2
homozygous classes.           Finally, it was observed that among ANTIBODY 01951/G12-treated
patients each of the 7 SNPs had a particular homozygous class in which there were no
exacerbations.        A permutation test showed that the probability of observing this result in the
absence of any true associations is 0.002. Taken together, along with the importance of the IL4
Ra gene to the mechanism of ANTIBODY 01951/G12, these results suggest a strong likelihood
that the risk of asthma exacerbations in patients treated with ANTIBODY 01951/G12 is
influenced by SNPs in the IL4-Ra gene.
In addition, the two other SNPs in the IL4-Ra gene (listed as bottom two SNPs in Table 5) were
evaluated for possible association with exacerbation risk in ANTIBODY 01951/G12-treated
patients because of their reported association with asthma disease phenotypes and because they
code for amino acid changes.            Although, both were less significant than the other 7 SNPs
(p=O.091 and 0.10).
No evidence was found for association between SNPs in the IL4-Ra gene and exacerbation risk
among patients treated with placebo in the ANTIBODY 01951/G12 study. Taken together with
knowledge of the ANTIBODY 01951/G12 mechanism, this suggests that the influence of these
SNPs on exacerbation risk is specific to the drug mechanism and is not reflective of a more
                                                   - 61 -

general disease severity association. Moreover, no evidence was found for association between
these SNPs and change from baseline in ACQ7 score or IgE level, and only a few SNPs were
significantly associated with change in FEVI, with these associations pointing in the opposite
direction of that seen for exacerbation risk.           This suggests that the genetic mechanism
influencing patient's susceptibility to exacerbations is different from that for other asthma
endpoints.
The strong evidence for this pharmacogenetic association among ANTIBODY 01951/G12
treated patients suggests the use of particular genotypes or combination of genotypes at these
SNPs to predict a patient's risk of asthma exacerbation after treatment with ANTIBODY
01951/G12.
As shown in Table 5, rs1805010 causes an amino acid substitution, while rs8832 is in the 3'
untranslated region (UTR), a region known to influence gene transcription levels.               Since
rs1805010 lies in the first LD block while rs8832 lies in the second, these 2 SNPs are useful in
developing a predictive model for exacerbation risk. The cross-tabulated genotype frequencies
for these 2 SNPs in the CQAX576A2207 study are shown in Table 9.
