                                                FIELD OF THE INVENTION

   comprising an antibody.

                                                       BACKGROUND
   [0003]                      In the past years, advances in biotechnology have made it possible to produce
   a variety of proteins for pharmaceutical applications using recombinant DNA techniques.
   Because proteins are larger and more complex than traditional organic and inorganic drugs
15 (e.g., possessing multiple functional groups in addition to complex three-dimensional
   structures), the formulation of such proteins poses special problems. For a protein to remain
   biologically active, a formulation must preserve intact the conformational integrity of at least
   a core sequence of the protein's amino acids while at the same time protecting the protein's
   multiple functional groups from degradation. Degradation pathways for proteins can involve
20 chemical instability (e.g., any process which involves modification of the protein by bond
   formation or cleavage resulting in a new chemical entity) or physical instability (e.g., changes
   in the higher order structure of the protein). Chemical instability can result from deamidation,
   racemization, hydrolysis, oxidation, beta elimination or disulfide exchange. Physical
   instability can result from denaturation, aggregation, precipitation or adsorption, for example.
25 The three most common protein degradation pathways are protein aggregation, deamidation
   and oxidation. Cleland et al CriticalReviews in TherapeuticDrug CarrierSystems 10(4):
   307-377 (1993).
   [0004]                      Included in the proteins used for pharmaceutical applications are antibodies.
   An example of an antibody useful for therapy is an antibody which binds to anti-VEGF.
30 There is a need in the art for a stable aqueous pharmaceutical formulation comprising an
   antibody, such as an anti-VEGF antibody, which is suitable for therapeutic use.
                                                                1

                                             DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   I.           Definitions
   [0022a]                     In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except
   where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the
30 word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive
   sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or
   addition of further features in various embodiments of the invention.
                                                                14
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   [0023]                      Before describing the invention in detail, it is to be understood that this
   invention is not limited to particular compositions or biological systems, which can, of
   course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of
 5 describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. As used in this
   specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an" and "the" include plural
   referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a
   molecule" optionally includes a combination of two or more such molecules, and the like.
   [0024]                      The term "pharmaceutical formulation" refers to a preparation which is in such
10 form as to permit the biological activity of the active ingredient to be effective, and which
   contains no additional components which are unacceptably toxic to a subject to which the
   formulation would be administered. Such formulations are sterile. "Pharmaceutically
   acceptable" excipients (vehicles, additives) are those which can reasonably be administered
   to a subject mammal to provide an effective dose of the active ingredient employed.
15 [0025]                      A "sterile" formulation is asceptic or free or essentially free from all living
   microorganisms and their spores.
   [0026]                      Herein, a "frozen" formulation is one at a temperature below 0oC. Generally,
   the frozen formulation is not freeze-dried, nor is it subjected to prior, or subsequent,
   lyophilization. In certain embodiments, the frozen formulation comprises frozen drug
20 substance for storage (in stainless steel tank) or frozen drug product (in final vial
   configuration).
   [0027]                      A "stable" formulation is one in which the protein therein essentially retains
   its physical stability and/or chemical stability and/or biological activity upon storage.
   Preferably, the formulation essentially retains its physical and chemical stability, as well as
25 its biological activity upon storage. The storage period is generally selected based on the
   intended shelf-life of the formulation. Various analytical techniques for measuring protein
   stability are available in the art and are reviewed in Peptide and ProteinDrug Delivery, 247
   301, Vincent Lee Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., Pubs. (1991) and Jones, A. Adv.
   DrugDelivery Rev. 10: 29-90 (1993), for example. Stability can be measured at a selected
30 temperature for a selected time period. In certain embodiments, the formulation is stable at
   about 40C for at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 21, 28, or more days. In certain
   embodiments, the formulation is stable at about 40C for at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or
                                                               15

   more weeks. In certain embodiments, the formulation is stable at about 25'C for at least 1, 2,
   3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or more months. In
   certain embodiments, the formulation is stable at about 5oC for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, 9,
    10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or more months. In certain
 5 embodiments, the formulation is stable at about -20'C for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10,
    11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,
   36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, or more months. In certain embodiments,
   the formulation is stable at 5'C or -20'C for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
    15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,
10 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, or more months. Furthermore, the formulation is preferably
   stable following freezing (to, e.g., -20'C or -70'C) and thawing of the formulation, for
   example following 1, 2 3, 4, or 5 cycles of freezing and thawing. Stability can be evaluated
   qualitatively and/or quantitatively in a variety of different ways, including evaluation of
   aggregate formation (for example using size exclusion chromatography, by measuring
15 turbidity, and/or by visual inspection); by assessing charge heterogeneity using cation
   exchange chromatography, image capillary isoelectric focusing (icIEF) or capillary zone
   electrophoresis; amino-terminal or carboxy-terminal sequence analysis; mass spectrometric
   analysis; SDS-PAGE analysis to compare reduced and intact antibody; peptide map (for
   example tryptic or LYS-C) analysis; evaluating biological activity or antigen binding
20 function of the antibody; etc. Instability may involve any one or more of: aggregation,
   deamidation (e.g. Asn deamidation), oxidation (e.g. Met oxidation), isomerization (e.g. Asp
   isomeriation), clipping/hydrolysis/fragmentation (e.g. hinge region fragmentation),
   succinimide formation, unpaired cysteine(s), N-terminal extension, C-terminal processing,
   glycosylation differences, etc.
25 [0028]                      A protein "retains its physical stability" in a pharmaceutical formulation if it
   shows no signs or very little of aggregation, precipitation and/or denaturation upon visual
   examination of color and/or clarity, or as measured by UV light scattering or by size
   exclusion chromatography.
   [0029]                      A protein "retains its chemical stability" in a pharmaceutical formulation, if
30 the chemical stability at a given time is such that the protein is considered to still retain its
   biological activity as defined below. Chemical stability can be assessed by detecting and
   quantifying chemically altered forms of the protein. Chemical alteration may involve size
                                                                16

   modification (e.g. clipping) which can be evaluated using size exclusion chromatography,
   SDS-PAGE and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (MALDI/TOF MS), for example. Other types of chemical alteration include
   charge alteration (e.g. occurring as a result of deamidation) which can be evaluated by ion
 5 exchange chromatography or icIEF, for example.
   [0030]                      An antibody "retains its biological activity" in a pharmaceutical formulation, if
   the biological activity of the antibody at a given time is within about 10% (within the errors
   of the assay) of the biological activity exhibited at the time the pharmaceutical formulation
   was prepared as determined in an antigen binding assay, for example. Other "biological
10 activity" assays for antibodies are elaborated herein below.
   [0031]                      Herein, "biological activity" of a monoclonal antibody refers to the ability of
   the antibody to bind to antigen. It can further include antibody binding to antigen and
   resulting in a measurable biological response which can be measured in vitro or in vivo. Such
   activity may be antagonistic or agonistic.
15 [0032]                      A "deamidated" monoclonal antibody herein is one in which one or more
   asparagine residue thereof has been derivitized, e.g. to an aspartic acid or an iso-aspartic acid.
   [0033]                      An antibody which is "susceptible to deamidation" is one comprising one or
   more residue which has been found to be prone to deamidate.
   [0034]                      An antibody which is "susceptible to aggregation" is one which has been
20 found to aggregate with other antibody molecule(s), especially upon freezing and/or
   agitation.
   [0035]                      An antibody which is "susceptible to fragmentation" is one which has been
   found to be cleaved into two or more fragments, for example at a hinge region thereof.
   [0036]                      By "reducing deamidation, aggregation, or fragmentation" is intended

   the monoclonal antibody formulated at a different pH or in a different buffer.
   [0037]                      The antibody which is formulated is preferably essentially pure and desirably
   essentially homogeneous (e.g., free from contaminating proteins etc). "Essentially pure"

   [0038]                      By "isotonic" is meant that the formulation of interest has essentially the same
   osmotic pressure as human blood. Isotonic formulations will generally have an osmotic
   pressure from about 250 to 350 mOsm. Isotonicity can be measured using a vapor pressure or
   ice-freezing type osmometer, for example.
 5 [0039]                      As used herein, "buffer" refers to a buffered solution that resists changes in pH
   by the action of its acid-base conjugate components. The buffer of this invention preferably
   has a pH in the range from about 4.5 to about 7.0, preferably from about 4.5 to about 6.5, for
   example from 4.5 to 6.0, 4.5 to 5.9. 4.5 to 5.8, 4.5 to 5.7, 4.5 to 5.6, 4.5 to 5.5, 4.5 to 5.6, 4.5

   5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, or 6.0. Examples of buffers that will control the pH in this range
   include acetate, succinate, succinate, gluconate, histidine, citrate, glycylglycine and other
   organic acid buffers.
   [0040]                      An "arginine buffer" is a buffer comprising arginine ions. Examples of
15 arginine buffers include arginine acetate, arginine chloride, arginine phosphate, arginine
   sulfate, arginine succinate, etc. In one embodiment, the arginine buffer is arginine acetate. In
   the one embodiment, the arginine acetate buffer is prepared by titrating L- arginine (free
   base, solid) with acetic acid (liquid). In certain embodiments, the arginine buffer is at pH 4.5
   to 6.0, 4.5 to 5.9. 4.5 to 5.8, 4.5 to 5.7, 4.5 to 5.6, 4.5 to 5.5, 4.5 to 5.6, 4.5 to 5.5, 4.5 to 5.4,

   one embodiment the buffer has a pH 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.8, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7,
   5.8, 5.9, or 6.0.
   [0041]                      Herein, a "surfactant" refers to a surface-active agent, preferably a nonionic
   surfactant. Examples of surfactants herein include polysorbate (for example, polysorbate 20
25 and, polysorbate 80); poloxamer (e.g. poloxamer 188); Triton; sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS);
   sodium laurel sulfate; sodium octyl glycoside; lauryl-, myristyl-, linoleyl-, or stearyl
   sulfobetaine; lauryl-, myristyl-, linoleyl- or stearyl-sarcosine; linoleyl-, myristyl-, or cetyl

   disodium methyl oleyl-taurate; and the MONAQUATTM series (Mona Industries, Inc.,
   Paterson, N.J.); polyethyl glycol, polypropyl glycol, and copolymers of ethylene and
                                                                18

   propylene glycol (e.g. Pluronics, PF68 etc); etc. In one embodiment, the surfactant herein is
   polysorbate 20.
   [0042]                      In a pharmacological sense, in the context of the invention, a "therapeutically
   effective amount" of an antibody refers to an amount effective in the prevention or treatment
 5 of a disorder for the treatment of which the antibody is effective. A "disorder" is any
   condition that would benefit from treatment with the antibody. This includes chronic and
   acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the
   mammal to the disorder in question.
   [0043]                      A "preservative" is a compound which can be optionally included in the
10 formulation to essentially reduce bacterial action therein, thus facilitating the production of a
   multi-use formulation, for example. Examples of potential preservatives include
   octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, hexamethonium chloride, benzalkonium
   chloride (a mixture of alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chlorides in which the alkyl groups
   are long-chain compounds), and benzethonium chloride. Other types of preservatives include
15 aromatic alcohols such as phenol, butyl and benzyl alcohol, alkyl parabens such as methyl or
   propyl paraben, catechol, resorcinol, cyclohexanol, 3-pentanol, and m-cresol. In one
   embodiment, the preservative herein is benzyl alcohol.
   [0044]                      A "polyol" is a substance with multiple hydroxyl groups, and includes sugars
   (reducing and nonreducing sugars), sugar alcohols and sugar acids. A polyol may optionally
20 be included in the formulation. In certain embodiments, polyols herein have a molecular
   weight which is less than about 600 kD (e.g. in the range from about 120 to about 400 kD). A
   "reducing sugar" is one which contains a hemiacetal group that can reduce metal ions or react
   covalently with lysine and other amino groups in proteins and a "nonreducing sugar" is one
   which does not have these properties of a reducing sugar. Examples of reducing sugars are
25 fructose, mannose, maltose, lactose, arabinose, xylose, ribose, rhamnose, galactose and
   glucose. Nonreducing sugars include sucrose, trehalose, sorbose, melezitose and raffinose.
   Mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, threitol, sorbitol and glycerol are examples of sugar alcohols. As
   to sugar acids, these include L-gluconate and metallic salts thereof. Where it desired that the
   formulation is freeze-thaw stable, the polyol is preferably one which does not crystallize at
30 freezing temperatures (e.g. -20 0 C) such that it destabilizes the antibody in the formulation. In
   certain embodiments, nonreducing sugars such as sucrose and trehalose are examples of
                                                              19

   polyols, with trehalose being preferred over sucrose, because of the solution stability of
   trehalose.
   [0045]                      The term "VEGF"or "VEGF-A" as used herein refers to the 165-amino acid
   human vascular endothelial cell growth factor and related 121-, 189-, and 206- amino acid
 5 human vascular endothelial cell growth factors, as described by Leung et al. (1989) Science
   246:1306, and Houck et al. (1991) Mol. Endocrin, 5:1806, together with the naturally
   occurring allelic and processed forms thereof. The term "VEGF" also refers to VEGFs from
   non-human species such as mouse, rat or primate. Sometimes the VEGF from a specific
   species are indicated by terms such as hVEGF for human VEGF, mVEGF for murine VEGF,
10 and etc. The term "VEGF" is also used to refer to truncated forms of the polypeptide
   comprising amino acids 8 to 109 or 1 to 109 of the 165-amino acid human vascular
   endothelial cell growth factor. Reference to any such forms of VEGF may be identified in
   the present application, e.g., by "VEGF (8-109)," "VEGF (1-109)" or "VEGF1 6 5 ." The
   amino acid positions for a "truncated" native VEGF are numbered as indicated in the native
15 VEGF sequence. For example, amino acid position 17 (methionine) in truncated native
   VEGF is also position 17 (methionine) in native VEGF. The truncated native VEGF has
   binding affinity for the KDR and Flt-1 receptors comparable to native VEGF.
   [0046]                      "VEGF biological activity" includes binding to any VEGF receptor or any
   VEGF signaling activity such as regulation of both normal and abnormal angiogenesis and
20 vasculogenesis (Ferrara and Davis-Smyth (1997) EndocrineRev. 18:4-25; Ferrara (1999) J
   Mol. Med. 77:527-543); promoting embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (Carmeliet
   et al. (1996) Nature 380:435-439; Ferrara et al. (1996) Nature 380:439-442); and
   modulating the cyclical blood vessel proliferation in the female reproductive tract and for
   bone growth and cartilage formation (Ferrara et al. (1998) Nature Med. 4:336-340; Gerber
25 et al. (1999) Nature Med. 5:623-628). In addition to being an angiogenic factor in
   angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, VEGF, as a pleiotropic growth factor, exhibits multiple
   biological effects in other physiological processes, such as endothelial cell survival, vessel
   permeability and vasodilation, monocyte chemotaxis and calcium influx (Ferrara and
   Davis-Smyth (1997), supra and Cebe-Suarez et al. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 63:601-615 (2006)).
30 Moreover, recent studies have reported mitogenic effects of VEGF on a few non
   endothelial cell types, such as retinal pigment epithelial cells, pancreatic duct cells, and
   Schwann cells. Guerrin et al. (1995) J Cell Physiol. 164:385-394; Oberg-Welsh et al.

   [0047]                      A "VEGF antagonist" or "VEGF-specific antagonist" refers to a molecule
   capable of binding to VEGF, reducing VEGF expression levels, or neutralizing, blocking,
 5 inhibiting, abrogating, reducing, or interfering with VEGF biological activities, including, but
   not limited to, VEGF binding to one or more VEGF receptors and VEGF mediated
   angiogenesis and endothelial cell survival or proliferation. Included as VEGF-specific
   antagonists useful in the methods of the invention are polypeptides that specifically bind to
   VEGF, anti-VEGF antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, receptor molecules and
10 derivatives which bind specifically to VEGF thereby sequestering its binding to one or more
   receptors, fusions proteins (e.g., VEGF-Trap (Regeneron)), and VEGF121-gelonin
   (Peregrine). VEGF-specific antagonists also include antagonist variants of VEGF
   polypeptides, antisense nucleobase oligomers directed to VEGF, small RNA molecules
   directed to VEGF, RNA aptamers, peptibodies, and ribozymes against VEGF. VEGF
15 specific antagonists also include nonpeptide small molecules that bind to VEGF and are
   capable of blocking, inhibiting, abrogating, reducing, or interfering with VEGF biological
   activities. Thus, the term "VEGF activities" specifically includes VEGF mediated biological
   activities of VEGF. In certain embodiments, the VEGF antagonist reduces or inhibits, by at
   least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more, the expression level or
20 biological activity of VEGF.
   [0048]                      An "anti-VEGF antibody" is an antibody that binds to VEGF with sufficient
   affinity and specificity. In certain embodiments, the antibody selected will normally have a
   sufficiently binding affinity for VEGF, for example, the antibody may bind hVEGF with a               Kd
   value of between 100 nM-I pM. Antibody affinities may be determined by a surface
25 plasmon resonance based assay (such as the BlAcore assay as described in PCT Application
   Publication No. W02005/012359); enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA); and
   competition assays (e.g. RIA' s), for example.
   [0049]                      In certain embodiment, the anti-VEGF antibody can be used as a therapeutic
   agent in targeting and interfering with diseases or conditions wherein the VEGF activity is
30 involved. Also, the antibody may be subjected to other biological activity assays, e.g., in
   order to evaluate its effectiveness as a therapeutic. Such assays are known in the art and
   depend on the target antigen and intended use for the antibody. Examples include the
                                                             21

   HUVEC inhibition assay; tumor cell growth inhibition assays (as described in WO 89/06692,
   for example); antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated
   cytotoxicity (CDC) assays (US Patent 5,500,362); and agonistic activity or hematopoiesis
   assays (see WO 95/27062). An anti-VEGF antibody will usually not bind to other VEGF
 5 homologues such as VEGF-B or VEGF-C, nor other growth factors such as PlGF, PDGF or
   bFGF. In one embodiment, anti-VEGF antibody is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the
   same epitope as the monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody A4.6.1 produced by hybridoma ATCC
   HB 10709. In another embodiment, the anti-VEGF antibody is a recombinant humanized
   anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody generated according to Presta et al. (1997) CancerRes.
10 57:4593-4599, including but not limited to the antibody known as bevacizumab (BV;
   AVASTIN*).
   [0050]                      The anti-VEGF antibody "Bevacizumab (BV)," also known as "rhuMAb
   VEGF" or "AVASTIN*," is a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody
   generated according to Presta et al. (1997) CancerRes. 57:4593-4599. It comprises
15 mutated human IgGI framework regions and antigen-binding complementarity-determining
   regions from the murine anti-hVEGF monoclonal antibody A.4.6.1 that blocks binding of
   human VEGF to its receptors. Approximately 93% of the amino acid sequence of
   Bevacizumab, including most of the framework regions, is derived from human IgG 1, and
   about 7% of the sequence is derived from the murine antibody A4.6. 1. Bevacizumab has a
20 molecular mass of about 149,000 daltons and is glycosylated. Bevacizumab and other
   humanized anti-VEGF antibodies are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,884,879 issued Feb.

   in Liang et al., JBiol Chem 281, 951-961 (2006).
   [0055]                      "Treatment" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or
   preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as
20 well as those in which the disorder is to be prevented.
   [0056]                            A "disorder" is any condition that would benefit from treatment including,
   but not limited to, chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological
   conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Disorders include
   angiogenic disorders. "Angiogenic disorder" as used herein refers to any condition involving
25 abnormal angiogenesis or abnormal vascular permeability or leakage. Non-limiting examples
   of angiogenic disorders to be treated herein include malignant and benign tumors; non
   leukemias and lymphoid malignancies; and, in particular, tumor (cancer) metastasis.
   [0057]                            "Abnormal angiogenesis" occurs when new blood vessels grow either
   excessively or otherwise inappropriately (e.g., the location, timing, degree, or onset of the
30 angiogenesis being undesired from a medical standpoint) in a diseased state or such that it
   causes a diseased state. In some cases, excessive, uncontrolled, or otherwise inappropriate
   angiogenesis occurs when there is new blood vessel growth that contributes to the worsening
                                                                23
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   of the diseased state or cause of a diseased state. The new blood vessels can feed the
   diseased tissues, destroy normal tissues, and in the case of cancer, the new vessels can allow
   tumor cells to escape into the circulation and lodge in other organs (tumor metastases).
   Examples of disorders involving abnormal angiogenesis include, but are not limited to
 5 cancer, especially vascularized solid tumors and metastatic tumors (including colon, lung
   cancer (especially small-cell lung cancer), or prostate cancer), diseases caused by ocular
   neovascularisation, especially diabetic blindness, retinopathies, primarily diabetic retinopathy
   or age-related macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), diabetic macular
   edema, pathological myopia, von Hippel-Lindau disease, histoplasmosis of the eye, Central
10 Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO), comeal neovascularization, retinal neovascularization and
   rubeosis; psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, haemangioblastoma such as haemangioma;
   inflammatory renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, especially mesangioproliferative
   glomerulonephritis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive
   nephrosclerosis; various imflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, especially rheumatoid
15 arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psorsasis, sarcoidosis, arterial arteriosclerosis and
   diseases occurring after transplants, endometriosis or chronic asthma and other conditions.
   [0058]                            "Abnormal vascular permeability" occurs when the flow of fluids,
   molecules (e.g., ions and nutrients) and cells (e.g., lymphocytes) between the vascular and
   extravascular compartments is excessive or otherwise inappropriate (e.g., the location,
20 timing, degree, or onset of the vascular permeability being undesired from a medical
   standpoint) in a diseased state or such that it causes a diseased state. Abnormal vascular
   permeability may lead to excessive or otherwise inappropriate "leakage" of ions, water,
   nutrients, or cells through the vasculature. In some cases, excessive, uncontrolled, or
   otherwise inappropriate vascular permeability or vascular leakage exacerbates or induces
25 disease states including, e.g., edema associated with tumors including, e.g., brain tumors;
   ascites associated with malignancies; Meigs' syndrome; lung inflammation; nephrotic
   syndrome; pericardial effusion; pleural effusion,; permeability associated with cardiovascular
   diseases such as the condition following myocardial infarctions and strokes and the like. The
   present invention contemplates treating those patients that have developed or are at risk of
30 developing the diseases and disorders associated with abnormal vascular permeability or
   leakage.

   [0064]                            An "anti-angiogenic agent" or "angiogenic inhibitor" refers to a small
   molecular weight substance, a polynucleotide (including, e.g., an inhibitory RNA (RNAi or
15 siRNA)), a polypeptide, an isolated protein, a recombinant protein, an antibody, or
   conjugates or fusion proteins thereof, that inhibits angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, or
   undesirable vascular permeability, either directly or indirectly. It should be understood that
   the anti-angiogenic agent includes those agents that bind and block the angiogenic activity of
   the angiogenic factor or its receptor. For example, an anti-angiogenic agent is an antibody or
20 other antagonist to an angiogenic agent as defined above, e.g., antibodies to VEGF-A or to
   the VEGF-A receptor (e.g., KDR receptor or Flt-1 receptor), anti-PDGFR inhibitors, small

   [0070]                            A "growth inhibitory agent" when used herein refers to a compound or
   composition which inhibits growth of a cell either in vitro or in vivo. In one embodiment,
   growth inhibitory agent is growth inhibitory antibody that prevents or reduces proliferation of
   a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibody binds. In another embodiment, the growth
 5 inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells in S phase.
   Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression (at a
   place other than S phase), such as agents that induce GI arrest and M-phase arrest. Classical
   M-phase blockers include the vincas (vincristine and vinblastine), taxanes, and topoisomerase
   II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Those
10 agents that arrest GI also spill over into S-phase arrest, for example, DNA alkylating agents
   such as tamoxifen, prednisone, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 5
   fluorouracil, and ara-C. Further information can be found in Mendelsohn and Israel, eds.,
   The Molecular Basis of Cancer, Chapter 1, entitled "Cell cycle regulation, oncogenes, and
   antineoplastic drugs" by Murakami et al. (W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, 1995), e.g., p. 13.
15 The taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree.
   Docetaxel (TAXOTERE@, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer), derived from the European yew, is a
   semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel (TAXOL@, Bristol-Myers Squibb). Paclitaxel and
   docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize
   microtubules by preventing depolymerization, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in
20 cells.
   [0071]                            By "radiation therapy" is meant the use of directed gamma rays or beta
   rays to induce sufficient damage to a cell so as to limit its ability to function normally or to
   destroy the cell altogether. It will be appreciated that there will be many ways known in the
   art to determine the dosage and duration of treatment. Typical treatments are given as a one
25 time administration and typical dosages range from 10 to 200 units (Grays) per day.
   [0072]                      "Mammal" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a
   mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such
   as dogs, horses, cats, cows, etc. Preferably, the mammal is human.
   [0073]                      The term "antibody" herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically
30 covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal

   [0074]                      An "isolated" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or
   recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its
   natural environment are materials which would interfere with research, diagnostic or
   therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other
 5 proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In some embodiments, an antibody is purified (1)
   to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method,
   and in some embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain
   at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of, for example, a
   spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or
10 nonreducing conditions using, for example, Coomassie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody
   includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the
   antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody
   will be prepared by at least one purification step.
   [0075]                      "Native antibodies" are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about
15  150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H)
   chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the
   number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin
   isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges.
   Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant
20 domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its
   other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of
   the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of
   the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the
   light chain and heavy chain variable domains.
25 [0076]                      The term "constant domain" refers to the portion of an immunoglobulin
   molecule having a more conserved amino acid sequence relative to the other portion of the
   immunoglobulin, the variable domain, which contains the antigen binding site. The constant
   domain contains the CHI,               CH2  and CH3 domains (collectively, CH) of the heavy chain and
   the CHL (or CL) domain of the light chain.
30 [0077]                      The "variable region" or "variable domain" of an antibody refers to the amino
   terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domain of the
   heavy chain may be referred to as "VH." The variable domain of the light chain may be
                                                              33
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   referred to as "VL." These domains are generally the most variable parts of an antibody and
   contain the antigen-binding sites.
   [0078]                      The term "variable" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable
   domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and
 5 specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is
   not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in
   three segments called hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy
   chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called
   the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each
10 comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three
   HVRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet
   structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions
   and, with the HVRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding
   site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteins ofImmunological Interest, Fifth
15 Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991)). The constant domains are not
   involved directly in the binding of an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector
   functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.
   [0079]                      The "light chains" of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate
   species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa ():and la mbda ()
20 based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.
   [0080]                      The term IgG "isotype: or "subclass" as used herein is meant any of the
   subclasses of immunoglobulins defined by the chemical and antigenic characteristics of their
   constant regions.
   [0081]                      Depending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domains of their
25 heavy chains, antibodies (immunoglobulins) can be assigned to different classes. There are
   five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these
   may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgGI, IgG 2 , IgG 3 , IgG 4 , IgA1, and
   IgA 2 . The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of
   immunoglobulins are called a, 6, E, y, and p, respectively. The subunit structures and three
30 dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known and
   described generally in, for example, Abbas et al. Cellularand Mol. Immunology, 4th ed.
   (W.B. Saunders, Co., 2000). An antibody may be part of a larger fusion molecule, formed by
                                                               34

   covalent or non-covalent association of the antibody with one or more other proteins or
   peptides.
   [0082]                      The terms "full length antibody," "intact antibody" and "whole antibody" are
   used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, not
 5 antibody fragments as defined below. The terms particularly refer to an antibody with heavy
   chains that contain an Fc region.
   [0083]                      A "naked antibody" for the purposes herein is an antibody that is not
   conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.
   [0084]                      "Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably
10 comprising the antigen binding region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab,
   Fab', F(ab') 2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody
   molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.
   [0085]                      Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding
   fragments, called "Fab" fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual
15 "Fc" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields
   an F(ab' ) fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking
   antigen.
   [0086]                      "Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen
   binding site. In one embodiment, a two-chain Fv species consists of a dimer of one heavy
20 and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv
   (scFv) species, one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a
   flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a "dimeric"
   structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three
   HVRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the
25 VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six HVRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody.
   However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs
   specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower
   affinity than the entire binding site.
   [0087]                      The Fab fragment contains the heavy- and light-chain variable domains and
30 also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CHI) of
   the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues
   at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CHI domain including one or more cysteines
                                                              35
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the
   cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab' ) antibody
   fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines
   between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.
 5 [0088]                      "Single-chain Fv" or "scFv" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL
   domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain.
   Generally, the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and
   VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a
   review of scFv, see, e.g., Pluckthin, in The PharmacologyofMonoclonal Antibodies, vol.
10  113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1994), pp. 269-315.
   [0089]                      The term "diabodies" refers to antibody fragments with two antigen-binding
   sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light
   chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH-VL). By using a linker that
   is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are
15 forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen
   binding sites. Diabodies may be bivalent or bispecific. Diabodies are described more fully
   in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 1993/01161; Hudson et al., Nat. Med. 9:129-134 (2003);
   and Hollinger et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993). Triabodies and
   tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al., Nat. Med. 9:129-134 (2003).
20 [0090]                      The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained
   from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, e.g., the individual antibodies
   comprising the population are identical except for possible mutations, e.g., naturally
   occurring mutations, that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier
   "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete
25 antibodies. In certain embodiments, such a monoclonal antibody typically includes an
   antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target, wherein the target-binding
   polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target
   binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example, the
   selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones, such as a
30 pool of hybridoma clones, phage clones, or recombinant DNA clones. It should be
   understood that a selected target binding sequence can be further altered, for example, to
   improve affinity for the target, to humanize the target binding sequence, to improve its
                                                              36
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   production in cell culture, to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo, to create a multispecific
   antibody, etc., and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a
   monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations,
   which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants
 5 (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed
   against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity, monoclonal
   antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other
   immunoglobulins.
   [0091]                      The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being
10 obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be
   construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the
   monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the invention may be made by a variety
   of techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler and Milstein,

   [0092]                      The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies
   in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to
   corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a
   particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or
 5 homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or
   belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so
   long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (see, e.g.,U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; and
   Morrison et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies
   include PRIMATIZED@ antibodies wherein the antigen-binding region of the antibody is
10 derived from an antibody produced by, e.g., immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen
   of interest.
   [0093]                      "Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric
   antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In one
   embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in
15 which residues from a HVR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a HVR of a non
   human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit, or nonhuman primate having the
   desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity. In some instances, FR residues of the human
   immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore,
   humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or
20 in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody
   performance. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one,
   and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable
   loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the
   FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally
25 will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that
   of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see, e.g., Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525
   (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol.

   the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human
   antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding
   residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art,
   including phage-display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter, J Mol. Biol., 227:381 (1991);
 5 Marks et al., J Mol. Biol., 222:581 (1991). Also available for the preparation of human
   monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and
   Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985); Boemer et al., J Immunol., 147(1):86-95
   (1991). See also van Dijk and van de Winkel, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol., 5: 368-74 (2001).
   Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal that
10 has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge, but whose
   endogenous loci have been disabled, e.g., immunized xenomice (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos.
   6,075,181 and 6,150,584 regarding XENOMOUSETM technology). See also, for example, Li
   et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 103:3557-3562 (2006) regarding human antibodies
   generated via a human B-cell hybridoma technology.
15 [0095]                      A "species-dependent antibody" is one which has a stronger binding affinity
   for an antigen from a first mammalian species than it has for a homologue of that antigen
   from a second mammalian species. Normally, the species-dependent antibody "binds
   specifically" to a human antigen (e.g., has a binding affinity (Kd) value of no more than
   about 1 x 10-7 M, preferably no more than about 1 x 10-8 M and preferably no more than
20 about 1 x 10-9 M) but has a binding affinity for a homologue of the antigen from a second
   nonhuman mammalian species which is at least about 50 fold, or at least about 500 fold, or at
   least about 1000 fold, weaker than its binding affinity for the human antigen. The species
   dependent antibody can be any of the various types of antibodies as defined above, but
   preferably is a humanized or human antibody.
25 [0096]                      The term "hypervariable region," "HVR," or "HV," when used herein refers to
   the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form
   structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH (HI,
   H2, H3), and three in the VL (LI, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most
   diversity of the six HVRs, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring
30 fine specificity to antibodies. See, e.g., Xu et al., Immunity 13:37-45 (2000); Johnson and
   Wu, in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:1-25 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 2003).

   [0097]                      A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The
   Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and
 5 are the most commonly used (Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteins ofImmunological Interest,
   5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)). Chothia
   refers instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk J Mol. Biol. 196:901
   917 (1987)). The AbM HVRs represent a compromise between the Kabat HVRs and Chothia
   structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software. The
10 "contact" HVRs are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The
   residues from each of these HVRs are noted below.

25 56 or 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 or 89-96 (L3) in the VL and 26-35 (HI), 50-65 or 49-65 (H2) and
   93-102, 94-102, or 95-102 (H3) in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered
   according to Kabat et al., supra, for each of these definitions.
   [0099]                      "Framework" or "FR" residues are those variable domain residues other than
   the HVR residues as herein defined.
30 [0100]                      The term "variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat" or "amino acid
   position numbering as in Kabat," and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used
   for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of
                                                            40

   antibodies in Kabat et al., supra. Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid
   sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or
   insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable
   domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue
 5 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after
   heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given
   antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a
   "standard" Kabat numbered sequence.
   [0101]                      The Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in
10 the variable domain (approximately residues 1-107 of the light chain and residues 1-113 of
   the heavy chain) (e.g, Kabat et al., Sequences ofImmunologicalInterest. 5th Ed. Public
   Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The "EU numbering
   system" or "EU index" is generally used when referring to a residue in an immunoglobulin
   heavy chain constant region (e.g., the EU index reported in Kabat et al., supra). The "EU
15 index as in Kabat" refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody.
   [0102]                      The expression "linear antibodies" refers to the antibodies described in Zapata
   et al. (1995 ProteinEng, 8(10):1057-1062). Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of
   tandem Fd segments (VH-CH1-VH-CH1) which, together with complementary light chain
   polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or
20 monospecific.
   [0103]                      As used herein, "library" refers to a plurality of antibody or antibody fragment
   sequences (for example, polypeptides of the invention), or the nucleic acids that encode these
   sequences, the sequences being different in the combination of variant amino acids that are
   introduced into these sequences according to the methods of the invention.
25 [0104]                      "Phage display" is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as
   fusion proteins to at least a portion of coat protein on the surface of phage, e.g., filamentous
   phage, particles. A utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of randomized
   protein variants can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target
   antigen with high affinity. Display of peptide and protein libraries on phage has been used
30 for screening millions of polypeptides for ones with specific binding properties. Polyvalent
   phage display methods have been used for displaying small random peptides and small
   proteins through fusions to either gene III or gene VIII of filamentous phage. Wells and
                                                               41

   Lowman (1992) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 3:355-362, and references cited therein. In a
   monovalent phage display, a protein or peptide library is fused to a gene III or a portion
   thereof, and expressed at low levels in the presence of wild type gene III protein so that
   phage particles display one copy or none of the fusion proteins. Avidity effects are reduced
 5 relative to polyvalent phage so that sorting is on the basis of intrinsic ligand affinity, and
   phagemid vectors are used, which simplify DNA manipulations. Lowman and Wells (1991)
   Methods: A companion to Methods in Enzymology 3:205-0216.
   [0105]                      A "phagemid" is a plasmid vector having a bacterial origin of replication, e.g.,
   ColE1, and a copy of an intergenic region of a bacteriophage. The phagemid may be used on
10 any known bacteriophage, including filamentous bacteriophage and lambdoid bacteriophage.
   The plasmid will also generally contain a selectable marker for antibiotic resistance.
   Segments of DNA cloned into these vectors can be propagated as plasmids. When cells
   harboring these vectors are provided with all genes necessary for the production of phage
   particles, the mode of replication of the plasmid changes to rolling circle replication to
15 generate copies of one strand of the plasmid DNA and package phage particles. The
   phagemid may form infectious or non-infectious phage particles. This term includes
   phagemids which contain a phage coat protein gene or fragment thereof linked to a
   heterologous polypeptide gene as a gene fusion such that the heterologous polypeptide is
   displayed on the surface of the phage particle.

   [0109]                      In certain embodiments of the invention, the molecular targets for antibodies
   encompassed by the invention include VEGF. In one embodiment, the antibody herein is one
30 which binds to human VEGF.
                                                              43
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

                A. Preparation of the Formulation
   [0110]                      After preparation of the antibody of interest (e.g., techniques for producing
   antibodies which can be formulated as disclosed herein will be elaborated below and are
   known in the art), the pharmaceutical formulation comprising it is prepared. In certain
 5 embodiments, the antibody to be formulated has not been subjected to prior lyophilization
   and the formulation of interest herein is an aqueous formulation. In certain embodiments, the
   antibody is a full length antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody in the formulation is an
   antibody fragment, such as an F(ab')               2, in which case problems that may not occur for the full
   length antibody (such as clipping of the antibody to Fab) may need to be addressed. The
10 therapeutically effective amount of antibody present in the formulation is determined by
   taking into account the desired dose volumes and mode(s) of administration, for example.
   From about 0.1 mg/mL to about 250 mg/mL, or from about 10 mg/mL to about 200 mg/mL
   or from about 50 mg/mL to about 175 mg/mL is an exemplary antibody concentration in the
   formulation.
15 [0111]                      An aqueous formulation is prepared comprising the antibody in a pH-buffered
   solution. The buffer of this invention has a pH in the range from about 4.0 to about 6.5. In
   certain embodiments the pH is in the range from pH 4.25 to 6.25, or in the range from pH 4.5
   to 6.0, or in the range from pH 4.75 to 5.75, or in the range from pH 5.0 to 5.5, or in the
   range from pH 5.1 to 5.4. In certain embodiments of the invention, the formulation has a pH
20 of 5.2 or about 5.2. Examples of buffers that will control the pH within this range include
   acetate (e.g. arginine acetate or sodium acetate), succinate (such as arginine succinate or
   sodium succinate), gluconate, citrate and other organic acid buffers and combinations thereof.
   The buffer concentration can be from about 1 mM to about 600 mM, depending, for example,
   on the buffer and the desired isotonicity of the formulation. In certain embodiments, the
25 buffer contains arginine in the concentration of 50 mM to 500 mM, 75 mM to 400 mM, 100
   mM to 250 mM, 120 mM to 240 mM, 150 mM to 225 mM, or 175 mM to 210 mM. In
   certain embodiments of the invention, the buffer contains arginine in the concentration of 200
   mM or about 200 mM. In one embodiment, the buffer is arginine acetate (e.g., at 200 mM or
   about 200 mM), pH 5.2.
30 [0112]                      A surfactant can optionally be added to the antibody formulation. Exemplary
   surfactants include nonionic surfactants such as polysorbates (e.g. polysorbates 20, 80 etc) or
   poloxamers (e.g. poloxamer 188). The amount of surfactant added is such that it reduces
                                                               44
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   aggregation of the formulated antibody and/or minimizes the formation of particulates in the
   formulation and/or reduces adsorption. For example, the surfactant may be present in the
   formulation in an amount from about 0.001% to about 0.5%, from about 0.005% to about
   0.2% , from about 0.01% to about 0.1%, or from about 0.02% to about 0.06%, or about
 5 0.03% to about 0.05%. In certain embodiments, the surfactant is present in the formation in
   an amount of 0.04% or about 0.04%. In one embodiment, the formulation does not comprise
   a surfactant.
   [0113]                      In one embodiment, the formulation contains the above-identified agents (e.g.,
   antibody, buffer, and/or surfactant) and is essentially free of one or more preservatives, such
10 as benzyl alcohol, phenol, m-cresol, chlorobutanol and benzethonium Cl. In another
   embodiment, a preservative may be included in the formulation, particularly where the
   formulation is a multidose formulation. The concentration of preservative may be in the
   range from about 0.1% to about 2 %, preferably from about 0.5% to about 1%. One or more
   other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers such as those described in
15 Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980) may be included in
   the formulation provided that they do not adversely affect the desired characteristics of the
   formulation. Acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the
   dosages and concentrations employed and include; additional buffering agents; co-solvents;
   anti-oxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; chelating agents such as EDTA; metal
20 complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); biodegradable polymers such as polyesters; and/or
   salt-forming counterions. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable carriers herein further
   include insterstitial drug dispersion agents such as soluble neutral-active hyaluronidase
   glycoproteins (sHASEGP), for example, human soluble PH-20 hyaluronidase glycoproteins,
   such as rHuPH20 (HYLENEX*, Baxter International, Inc.). Certain exemplary sHASEGPs
25 and methods of use, including rHuPH20, are described in US Patent Publication Nos.
   2005/0260186 and 2006/0104968. In one aspect, a sHASEGP is combined with one or more
   additional glycosaminoglycanases such as chondroitinases.
   [0114]                      While the various descriptions of chelators herein often focus on EDTA, it
   will be appreciated that other metal ion chelators are also encompassed within the invention.
30 Metal ion chelators are well known by those of skill in the art and include, but are not
   necessarily limited to aminopolycarboxylates, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid),
   EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid), NTA
                                                              45
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   (nitrilotriacetic acid), EDDS (ethylene diamine disuccinate), PDTA (1,3
   propylenediaminetetraacetic acid), DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), ADA (beta
   alaninediacetic acid), MGCA (methylglycinediacetic acid), etc. Additionally, some
   embodiments herein comprise phosphonates/phosphonic acid chelators.
 5 [0115]                      The formulation herein may also contain more than one protein as necessary
   for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that
   do not adversely affect the other protein. For example, where the antibody is anti-VEGF, it
   may be combined with another agent (e.g., a chemotherapeutic agent, and anti-neoplastic
   agent, and anti.
10 [0116]                      The formulations to be used for in vivo administration should be sterile. This
   is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to, or
   following, preparation of the formulation.
                B. Administration of the Formulation
   [0117]                      The formulation is administered to a mammal in need of treatment with the
15 antibody, preferably a human, in accord with known methods, such as intravenous
   administration as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular,
   intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal,
   oral, topical, or inhalation routes. In one embodiment, the formulation is administered to the
   mammal by intravenous administration. For such purposes, the formulation may be injected
20 using a syringe or via an IV line, for example. In one embodiment, the formulation is
   administered to the mammal by subcutaneous administration.
   [0118]                      The appropriate dosage ("therapeutcally effective amount") of the antibody
   will depend, for example, on the condition to be treated, the severity and course of the
   condition, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes,
25 previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, the type of
   antibody used, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably
   administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments and may be administered
   to the patient at any time from diagnosis onwards. The antibody may be administered as the
   sole treatment or in conjunction with other drugs or therapies useful in treating the condition
30 in question.
   [0119]                      As a general proposition, the therapeutically effective amount of the antibody
   administered will be in the range of about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg of patent body weight
                                                              46
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   whether by one or more administrations, with the typical range of antibody used being about
   0.3 to about 20 mg/kg, preferably about 0.3 to about 15 mg/kg, administered daily, for
   example. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. In one embodiment, the antagonist
   is an anti-VEGF antibody that is administered at a dose of about 100 or 400 mg every 1, 2, 3,
 5 or 4 weeks or is administered a dose of about 1, 3, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/kg every 1, 2, 3, or
   4 weeks. The dose may be administered as a single dose or as multiple doses (e.g., 2 or 3
   doses), such as infusions. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional
   techniques.
                C. Antibody Preparation
10                             (i) Antigen Preparation
   [0120]                      Soluble antigens or fragments thereof, optionally conjugated to other
   molecules, can be used as immunogens for generating antibodies. For transmembrane
   molecules, such as receptors, fragments of these (e.g. the extracellular domain of a receptor)
   can be used as the immunogen. Alternatively, cells expressing the transmembrane molecule
15 can be used as the immunogen. Such cells can be derived from a natural source (e.g. cancer
   cell lines) or may be cells which have been transformed by recombinant techniques to
   express the transmembrane molecule. Other antigens and forms thereof useful for preparing
   antibodies will be apparent to those in the art.
                               (ii) Certain Antibody-Based Methods
20 [0121]                      Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple
   subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant.
   It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen to a protein that is immunogenic in the
   species to be immunized, e.g., keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine
   thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, for
25 example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues),
   N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCl 2 ,
   or RIN=C=NR, where R and RI are different alkyl groups.
   [0122]                      Animals are immunized against the antigen, immunogenic conjugates, or
   derivatives by combining, e.g., 100 pg or 5 pg of the protein or conjugate (for rabbits or
30 mice, respectively) with 3 volumes of Freund's complete adjuvant and injecting the solution
   intradermally at multiple sites. One month later the animals are boosted with 1/5 to 1/10 the
   original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvant by subcutaneous
                                                              47
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later the animals are bled and the serum is
   assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Preferably, the animal
   is boosted with the conjugate of the same antigen, but conjugated to a different protein and/or
   through a different cross-linking reagent. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell
 5 culture as protein fusions. Also, aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance
   the immune response.
   [0123]                      Monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made using the hybridoma
   method first described by Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975), and further described, e.g.,
   in Hongo et al., Hybridoma, 14 (3): 253-260 (1995), Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory
10 Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling et al., in:
   Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981), and Ni,
   Xiandai Mianyixue, 26(4):265-268 (2006) regarding human-human hybridomas. Additional
   methods include those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,189,826 regarding
   production of monoclonal human natural IgM antibodies from hybridoma cell lines. Human
15 hybridoma technology (Trioma technology) is described in Vollmers and Brandlein,
   Histology and Histopathology,20(3):927-937 (2005) and Vollmers and Brandlein, Methods
   and Findings in Experimental and ClinicalPharmacology,27(3):185-91 (2005).
   [0124]                      For various other hybridoma techniques, see, e.g., US 2006/258841; US
   2006/183887 (fully human antibodies), US 2006/059575; US 2005/287149; US
20 2005/100546; US 2005/026229; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,078,492 and 7,153,507. An exemplary
   protocol for producing monoclonal antibodies using the hybridoma method is described as
   follows. In one embodiment, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is
   immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will
   specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Antibodies are raised in animals by
25 multiple subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of a polypeptide of the invention
   or a fragment thereof, and an adjuvant, such as monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)/trehalose
   dicrynomycolate (TDM) (Ribi Immunochem. Research, Inc., Hamilton, MT). A polypeptide
   of the invention (e.g., antigen) or a fragment thereof may be prepared using methods well
   known in the art, such as recombinant methods, some of which are further described herein.
30 Serum from immunized animals is assayed for anti-antigen antibodies, and booster
   immunizations are optionally administered. Lymphocytes from animals producing anti
   antigen antibodies are isolated. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro.

   [0125]                      Lymphocytes are then fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent,
   such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell. See, e.g., Goding, Monoclonal
   Antibodies: Principlesand Practice,pp.59-103 (Academic Press, 1986). Myeloma cells may
   be used that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected
 5 antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Exemplary
   myeloma cells include, but are not limited to, murine myeloma lines, such as those derived
   from MOPC-21 and MPC-1 1 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell
   Distribution Center, San Diego, California USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8-653 cells available
   from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland USA. Human myeloma
10 and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of
   human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al.,
   Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker,
   Inc., New York, 1987)).
   [0126]                      The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture
15 medium, e.g., a medium that contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or
   survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells
   lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the
   culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and
   thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.
20 Preferably, serum-free hybridoma cell culture methods are used to reduce use of animal
   derived serum such as fetal bovine serum, as described, for example, in Even et al., Trends in
   Biotechnology, 24(3), 105-108 (2006).
   [0127]                      Oligopeptides as tools for improving productivity of hybridoma cell cultures
   are described in Franek, Trends in Monoclonal Antibody Research, 111-122 (2005).
25 Specifically, standard culture media are enriched with certain amino acids (alanine, serine,
   asparagine, proline), or with protein hydrolyzate fractions, and apoptosis may be significantly
   suppressed by synthetic oligopeptides, constituted of three to six amino acid residues. The
   peptides are present at millimolar or higher concentrations.
   [0128]                      Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing may be assayed for
30 production of monoclonal antibodies that bind to an antibody of the invention. The binding
   specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells may be determined by
   immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or
                                                              49
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). The binding affinity of the monoclonal
   antibody can be determined, for example, by Scatchard analysis. See, e.g., Munson et al.,
   Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).
   [0129]                      After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired
 5 specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution
   procedures and grown by standard methods. See, e.g., Goding, supra. Suitable culture
   media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition,
   hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal. Monoclonal antibodies
   secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or
10 serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein
   A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity
   chromatography. One procedure for isolation of proteins from hybridoma cells is described
   in US 2005/176122 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,919,436. The method includes using minimal salts,
   such as lyotropic salts, in the binding process and preferably also using small amounts of
15 organic solvents in the elution process.
                                (iii)  Certain Library Screening Methods
   [0130]                      Antibodies of the invention can be made by using combinatorial libraries to
   screen for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example, a variety of
   methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such
20 libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are
   described generally in Hoogenboom et al. in Methods in Molecular Biology 178:1-37
   (0' Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ,                200 ). For example, one method of
   generating antibodies of interest is through the use of a phage antibody library as described in
   Lee et al., J. Mol. Biol. (2004), 340(5):1073-93.
25 [0131]                      In principle, synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage
   libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region (Fv)
   fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography
   against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the
   desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non-binding clones in
30 the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen, and can be further enriched
   by additional cycles of antigen adsorption/elution. Any of the antibodies of the invention can
   be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone
                                                               50
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   of interest followed by construction of a full length antibody clone using the Fv sequences
   from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region (Fc) sequences described in
   Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteins ofImmunologicalInterest, Fifth Edition, NIH Publication
   91-3242, Bethesda MD (1991), vols. 1-3.
 5 [0132]                      In certain embodiments, the antigen-binding domain of an antibody is formed
   from two variable (V) regions of about 110 amino acids, one each from the light (VL) and
   heavy (VH) chains, that both present three hypervariable loops (HVRs) or complementarity
   determining regions (CDRs). Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage,
   either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments, in which VH and VL are covalently linked
10 through a short, flexible peptide, or as Fab fragments, in which they are each fused to a
   constant domain and interact non-covalently, as described in Winter et al., Ann. Rev.
   Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994). As used herein, scFv encoding phage clones and Fab
   encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as "Fv phage clones" or "Fv clones."
   [0133]                      Repertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase
15 chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be
   searched for antigen-binding clones as described in Winter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12:
   433-455 (1994). Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the
   immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive
   repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of
20 non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al.,
   EMBO J, 12: 725-734 (1993). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by
   cloning the unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers
   containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish
   rearrangement in vitro as described by Hoogenboom and Winter, J Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388
25 (1992).
   [0134]                      In certain embodiments, filamentous phage is used to display antibody
   fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIll. The antibody fragments can be displayed
   as single chain Fv fragments, in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same
   polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer, e.g. as described by Marks et al., J Mol.
30 Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991), or as Fab fragments, in which one chain is fused to pIll and the
   other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab-coat protein
   structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type
                                                             51
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   coat proteins, e.g. as described in Hoogenboom et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 19: 4133-4137
   (1991).
   [0135]                      In general, nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from
   immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti-antigen
 5 clones is desired, the subject is immunized with antigen to generate an antibody response,
   and spleen cells and/or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are
   recovered for library construction. In one embodiment, a human antibody gene fragment
   library biased in favor of anti-antigen clones is obtained by generating an anti-antigen
   antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene
10 array (and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system) such that antigen
   immunization gives rise to B cells producing human antibodies against antigen. The
   generation of human antibody-producing transgenic mice is described below.
   [0136]                      Additional enrichment for anti-antigen reactive cell populations can be
   obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing antigen-specific
15 membrane bound antibody, e.g., by cell separation using antigen affinity chromatography or
   adsorption of cells to fluorochrome-labeled antigen followed by flow-activated cell sorting
   (FACS).
   [0137]                      Alternatively, the use of spleen cells and/or B cells or other PBLs from an
   unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire, and
20 also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal (human or non-human)
   species in which antigen is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating in vitro antibody gene
   construction, stem cells are harvested from the subject to provide nucleic acids encoding
   unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a
   variety of animal species, such as human, mouse, rat, lagomorpha, luprine, canine, feline,
25 porcine, bovine, equine, and avian species, etc.
   [0138]                      Nucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments (including VH and
   VL segments) are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of
   rearranged VH and VL gene libraries, the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic
   DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with
30 primers matching the 5' and 3' ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in Orlandi
   et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 3833-3837 (1989), thereby making diverse V gene
   repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA,
                                                               52
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   with back primers at the 5' end of the exon encoding the mature V-domain and forward
   primers based within the J-segment as described in Orlandi et al. (1989) and in Ward et al.,
   Nature, 341: 544-546 (1989). However, for amplifying from cDNA, back primers can also
   be based in the leader exon as described in Jones et al., Biotechnol., 9: 88-89 (1991), and
 5 forward primers within the constant region as described in Sastry et al., Proc.Natl. A cad. Sci.
   (USA), 86: 5728-5732 (1989). To maximize complementarity, degeneracy can be
   incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi et al. (1989) or Sastry et al. (1989). In
   certain embodiments, library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each
   V-gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the
10 immune cell nucleic acid sample, e.g. as described in the method of Marks et al., J Mol.
   Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991) or as described in the method of Orum et al., Nucleic Acids Res.,
   21: 4491-4498 (1993). For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors, rare
   restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in
   Orlandi et al. (1989), or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in
15 Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991).
   [0139]                      Repertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V
   gene segments. Most of the human VH-gene segments have been cloned and sequenced
   (reported in Tomlinson et al., J Mol. Biol., 227: 776-798 (1992)), and mapped (reported in
   Matsuda et al., Nature Genet., 3: 88-94 (1993); these cloned segments (including all the
20 major conformations of the HI and H2 loop) can be used to generate diverse VH gene
   repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described
   in Hoogenboom and Winter, J Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992). VH repertoires can also be
   made with all the sequence diversity focused in a long H3 loop of a single length as described
   in Barbas et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 4457-4461 (1992). Human Viand VX
25 segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in Williams and Winter, Eur. J
   Immunol., 23: 1456-1461 (1993)) and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires.
   Synthetic V gene repertoires, based on a range of VH and VL folds, and L3 and H3 lengths,
   will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V
   gene encoding DNAs, germline V-gene segments can be rearranged in vitro according to the
30 methods of Hoogenboom and Winter, J Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992).
   [0140]                      Repertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and
   VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different
                                                               53

   vectors, and the vectors recombined in vitro, e.g., as described in Hogrefe et al., Gene, 128:
    119-126 (1993), or in vivo by combinatorial infection, e.g., the loxP system described in
   Waterhouse et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 21: 2265-2266 (1993). The in vivo recombination
   approach exploits the two-chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size
 5 imposed by E. coli transformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned
   separately, one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then
   combined by phage infection of phagemid-containing bacteria so that each cell contains a
   different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present
   (about 1012 clones). Both vectors contain in vivo recombination signals so that the VH and
10 VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co-packaged into phage virions.
   These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity (Kd-I of
   about 10-8 M).
   [0141]                      Alternatively, the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector,
   e.g. as described in Barbas et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991), or
15 assembled together by PCR and then cloned, e.g. as described in Clackson et al., Nature,
   352: 624-628 (1991). PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA
   encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv (scFv) repertoires. In yet another
   technique, "in cell PCR assembly" is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes
   by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in Embleton et al., Nucl.
20 Acids Res., 20: 3831-3837 (1992).
   [0142]                      The antibodies produced by naive libraries (either natural or synthetic) can be
   of moderate affinity (K-I of about 106 to 107 M 1 ), but affinity maturation can also be
   mimicked in vitro by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in
   Winter et al. (1994), supra. For example, mutation can be introduced at random in vitro by
25 using error-prone polymerase (reported in Leung et al., Technique, 1: 11-15 (1989)) in the
   method of Hawkins et al., J Mol. Biol., 226: 889-896 (1992) or in the method of Gram et al.,
   Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 89: 3576-3580 (1992). Additionally, affinity maturation can be
   performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs, e.g. using PCR with primers carrying
   random sequence spanning the CDR of interest, in selected individual Fv clones and
30 screening for higher affinity clones. WO 9607754 (published 14 March 1996) described a
   method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an
   immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective
                                                               54
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires
   of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for
   higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in Marks et al., Biotechnol.,
    10: 779-783 (1992). This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody
 5 fragments with affinities of about 10-9 M or less.
   [0143]                      Screening of the libraries can be accomplished by various techniques known
   in the art. For example, antigen can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates, expressed
   on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting, or conjugated to biotin for
   capture with streptavidin-coated beads, or used in any other method for panning phage
10 display libraries.
   [0144]                      The phage library samples are contacted with immobilized antigen under
   conditions suitable for binding at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent.
   Normally, the conditions, including pH, ionic strength, temperature and the like are selected
   to mimic physiological conditions. The phages bound to the solid phase are washed and then
15 eluted by acid, e.g. as described in Barbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 88: 7978-7982
   (1991), or by alkali, e.g. as described in Marks et al., J Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991), or
   by antigen competition, e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of
   Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991). Phages can be enriched 20-1,000-fold in a
   single round of selection. Moreover, the enriched phages can be grown in bacterial culture
20 and subjected to further rounds of selection.
   [0145]                      The efficiency of selection depends on many factors, including the kinetics of
   dissociation during washing, and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can
   simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics (and weak
   binding affinities) can be retained by use of short washes, multivalent phage display and high
25 coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage
   through multivalent interactions, but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The
   selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics (and good binding affinities) can be
   promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in Bass et al.,
   Proteins, 8: 309-314 (1990) and in WO 92/09690, and a low coating density of antigen as
30 described in Marks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992).
   [0146]                      It is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities, even
   with affinities that differ slightly, for antigen. However, random mutation of a selected
                                                                55

   antibody (e.g. as performed in some affinity maturation techniques) is likely to give rise to
   many mutants, most binding to antigen, and a few with higher affinity. With limiting
   antigen, rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all higher affinity mutants,
   phages can be incubated with excess biotinylated antigen, but with the biotinylated antigen at
 5 a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for antigen. The
   high affinity-binding phages can then be captured by streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads.
   Such "equilibrium capture" allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of
   binding, with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two-fold
   higher affinity from a great excess of phages with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing
10 phages bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of
   dissociation kinetics.
   [0147]                      Anti-antigen clones may be selected based on activity. In certain
   embodiments, the invention provides anti-antigen antibodies that bind to living cells that
   naturally express antigen or bind to free floating antigen or antigen attached to other cellular
15 structures. Fv clones corresponding to such anti- antigen antibodies can be selected by (1)
   isolating anti- antigen clones from a phage library as described above, and optionally
   amplifying the isolated population of phage clones by growing up the population in a suitable
   bacterial host; (2) selecting antigen and a second protein against which blocking and non
   blocking activity, respectively, is desired; (3) adsorbing the anti- antigen phage clones to
20 immobilized antigen; (4) using an excess of the second protein to elute any undesired clones
   that recognize antigen -binding determinants which overlap or are shared with the binding
   determinants of the second protein; and (5) eluting the clones which remain adsorbed
   following step (4). Optionally, clones with the desired blocking/non-blocking properties can
   be further enriched by repeating the selection procedures described herein one or more times.
25 [0148]                      DNA encoding hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibodies or phage display Fv
   clones of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g.
   by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain
   coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template). Once isolated, the DNA
   can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E.
30 coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do
   not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of the desired
   monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant

   constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal
   species. An Fv clone derived from the variable domain DNA of one animal (such as human)
10 species and then fused to constant region DNA of another animal species to form coding
   sequence(s) for "hybrid," full length heavy chain and/or light chain is included in the
   definition of "chimeric" and "hybrid" antibody as used herein. In certain embodiments, an Fv
   clone derived from human variable DNA is fused to human constant region DNA to form
   coding sequence(s) for full- or partial-length human heavy and/or light chains.
15 [0150]                      DNA encoding anti-antigen antibody derived from a hybridoma of the
   invention can also be modified, or example, by substituting the coding sequence for human
   heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of homologous murine sequences derived
   from the hybridoma clone (e.g. as in the method of Morrison et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci.
    USA, 81: 6851-6855 (1984)). DNA encoding a hybridoma- or Fv clone-derived antibody or
20 fragment can be further modified by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding
   sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In this
   manner, "chimeric" or "hybrid" antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of
   the Fv clone or hybridoma clone-derived antibodies of the invention.
                                (iv) Humanized and Human Antibodies
25 [0151]                      Various methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are known in the art.
   For example, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it
   from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred
   to as "import" residues, which are typically taken from an "import" variable domain.
   Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers
30 (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988);
   Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR
   sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such
                                                           57
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   "humanized" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) wherein
   substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the
   corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are
   typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are
 5 substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.
   [0152]                      The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in
   making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the
   so-called "best-fit" method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is
   screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human
10 sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework (FR)
   for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., J Immunol., 151:2296 (1993); Chothia et al., J Mol.
   Biol., 196:901 (1987)). Another method uses a particular framework derived from the
   consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains.
   The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al.,
15 Proc.Natl. Acad Sci. USA, 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., J Immnol., 151:2623 (1993)).
   [0153]                      It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high
   affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal,
   according to one embodiment of the method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process
   of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three
20 dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional
   immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art.
   Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional
   conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of
   these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the
25 candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of
   the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected
   and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody
   characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the
   hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing
30 antigen binding.
   [0154]                      Human antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone
   variable domain sequence(s) selected from human-derived phage display libraries with
                                                                58
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   known human constant domain sequence(s) as described above. Alternatively, human
   monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human
   myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human
   monoclonal antibodies have been described, for example, by Kozbor J Immunol., 133: 3001
 5 (1984); Brodeur et al., MonoclonalAntibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp.
   51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987); and Boemer et al., J Immunol., 147: 86
   (1991).
   [0155]                      It is possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon
   immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of
10 endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the
   homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and
   germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production.
   Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice
   will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g.,
15 Jakobovits et al, Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., Nature,
   362:255-258 (1993); Bruggermann et al., Year in Immuno., 7:33 (1993); and Duchosal et al.
   Nature 355:258 (1992).
   [0156]                      Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non-human,
   e.g. rodent, antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to
20 the starting non-human antibody. According to this method, which is also called "epitope
   imprinting", either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non-human antibody fragment
   obtained by phage display techniques as described herein is replaced with a repertoire of
   human V domain genes, creating a population of non-human chain/human chain scFv or Fab
   chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non-human chain/human chain
25 chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed
   upon removal of the corresponding non-human chain in the primary phage display clone, i.e.
   the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is
   repeated in order to replace the remaining non-human chain, a human antibody is obtained
   (see PCT WO 93/06213 published April 1, 1993). Unlike traditional humanization of non
30 human antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies,
   which have no FR or CDR residues of non-human origin.
                                                               59
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

                (v) Antibody Fragments
   [0157]                      Antibody fragments may be generated by traditional means, such as enzymatic
   digestion, or by recombinant techniques. In certain circumstances there are advantages of
   using antibody fragments, rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments
 5 allows for rapid clearance, and may lead to improved access to solid tumors. For a review of
   certain antibody fragments, see Hudson et al. (2003) Nat. Med. 9:129-134.
   [0158]                      Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody
   fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact
   antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., Journalof Biochemical and BiophysicalMethods
10 24:107-117 (1992); and Brennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments
   can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and ScFv antibody
   fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from E. coli, thus allowing the facile
   production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the
   antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly
15 recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(ab') 2 fragments (Carter et al.,
   Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab') 2 fragments can
   be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F(ab') 2 fragment with
   increased in vivo half-life comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described
   in U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be
20 apparent to the skilled practitioner. In certain embodiments, an antibody is a single chain Fv
   fragment (scFv). See WO 93/16185; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,894; and 5,587,458. Fv and scFv
   are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they
   may be suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. scFv fusion proteins may
   be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy
25 terminus of an scFv. See Antibody Engineering,ed. Borrebaeck, supra. The antibody
   fragment may also be a "linear antibody", e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870, for
   example. Such linear antibodies may be monospecific or bispecific.
                               (vi) Multispecific Antibodies
   [0159]                      Multspecific antibodies have binding specificities for at least two different
30 epitopes, where the epitopes are usually from different antigens. While such molecules
   normally will only bind two different epitopes (i.e. bispecific antibodies, BsAbs), antibodies
   with additional specificities such as trispecific antibodies are encompassed by this expression
                                                             60
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   when used herein. Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody
   fragments (e.g. F(ab') 2bispecific antibodies).
   [0160]                      Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditonal
   production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two
 5 immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different
   specificities (Millstein et al., Nature, 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random assortment
   of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a
   potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct
   bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity
10 chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar
   procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J., 10:3655-3659
   (1991).
   [0161]                      According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired
   binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin
15 constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain
   constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is typical to
   have the first heavy-chain constant region (CHI) containing the site necessary for light chain
   binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy
   chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate
20 expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for
   great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in
   embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction
   provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or
   all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two
25 polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular
   significance.
   [0162]                      In one embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of
   a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a
   hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity)
30 in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the
   desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the
   presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule
                                                              61
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94/04690. For
   further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in
   Enzymology, 121:210 (1986).
   [0163]                      According to another approach described in W096/2701 1, the interface
 5 between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of
   heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. One interface comprises at
   least a part of the CH 3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more
   small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced
   with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory "cavities" of identical or
10 similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody
   molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or
   threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other
   unwanted end-products such as homodimers.
   [0164]                      Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or "heteroconjugate" antibodies. For
15 example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to
   biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to
   unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 91/00360,
   WO 92/200373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any
   convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art,
20 and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking
   techniques.
   [0165]                      Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have
   also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using
   chemical linkage. Brennan et al., Science, 229: 81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact
25 antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab') 2 fragments. These fragments are
   reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal
   dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab' fragments generated are
   then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab'-TNB derivatives is
   then reconverted to the Fab'-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with
30 an equimolar amount of the other Fab'-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The
   bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of
   enzymes.
                                                              62
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   [0166]                      Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab'-SH fragments from
   E. coli, which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., J Exp.
   Med., 175: 217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody
   F(ab')      2 molecule.           Each Fab' fragment was separately secreted from E. coli and subjected to
 5 directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody.
   [0167]                      Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments
   directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific
   antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., J Immunol.,
    148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were
10 linked to the Fab' portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody
   homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to
   form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of
   antibody homodimers. The "diabody" technology described by Hollinger et al., Proc.Nati.
   A cad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making
15 bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH)
   connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which is too short to allow
   pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of
   one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another
   fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific
20 antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See
   Gruber et al, J Immunol, 152:5368 (1994).
   [0168]                      Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example,
   trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tuft et al.J Immunol. 147: 60 (1991).
                                (vii) Single-Domain Antibodies
25 [0169]                      In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention is a single-domain
   antibody. A single-domain antibody is a single polypetide chain comprising all or a portion
   of the heavy chain variable domain or all or a portion of the light chain variable domain of an
   antibody. In certain embodiments, a single-domain antibody is a human single-domain
   antibody (Domantis, Inc., Waltham, MA; see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,248,516 BI). In one
30 embodiment, a single-domain antibody consists of all or a portion of the heavy chain variable
   domain of an antibody.
                                                               63
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

                                (viii) Antibody Variants
   [0170]                      In some embodiments, amino acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies
   described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding
   affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of
 5 the antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate changes into the nucleotide
   sequence encoding the antibody, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for
   example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the
   amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and
   substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct
10 possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the
   subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.
                                (ix) Antibody Derivatives
   [0171]                      The antibodies of the invention can be further modified to contain additional
   nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. In certain
15 embodiments, the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble
   polymers. Non-limiting examples of water soluble polymers include, but are not limited to,
   polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol,
   carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1, 3
   dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either
20 homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl
   pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers, prolypropylene
   oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl
   alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in
   manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight,
25 and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may
   vary, and if more than one polymer are attached, they can be the same or different molecules.
   In general, the number and/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined
   based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of
   the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under
30 defined conditions, etc.
                                                              64
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

                               (x)    Vectors, Host Cells, and Recombinant Methods
   [0172]                      Antibodies may also be produced using recombinant methods. For
   recombinant production of an anti-antigent antibody, nucleic acid encoding the antibody is
   isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA)
 5 or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody may be readily isolated and sequenced using
   conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding
   specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are
   available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of
   the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an
10 enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.
                                       (a) Signal sequence component
   [0173]                   An antibody of the invention may be produced recombinantly not only directly,
   but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which is preferably a signal
   sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature
15 protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is
   recognized and processed (e.g., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For
   prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process a native antibody signal sequence,
   the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example,
   from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, lpp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II
20 leaders. For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by, e.g., the yeast
   invertase leader, a factor leader (including Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces a-factor
   leaders), or acid phosphatase leader, the C. albicans glucoamylase leader, or the signal
   described in WO 90/13646. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as
   well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available.
25                                     (b) Origin of replication
   [0174]                      Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that
   enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning
   vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host
   chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating
30 sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The
   origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria,
                                                               65
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   the 2p plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma,
   adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the
   origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (the SV40
   origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter).
 5                                     (c) Selection gene component
   [0175]                      Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a
   selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to
   antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b)
   complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from
10 complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli.
   [0176]                      One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host
   cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a
   protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such
   dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.
15 [0177]                      Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those
   that enable the identification of cells competent to take up antibody-encoding nucleic acid,
   such as DHFR, glutamine synthetase (GS), thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II,
   preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.
   [0178]                      For example, cells transformed with the DHFR gene are identified by
20 culturing the transformants in a culture medium containing methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive
   antagonist of DHFR. Under these conditions, the DHFR gene is amplified along with any
   other co-transformed nucleic acid. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in
   endogenous DHFR activity (e.g., ATCC CRL-9096) may be used.
   [0179]                      Alternatively, cells transformed with the GS gene are identified by culturing
25 the transformants in a culture medium containing L-methionine sulfoximine (Msx), an
   inhibitor of GS. Under these conditions, the GS gene is amplified along with any other co
   transformed nucleic acid. The GS selection/amplification system may be used in
   combination with the DHFR selection/amplification system described above.
   [0180]                      Alternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous
30 DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody of
   interest, wild-type DHFR gene, and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3'
                                                                66
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection
   agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin,
   neomycin, or G418. See U.S. Patent No. 4,965,199.
   [0181]                      A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp 1 gene present in the yeast
 5 plasmid YRp7 (Stinchcomb et al., Nature, 282:39 (1979)). The trpl gene provides a
   selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for
   example, ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1. Jones, Genetics, 85:12 (1977). The presence of the
   trp1 lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting
   transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly, Leu2-deficient yeast
10 strains (ATCC 20,622 or 38,626) are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2
   gene.
   [0182]                      In addition, vectors derived from the 1.6 pm circular plasmid pKD1 can be
   used for transformation of Kluyveromyces yeasts. Alternatively, an expression system for
   large-scale production of recombinant calf chymosin was reported for K. lactis. Van den
15 Berg, Bio/Technology, 8:135 (1990). Stable multi-copy expression vectors for secretion of
   mature recombinant human serum albumin by industrial strains of Kluyveromyces have also
   been disclosed. Fleer et al., Bio/Technology, 9:968-975 (1991).
                                        (d) Promoter component
   [0183]                      Expression and cloning vectors generally contain a promoter that is
20 recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to nucleic acid encoding an antibody.
   Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter, p-lactamase
   and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase promoter, a tryptophan (trp) promoter
   system, and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. However, other known bacterial
   promoters are suitable. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine
25 Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding an antibody.
   [0184]                      Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes
   have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where
   transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of
   transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3'
30 end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of
                                                               67
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   the poly A tail to the 3' end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably
   inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.
   [0185]                      Examples of suitable promoter sequences for use with yeast hosts include the
   promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, such as enolase,
 5 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phospho
   fructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase,
   triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase.
   [0186]                      Other yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional
   advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for
10 alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes
   associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3 -phosphate
   dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable
   vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73,657. Yeast
   enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.
15 [0187]                      Antibody transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells can be
   controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma
   virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian
   sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), or
   from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin
20 promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host
   cell systems.
   [0188]                      The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as
   an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The
   immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a
25 HindIll E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the
   bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,419,446. A modification
   of this system is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,601,978. See also Reyes et al., Nature
   297:598-601 (1982) on expression of human p-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the
   control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the Rous
30 Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.
                                                             68
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

                                       (e) Enhancer element component
   [0189]                      Transcription of a DNA encoding an antibody of this invention by higher
   eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many
   enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, a
 5 fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic
   cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp
    100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late
   side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, Nature 297:17-18
   (1982) on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be
10 spliced into the vector at a position 5' or 3' to the antibody-encoding sequence, but is
   preferably located at a site 5' from the promoter.
                                       (f) Transcription termination component
   [0190]                      Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant,
   animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain
15 sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such
   sequences are commonly available from the 5' and, occasionally 3', untranslated regions of
   eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed
   as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding antibody.
   One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone
20 polyadenylation region. See W094/11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.
                                       (g) Selection and transformation of host cells
   [0191]                      Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are
   the prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells described above. Suitable prokaryotes for
   this purpose include eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for
25 example, Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia,e.g., E. coli, Enterobacter,Erwinia,
   Klebsiella, Proteus,Salmonella, e.g., Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia,e.g., Serratia
   marcescans, and Shigella, as well as Bacilli such as B. subtilis and B. lichenformis (e.g., B.
   lichenformis 41P disclosed in DD 266,710 published 12 April 1989), Pseudomonas such as
   P. aeruginosa,and Streptomyces. One preferred E. coli cloning host is E. coli 294 (ATCC
                                                               69
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   31,446), although other strains such as E. coli B, E. coli X1776 (ATCC 31,537), and E. coli
   W3 110 (ATCC 27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.
   [0192]                      Full length antibody, antibody fusion proteins, and antibody fragments can be
   produced in bacteria, in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not
 5 needed, such as when the therapeutic antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a
   toxin) that by itself shows effectiveness in tumor cell destruction. Full length antibodies have
   greater half life in circulation. Production in E. coli is faster and more cost efficient. For
   expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria, see, e.g., U.S. 5,648,237
   (Carter et. al.), U.S. 5,789,199 (Joly et al.), U.S. 5,840,523 (Simmons et al.), which describes
10 translation initiation region (TIR) and signal sequences for optimizing expression and
   secretion. See also Charlton,Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 248 (B.K.C. Lo, ed.,
   Humana Press, Totowa, NJ, 2003), pp. 245-254, describing expression of antibody fragments
   in E. coli. After expression, the antibody may be isolated from the E. coli cell paste in a
   soluble fraction and can be purified through, e.g., a protein A or G column depending on the
15 isotype. Final purification can be carried out similar to the process for purifying antibody
   expressed e.g,, in CHO cells.
   [0193]                      In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or
   yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody-encoding vectors. Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae, or common baker's yeast, is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic
20 host microorganisms. However, a number of other genera, species, and strains are commonly
   available and useful herein, such as Schizosaccharomycespombe; Kluyveromyces hosts such
   as, e.g., K. lactis, K.fragilis (ATCC 12,424), K. bulgaricus (ATCC 16,045), K. wickeramii
   (ATCC 24,178), K. waltii (ATCC 56,500), K. drosophilarum (ATCC 36,906), K.
   thermotolerans,and K. marxianus;yarrowia (EP 402,226); Pichiapastoris(EP 183,070);
25 Candida; Trichodermareesia (EP 244,234); Neurospora crassa;Schwanniomyces such as
   Schwanniomyces occidentalis; and filamentous fungi such as, e.g., Neurospora,Penicillium,
   Tolypocladium, and Aspergillus hosts such as A. nidulans and A. niger. For a review
   discussing the use of yeasts and filamentous fungi for the production of therapeutic proteins,
   see, e.g., Gerngross, Nat. Biotech. 22:1409-1414 (2004).
30 [0194]                      Certain fungi and yeast strains may be selected in which glycosylation
   pathways have been "humanized," resulting in the production of an antibody with a partially
   or fully human glycosylation pattern. See, e.g., Li et al., Nat. Biotech. 24:210-215 (2006)
                                                               70

   (describing humanization of the glycosylation pathway in Pichiapastoris); and Gerngross et
   al., supra.
   [0195]                      Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody are also derived
   from multicellular organisms (invertebrates and vertebrates). Examples of invertebrate cells
 5 include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding
   permissive insect host cells from hosts such as Spodopterafrugiperda(caterpillar), Aedes
   aegypti (mosquito), A edes albopictus (mosquito), Drosophila melanogaster(fruitfly), and
   Bombyx mori have been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly
   available, e.g., the L-1 variant of Autographa cahfornicaNPV and the Bm-5 strain of
10 Bombyx mori NPV, and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the
   invention, particularly for transfection of Spodopterafrugiperdacells.
   [0196]                      Plant cell cultures of cotton, corn, potato, soybean, petunia, tomato, duckweed
   (Lemnaceae), alfalfa (M. truncatula),and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts. See, e.g., US
   Patent Nos. 5,959,177, 6,040,498, 6,420,548, 7,125,978, and 6,417,429 (describing
15 PLANTIBODIESTM technology for producing antibodies in transgenic plants).
   [0197]                      Vertebrate cells may be used as hosts, and propagation of vertebrate cells in
   culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host
   cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651);
   human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture,
20 Graham et al., J Gen Virol. 36:59 (1977)) ; baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL
    10); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, Biol. Reprod. 23:243-251 (1980) ); monkey kidney
   cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL
    1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK,
   ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells
25 (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor
   (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL5 1); TRI cells (Mather et al., Annals N.Y Acad. Sci. 383:44-68
   (1982)); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep G2). Other useful
   mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, including DHFR
   CHO cells (Urlaub et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216 (1980)); and myeloma cell
30 lines such as NSO and Sp2/0. For a review of certain mammalian host cell lines suitable for
   antibody production, see, e.g., Yazaki and Wu, Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 248
   (B.K.C. Lo, ed., Humana Press, Totowa, NJ, 2003), pp. 255-268.
                                                                71
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   [0198]                      Host cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning
   vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as
   appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes
   encoding the desired sequences.
 5                                      (h) Culturing the host cells
   [0199]                      The host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured
   in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F1O (Sigma), Minimal
   Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's
   Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the
10 media described in Ham et al., Meth. Enz. 58:44 (1979), Barnes et al., Anal.
   Biochem.102:255 (1980), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; 4,560,655; or
   5,122,469; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; or U.S. Patent Re. 30,985 may be used as culture
   media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with
   hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth
15 factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as
   HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as
   GENTAMYCINTM drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at
   final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source.
   Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that
20 would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH,
   and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be
   apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.
                                (xi) Purification of antibody
   [0200]                      When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced
25 intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody
   is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed
   fragments, are removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al.,
   Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992) describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are
   secreted to the periplasmic space of E. coli. Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of
30 sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30
   min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the
                                                               72
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a
   commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore
   Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the
   foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of
 5 adventitious contaminants.
   [0201]                      The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for
   example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, gel
   electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being
   among one of the typically preferred purification steps. The suitability of protein A as an
10 affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is
   present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human
   yl, y2, or y4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., J Immunol. Meth. 62:1-13 (1983)). Protein G is
   recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 73 (Guss et al., EMBO J 5:15671575
   (1986)). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other
15 matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or
   poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can
   be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH3 domain, the Bakerbond
   ABX TMresin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) is useful for purification. Other techniques for
   protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation,
20 Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin
   SEPHAROSETM chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a
   polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate
   precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.
   [0202]                      In general, various methodologies for preparing antibodies for use in research,
25 testing, and clinicalare well-established in the art, consistent with the above-described
   methodologies and/or as deemed appropriate by one skilled in the art for a particular antibody
   of interest.
                D. Selecting Biologically Active Antibodies
   [0203]                      Antibodies produced as described above may be subjected to one or more
30 "biological activity" assays to select an antibody with beneficial properties from a therapeutic
   perspective. The antibody may be screened for its ability to bind the antigen against which it
   was raised. For example, for an anti-VEGF antibody, as shown in the example below, the
                                                             73
   9810482_1 (GHMatters) P90324.AU.3

   antigen binding properties of the antibody can be evaluated in an assay that detects the ability
   to bind to VEGF.
   [0204]                      In another embodiment, the affinity of the antibody may be determined by
   saturation binding; ELISA; and/or competition assays (e.g. RIA's), for example.
 5 [0205]                      Also, the antibody may be subjected to other biological activity assays, e.g., in
   order to evaluate its effectiveness as a therapeutic. Such assays are known in the art and
   depend on the target antigen and intended use for the antibody.
   [0206]                      To screen for antibodies which bind to a particular epitope on the antigen of
   interest (e.g., those which block binding of the anti-VEGF antibody of the example to
10 VEGF), a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies, A Laboratory
   Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be
   performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping, e.g. as described in Champe et al., J Biol. Chem.
   270:1388-1394 (1995), can be performed to determine whether the antibody binds an epitope
   of interest.

   Example 1: Stable anti-VEGF antibody Liquid Formulations
10 [0211]                      This examples describe the development and stability testing of stable liquid
   formulations comprising anti-VEGF antibody at protein concentrations in the range from
   about 20 mg/mL-200 mg/mL in various liquid formulations comprising comprising histidine,
   arginine, acetate, or sodium chloride. One milliliter of each formulation in a 3cc glass vials
   was stored at 40 0C and the stability was assessed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. The stability of anti
15 VEGF was monitored by several assays including UV (for concentration and turbidity), size
   exclusion chromatography (SEC) for size variant analysis, imaged capillary isoelectric
   focusing (icIEF) for charge variant analysis, CE-SDS for size distribution and binding assay
   for activity. After four weeks of stability testing, our results indicate that anti-VEGF is stable
   in 200 mM Arginine Acetate, 150 mM Sodium Chloride, 0.04% PS20, pH 5.2.
20 [0212]                      The stability (e.g., aggregate formation, viscosity, etc.) of anti-VEGF was
   investigated in various liquid formulations comprising histidine, sodium chloride, arginine,
   and acetate. The stability of anti-VEGF was monitored by several assays including, size
   exclusion chromatography (SEC) for aggregate formation analysis. Our results indicate that
   anti-VEGF is stable at about pH 5.2 in arginine-containing buffers.
25 [0213]                      Anti-VEGF was formulated into different buffers by dialysis using Slide-a
   Lyzer@ cassettes to achieve the final concentrations listed in Table 1. Each formulation was
   sterile filtered with 0.22ptm Steriflip@ filter units and aseptically filled into autoclaved vials,
   stoppered, and sealed. Samples were placed at 2-8"C, 25"C, and 40"C and stability studies
   were conducted at select temperatures.

   METHODS
   [0214]                     pH.: A 200 pL volume of each sample was placed in a 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes
   at an ambient temperature and their pH was measured using Thermo Orion pH meter
   equipped with a Ross semi-micro electrode. The pH meter was calibrated using Thermo
10 Orion buffer standards pH 4.0, 5.0 and 7.0.
   [0215]                       Viscosity: Shear viscosity was measured using an Anton Paar Physica
   MCR300 rheometer with a 25 mm cone (CP 25-1) set at a height of 0.049 mm. 75 pL of each
   sample was loaded onto a Peltier plate at 25'C and measured 10 times per 100s interval at a
   constant shear rate of 1000 1/s.
15 [0216]                      Size Exclusion Exchange Chromatography(SEC): Size exclusion
   chromatography was performed to quantitate total aggregate levels (with neat injections) and
   slow-dissociating aggregate levels (with dilute injections). Dilute injections were diluted
   with mobile phase buffer (0.20M potassium phosphate, 0.25M potassium chloride, pH 6.2) to
   0.5 mg/mL. All samples were incubated at 30'C for 24 hours prior to analysis. 10IL of each
20 neat sample and 100pL of each dilute sample were injected onto a TSK G3000SWXL, 7.8 X
   300mm column (TOSOHAAS, part no. 08541) using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. The
   autosampler was kept at 30'C while the column was kept at ambient temperature. Flow rate
   was 0.5 mL/min and total run time per sample was 30 minutes. Data was analyzed with
   sample absorbance at 280 nm using HP Chemstation.
25 [0217]                      Ion Exchange Chromatography(IEC): Ion exchange chromatography was
   performed to quantitate charged variants in carboxypeptidase B (CpB)-digested samples.
   Samples were diluted to 1 mg/mL with Solvent A (20 mM N-(2-Acetamido)-2
   aminoethanesulfonic acid (ACES) buffer, pH 6.5), treated with a 1% w/w addition of 1
   mg/mL CpB, and incubated for 20 minutes at 37'C. 50[tL of each sample was then injected
30 onto a Dionex ProPac WCX-10, 4.6 X 250 mm column using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system.
   Autosampler temperature was kept at 2-8'C while the column was kept at 40'C. Flow rate
                                                               76

   chloride in Solvent A) over 90 minutes, as listed in the test procedure. Data was analyzed
   with sample absorbance at 280 nm using HP Chemstation.
   [0218]                      Turbidity Assay:       To monitor turbidity the optical density of each
 5 formulation was measured at 350 nm using an Agilent 8453 UV-VIS spectrophotmeter. All
   samples were analyzed without dilution using a 1 cm pathlength quartz cuvette.
   [0219]                      -20 C and Freeze Thaw Stability Studies: Formulations A-D are aseptically
   filled into 316 L stainless steel mini-cans (15 mL/minican). All samples are stored at -20'C
   for varying amounts of time (e.g., 24, 48, 72, or more hours; 4, 5, 6, 7, or more days; 2, 3, 4,
10 5, 6, 7, 8, or more weeks; 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
   23, 24, or more months, and continuously sampled aseptically under a laminar flow hood. In
   addition, formulations A-D are filled into 6 cc glass vials and stored at -20'C. Each vial is
   subjected to five freeze thaw cycles and analyzed using SEC, IEC and turbidity assays. The
   freeze-thaw cycle entails storage for at least 24 hours at -20'C followed by storage for at least
15 24 hours at 5'C.
   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
   [0220]                      This study investigated the stability (e.g., aggregate formation, viscosity,
   chemical stability etc.) of different concentrations of anti-VEGF in an arginine-based
   formulation. SEC and IEC were used to monitor stability of anti-VEGF at stressed and
20 accelerated storage conditions. Aggregation and viscosity of the anti-VEGF was measured
   and set forth in Table 2 below and illustrated in Figures 2 and 4.
