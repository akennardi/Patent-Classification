  5                                       BACKGROUND
            Cellulosic and lignocellulosic materials are produced, processed, and used in large
    quantities in a number of applications. Often such materials are used once, and then
    discarded as waste, or are simply considered to be waste materials, e.g., sewage, bagasse,
    sawdust, and stover.
 10         Various cellulosic and lignocellulosic materials, their uses, and applications have
    been described in U.S. Patent Nos. 7,074,918, 6,448,307, 6,258,876, 6,207,729,
    5,973,035 and 5,952,105; and in various patent applications, including "FIBROUS
    MATERIALS AND COMPOSITES," PCT/US2006/010648, filed on March 23, 2006,

                                             SUMMARY
            Generally, this invention relates to carbohydrate-containing materials (e.g.,
    biomass materials or biomass-derived materials), methods of processing such materials to
    change their structure, and products made from the structurally changed materials. Many
20  of the methods provide materials that can be more readily utilized by a variety of
    microorganisms to produce useful intermediates and products, e.g., energy, a fuel such as
    ethanol, a food or a material.
            The methods disclosed herein include treating a biomass material to alter the
    structure of the material by a structural modification treatment other than mechanical
25  treatment, e.g., a treatment selected from the group consisting of radiation, sonication,
    pyrolysis, oxidation, steam explosion, chemical treatment, and combinations thereof, and
    then mechanically treating the structurally altered material. In some implementations,
                                                   1

     WO 2011/103033                                                            PCT/US2011/024470
    one or more of these steps is repeated. For example, the material can be subjected to the
    structural modification treatment, e.g., irradiated, two or more times, with mechanical
    treatments between structural modification treatments. In some implementations, the
    biomass material is initially mechanically treated, e.g., for size reduction, prior to
  5 structural modification. The initial and subsequent mechanical treatments may be the
    same (e.g., shearing followed by further shearing after irradiation), or may be different
    (e.g., shearing followed by grinding after irradiation).
             Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the structural
    modification treatment weakens or partially disrupts (e.g., microfractures) the internal
 10 crystalline structure of the material, and subsequent mechanical treatment shatters or
    otherwise further disrupts the weakened structure. This sequence of events reduces the
    recalcitrance of the feedstock, allowing the treated feedstock to be more readily
    converted to a product, e.g., a fuel. The optional initial mechanical treatment step can be
    used to prepare the feedstock material for structural modification, e.g., by reducing the
 is size of the material or "opening up" the material.
             It has been found that the total energy requirements to produce a product using the
    processes described herein are often lower than the total energy requirements of a similar
    process that includes only structural modification treatment or an initial mechanical
    treatment followed by structural modification treatment. For example, when one or more
 ?o mechanical treatments are performed subsequent to structural modification treatment, the
    structural modification treatment can be performed at a lower energy level with the same
    or better net effect on recalcitrance. In the case of irradiation, in some implementations a
    relatively low dose can be delivered to the feedstock, for example less than 60 Mrad, e.g.,
    from about 1 Mrad to about 60 Mrad, or from about 5 Mrad to about 50 Mrad. Thus, the
25  processes described herein may allow an intermediate or a product to be manufactured at
    relatively low cost using feedstocks that are generally difficult and energy-intensive to
    process.
             However, a wide range of radiation doses can be used. For example, the dose of
    irradiation can be from about 0.1 Mrad to about 500 Mrad, from about 0.5 Mrad to about
30  200 Mrad, from about 1 Mrad to about 100 Mrad, or from about 5 Mrad to about 60
    Mrad.

     WO 2011/103033                                                             PCT/US2011/024470
            In one aspect, the invention features a method that includes mechanically treating
    a structurally modified biomass feedstock that has been subjected to a structural
    modification treatment selected from the group consisting of radiation (e.g., electron
    beam radiation), sonication, pyrolysis, oxidation, steam explosion, chemical treatment,
  5 and combinations thereof.
            Some implementations may include one or more of the following features.
    Mechanically treating may include a process selected from the group consisting of
    cutting, milling, pressing, grinding, shearing and chopping. Milling may include, for
    example, utilizing a hammer mill, ball mill, colloid mill, conical or cone mill, disk mill,
 10 edge mill, Wiley mill or grist mill. In some implementations, structurally modifying
    includes irradiating, e.g., with an electron beam, alone or in combination with one or
    more of the other structural modification treatments described herein. Mechanically
    treating can be performed at ambient temperature, or at a reduced temperature, e.g., as
    disclosed in U.S. Serial No. 12/502,629, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated
 is herein by reference. The method may further include repeating the structural
    modification and mechanical treatment steps one or more times. For instance, the
    method can include performing an additional structure modifying treatment after
    mechanically treating.
            In some cases, the biomass feedstock comprises a cellulosic or lignocellulosic
 ?0 material. Feedstocks can include, for example, paper, paper products, wood, wood
    related materials, particle board, grasses, rice hulls, bagasse, cotton, jute, hemp, flax,
    bamboo, sisal, abaca, straw, corn cobs, coconut hair, algae, seaweed, microbial materials,
    altered celluloses, e.g., cellulose acetate, regenerated cellulose, and the like, or mixtures
    of any of these.
25          Some methods further include combining the structurally modified, mechanically
    treated feedstock with a microorganism, the microorganism utilizing the feedstock to
    produce an intermediate or a product, for example energy, a fuel, e.g., an alcohol, a food
    or a material. The microorganism can be, for example, a bacterium and/or enzyme. The
    method can include saccharifying the structurally modified, mechanically treated
30  feedstock, and in some cases fermenting the product of saccharification.
                                                    3

     WO 2011/103033                                                            PCT/US2011/024470
             The structurally modified, mechanically treated feedstock has characteristics that
    can allow it to be readily converted to a product, e.g., by saccharification. For example,
    in some cases the structurally modified, mechanically treated feedstock has a porosity of
    at least 80%.
  5          "Structurally modifying" a biomass feedstock, as that phrase is used herein,
    means changing the molecular structure of the feedstock in any way, including the
    chemical bonding arrangement, crystalline structure, or conformation of the feedstock.
    The change may be, for example, a change in the integrity of the crystalline structure,
    e.g., by microfracturing within the structure, which may not be reflected by diffractive
 10 measurements of the crystallinity of the material. Such changes in the structural integrity
    of the material can be measured indirectly by measuring the yield of a product at different
    levels of structure-modifying treatment. In addition, or alternatively, the change in the
    molecular structure can include changing the supramolecular structure of the material,
    oxidation of the material, changing an average molecular weight, changing an average
 i5 crystallinity, changing a surface area, changing a degree of polymerization, changing a
    porosity, changing a degree of branching, grafting on other materials, changing a
    crystalline domain size, or changing an overall domain size. It is noted that both what is
    referred to herein as the "structural modification treatment" and the mechanical treatment
    serve to structurally modify the biomass feedstock. Mechanical treatment does so by the
 ?0 use of mechanical means, while the structural modification means do so using other types
    of energy (e.g., radiation, ultrasonic energy, or heat) or chemical means.
             Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the
    same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this
    invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those
25  described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, suitable
    methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents,

                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
             Using the methods described herein, biomass (e.g., plant biomass, animal
    biomass, and municipal waste biomass) can be processed to produce useful intermediates
    and products such as those described herein. Systems and processes are described below
 10 that can use as feedstock materials cellulosic and/or lignocellulosic materials that are
    readily available, but can be difficult to process by processes such as fermentation. The
    methods disclosed herein include subjecting a biomass material to a structural
    modification treatment, e.g., a treatment selected from the group consisting of radiation,
    sonication, pyrolysis, oxidation, steam explosion, chemical treatment, and combinations
 is thereof, and then mechanically treating the structurally altered material. In some
    implementations, one or more of these steps is repeated. For example, as will be
    discussed further below, the material can be irradiated two or more times, with
    mechanical treatment between irradiation steps. In some implementations, the biomass
    material is subjected to an initial mechanical treatment prior to the structural modification
 ?o treatment.
    SYSTEMS FOR TREATING BIOMASS
             FIG. 1 shows a process 10 for converting biomass, particularly biomass with
    significant cellulosic and lignocellulosic components, into useful intermediates and
    products. Process 10 includes initially mechanically treating the feedstock (12), e.g., to
25  reduce the size of the feedstock 110. The mechanically treated feedstock is then treated with
    a structure modifying treatment (14) to modify its internal structure, for example by
    weakening or microfracturing bonds in the crystalline structure of the material. Next, the
    structurally modified material is subjected to further mechanical treatment (16). This
    mechanical treatment can be the same as or different from the initial mechanical treatment.
                                                    5

     WO 2011/103033                                                              PCT/US2011/024470
    For example, the initial treatment can be a size reduction (e.g., cutting) step followed by a
    shearing step, while the further treatment can be a grinding or milling step.
             Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the structure-modifying
    treatment disrupts the internal structure of the material, e.g., by micro-fracturing the
  5 crystalline structure of the material. The internal structure of the structurally modified
    material is then further disrupted, e.g., broken, ruptured or fractured, by the subsequent
    mechanical treatment.
             The material can then be subjected to further structure-modifying treatment and
    mechanical treatment, if further structural change (e.g., reduction in recalcitrance) is desired
 i0 prior to further processing.
             Next, the treated material can be processed with a primary processing step 18, e.g.,
    saccharification and/or fermentation, to produce intermediates and products (e.g., energy,
    fuel, foods and materials). In some cases, the output of the primary processing step is
    directly useful but, in other cases, requires further processing provided by a post-processing
 15 step (20). For example, in the case of an alcohol, post-processing may involve distillation
    and, in some cases, denaturation.
             FIG. 2 shows a system 100 that utilizes the steps described above for treating
    biomass and then using the treated biomass in a fermentation process to produce an alcohol.
    System 100 includes a module 102 in which a biomass feedstock is initially mechanically
 ?0 treated (step 12, above), a module 104 in which the mechanically treated feedstock is
    structurally modified (step 14, above), e.g., by irradiation, and a module 106 in which the
    structurally modified feedstock is subjected to further mechanical treatment (step 16,
    above). As discussed above, the module 106 may be of the same type as the module 102, or
    a different type. In some implementations the structurally modified feedstock can be
25  returned to module 102 for further mechanical treatment rather than being further
    mechanically treated in a separate module 106.
             After these treatments, which may be repeated as many times as required to obtain
    desired feedstock properties, the treated feedstock is delivered to a fermentation system 108.
    Mixing may be performed during fermentation, in which case the mixing is preferably
30  relatively gentle (low shear) so as to minimize damage to shear sensitive ingredients such as
    enzymes and other microorganisms. In some embodiments, jet mixing is used, as described
                                                     6

     WO 2011/103033                                                                 PCT/US2011/024470
    in USSN 61/218,832 and USSN 61/179,995, the complete disclosures of which are
    incorporated herein by reference.
              Referring again to FIG. 2, fermentation produces a crude ethanol mixture, which
    flows into a holding tank 110. Water or other solvent, and other non-ethanol components,
  5 are stripped from the crude ethanol mixture using a stripping column 112, and the ethanol is
    then distilled using a distillation unit 114, e.g., a rectifier. Distillation may be by vacuum
    distillation. Finally, the ethanol can be dried using a molecular sieve 116 and/or denatured,
    if necessary, and output to a desired shipping method.
              In some cases, the systems described herein, or components thereof, may be
 i0 portable, so that the system can be transported (e.g., by rail, truck, or marine vessel) from
    one location to another. The method steps described herein can be performed at one or
    more locations, and in some cases one or more of the steps can be performed in transit.
    Such mobile processing is described in U.S. Serial No. 12/374,549 and International
    Application No. WO 2008/011598, the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein
 is by reference.
              Any or all of the method steps described herein can be performed at ambient
    temperature. If desired, cooling and/or heating may be employed during certain steps.
    For example, the feedstock may be cooled during mechanical treatment to increase its
    brittleness. In some embodiments, cooling is employed before, during or after the initial
 ?0 mechanical treatment and/or the subsequent mechanical treatment. Cooling may be
    performed as described in 12/502,629, the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein
    by reference. Moreover, the temperature in the fermentation system 108 may be
    controlled to enhance saccharification and/or fermentation.
              The individual steps of the methods described above, as well as the materials used,
25  will now be described in further detail.
    MECHANICAL TREATMENTS
              Mechanical treatments of the feedstock may include, for example, cutting,
    milling, grinding, pressing, shearing or chopping.
              The initial mechanical treatment step may, in some implementations, include
30  reducing the size of the feedstock. In some cases, loose feedstock (e.g., recycled paper or
                                                       7

     WO 2011/103033                                                            PCT/US2011/024470
    switchgrass) is initially prepared by shearing and/or shredding. In this initial preparation
    step screens and/or magnets can be used to remove oversized or undesirable objects such
    as, for example, rocks or nails from the feed stream.
             In addition to this size reduction, which can be performed initially and/or later
  5 during processing, mechanical treatment can also be advantageous for "opening up,"
    "stressing," breaking or shattering the biomass materials, making the cellulose of the
    materials more susceptible to chain scission and/or disruption of crystalline structure
    during the structural modification treatment. The open materials can also be more
    susceptible to oxidation when irradiated.
 10          As discussed above, after irradiation, or other structure-modifying treatment,
    subsequent mechanical treatment can break bonds within the structure of the material that
    have been weakened or micro-fractured by the structure-modifying treatment. This
    further breaking up of the molecular structure of the material tends to reduce the
    recalcitrance of the material and make it more susceptible to conversion, e.g., by a
 i5 microorganism such as a bacterium or enzyme.
    Shearing/Screening
             In some implementations, the feedstock, either before or after structural
    modification, is sheared, e.g., with a rotary knife cutter. The feedstock may also be
 ?0 screened. In some embodiments, the shearing of the feedstock and the passing of the
    material through a screen are performed concurrently.
             If desired, the feedstock can be cut prior to the initial mechanical treatment (e.g.,
    shearing), for example using a shredder or other cutter. In some cases, shredding and
    shearing is accomplished using a combined "shredder-shearer train." Multiple shredder
25  shearer trains can be arranged in series, for example two shredder-shearer trains can be
    arranged in series with output from the first shearer fed as input to the second shredder.
    Multiple passes through shredder-shearer trains can decrease particle size and increase
    overall surface area.
30  Other Mechanical Treatments

     WO 2011/103033                                                            PCT/US2011/024470
             Other methods of mechanically treating the feedstock include, for example,
    milling or grinding. Milling may be performed using, for example, a hammer mill, ball
    mill, colloid mill, conical or cone mill, disk mill, edge mill, Wiley mill or grist mill.
    Grinding may be performed using, for example, a cutting/impact type grinder. Specific
  5 examples of grinders include stone grinders, pin grinders, coffee grinders, and burr
    grinders. Grinding or milling may be provided, for example, by a reciprocating pin or
    other element, as is the case in a pin mill. Other mechanical treatment methods include
    mechanical ripping or tearing, other methods that apply pressure to the fibers, and air
    attrition milling. Suitable mechanical treatments further include any other technique that
 10 continues the disruption of the internal structure of the material that was initiated by the
    previous processing steps.
             Suitable cutting/impact type grinders include those commercially available from
    IKA Works under the tradenames A 10 Analysis Grinder and M10 Universal Grinder.
    Such grinders include metal beaters and blades that rotate at high speed (e.g., greater than
 i5 30 m/s or even greater than 50 m/s) within a milling chamber. The milling chamber may
    be at ambient temperature during operation, or may be cooled, e.g., by water or dry ice.
    Processing Conditions
             The feedstock can be mechanically treated in a dry state, a hydrated state (e.g.,
 ?0 having up to 10 percent by weight absorbed water), or in a wet state, e.g., having between
    about 10 percent and about 75 percent by weight water. In some cases, the feedstock can
    be mechanically treated under a gas (such as a stream or atmosphere of gas other than
    air), e.g., oxygen or nitrogen, or steam.
             It is generally preferred that the feedstock be mechanically treated in a
25  substantially dry condition, e.g., having less than 10 percent by weight absorbed water
    and preferably less than five percent by weight absorbed water) as dry fibers tend to be
    more brittle and thus easier to structurally disrupt. In a preferred embodiment, a
    substantially dry, structurally modified feedstock is ground using a cutting/impact type
    grinder.
30           However, in some embodiments the feedstock can be dispersed in a liquid and
    wet milled. The liquid is preferably the liquid medium in which the treated feedstock
                                                    9

     WO 2011/103033                                                             PCT/US2011/024470
    will be further processed, e.g., saccharified. It is generally preferred that wet milling be
    concluded before any shear or heat sensitive ingredients, such as enzymes and nutrients,
    are added to the liquid medium, since wet milling is generally a relatively high shear
    process. In some embodiments, the wet milling equipment includes a rotor/stator
  5 arrangement. Wet milling machines include the colloidal and cone mills that are
    commercially available from IKA Works, Wilmington, NC (-vww\ikausa.com).
            If desired, lignin can be removed from any feedstock that includes lignin. Also,
    to aid in the breakdown of the feedstock, in some embodiments the feedstock can be
    cooled prior to, during, or after irradiation and/or mechanical treatment, as described in
 10 12/502,629, the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition,
    or alternatively, the feedstock can be treated with heat, a chemical (e.g., mineral acid,
    base or a strong oxidizer such as sodium hypochlorite) and/or an enzyme. However, in
    many embodiments such additional treatments are unnecessary due to the effective
    reduction in recalcitrance that is provided by the combination of the mechanical and
 i5 structure modifying treatments.
    Characteristics of the Treated Feedstock
            Mechanical treatment systems can be configured to produce feed streams with
    specific characteristics such as, for example, specific bulk densities, maximum sizes,
 ?0 fiber length-to-width ratios, or surface areas ratios.
            In some embodiments, a BET surface area of the mechanically treated biomass
    material is greater than 0.1 m2/g, e.g., greater than 0.25 m2/g, greater than 0.5 m 2/g,
    greater than 1.0 m 2/g, greater than 1.5 m 2/g, greater than 1.75 m 2/g, greater than 5.0 m 2/g,
    greater than 10 m 2/g, greater than 25 m 2/g, greater than 35 m 2/g, greater than 50m 2/g,
25  greater than 60 m 2/g, greater than 75 m 2/g, greater than 100 m 2/g, greater than 150 m 2/g,
    greater than 200 m 2/g, or even greater than 250 m 2/g.
            A porosity of the mechanically treated feedstock, before or after structural
    modification, can be, e.g., greater than 20 percent, greater than 25 percent, greater than
    35 percent, greater than 50 percent, greater than 60 percent, greater than 70 percent, e.g.,
30  greater than 80 percent, greater than 85 percent, greater than 90 percent, greater than 92
                                                    10

     WO 2011/103033                                                            PCT/US2011/024470
    percent, greater than 94 percent, greater than 95 percent, greater than 97.5 percent,
    greater than 99 percent, or even greater than 99.5 percent.
             The porosity and BET surface area of the material generally increase after each
    mechanical treatment and after structural modification.
  5          If the biomass material is fibrous, in some implementations, fibers of the
    mechanically treated material can have a relatively large average length-to-diameter ratio
    (e.g., greater than 20-to-1), even after the material has been mechanically treated more
    than once. In addition, the fibers may have a relatively narrow length and/or length-to
    diameter ratio distribution.
 10          As used herein, average fiber widths (i.e., diameters) are those determined
    optically by randomly selecting approximately 5,000 fibers. Average fiber lengths are
    corrected length-weighted lengths. BET (Brunauer, Emmet and Teller) surface areas are
    multi-point surface areas, and porosities are those determined by mercury porosimetry.
             If the biomass material is fibrous, the average length-to-diameter ratio of fibers of
 is the mechanically treated material can be, e.g., greater than 8/1, e.g., greater than 10/1,
    greater than 15/1, greater than 20/1, greater than 25/1, or greater than 50/1. An average
    length of the fibers can be, e.g., between about 0.5 mm and 2.5 mm, e.g., between about
    0.75 mm and 1.0 mm, and an average width (i.e., diameter) of the fibers can be, e.g.,
    between about 5 pim and 50 pim, e.g., between about 10 pim and 30 pim.
 ?o          In some embodiments in which the biomass material is fibrous, a standard
    deviation of the length of fibers of the mechanically treated material is less than 60
    percent of an average length of the fibers, e.g., less than 50 percent of the average length,
    less than 40 percent of the average length, less than 25 percent of the average length, less
    than 10 percent of the average length, less than 5 percent of the average length, or even
25  less than 1 percent of the average length.
    Densification
             Densified materials can be processed by any of the methods described herein.
    A mechanically treated feedstock having a low bulk density can be densified to a product
    having a higher bulk density. For example, a feedstock material having a bulk density of
30  0.05 g/ cm 3 can be densified by sealing the material in a relatively gas impermeable
                                                    11

     WO 2011/103033                                                               PCT/US2011/024470
    structure, e.g., a bag made of polyethylene or a bag made of alternating layers of
    polyethylene and a nylon, and then evacuating the entrapped gas, e.g., air, from the
    structure. After evacuation of the air from the structure, the material can have, e.g., a
    bulk density of greater than 0.3 g/cm 3, e.g., 0.5 g/cm 3 , 0.6 g/cm 3, 0.7 g/cm 3 or more, e.g.,
  5 0.85 g/ cm 3 . After densification, the product can processed by any of the methods
    described herein. This can be advantageous when it is desirable to transport the material
    to another location, e.g., a remote manufacturing plant, where the material can be added
    to a solution, e.g., to saccharify or ferment the material. Any material described herein
    can be densified, e.g., for transport or storage, and then "opened up" for further
 10 processing by any one or more methods described herein. Densification is described, for
    example, in U.S. Serial No. 12/429,045, the full disclosure of which is incorporated
    herein by reference.
    STRUCTURAL MODIFICATION TREATMENT
             The feedstock is subjected to one or more structural modification treatments to
 is modify its structure by, for example, reducing the average molecular weight of the
    feedstock, changing the crystalline structure of the feedstock (e.g., by microfracturing within
    the structure which may or may not alter the crystallinity as measured by diffractive
    methods), and/or increasing the surface area and/or porosity of the feedstock. In some
    embodiments, structural modification reduces the molecular weight of the feedstock
 ?0 and/or increases the level of oxidation of the feedstock.
             Processes that modify the structure of the feedstock include one or more of
    irradiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis, chemical treatment (e.g., acid or base
    treatment) and steam explosion. In some preferred implementations, the structure is
    modified by a process that includes irradiation. When irradiation is used, the process can
25  further include one or more of sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis, chemical treatment, and
    steam explosion.
    Radiation Treatment
             Irradiating the combination can include subjecting the combination to accelerated
    electrons, such as electrons having an energy of greater than about 2 MeV, 4MeV, 6
30  MeV, or even greater than about 8 MeV, for example from about 2.0 to 8.0 MeV or from
                                                   12

      WO 2011/103033                                                           PCT/US2011/024470
    about 4.0 to 6.0 MeV. In some embodiments, electrons are accelerated to, for example, a
    speed of greater than 75 percent of the speed of light, e.g., greater than 85, 90, 95, or 99
    percent of the speed of light.
             In some instances, the irradiation is performed at a dosage rate of greater than
  5 about 0.25 Mrad per second, e.g., greater than about 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, or even
    greater than about 2.5 Mrad per second. In some embodiments, the irradiating is
    performed at a dose rate of between 5.0 and 1500.0 kilorads/hour, e.g., between 10.0 and
    750.0 kilorads/hour or between 50.0 and 350.0 kilorads/hours.
             In some embodiments, the irradiating (with any radiation source or a combination
 10 of sources) is performed until the material receives a dose of at least 0.1 Mrad, at least
    0.25 Mrad, e.g., at least 1.0 Mrad, at least 2.5 Mrad, at least 5.0 Mrad, at least 10.0 Mrad,
    at least 60 Mrad or at least 100 Mrad. In some embodiments, the irradiating is performed
    until the material receives a dose of from about 0.1 Mrad to about 500 Mrad, from about
    0.5 Mrad to about 200 Mrad, from about 1 Mrad to about 100 Mrad, or from about 5
 is Mrad to about 60 Mrad. In some embodiments, a relatively low dose of radiation is
    applied, e.g., less than 60 Mrad.
             Radiation can be applied to any sample that is dry or wet, or even dispersed in a
    liquid, such as water. For example, irradiation can be performed on cellulosic and/or
    lignocellulosic material in which less than about 25 percent by weight of the cellulosic
 ?0 and/or lignocellulosic material has surfaces wetted with a liquid, such as water. In some
    embodiments, irradiating is performed on cellulosic and/or lignocellulosic material in
    which substantially none of the cellulosic and/or lignocellulosic material is wetted with a
    liquid, such as water.
             In some embodiments, any processing described herein occurs after the cellulosic
25  and/or lignocellulosic material remains dry as acquired or has been dried, e.g., using heat
    and/or reduced pressure. For example, in some embodiments, the cellulosic and/or
    lignocellulosic material has less than about five percent by weight retained water,
    measured at 25 0C and at fifty percent relative humidity.
             Radiation can be applied while the cellulosic and/or lignocellulosic material is
30  exposed to air, oxygen-enriched air, or even oxygen itself, or blanketed by an inert gas
    such as nitrogen, argon, or helium. When maximum oxidation is desired, an oxidizing
                                                    13

     WO 2011/103033                                                            PCT/US2011/024470
    environment is utilized, such as air or oxygen and the distance from the radiation source
    is optimized to maximize reactive gas formation, e.g., ozone and/or oxides of nitrogen.
             Radiation may be applied under a pressure of greater than about 2.5 atmospheres,
    such as greater than 5, 10, 15, 20, or even greater than about 50 atmospheres.
  5          Irradiating can be performed utilizing an ionizing radiation, such as gamma rays,
    x-rays, energetic ultraviolet radiation, such as ultraviolet C radiation having a wavelength
    of from about 100 nm to about 280 nm, a beam of particles, such as a beam of electrons,
    slow neutrons or alpha particles. In some embodiments, irradiating includes two or more
    radiation sources, such as gamma rays and a beam of electrons, which can be applied in
 i0 either order or concurrently.
             In some embodiments, energy deposited in a material that releases an electron
    from its atomic orbital is used to irradiate the materials. The radiation may be provided
    by 1) heavy charged particles, such as alpha particles or protons, 2) electrons, produced,
    for example, in beta decay or electron beam accelerators, or 3) electromagnetic radiation,
 is for example, gamma rays, x rays, or ultraviolet rays. In one approach, radiation produced
    by radioactive substances can be used to irradiate the feedstock. In some embodiments,
    any combination in any order or concurrently of (1) through (3) may be utilized.
             In some instances when chain scission is desirable and/or polymer chain
    functionalization is desirable, particles heavier than electrons, such as protons, helium
 ?0 nuclei, argon ions, silicon ions, neon ions, carbon ions, phoshorus ions, oxygen ions or
    nitrogen ions can be utilized. When ring-opening chain scission is desired, positively
    charged particles can be utilized for their Lewis acid properties for enhanced ring
    opening chain scission.
             In some embodiments, the irradiated biomass has a number average molecular
25  weight   (MN2)  that is lower than the number average molecular weight of the biomass
    prior to irradiation  (TMN1)  by more than about 10 percent, e.g., 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50
    percent, 60 percent, or even more than about 75 percent.
             In some embodiments, the starting number average molecular weight (prior to
    irradiation) is from about 200,000 to about 3,200,000, e.g., from about 250,000 to about
30  1,000,000 or from about 250,000 to about 700,000, and the number average molecular
    weight after irradiation is from about 50,000 to about 200,000, e.g., from about 60,000 to
                                                   14

     WO 2011/103033                                                               PCT/US2011/024470
    about 150,000 or from about 70,000 to about 125,000. However, in some embodiments,
    e.g., after extensive irradiation, it is possible to have a number average molecular weight
    of less than about 10,000 or even less than about 5,000.
             In some instances, the irradiated biomass has cellulose that has as crystallinity
  5 (TC2)  that is lower than the crystallinity (TC1) of the cellulose of the biomass prior to
    irradiation. For example, (TC2 ) can be lower than (TCi) by more than about 10 percent,
    e.g., 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, or even more than about 50 percent.
             In some embodiments, the starting crystallinity index (prior to irradiation) is from
    about 40 to about 87.5 percent, e.g., from about 50 to about 75 percent or from about 60
 l0 to about 70 percent, and the crystallinity index after irradiation is from about 10 to about
    50 percent, e.g., from about 15 to about 45 percent or from about 20 to about 40 percent.
    However, in some embodiments, e.g., after extensive irradiation, it is possible to have a
    crystallinity index of lower than 5 percent. In some embodiments, the material after
    irradiation is substantially amorphous.
 15          In some embodiments, the irradiated biomass can have a level of oxidation         (T 0 2)
    that is higher than the level of oxidation   (T 0 1) of the biomass prior to irradiation. A
    higher level of oxidation of the material can aid in its dispersability, swellability and/or
    solubility, further enhancing the materials susceptibility to chemical, enzymatic or
    biological attack. The irradiated biomass material can also have more hydroxyl groups,
 ?0 aldehyde groups, ketone groups, ester groups or carboxylic acid groups, which can
    increase its hydrophilicity.
             Ionizing Radiation
             Each form of radiation ionizes the biomass via particular interactions, as
    determined by the energy of the radiation. Heavy charged particles primarily ionize
25  matter via Coulomb scattering; furthermore, these interactions produce energetic
    electrons that may further ionize matter. Alpha particles are identical to the nucleus of a
    helium atom and are produced by the alpha decay of various radioactive nuclei, such as
    isotopes of bismuth, polonium, astatine, radon, francium, radium, several actinides, such
    as actinium, thorium, uranium, neptunium, curium, californium, americium, and
30  plutonium.

             When particles are utilized, they can be neutral (uncharged), positively charged or
    negatively charged. When charged, the charged particles can bear a single positive or
    negative charge, or multiple charges, e.g., one, two, three or even four or more charges.
    In instances in which chain scission is desired, positively charged particles may be
  5 desirable, in part, due to their acidic nature. When particles are utilized, the particles can
    have the mass of a resting electron, or greater, e.g., 500, 1000, 1500, or 2000 or more,
    e.g., 10,000 or even 100,000 times the mass of a resting electron. For example, the
    particles can have a mass of from about 1 atomic unit to about 150 atomic units, e.g.,
    from about 1 atomic unit to about 50 atomic units, or from about I to about 25, e.g., 1, 2,
 10 3, 4, 5, 10, 12 or 15 amu. Accelerators used to accelerate the particles can be electrostatic
    DC, electrodynamic DC, RF linear, magnetic induction linear, or continuous wave. For
    example, cyclotron type accelerators are available from IBA, Belgium, such as the
    Rhodotron@ system, while DC type accelerators are available from RDI, now IBA
    Industrial, such as the Dynamitron*. Exemplary ions and ion accelerators are discussed

             Electrons interact via Coulomb scattering and bremsstrahlung radiation produced
    by changes in the velocity of electrons. Electrons may be produced by radioactive nuclei
    that undergo beta decay, such as isotopes of iodine, cesium, technetium, and iridium.
    Alternatively, an electron gun can be used as an electron source via thermionic emission.
25           Electromagnetic radiation interacts via three processes: photoelectric absorption,
    Compton scattering, and pair production. The dominating interaction is determined by
    the energy of the incident radiation and the atomic number of the material. The
    summation of interactions contributing to the absorbed radiation in cellulosic material
    can be expressed by the mass absorption coefficient (see "Ionization Radiation" in
30  PCT/US2007/022719).

            Electromagnetic radiation can be subclassified as gamma rays, x rays, ultraviolet
    rays, infrared rays, microwaves, or radiowaves, depending on wavelength.
            Gamma radiation has the advantage of a significant penetration depth into a
    variety of material in the sample. Sources of gamma rays include radioactive nuclei, such
  5 as isotopes of cobalt, calcium, technicium, chromium, gallium, indium, iodine, iron,
    krypton, samarium, selenium, sodium, thalium, and xenon.
            Sources of x rays include electron beam collision with metal targets, such as
    tungsten or molybdenum or alloys, or compact light sources, such as those produced
    commercially by Lyncean.
 10         Sources for ultraviolet radiation include deuterium or cadmium lamps.
            Sources for infrared radiation include sapphire, zinc, or selenide window ceramic
    lamps.
            Sources for microwaves include klystrons, Slevin type RF sources, or atom beam
    sources that employ hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen gases.
 15
            Electron Beam
            In some embodiments, a beam of electrons is used as the radiation source. A
    beam of electrons has the advantages of high dose rates (e.g., 1, 5, or even 10 Mrad per
    second), high throughput, less containment, and less confinement equipment. Electrons
 ?0 can also be more efficient at causing chain scission. In addition, electrons having
    energies of 4-10 MeV can have a penetration depth of 5 to 30 mm or more, such as 40
    mm.
            Electron beams can be generated, e.g., by electrostatic generators, cascade
    generators, transformer generators, low energy accelerators with a scanning system, low
25  energy accelerators with a linear cathode, linear accelerators, and pulsed accelerators.
    Electrons as an ionizing radiation source can be useful, e.g., for relatively thin piles of
    materials, e.g., less than 0.5 inch, e.g., less than 0.4 inch, 0.3 inch, 0.2 inch, or less than
    0.1 inch. In some embodiments, the energy of each electron of the electron beam is from
    about 0.3 MeV to about 2.0 MeV (million electron volts), e.g., from about 0.5 MeV to
30  about 1.5 MeV, or from about 0.7 MeV to about 1.25 MeV.

            In some embodiments, electrons used to treat biomass material can have average
    energies of 0.05 c or more (e.g., 0.10 c or more, 0.2 c or more, 0.3 c or more, 0.4 c or
    more, 0.5 c or more, 0.6 c or more, 0.7 c or more, 0.8 c or more, 0.9 c or more, 0.99 c or
    more, 0.9999 c or more), where c corresponds to the vacuum velocity of light.
  5         Electron beam irradiation devices may be procured commercially from Ion Beam
    Applications, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium or the Titan Corporation, San Diego, CA.
    Typical electron energies can be 1 MeV, 2 MeV, 4.5 MeV, 7.5 MeV, or 10 MeV.
    Typical electron beam irradiation device power can be 1 kW, 5 kW, 10 kW, 20 kW, 50
    kW, 100 kW, 250 kW, 500 kW, 1000 kW, or even 1500 kW or more. Effectiveness of
 10 depolymerization of the feedstock slurry depends on the electron energy used and the
    dose applied, while exposure time depends on the power and dose. Typical doses may
    take values of 1 kGy, 5 kGy, 10 kGy, 20 kGy, 50 kGy, 100 kGy, 200 kGy, 500 kGy,
    1000 kGy, 1500 kGy, or 2000 kGy.
            Tradeoffs in considering electron beam irradiation device power specifications
 is include cost to operate, capital costs, depreciation, and device footprint. Tradeoffs in
    considering exposure dose levels of electron beam irradiation would be energy costs and
    environment, safety, and health (ESH) concerns. Tradeoffs in considering electron
    energies include energy costs; here, a lower electron energy may be advantageous in
    encouraging depolymerization of certain feedstock slurry (see, for example, Bouchard, et
 ?0 al, Cellulose (2006) 13: 601-610).
            It may be advantageous to provide a double-pass of electron beam irradiation in
    order to provide a more effective depolymerization process. For example, the feedstock
    transport device could direct the feedstock (in dry or slurry form) underneath and in a
    reverse direction to its initial transport direction. Double-pass systems can allow thicker
25  feedstock slurries to be processed and can provide a more uniform depolymerization
    through the thickness of the feedstock slurry.
            The electron beam irradiation device can produce either a fixed beam or a
    scanning beam. A scanning beam may be advantageous with large scan sweep length
    and high scan speeds, as this would effectively replace a large, fixed beam width.
30  Further, available sweep widths of 0.5 m, Im, 2 m or more are available.

            Ion Particle Beams
            Particles heavier than electrons can be utilized to irradiate carbohydrates or
    materials that include carbohydrates, e.g., cellulosic materials, lignocellulosic materials,
    starchy materials, or mixtures of any of these and others described herein. For example,
  5 protons, helium nuclei, argon ions, silicon ions, neon ions carbon ions, phoshorus ions,
    oxygen ions or nitrogen ions can be utilized. In some embodiments, particles heavier
    than electrons can induce higher amounts of chain scission. In some instances, positively
    charged particles can induce higher amounts of chain scission than negatively charged
    particles due to their acidity.
 10         Heavier particle beams can be generated, e.g., using linear accelerators or
    cyclotrons. In some embodiments, the energy of each particle of the beam is from about
    1.0 MeV/atomic unit to about 6,000 MeV/atomic unit, e.g., from about 3 MeV/ atomic
    unit to about 4,800 MeV/atomic unit, or from about 10 MeV/atomic unit to about 1,000
    MeV/atomic unit.

    disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
            Electromagnetic Radiation
            In embodiments in which the irradiating is performed with electromagnetic
 ?0 radiation, the electromagnetic radiation can have, e.g., energy per photon (in electron
    volts) of greater than 102 eV, e.g., greater than 103 , 104 , 105, 106, or even greater than 107
    eV. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation has energy per photon of
    between 104 and 107 , e.g., between 105 and 106 eV. The electromagnetic radiation can
    have a frequency of, e.g., greater than 1016 hz, greater than 1017 hz, 1018, 1019, 102, or
25  even greater than 1021 hz. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation has a
    frequency of between 1018 and 1022 hz, e.g., between 1019 to 1021 hz.
            Combinations of Radiation Treatments
            In some embodiments, two or more radiation sources are used, such as two or
30  more ionizing radiations. For example, samples can be treated, in any order, with a beam
    of electrons, followed by gamma radiation and UV light having wavelengths from about
                                                   19

     WO 2011/103033                                                             PCT/US2011/024470
    100 nm to about 280 nm. In some embodiments, samples are treated with three ionizing
    radiation sources, such as a beam of electrons, gamma radiation, and energetic UV light.
    Ouenching and Controlled Functionalization of Biomass
  5          After treatment with one or more ionizing radiations, such as photonic radiation
    (e.g., X-rays or gamma-rays), e-beam radiation or particles heavier than electrons that are
    positively or negatively charged (e.g., protons or carbon ions), any of the mixtures of
    carbohydrate-containing materials and inorganic materials described herein become
    ionized; that is, they include radicals at levels that are detectable with an electron spin
 10 resonance spectrometer. The current practical limit of detection of the radicals is about
    1014  spins at room temperature. After ionization, any biomass material that has been
    ionized can be quenched to reduce the level of radicals in the ionized biomass, e.g., such
    that the radicals are no longer detectable with the electron spin resonance spectrometer.
    For example, the radicals can be quenched by the application of a sufficient pressure to
 is the biomass and/or by utilizing a fluid in contact with the ionized biomass, such as a gas
    or liquid, that reacts with (quenches) the radicals. The use of a gas or liquid to at least aid
    in the quenching of the radicals also allows the operator to control functionalization of
    the ionized biomass with a desired amount and kind of functional groups, such as
    carboxylic acid groups, enol groups, aldehyde groups, nitro groups, nitrile groups, amino
 ?o groups, alkyl amino groups, alkyl groups, chloroalkyl groups or chlorofluoroalkyl groups.
    In some instances, such quenching can improve the stability of some of the ionized
    biomass materials. For example, quenching can improve the resistance of the biomass to
    oxidation. Functionalization by quenching can also improve the solubility of any
    biomass described herein, can improve its thermal stability, which can be important in the
25  manufacture of composites, and can improve material utilization by various
    microorganisms. For example, the functional groups imparted to the biomass material by
    quenching can act as receptor sites for attachment by microorganisms, e.g., to enhance
    cellulose hydrolysis by various microorganisms.
             If the ionized biomass remains in the atmosphere, it will be oxidized, such as to
30  an extent that carboxylic acid groups are generated by reaction with the atmospheric
    oxygen. In some instances with some materials, such oxidation is desired because it can
                                                   20

    aid in the further breakdown in molecular weight of the carbohydrate-containing biomass,
    and the oxidation groups, e.g., carboxylic acid groups can be helpful for solubility and
    microorganism utilization in some instances. However, since the radicals can "live" for
    some time after irradiation, e.g., longer than 1 day, 5 days, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months
  5 or even longer than 1 year, material properties can continue to change over time, which in
    some instances, can be undesirable.

    Sonication, Pyrolysis, Oxidation
            One or more sonication, pyrolysis, and/or oxidative processing sequences can be
    used to structurally modify the mechanically treated feedstock. Any of these processes
 i5 can be used alone or in combination with each other and/or with irradiation. These
    processes are described in detail in U.S. Serial No. 12/429,045, the full disclosure of
    which is incorporated herein by reference.
    Other Processes
            Steam explosion can be used alone without any of the processes described herein,
20  or in combination with any of the processes described herein.
            Any processing technique described herein can be used at pressure above or
    below normal, earth-bound atmospheric pressure. For example, any process that utilizes
    radiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis, steam explosion, or combinations of any of
    these processes to provide materials that include a carbohydrate can be performed under
25  high pressure, which can increase reaction rates. For example, any process or
    combination of processes can be performed at a pressure greater than about greater than
    25 MPa, e.g., greater than 50 MPa, 75 MPa, 100 MPa, 150 MPa, 200 MPa, 250 MPa, 350
    MPa, 500 MPa, 750 MPa, 1,000 MPa, or greater than 1,500 MPa.

    PRIMARY PROCESSES
    Saccharification
            In order to convert the treated feedstock to a form that can be readily fermented,
    in some implementations the cellulose in the feedstock is first hydrolyzed to low
  5 molecular weight carbohydrates, such as sugars, by a saccharifying agent, e.g., an
    enzyme, a process referred to as saccharification. In some implementations, the
    saccharifying agent comprises an acid, e.g., a mineral acid. When an acid is used, co
    products may be generated that are toxic to microorganisms, in which case the process
    can further include removing such co-products. Removal may be performed using an
 10 activated carbon, e.g., activated charcoal, or other suitable techniques.
            The materials that include the cellulose are treated with the enzyme, e.g., by
    combining the material and the enzyme in a solvent, e.g., in an aqueous solution.
            Enzymes and biomass-destroying organisms that break down biomass, such as the
    cellulose and/or the lignin portions of the biomass, contain or manufacture various
 15 cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases), ligninases or various small molecule biomass
    destroying metabolites. These enzymes may be a complex of enzymes that act
    synergistically to degrade crystalline cellulose or the lignin portions of biomass.
    Examples of cellulolytic enzymes include: endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and
    cellobiases (0-glucosidases). A cellulosic substrate is initially hydrolyzed by
 ?0 endoglucanases at random locations producing oligomeric intermediates. These
    intermediates are then substrates for exo-splitting glucanases such as cellobiohydrolase to
    produce cellobiose from the ends of the cellulose polymer. Cellobiose is a water-soluble
    1,4-linked dimer of glucose. Finally cellobiase cleaves cellobiose to yield glucose.
    Fermentation
25          Microorganisms can produce a number of useful intermediates and products by
    fermenting a low molecular weight sugar produced by saccharifying the treated biomass
    materials. For example, fermentation or other bioprocesses can produce alcohols, organic
    acids, hydrocarbons, hydrogen, proteins or mixtures of any of these materials.
            Yeast and Zymomonas bacteria, for example, can be used for fermentation or
30  conversion. Other microorganisms are discussed in the Materials section, below. The
                                                  22

     WO 2011/103033                                                            PCT/US2011/024470
    optimum pH for yeast is from about pH 4 to 5, while the optimum pH for Zymomonas is
    from about pH 5 to 6. Typical fermentation times are about 24 to 96 hours with
    temperatures in the range of 26 'C to 40 'C, however thermophilic microorganisms
    prefer higher temperatures.
  5         Mobile fermentors can be utilized, as described in U.S. Provisional Patent
    Application Serial 60/832,735, now Published International Application No. WO
    2008/011598. Similarly, the saccharification equipment can be mobile. Further,
    saccharification and/or fermentation may be performed in part or entirely during transit.
    POST-PROCESSING
 10 Distillation
            After fermentation, the resulting fluids can be distilled using, for example, a "beer
    column" to separate ethanol and other alcohols from the majority of water and residual
    solids. The vapor exiting the beer column can be, e.g., 35% by weight ethanol and can be
    fed to a rectification column. A mixture of nearly azeotropic (92.5%) ethanol and water
 is from the rectification column can be purified to pure (99.5%) ethanol using vapor-phase
    molecular sieves. The beer column bottoms can be sent to the first effect of a three-effect
    evaporator. The rectification column reflux condenser can provide heat for this first
    effect. After the first effect, solids can be separated using a centrifuge and dried in a
    rotary dryer. A portion (25%) of the centrifuge effluent can be recycled to fermentation
20  and the rest sent to the second and third evaporator effects. Most of the evaporator
    condensate can be returned to the process as fairly clean condensate with a small portion
    split off to waste water treatment to prevent build-up of low-boiling compounds.
    INTERMEDIATES AND PRODUCTS
            Using, e.g., such primary processes and/or post-processing, the treated biomass
25  can be converted to one or more products, such as energy, fuels, foods and materials.
    Specific examples of products include, but are not limited to, hydrogen, alcohols (e.g.,
    monohydric alcohols or dihydric alcohols, such as ethanol, n-propanol or n-butanol),
    sugars, biodiesel, organic acids (e.g., acetic acid and/or lactic acid), hydrocarbons, co
    products (e.g., proteins, such as cellulolytic proteins (enzymes) or single cell proteins),

    and mixtures of any of these. Other examples include carboxylic acids, such as acetic
    acid or butyric acid, salts of a carboxylic acid, a mixture of carboxylic acids and salts of
    carboxylic acids and esters of carboxylic acids (e.g., methyl, ethyl and n-propyl esters),
    ketones, aldehydes, alpha, beta unsaturated acids, such as acrylic acid and olefins, such as
  5 ethylene. Other alcohols and alcohol derivatives include propanol, propylene glycol, 1,4
    butanediol, 1,3-propanediol, methyl or ethyl esters of any of these alcohols. Other
    products include methyl acrylate, methylmethacrylate, lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric
    acid, succinic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, a salt of any of the acids and a mixture of
    any of the acids and respective salts.

    MATERIAL S
    Biomass Materials

    include paper and paper products (e.g., polycoated paper and Kraft paper), wood, wood
    related materials, e.g., particle board, grasses, rice hulls, bagasse, jute, hemp, flax,
    bamboo, sisal, abaca, straw, corn cobs, coconut hair; and materials high in c-cellulose
    content, e.g., cotton. Feedstocks can be obtained from virgin scrap textile materials, e.g.,
20  remnants, post consumer waste, e.g., rags. When paper products are used they can be
    virgin materials, e.g., scrap virgin materials, or they can be post-consumer waste. Aside
    from virgin raw materials, post-consumer, industrial (e.g., offal), and processing waste
    (e.g., effluent from paper processing) can also be used as fiber sources. Biomass
    feedstocks can also be obtained or derived from human (e.g., sewage), animal or plant
25  wastes. Additional cellulosic and lignocellulosic materials have been described in U.S.
    Patent Nos. 6,448,307, 6,258,876, 6,207,729, 5,973,035 and 5,952,105.
