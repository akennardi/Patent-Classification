Eicosapentaenoic acid
         [0012] In one embodiment, compositions of the invention comprise EPA as an active
ingredient.   The term "EPA" as used herein refers to eicosapentaenoic acid (e.g. eicosa
5,8,11,14,17-pentaenoic     acid) and/or a pharmaceutically      acceptable ester, derivative,
conjugate or salt thereof, or mixtures of any of the foregoing. The term "pharmaceutically
acceptable" in the present context means that the substance in question does not produce
unacceptable toxicity to the subject or interaction with other components of the composition.
         [0013] In one embodiment, the EPA comprises all-cis eicosa-5,8,11,14,17-pentaenoic
acid. In another embodiment, the EPA is in the form of an eicosapentaenoic acid ester (also
referred to herein as E-EPA or ethyl-EPA). In another embodiment, the EPA comprises a C1
-  C5 alkyl ester of EPA. In another embodiment, the EPA comprises eicosapentaenoic acid
methyl ester, eicosapentaenoic acid propyl ester, or eicosapentaenoic acid butyl ester. In still
another embodiment, the EPA comprises all-cis eicosa-5,8,11,14,17-pentaenoic acid ethyl
ester.
         [0014] In another embodiment, the EPA comprises lithium EPA, mono, di- or
triglyceride EPA or any other ester or salt of EPA, or the free acid form of EPA. The EPA
may also be in the form of a 2-substituted derivative or other derivative which slows down its
rate of oxidation but does not otherwise change its biological action to any substantial degree.
         [0015] In one embodiment, EPA present in a composition of the invention comprises
ultra-pure EPA.     The term "ultra-pure" as used herein with respect to EPA refers to a
composition comprising at least 96% by weight EPA (as the term "EPA" is defined and
exemplified herein). Ultra-pure EPA can comprise even higher purity EPA, for example at
least 97% by weight EPA or at least 98% by weight EPA, wherein the EPA is any form of
                                                 3

EPA as set forth herein. Ultra-pure EPA can further be defined (e.g. impurity profile) by any
of the description of EPA provided herein.
        [0016] In another embodiment, the EPA comprises an EPA-Fatty Acid conjugate
wherein EPA is conjugated to another molecule of EPA or to another fatty acid. In one
embodiment, the EPA-Fatty Acid conjugate comprises a diester formed between EPA and
EPA or between EPA a second fatty acid as shown in structures (1) and (II).              In one
embodiment, R1 is a fatty acid acyl group derived from EPA and R 2 is selected from H, a
fatty acid acyl of 12 to 30 carbon atoms with two or more cis or trans double bonds and fatty
alcohol groups of 12 to 30 carbon atoms, the same or different than R'.     R1 and R2 may both
be derived from EPA (EPA-EPA) or one may be derived from EPA and the second from a
different fatty acid (EPA-Fatty acid), for example gamma-linolenic acid, dihomo-gamma
linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, adrenic acid, stearidonic acid, docosapentaenoic acid n-3,
etc.). R3 is generally either hydrogen, fully hydrocarbon, or containing heteroatoms, and in
one embodiment is a CI-C     4 alkyl group.
                    R3
                    CH
                                  2

         CH2 OR1
         CH2
         CH 2 OR 2
        [0017] Synthesis of a diester conjugate can be accomplished according to methods
well known in the art, including for example, using metals, metal-chlorides, or organic acids
as catalysts; using fatty acid chlorides such as EPA-chloride, 7-linolenic acid chloride (GLA
chloride), dihomo-y-linolenic acid chloride (DGLA-chloride), linoleic acid chloride (LA
chloride), arachidonic acid chloride (AA-chloride), conjugated linoleic acid chloride (cLA
chloride), ALA-chloride, STA-chloride, ETA-chloride, DPA-chloride, etc.; and the use of
immobilized enzymes as catalysts.

enzyme. In bile acid biosynthesis, ACAT catalyzes the intracellular formation of cholesterol
esters from cholesterol.      ACAT promotes accumulation of cholesterol esters in vascular
tissues.     Agents that inhibit ACAT, therefore, are useful in preventing or treating
atherosclerosis.    Non-limiting examples of suitable ACAT inhibitors include CI-1011
(Avasimibe, Pfizer), CS-505 (Pactimibe sulfate, Sankyo Pharma), or combinations thereof.
         [0032] One or more ACAT inhibitors, if desired, are typically present in a
composition of the invention (or co-administered with EPA according to other embodiments
of the invention) in an amount of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, for example about 1 mg,
about 5 mg, about 10 mg, about 20 mg, about 30 mg, about 40 mg, about 50 mg, about 60
mg, about 70 mg, about 80 mg, about 90 mg, about 100 mg, about 125 mg, about 150 mg,

ACE inhibitors.
                                                 9

         [0033] Angiotensin I converting enzyme ("ACE") converts angiontensin I to
angiotensin 11 and inhibits bradykinin.        Because increased angiotensin Il and decreased
bradykinin levels both promote a variety of cardiovascular diseases and disorders, agents that
inhibit ACE are useful in preventing or treating cardiovascular-related diseases such as
hypertension, heart failure, diabetic neuropathy, and type 2 diabetes. Non-limiting examples
of suitable ACE inhibitors include captopril, enalapril, enaliprilat, trandolapril, moexipril,
ramipril, quinapril, perindopril, lisinopril, benazepril, fosinopril, or combinations thereof.
         [0034] One or more ACE inhibitors, if desired, are typically present in a composition
of the invention (or co-administered with EPA according to other embodiments of the
invention) in an amount of about 0.5 mg to about 50 mg, for example about 0.5 mg, about
0.75 mg, about I mg, about 1.25 mg, about 2 mg, about 2.5 mg, about 3 mg, about 4 mg,

Aldosterone antagonists.
         [0035] Aldosterone is a steroidal hormone that contributes to hypertension by
inhibiting kidney function.     Agents that compete with aldosterone for mineralo-corticoid
receptors are therefore useful in preventing or treating hypertension. Non-limiting examples
of suitable aldosterone agents include eplerenone and aldactone, or combinations thereof.
         [0036] Aldosterone antagonists, if desired, are typically present in a composition of
the invention (or co-administered with EPA according to other embodiments of the invention)
in an amount of about 5 mg to about 100 mg, for example about 5 mg, about 10 mg, about 12
mg, about 15 mg, about 20 mg, about 25 mg, about 30 mg, about 35 mg, about 40 mg, about
45 mg, about 50 mg, about 55 mg, about 60 mg, about 65 mg, about 70 mg, about 75 mg,
about 80 mg, about 85 mg, about 90 mg, about 95, or about 100 mg.
Alpha blockers.
         [0037] Alpha blockers, also called adrenergic alpha-antagonists, compete              with
adrenaline binding at a-adrenoreceptors.        Adrenaline binding at such receptors leads to
vasoconstriction and therefore hypertension. Agents that compete with adrenaline or block a
adrenoreceptors are therefore useful in preventing or treating hypertension.         Non-limiting
                                                 10

Angiotensin H receptor antagonists.
        [0040] Angiotensin 11 receptor antagonists, alternately called angiotensin receptor
blockers, ARBs, ATi-receptor antagonists, or sartans, are useful in treating hypertension,
congestive heart failure, and various other diseases and disorders. Non-limiting examples of
angiotensin Il receptor antagonists include candesartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, losartan,
valsartan, telmisartan, eprosartan, or combinations thereof.
        [0041] One or more angiotensin II receptor antagonists, if desired, are typically

CETP inhibitors.
        [0058] Cholesteryl ester transfer protein ("CETP") plays an important role in
transferring cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. Inhibition of CETP, also called plasma lipid
transfer protein, is therefore useful in preventing or treating atherosclerosis and other
cardiovascular diseases and disorders. Non-limiting examples of CETP inhibitors include
torcetrapib,  anacetrapib,   JTT-705,     BAY-60-5521,     PF-3185043,   and   CP-800569,    or
combinations thereof.
        [0059] One or more CETP inhibitors, if desired, are present in a composition of the
invention (or co-administered with EPA according to other embodiments of the invention) in
an amount sufficient to provide the subject with a dose of about 25 mg per kg body weight
("mg per kg") to about 100 mg per kg, for example about 25 mg per kg, about 30 mg per kg,
about 35 mg per kg, about 40 mg per kg, about 45 mg per kg, about 50 mg per kg, about 55
mg per kg, about 60 mg per kg, about 65 mg per kg, about 70 mg per kg, about 75 mg per kg,
about 80 mg per kg, about 85 mg per kg, about 90 mg per kg, about 95 mg per kg, or about
 100 mg per kg.
        [0060] In another embodiment, one or more CETP inhibitors, if desired, are present in
a composition of the invention          (or co-administered   with EPA according to other
embodiments of the invention) in an amount of about 100 mg to about 10 g, about 500 mg to
about 9 g, or about 750 mg to about 5 g.
Cholesterol absorption inhibitors.
                                                16

         [0061] Cholesterol   absorption    inhibitors   reduce   the  cholesterol  content    of
chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants by preventing the uptake of micellar cholesterol
from the small intestine.   As a result, less cholesterol is delivered to the liver and thereby
reduces LDL. Non-limiting examples of cholesterol absorption inhibitors include ezetimibe
and simvastatin, or combinations thereof.
         [0062] One or more cholesterol absorption inhibitors, if desired, are typically present
in a composition of the invention (or co-administered with EPA according to other
embodiments of the invention) in an amount of about I mg to about 10 mg, for example
about 1 mg, about 2 mg, about 3 mg, about 4 mg, about 5 mg, about 6 mg, about 7 mg, about
8 mg, about 9 mg, or about 10 mg; or in an amount of about 10 to about 80 mg, for example
about 10 mg, about 15 mg, about 20 mg, about 25 mg, about 30 mg, about 35 mg, about 40
mg, about 45 mg, about 50 mg, about 55 mg, about 60 mg, about 65 mg, about 70 mg, about
75 mg, or about 80 mg.
Diuretics.
         [0063] Diuretics increase urination rates forcing diuresis. Some diuretics also provide
antihypertensive effects.   Non-limiting examples of diuretics include hydrochlorothiazide,
torsemide, ethacrynic acid, furosemide, triamterene, indapamide, chlorothiazide sodium,
aliskiren, or combinations thereof.
         [0064] One or more diuretics, if desired, are typically present in a composition of the
invention (or co-administered with EPA according to other embodiments of the invention) in
an amount of: (a) about 0.25 mg to about 2.5 mg, for example about 0.25 mg, about 0.5 mg,
about 0.75 mg, about I mg, about 1.25 mg, about 1.5 mg, about 1.75 mg, about 2 mg, about
2.25 mg, or about 2.5 mg; (b) in an amount of about 5 mg to about 25 mg, for example about

mg, about 80 mg, about 85 mg, about 90 mg, about 95 mg, or about 100 mg; (d) about 10 mg
to about 50 mg, for example about 10 mg, about 12.5 mg, about 15 mg, about 17.5 mg, about
20 mg, about 22.5 mg, about 25 mg, about 30 mg, about 35 mg, about 40 mg, about 45 mg, or
about 50 mg; in an amount of about 5 mg to about 60 mg, for example about 5 mg, about 10
mg, about 15 mg, about 20 ing, about 25 mg, about 30 mg, about 35 mg, about 40 mg, about
45 mg, about 50 mg, about 55 mg, (e) or about 60 mg; in an amount of about 25 mg to about
                                                17

per mL, about 5 mg per mL, about 6 mg per mL, about 7 mg per mL, about 8 mg per mL,
about 9 mg per mL, or about 10 mg per mL.
Dyslipidemia agents.
        [0065] Dyslipidemia is a class of diseases that includes hyperlipidemia. Fredrickson's
Type I dyslipidemia (sometimes          referred to as Buerger-Gruetz      syndrome, primary
hyperlipoproteinaemia,    or familial hyperchylomicronemia) is characterized by elevated
cholesterol levels, subjects with Fredrickson's Type Ila dyslipidemia (also known as familial
hypercholesterolemia) exhibit elevated LDL levels.        Those with Fredrickson's Type Ilb
dyslipidemia   (familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia       (FCH) or secondary       combined
hyperlipoproteinemia) show increased LDL and VLDL levels.              Fredrickson's Type III
dyslipidemia (sometimes called beta disease or dysbetalipoproteinemia) features elevated
intermediate density lipoproteins ("IDL"), while Fredrickson's Type IV dyslipidemics
(sometimes called "pure hypertriglyceridemics") have elevated VLDL levels. Subjects with
Fredrickson's Type V dyslipidemia have increased VLDL and chylomicron levels.

        [0067] One or more dyslipidemia agents, if desired, are typically present in a
composition of the invention (or co-administered with EPA according to other embodiments
of the invention) in an amount of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, for example about 1 mg,
about 2 mg, about 3 mg, about 4 mg, about 5 mg, about 6 mg, about 7 mg, about 8 mg, about

about 1000 mg.
Endothelin receptor antagonists.
        [0068] Binding of endothelin-1 at endothelin-A (ETA) or endothelin-B (ETB)
receptors causes pulmonary vasoconstriction. Endothelin receptor antagonists compete with
endothelin-1 binding, thereby attenuating pulmonary vasoconstriction. Endothelin receptor
antagonists, therefore, are useful in treating pulmonary hypertension. Non-limiting examples
of endothelin receptor antagonists include ambrisentan, bosentan, volibris, thelin, or
combinations thereof.
        [0069] One or more endothelin receptor antagonists, if desired, are typically present
in a composition of the invention (or co-administered with EPA according to other
embodiments of the invention) in an amount of about I mg to about 10 mg, for example
about 1 mg, about 2 mg, about 3 mg, about 4 mg, about 5 mg, about 6 mg, about 7 mg, about
8 mg, about 9 mg, or about 10 mg; in an amount of about 50 mg to about 250 mg, for
example about 50 mg, about 75 mg, about 100 mg, about 125 mg, about 150 mg, about 175
mg, about 200 mg, about 225 mg, or about 250 mg.
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
        [0070] HMG-CoA reductase (also known as HMGR) converts HMG-CoA (3
hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme        A)    to  mevalonic  acid  (3,5-dihydroxy-3-methyl
                                                 19

pentanoic acid) along the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol. HMG-CoA reductase
inhibitors, also called statins, inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and thereby reduce cholesterol
production. As a result, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are useful in treating a variety of
cardiovascular     diseases  and   disorders   including,   for example, hypercholesterolemia,
hyperlipidemia, mixed dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, atherosclerosis, Non-limiting
examples     of HMG-CoA        reductase inhibitors include lovastatin, lovastatin + niacin,
mevastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, atorvastatin +
amlodipine besylate, simvastatin, simvistatin + niacin, ezetimibe, and pravastatin, among
others.
        [0071] One or more HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, if desired, are typically present
in a composition of the invention (or co-administered with EPA according to other
embodiments of the invention) in an amount of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, for example
about I mg, about 2 mg, about 3 mg, about 4 mg, about 5 mg, about 6 mg, about 7 mg, about
8 mg, about 9 mg, or about 10 mg; about 15 mg, about 20 mg, about 25 mg, about 30 mg,

L CA T activators.
        [0072] Lecithin-cholesterol     acyltransferase   ("LCAT") converts   cholesterol  into
cholesteryl ester.      In subjects with deficient levels of LCAT, unesterified cholesterol
accumulates in body tissues. This can lead to elevated serum levels of HDL and eventually
atherosclerosis.    LCAT activators are therefore useful in reducing serum HDL levels and
treating or preventing atherosclerosis.    Non-limiting examples of LCAT activators include
LCAT enzyme, recombinant LCAT, genetic therapy agents that include a nucleic acid
sequence coding for expression of LCAT, estrogens, estrogen analogs, and combinations
thereof for example as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,635,614 incorporated by reference
herein in its entirety.
        [0073] One or more LCAT activators, if desired, are typically present in a
composition of the invention (or co-administered with EPA according to other embodiments
                                                 20

of the invention) in an amount sufficient to raise the serum LCAT level of the subject to a
desired level.  Subjects with abnormally low LCAT serum levels may be administered an
amount of a composition of the invention comprising EPA and LCAT enzyme, estrogen,
estrogen analogs, or combinations thereof sufficient to raise the subject's serum LCAT level
to normal levels, typically about 5 tg per mL or greater. In another embodiment, subjects
with about normal LCAT serum levels may be treated with a composition of the invention
comprising EPA and LCAT enzyme, estrogen, estrogen analogs, or combinations thereof in
an amount sufficient to raise the LCAT serum level to about 6 pg per mL or more, about 7 pig
per mL or more, about 8 pg per mL or more, about 9 pg per mL or more, or about 10 pg per
mL or more.
LDL receptor inducers.
        [0074] LDL receptors are cell surface proteins. Along with adaptin, LDL receptors
bind free LDL cholesterol to form clathrin-coated vesicles, reducing serum LDL levels.
Thus, agents that induce LDL receptors further reduce serum LDL levels and are useful in
preventing or treating atherosclerosis.     A non-limiting example of LDL receptor is
lactacystin.
        [0075] One or more LDL receptor inducers, if desired, are typically present in a
composition of the invention (or co-administered with EPA according to other embodiments
of the invention) in an amount of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, for example about I mg,
about 2 mg, about 3 mg, about 4 mg, about 5 mg, about 6 mg, about 7 mg, about 8 mg, about
9 mg, or about 10 mg about 15 mg, about 20 mg, about 25 mg, about 30 mg, about 35 mg,

about 925 mg, about 950 mg, about 975 mg, or about 1000 mg.
Lp-PLA2 inhibitors.
        [0076] Compositions of the invention may comprise one or more lipoprotein
associated   phospholipase   A2    (Lp-PLA2)  inhibitors.    Lp-PLA2 hydrolyzes     oxidized
phospholipids in LDL cholesterols. High levels of Lp-PLA2 seem to trigger a cascade of
inflammatory events in atherosclerosis and an increased risk of stroke. Lp-PLA2 inhibitors,
                                             21

therefore, are useful in slowing or preventing development of atherosclerosis. Non-limiting
examples of Lp-PLA2 inhibitors include rilapladib, darapladib, and combinations thereof.
        [0077] One or more Lp-PLA2 inhibitors, if desired, are typically present in a
composition of the invention (or co-administered with EPA according to other embodiments
of the invention) in an amount of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, for example about I mg,
about 2 mg, about 3 mg, about 4 mg, about 5 mg, about 6 mg, about 7 mg, about 8 mg, about
9 mg, or about 10 mg; about 15 mg, about 20 mg, about 25 mg, about 30 mg, about 35 mg,

5-Lipoxygenase inhibitors.
        [0078] 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors are useful in accordance with various embodiments
of the invention.   Non-limiting examples of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors include VIA-2291,

Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitors.
        [0081] Microsomal     triglyceride   transfer protein  ("MTTP"     or  "MTP")      is a
heterodimeric protein involved in lipoprotein assembly. MTP inhibitors are thus useful in
slowing or preventing the production of lipoproteins and therefore cardiovascular diseases
and disorders.   Non-limiting examples of MTP inhibitors include SLx-4090, AEGR-733,
implitapide, BMS-200150, CP-346086, JTT-130, dirlotapide, and combinations thereof.

PPAR agonists and activators.
        [0085] Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ("PPARs") are nuclear receptor
proteins regulating the expression of genes by acting as transcription factors in combination
with the retinoid X receptor ("RXR"). Agents that inhibit or activate PPARs are therefore
useful in modifying the expression of certain genes including, for example, genes associated
with metabolic disorders such as hypercholesterolemia.      Non-limiting examples of PPAR
agonists and activators include fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, clofibrate, gemfibrozil,
CER-002, rosiglitazone, GW501516, RWJ 800025, KD-3010, and combinations thereof.
        [0086] One or more PPAR agonists and/or activators, if desired, are typically present

Squalene epoxidase inhibitors.
        [0090] Squalene epoxidase, also called squalene monooxygenase, catalyzes the
oxidation of squalene in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.        Thus, agents that inhibit
squalene epoxidase are useful in preventing or slowing the cholesterol production.          Non
limiting examples of squalene epoxidase inhibitors include terbinafine, naftifine, amorolfine,
butenafine,      FR194738,      NB-598,       resveratrol     (trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene),
epigallocatechin-3-0-gallate, S-allylcysteine, selenocysteine, alliin, diallyl trisulfide, diallyl
disulfide, and combinations thereof.
        [0091] One or more squalene epoxidase inhibitors, if desired, are typically present in
a composition of the invention        (or co-administered   with EPA        according to other

Thrombolytic agents.
         [0092] Thrombolytic agents dissolve blood clots. Thrombolytic agents are therefore
useful in treating cardiovascular diseases and disorders including, for example, deep vein
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, ischemic complications, unstable angina, myocardial
infarction, and venous thromboembolism, among others.             Non-limiting examples of
thrombolytic agents include fondoparinux, dalteparin, enoxaparin, apixaban, PD-348292, and
combinations thereof.

Dosage Forms
        [00106] In one embodiment, compositions of the invention are orally deliverable.
The terms "orally deliverable" or "oral administration" herein include any form of delivery of
                                              32

a therapeutic agent or a composition thereof to a subject wherein the agent or composition is
placed in the mouth of the subject, whether or not the agent or composition is swallowed.
Thus    "oral  administration"     includes  buccal     and sublingual    as well     as esophageal
administration.
         [00107] In some embodiments, compositions of the invention are in the forn of solid
dosage forms. Non-limiting examples of suitable solid dosage forms include tablets (e.g.
suspension tablets, bite suspension tablets, rapid dispersion tablets, chewable tablets, melt
tablets, effervescent tablets, bilayer tablets, etc), caplets, capsules (e.g. a soft or a hard gelatin
capsule filled with solid and/or liquids), powder (e.g. a packaged powder, a dispensable
powder or an effervescent powder), lozenges, sachets, cachets, troches, pellets, granules,
microgranules, encapsulated microgranules, powder aerosol formulations, or any other solid
dosage form reasonably adapted for oral administration.
         [00108] EPA and/or any other desired cardiovascular agent(s) can be co-formulated
in the same dosage unit, or can be individually formulated in separate dosage units.              The
terms "dose unit" and "dosage unit" herein refer to a portion of a phannaceutical composition
that contains an amount of a therapeutic agent suitable for a single administration to provide a
therapeutic effect. Such dosage units may be administered one to a plurality (i.e. I to about
10, 1 to 8, 1 to 6, 1 to 4 or I to 2) of times per day, or as many times as needed to elicit a
therapeutic response.
         [00109] In one embodiment, a composition of the invention comprises one or more
cardiovascular agents dispersed or suspended in EPA, wherein the dispersion or suspension is
present in a capsule (for example gelatin or HPMC capsule), sachet, or other dosage form or

        [00113] Upon storage, some pharmaceutical          compositions degrade over time.
Degradation products can alter a composition's efficacy, for example by delivering less
active ingredient to a subject than recommended. Degradation products for new drugs above
certain thresholds should be reported to the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) in
accordance with current Guidance Documents.           Degradation products above a certain
threshold amount should be identified.        A degradation product is "identified" when its
structural characterization has been achieved. Degradation products above a certain amount
should be qualified.     A degradation product is "qualified" when its biological safety is
acquired and evaluated.

                                          EXAMPLES
         [00173] The following non-limiting examples are for illustrative purposes only and
are not to be construed as limiting the invention in any manner.
Example 1
         [00174] An experiment was conducted to test EPA, DHA, EPA + DHA with and
without with atorvastatin in model membranes enriched with PUFAs and cholesterol at levels
that reproduce disease or high CV-risk conditions (i.e. hypercholesterimia).         As is shown
below, EPA exhibits a potent antioxidant benefit in cholesterol-enriched membranes that was
superior to that observed with DHA. Moreover, the combination of EPA and atorvastating
provided even further antioxidant benefit by comparison to EPA alone.
         [00175] EPA and DHA were tested individually at a fixed concentration of 10.0 pM
or in combination at 5.65 ptM and 4.35 iM (EPA and DHA, respectively), which is a mole
ratio of 1.3:1.   Separate and combined effects of these agents on lipid peroxide (LOOH)
formation were examined at cholesterol-to-phospholipid (C/P) mole ratios of 0.5:1, 1.0:1 and
1.5:1. Levels of lipid hydroperoxides were also measured for EPA, DPH and EPA/DPH in
cholesterol-enriched membrane prepared in the absence and presence of atorvastatin.
                                                53

        [00176] 1,2-Dilinoleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) was obtained from Avanti
Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and stored in chloroform (25 mg/ml) at -80'C until use.
Cholesterol obtained and stored in chloroform (10 mg/ml) at -20'C.          CHOD-iodide color
reagent (stock) was prepared according to a procedure modified from El-Saadani et al. (El
Saadani    M,  Esterbauer   H,   El-Sayed   M,    Goher    M, Nassar       AY,  Jurgens   G.  A
spectrophotometric assay for lipid peroxides in serum lipoproteins using commercially
available reagent. JLipidRes 1989;30:627-30) consisted of 0.2 M K2HPO 4 , 0.12 M KI, 0.15
mM NaN3, 10 ptM ammonium molybdate, and 0.1 g/L benzalkonium chloride.                  Prior to
experimental     use,  the    CHOD      reagent    was     activated     by  adding    24    PM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 20 ptM butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and 0.2%
Triton X-100. Atorvastatin was prepared in ethanol just prior to experimental use and added
together with component lipids containing fixed amounts of EPA, DPH or EPA/DPH at
equimolar levels. The compounds and lipids were added in combination during membrane
sample preparation to ensure full incorporation into the lipid bilayers.
        [00177] Membrane samples consisting of DLPC  cholesterol, with cholesterol-to
phospholipid (C/P) mole ratios ranging from 0.5 to 1.5, were prepared as follows.
Component lipids (in chloroform) were transferred to 13 x 100 mm test tubes and shell-dried
under a steady stream of nitrogen gas while vortex mixing. The lipid was co-dried with EPA,
DPH or EPA/DPH prepared in the absence or presence of the atorvastatin at equimolar levels.
        [00178] Residual solvent was removed by drying for a minimum of 3 h under
vacuum.    After desiccation, each membrane sample was resuspended in diffraction buffer
(0.5 mM HEPES, 154 mM NaCl, pH 7.3) to yield a final phospholipid concentration of 1.0
mg/ml.    Multilamellar vesicles (MLV) were formed by vortex mixing for 3 minutes at
ambient temperature. Bangham AD, Standish MM, Watkins JC. Diffusion of univalent ions
across the lamellae of swollen phospholipids. JMol Biol 1965;13:238-52. Immediately after
initial MLV preparation, aliquots of each membrane sample will be taken for baseline (0 h)
peroxidation analyses.
        [00179] All lipid membrane samples were subjected to time-dependent autoxidation
by incubating at 37 'C in an uncovered, shaking water bath. Small aliquots of each sample
were removed at 24 h intervals and combined with 1.0 ml of active CHOD-iodide color
reagent.   To ensure spectrophotometric readings within the optimum absorbance range,
sample volumes taken for measurement of lipid peroxide formation were adjusted for length
of peroxidation and range between 100 and 10 pl. Test samples were immediately covered
                                              54

with foil and incubated at room temperature for > 4 h in the absence of light. Absorbances
were    measured against    a CHOD blank           at 365 nm using a Beckman DU-640
spectrophotometer.
        [00180] The CHOD colorimetric assay is based on the oxidation of iodide (I ) by
lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) and proceeds according to the following reaction scheme:
                                LOOH + 2H++ 3I          -     LOH+ H 2 0+ Is
        [00181] The quantity of triiodide anion (13) liberated in this reaction is directly
proportional to the amount of lipid hydroperoxides present in the membrane sample. The
molar absorptivity value (F) of I3- is 2.46 x 104 M- cm-1 at 365 nm.
        [00182] Results are shown in Figures 1 - 4.
