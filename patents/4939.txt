   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
35 having a game controller having components that enable the
   implementation of a game wherein reel strips are provided
   dynamically. In an embodiment, a set reel strips are
                                            10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 6
   randomly chosen by a reel selector of the game controller
   from a set of possible reel strips after play of the game
   is initiated but before symbols are selected. In an
   embodiment, weightings are assigned to each set of reel
 5 strips. In an embodiment, a player input may result in the
   weightings being adjusted by the game controller. An
   effect of an embodiment of the invention is that a wider
   range of game outcomes can be generated by a gaming system
   than in a conventional arrangement where the reels are
10 fixed.
   General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
15 a first form, a standalone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
20 wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
25 wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
30 operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
35 envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
                                            10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

   gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
   the gaming system may operate in standalone gaming machine
   mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
   on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
 5 Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
   the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
10 components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
15 instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
20 credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions            (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
25
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
30 display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
35 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server. That is a processor may be
                                            10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 8
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs   (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
 5 to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
   integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).
10
   A gaming system in the form of a standalone gaming machine
   10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 10
   includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
15 by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
20 chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
25 having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
30 device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
35 stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module that is accessed in response
                                             10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 9
   to insertion of the player tracking device.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
 5 information or images relating to the game.         Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
10
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a
   liquid crystal display.  The display 14 may any other
   suitable video display unit, such as an OLED display.                      The
   top box 26 may also include a display, which may be of the
15 same type as the display 14, or of a different type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
20
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
25 communication with the processor 102.   Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
30
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
35 machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
                                            10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 10
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.   A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
 5 random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
10 screen and/or buttons 107   (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
15 may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
20 instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
25 buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
30 The network card may, for example, send status
   information,  accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                    In
35 embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
                                             10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 11
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
 5 an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
10 some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
15
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
20
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
25 two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
30 implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
35 network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
                                            10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 12
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
 5 In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
10 collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
15 game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.       A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
20 most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.  With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
25 these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
30 computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference.
35
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
                                            10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 13
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
 5 network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
1o for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
15 plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
20 could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.

   Further detail of gaming system
   The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
   a wager which will be evaluated for this play of the game
30 and initiates a play of the game. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that a player's wager can be varied
   from game to game dependent on player selections. In most
   spinning reel games, it is typical for the player's wager
   to be made up of a selection as to how the game outcome
35 will be evaluated by specifying what parts of the game
   outcome will qualify for winning outcomes and a multiplier
   that will apply to each winning outcome. For example, a
                                            10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 14
   player's wager may be based on how many lines they play in
   each game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum
   number of lines allowed by the game  (noting that not all
   permutations of win lines may be available for selection)
 5 and an amount per line - e.g. one, two or five credits.
   Winning outcomes on an activated win line may be evaluated
   based on a pay table that specifies the amount awarded for
   a one credit per line wager multiplied by the amount
   wagered per line.
10
   Such win lines are typically formed by a combination of
   symbol display positions, one from each reel, the symbol
   display positions being located relative to one another
   such that they form a line.
15
   In many games, the gaming machine may award winning
   outcomes which are not strictly limited to the lines they
   have selected, for example, "scatter" pays are awarded
   independently of a player's selection of pay lines.
20
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may select a number of reels to
   play and an amount to wager. Games of this type are
   marketed under the trade name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat
25 Leisure Industries Pty Ltd and are also known as "ways" to
   win games. The selection of the reel means that each
   displayed symbol of the reel can be substituted for a
   symbol at one or more designated display positions. In
   other words, all symbols displayed at symbol display
30 positions corresponding to a selected reel can be used to
   form symbol combinations with symbols displayed at a
   designated, symbol display positions of the other reels.
   For example, if there are five reels and three symbol
   display positions for each reel such that the symbol
35 display positions comprise three rows of five symbol
   display positions, the symbols displayed in the centre row
   are used for non-selected reels. As a result, the total
                                            10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 15
   number of ways to win is determined by multiplying the
   number of active display positions of each reels, the
   active display positions being all display positions of
   each selected reel and the designated display position of
 5 the non-selected reels. As a result for five reels and
   fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to win.
   In the embodiment described below, the display positions
   of the symbol display are arranged in a rectangular matrix
10 comprising a plurality of columns and a plurality of rows.
   However, other arrangements are known in the gaming
   industry and could be employed in embodiments of the
   invention. For example, in some arrangements there are
   more symbols in some columns than others, such as 3-4-3-4
15 3 arrangement of seventeen display positions corresponding
   to respective ones of five reels. In such arrangements,
   the columns of four symbols can be arranged so that they
   are off-set or staggered relative to the columns having
   three symbols so that the middle two symbols in the
20 columns of four symbols share boundaries with two symbols
   of each neighbouring reel.
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
25 code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that various of the modules could be
   implemented in some other way, for example by a dedicated
   circuit.
30 Referring to Figure 6, there is shown an embodiment where
   the components of the gaming system are used to update the
   reel strips in a base game each time there is a play of a
   game on the gaming system.   Memory 64 of gaming system 1
   has reel data 641 which defines a number of sets of reel
35 strips 641A and weightings 641B associated with their
   relative probability of being selected.
                                            10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 16
   In response to the initiation of play of a game, and
   before the reels are used to select symbols, the reel
   selector 624 uses the reel weightings 641B assigned to
   specific reel strips 641A together with a value obtained
 5 from random number generator 621 in order to select the
   set of reel strips 641A of the plurality of sets of reel
   strips stored in memory 64 to be used in this play of a
   game.
10 In some embodiments, the game controller may adjust the
   reel weightings 641B based on a player input such as an
   amount wagered or a volatility selection made by the
   player.
15 In one embodiment, the reel weighting data 641B specifies
   a plurality of different sets of reel weightings and the
   reel selector 624 accesses the set or reel weightings for
   the present game based on the received wager or the
   received volatility request.   For example, in one
20 embodiment different sets of reel weightings are stored in
   the reel data 641 in association with different ones of a
   plurality of possible wagers.
   In one embodiment, the characteristic that makes the sets
25 of reel strips different is that they each have different
   groups of stacked symbols as shown in the example
   described below in relation to Figure 8.      In another
   example, each of the reel strips has a different
   characteristic in the form of different volatilities.
30
   In another embodiment, the different sets of reel strips
   have a different characteristic in the form of different
   probabilities of delivering win outcomes.       In one example,
   higher rated sets of reel strips have a higher probability
35 of delivering winning outcomes either in terms of
   frequency of wins and/or value of winning outcomes.
                                             10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 17
   In the embodiment, once the reels strips have been
   selected, the symbol selector 622A selects symbols for
   display at symbol display positions from the dynamically
   selected reel strips. As will be appreciated from the
 5 above discussion, the selected reel strips specify a
   sequence of symbols for each reel. In an embodiment, the
   symbol selector 622A selects the symbols for display by
   selecting a stopping position in the sequence. In one
   example, three symbols of each of five reels are displayed
10 such that symbols are displayed at fifteen symbol display
   positions on display 54. It is known to use a probability
   table stored in memory 64 to vary the odds of a particular
   stop position being selected. Other techniques can be used
   to control the odds of particular outcomes occurring to
15 thereby control the return to player of the game.
   Once the symbols are selected, they are evaluated by the
   outcome evaluator 623 by comparing the symbol selected at
   symbol display positions on display 54 with pay table 643.
20 Both the selected symbols and any winning outcomes are
   displayed on display 54 under control of display
   controller 625. Any wins are added to a win meter of
   meters 643 stored in memory 64.  Assuming this ends the
   game, e.g. a feature is not triggered or the player does
25 not chose a gamble feature, the value on the win meter can
   be transferred to the credit meter either by the player
   initiating a new play of the game or electing to cash out.
   In some embodiments, certain win types (e.g. jackpot prize
   wins) may be added directly to the credit meter.
30
   While the above embodiment has been described an
   embodiment which implements dynamic stacks (where each of
   the reel sets are identical except for the stacked symbol,
   and a weighted table is used to select the reel set to be
35 used for each spin, in other embodiments the symbols on
   the strips of each reel set are completely different (for
   example different length stacks, different symbol
                                           10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                                - 18
   patterns).   This has several applications including:
   e    Enabling the implementation of games where the
        quantum of a player's wager affects the reels strips
 5      - a higher wager will increase the chance that a
         "higher" rated reel set will be selected for play
         (e.g. higher frequency of wins, higher value of wins,
        or both); and
10 e    Enabling the control of volatility -     the appropriate
        reel set will be chosen based on the player's
        preference   (higher value wins less frequently or
        lower value wins more frequently).
15 An advantage of certain embodiments of the invention is
   that it can simplify compliance work by allowing different
   reel sets to be deployed in different combinations to
   produce different RTPs, as appropriate for different
   jurisdictions.
20
   As indicated above, the probability of selecting certain
   reel strips can be controlled by adjusting the individual
   weightings of the weighting table.    In other embodiments
   the game controller may be configured to dynamically
25 adjust the individual weightings based on a targeted
   overall weighting (for example driven by desired RTP or
   volatility).
   In some embodiments, an eligibility criteria may be
30 applied in order for the player to be eligible for the
   dynamic reel strips, for example that the player has made
   a certain sized wager, made an ante bet, selected all win
   lines, played sufficient games, or the player is a member
   of a loyalty program.
35
   A play of a game may result in one or more wins.
   Typically, a win will result in some form of award being
                                             10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 19
   made such as an award of credits added to the win meter.
   Such an award may never actually be physically received by
   a player. For example, many gaming systems provide a
   player with a double or nothing gamble feature, where the
 5 player can double or forfeit their credits before
   commencing another play of the game or cashing out.
   Further, as credits are fungible, once credits have been
   added to the credit meter it is not possible to
   distinguish between credits which exist because the player
10 has input cash or the like and credits resulting from an
   award.
   Referring to Figure 7, there is shown a method 700 of an
   embodiment. The method 700 involves receiving 710 a wager,
15 randomly selecting 720 a set of reel strips, selecting 730
   symbols using the selected reel strips, evaluating 740 the
   selected symbols, and making any awards by updating 750 a
   meter  (typically a win meter but in some instances, a
   credit meter may be updated directly.)
20
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
25 executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
   description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
30 sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
   may need to compute several values and compare those
35 values.
   Example
                                            10245903_1 (GHMatters) P100591.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 20
   Referring to Figures 8A to 8D there are shown four sets of
   reel strips 801, 802, 803, 804.    Each set of reel strips
   801, 802, 803, 804 has five reels R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5.
 5 Each set of reel strips has a stack of symbols 811, 812,
   813, 814.
   Referring to Figure 8A, it will be apparent that reel set
   A 801 has a stack 811 of "PIC1" symbols.      Referring to
10 Figure 8B, reel set B 802 has a stack 812 of "PIC2"
   symbols. Referring to Figure 8C, reel set C 803 has a
   stack 813 of "PIC3" symbols.    Referring to Figure 8D, reel
   set D has a stack 814 of "PIC4" symbols.
15 A weighting table defines the relative probabilities of
   selecting the reel sets.   Reel set A 801, has a weighting
   of 1.   Reel set B 802, has a weighting of 2.          Reel set C
   803, has a weighting of 3.    Reel set D 804, has a
   weighting of 4. Accordingly, it is more likely that reel
20 set D 804 will be selected than any of the other reel sets
   801, 802 and 803.
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
25 ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
    (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
30 be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.
35 It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
