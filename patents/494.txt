DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF NON-LIMITING EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
 [0026]
        Hereinafter,        embodiments       of the present invention will
be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
Further,    embodiments to be described below are merely examples
for carrying out the present invention, and the present
invention is not         limited to a specific configuration to be
described below.          When the present invention is carried out,
a concrete configuration according to an embodiment may be
appropriately employed.
 [0027]
<<First embodiment>>
                                           13

           A first embodiment relates to an inspection system and
an inspecting device which are capable of inspecting a gaming
chip, and more particularly to, an inspection system and an
inspecting device which are capable of inspecting a plurality
of gaming chips contained in a case.
 [0028]
            Gaming chips used in game halls such as casinos are
manufactured in             factories     and then transported to game halls,
stored in       a storage,          and moved from the storage to cashiers or
game tables         in    the hall,     but it   is   necessary to prevent gaming
chips from being stolen               or being replaced with fake gaming chips
in   the process of transporting,                  storing,    and moving.         To this
end,      a case containing gaming chips is                  used.    If   a plurality
of gaming chips are contained in the case and, then the case
is   sealed,     it    is    possible to discover a situation             in   which the
gaming chips           are withdrawn from the case after the sealing.
 [0029]
           As  a gaming chip in which a radio tag storing
identification             information or type information is                internally
installed,        and optically         readable code information indicating
the identification information or the type information is
assigned to a side surface is                known (for example,         JP 2009-66172
A).
 [00301
           A system using a gaming chip is               disclosed in    JP 2009-66172
A.      In the system, the number of gaming chips placed on a betting
board of a game table is calculated on the basis of
                                               14

identification         information stored in        a radio tag,   the number
of gaming chips is calculated on the basis of identification
information assigned to a side surface, and the calculated
numbers        of gaming chips are compared.           Accordingly,    it    is
possible to detect an unauthorized gaming chip when the
unauthorized gaming chip is used in the game table.
 [0031]
            However, since the system disclosed in JP 2009-66172 A
detects        a fraud by calculating        the number of bet gaming chips
 (placed on the betting           board),   the system is  unable to inspect
a plurality of gaming chips contained in the case in a state
where the gaming chips are contained in              the case and detect the
unauthorized gaming chip.
 [0032]
            In  this regard,     it  is  an object of the first    embodiment
to provide an inspection system and an inspecting device which
are capable of inspecting a plurality              of gaming chips contained
in a case in a state where the gaming chips are contained in
the case.

in the case, wherein the inspecting device includes a first
reading device that        acquires the first      gaming chip information
of the gaming chip contained in the case, a second reading device
that optically reads the side surface of the gaming chip
contained in the case and acquires the second gaming chip
information,        and a determining unit    that    determines whether a
plurality       of gaming chips contained in     the case are pass or fail
by determining the authenticity or damages of all the gaming
chips contained the case or the number of gaming chips for each
value using the first        gaming chip information acquired by the
first reading device and the second gaming chip information
acquired by the second reading device.
 [0034]
           With this configuration, since both the first reading
unit      and the second reading unit    acquire the first     gaming chip
information and the second gaming chip information from the
gaming chip contained in the case, it is possible to inspect
the gaming chips contained in the case.                Further, since two
pieces of information, that is,           the first gaming chip
information and the second gaming chip information are acquired
from the gaming chip, and the inspection is performed, the
pass/fail determination can be reliably performed.
 [00351
           In an inspection system according to a second aspect of
the first embodiment, in the inspection system of the first
aspect, the first       gaming chip information and the second gaming
                                      16

chip information in a common gaming chip include common
information, and the determining unit determines that a
plurality       of gaming chips contained in   the case are fail    when
common information portions of a plurality         of pieces of first
gaming chip information acquired by the first reading device
do not coincide with common information portions of a plurality
of pieces of second gaming chip information acquired by the
second reading device.
 [00361
           With this configuration, when an unauthorized gaming chip
in which the common information portion of the first        gaming chip
information does not coincide with the common information
portion of the second gaming chip information is           contained in
the case, the determining unit can determine that the gaming
chips contained in the case are fail.
 [0037]
            For example, when common identification information is
recorded in the radio tag and the side surface, fail is
determined if a plurality of pieces of identification
information read out from a plurality of radio tags do not
coincide completely with a plurality of pieces of
identification       information read out from a plurality       of side
surfaces.        Further, when a value of the gaming chip is   recorded
in the radio tag and the side surface, fail is determined if
the number of each value read from the radio tag does not coincide
with the number of each value read from the side surface.

aspect, the second gaming chip information includes information
indicated by a designated color indicating the value of the
gaming chip and is            information indicating the value of the
gaming chip through the designated color.
 [0040]
            In an inspection system according to a fifth aspect of
the first embodiment, in the inspection system of the third
aspect,        both the first      gaming chip information and the second
gaming chip information include individual identification
information,         and a plurality     of gaming chips contained in     the
case are determined to be fail when the individual
identification         information of a plurality       of pieces of first
gaming chip information acquired by the first reading device
does not coincide with the individual identification
information of a plurality of pieces of second gaming chip
information acquired by the second reading device.
 [0041]
           With this   configuration, when an unauthorized gaming chip
                                          18

in which the individual identification              information of the first
gaming chip information does not coincide with the individual
identification information of the second gaming chip
information is contained in the case,                 the determining unit
determines that       the gaming chips contained in           the case are fail.
 [0042]
            In the inspection system of the first aspect, an
inspection system according to a sixth aspect of the first
embodiment includes a storage unit             that    stores    the individual
identification information of at least the first gaming chip
information or the second gaming chip information of a plurality
of gaming chips to be contained in          the case,      and the determining
unit     determines that     a plurality    of gaming chips contained in
the case are fail when the individual identification
information of a plurality of pieces of first gaming chip
information acquired by the first           reading device or a plurality
of pieces of second gaming chip information acquired by the
second reading device does not coincide with the individual
identification       information of the first        gaming chip information
or the second gaming chip information stored in the storage
unit.
 [0043]
           With this configuration, when an unauthorized gaming chip
in   which the first     gaming chip information or the second gaming
chip information is incorrect is              contained in a case, the
determining unit        can determine that      the gaming chips contained
in the case are fail.
                                         19

 [0044]
            For example, when the individual identification
information indicated by characters is recorded in the radio
tag, and the individual identification information indicated
by numbers is       recorded on the side surface, a plurality         of pieces
of individual identification information indicated by
characters are stored in            the storage unit      for the radio tag for
each case,        a plurality     of pieces of individual identification
information indicated by numbers are stored for the side surface,
and fail       is determined when a plurality        of pieces of individual
identification          information read out from a plurality          of radio
tags do not coincide with a plurality               of pieces of individual
identification          information stored in      the storage unit     for the
radio tag of the case or when a plurality            of pieces of individual
identification           information read out from a plurality          of side
surfaces do not coincide with a plurality of pieces of
individual identification information stored in the storage
unit for the side surface of the case.
 [0045]
            In the inspection system of the first aspect, an
inspection system according to a seventh aspect of the first
embodiment further includes a storage unit that stores a
correspondence relation between the first gaming chip
information and the second gaming chip information, and the
determining unit            determines that  the plurality      of gaming chips
contained in the case are fail when a plurality of pieces of
first gaming chip information acquired by the first reading
                                          20

device and a plurality of pieces               of second gaming chip
information acquired by the second reading device do not
coincide with the correspondence relation              stored in the storage
unit.
 [0046]
          With this   configuration,       when a gaming chip in      which the
correspondence relation between the first gaming chip
information and the second gaming chip information is
inaccurate is contained in the case, fail can be determined.
 [0047]
          For example, when the identification information is
recorded in      the radio tag, and the value is        recorded in     the side
surface,     any value is  allocated       to each piece of identification
information and stored in           the storage unit,     the number of each
value is      obtained with reference to the storage unit for a
plurality     of pieces of identification         information read out from
the plurality of radio tags, and fail is determined when the
number of each value read out from the side surface does not
coincide with the obtained number of each value.                 Conversely,
the same applies when the value is              recorded in   the radio tag,
and the identification information is                recorded in the side
surface.       In these cases,     the storage unit     need not store     which
case contains a gaming chip of which identification
information.

the first         to seventh aspects,       the determining unit  determines
that      a plurality      of gaming chips contained in     the case are fail
when the number of pieces of the first               gaming chip information
acquired by the first             reading device and the number of pieces
of the second gaming chip information acquired by the second
reading device are not               a predetermined number.
 [0049]
            With this configuration, when the gaming chip is
withdrawn from the case or the gaming chip is              added to the case,
the determining unit can determine that the gaming chips
contained in the case are fail.
 [00501
            For example, when the number of gaming chips contained
in   the case is       100,  fail  is  determined when any one of the number
of pieces of the first gaming chip information read from the
radio tag and the number of pieces of the second gaming chip
information read from the side surface is not                  100.

gaming chip, and the inspecting device includes a first                      reading
device that   reads the radio tags of a plurality               of gaming chips
contained in the case and acquires the first gaming chip
information,     a second reading device that           optically         reads the
side surfaces of a plurality          of gaming chips contained in                  the
case and acquires the second gaming chip information, and a
determining unit     that   determines whether the gaming chips are
pass or fail   for each case on the basis of the first                 gaming chip
information acquired by the first           reading device and the second

 [00831
        With this configuration, since both the first reading
unit  and the second reading unit        acquire the first    gaming chip
information and the second gaming chip information from the
gaming chips contained in     the case,      it   is possible to inspect
the gaming chips contained in the case.               Further, since two
pieces of information, that is,           the first gaming chip
information and the second gaming chip information are acquired
from the gaming chips,      and the inspection is performed, the

<Configuration of inspection system>
          FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a configuration of an
inspection system according to an embodiment of the present
invention.       An inspection system 1 includes a case 100            that
contains gaming chips        in a stacked state and an inspecting
                                      34

device 200 that       inspects a plurality       of gaming chips contained
in   the case 100 in    the stacked state      in  a state    where the gaming
chips are contained in the case             100.
 [00891
           The case 100 has a substantially rectangular
parallelepiped       shape and is made of transparent          resin.     The case
100 contains disc shaped gaming chips C in                a stacked state.      In
the case 100,       five columns each containing 20 gaming chips C
are formed,      and a total  of 100 gaming chips C can be contained.
The case 100 can be carried      (portable) in a state         where the gaming
chips C are contained.         The case 100 includes an upper portion
101 and a lower portion 102 which are separable,                      and when the
upper portion 101 and the lower portion 102 are separated, the
gaming chips C can be contained in           the case 100,        and the gaming
chips C can be withdrawn from the case 100.
 [00901
           The inspecting device 200 includes a receiving unit                 210
and a main body portion 220.             The  inspecting device 200 can
receive the case        100 through the receiving unit 210.                 The
receiving unit 210 has         a substantially rectangular
parallelepiped shape in which an upper surface and a front
surface are opened as a whole, and the receiving unit 210 is
formed by left      and right   side walls 211,         a bottom portion 212,
and an inner wall 213 and has a width, a height, and a depth
in which the case 100 can fit exactly.
 [0091]
           The main body portion 220 is       installed       behind the inner
                                       35

wall 213 of the receiving unit            210 and includes an RFID reader
221,    a computer 222,      and a display unit 223.             The main body

to photograph the side surface of the gaming chip C contained
in the case       100 from the upper surface side of the case                   100
contained in the receiving unit 210.
 [0092]
         The RFID reader 221,       the display unit       223,    the infrared
camera 225,      and the visible     light    camera 226 are connected to
the computer 222.        An RFID antenna 224 is       connected to the RFID
reader 221.       The RFID antenna 224 extends from the RFID reader
221 and extends spirally         in  the left    and right      sidewalls 211.
In other words, a spiral RFID antenna 224 is laid in each of

<Structure of gaming chip>
         FIG. 2 is   a perspective view of the gaming chip C according
to an embodiment of the present invention,              and FIG.     3 is  a side
view of the gaming chip C according to an embodiment of the
present invention.         The gaming chip C has a designated color
                                        36

layer 501 which is         characterized by a designated color in                the
middle and a common color layer 502 which is                   characterized by
a common color on both sides of the designated color layer 501
in  the middle in        a thickness direction          (upper and lower sides
in  FIG.  3),   and a stripe       pattern     (in  the thickness direction)
is  formed on the side surface.
 [00951
        An RFID tag 503 is        inserted     between the designated color
layer 501 and one common color layer 502 of the gaming chip C
as  a radio tag.          For example,       individual    identification
information individually identifying                  (uniquely specifying)
the gaming chip C and value                (type) information are stored in
the RFID tag 503 as the gaming chip information of the gaming
chip C.    A transparent       layer 504 is     formed as the outermost layer
of the gaming chip C.         In other words,      the gaming chip C includes
the designated color layer 501 which is                an intermediate layer,
the common color layers 502 sandwiching the designated color
layer 501 from both sides, and the transparent                   layers 504 which
are the outermost layers of both sides.
 [00961
        The gaming chip C is       formed such that      five elongated layers
of plastic materials            (the transparent layer 504,               the common
color layer 502, the designated color layer 501,                          the common
color layer 502, and the transparent layer 504) are stacked,
the RFID tag 503 is        arranged between the designated color layer
501 and one common color layer 502 at a predetermined interval
at that time, and the five layers of plastic materials are
                                            37

thermocompression bonded and then punched into a circular        shape,
a rectangular shape, or the like through a press so that one
RFID tag 503 is  included in one gaming chip C.      When the punching
is  performed through the press, dimensions of a die and a punch
of a mold for punching are designed,        and R treatment   (rounded
corner)   is applied to the end of the transparent        layer 504 of
the outermost layer.
 [0097]
        The transparent layer 504 may be formed by
thermocompression bonding three layers including the
designated color layer 501 and the two common color layers 502
and then applying varnish to the surface.           Further, the
designated color layer 501 and the two common color layers 502
may not be separate members,     and the designated color layer 501
and the two common color layers 502 may be formed by applying
the designated color (and the common color) to the side surface
through inkjet   printing   or the like  after   the designated color
layer 501 and the two common color layers 502 are integrally
formed.
 [00981
        The designated color layer 501 indicates      the value (type)
of the gaming chip C using a color        (a designated color).     In
other words,   the color of the designated color layer 501 is      set
to a different color      (red, green, yellow, blue, or the like)
in  accordance with the value of the gaming chip C,        and thus it
is possible to specify the value of the gaming chip C (10 points,
20 points, 100 points, 1000 points, or the like) by checking
                                   38

the color of the designated color layer 501 optically               read from
the side surface of the gaming chip C.              A color common to the
gaming chips C having different values               (a common color) is
assigned to the common color layer 502.               The common color is
preferably a color lighter           than any designated color,         and the
common color is white           in the present embodiment.
 [00991
          Code information 505 indicating the gaming chip
information of the gaming chip C is further inscribed on the
side surface of the gaming chip C             (specifically, the common
color layer 502 of the side surface).            The code information 505
indicates      information by arranging a plurality       of marks (square
marks in     the present embodiment) .        Since the designated color
layer 501 indicates          information   (the value of the gaming chip
C) with color, whereas the code             information 505 indicates
information with a mark inscribed on the side surface, the code
information 505 can be regarded as notation information.
Examples      of the notation information include a plurality of
character strings,          a numeric string, and a bar code.
 [0100]
          The code information 505 of the present embodiment is
repeatedly inscribed with a cycle of 600 in             a circumferential
direction      of the gaming chip C.       Accordingly,   the perfect       code
information       505 is    included within a range      of 1200 in       the
circumferential       direction     regardless of a direction         in  which
the side surface of the gaming chip C is observed in the
circumferential direction.             A repetition cycle of the gaming
                                        39

chip C is          not limited to 600 and may be repeatedly inscribed
at equal intervals in the circumferential direction at least
three times.
 [0101]
         The code information 505 is              inscribed using invisible            ink.
In the present embodiment, printing is performed by inkjet
printing using infrared absorbing ink                         (specifically, carbon
black) that          absorbs infrared         rays as the invisible          ink.    Since
only a portion on which the code information 505 is                        printed     does
not reflect         infrared     rays,    the code information 505 floats              when
the side surface of the gaming chip C is photographed by the
infrared        camera 225.         In  order to cause the printed             portion to
float     clearly,        the infrared       camera 225 may be equipped with an
infrared        lamp and irradiate          the side surface of the gaming chip
C to be photographed with infrared rays.
 [0102]
          Further,        the invisible       ink is not limited to the infrared
absorbing ink and may be,                 for example,        infrared     reaction ink
that     emits fluorescence in             response to infrared          rays or UV ink
which emits fluorescence in                  response to ultraviolet             rays.   In
the case of using the UV ink,                   the ultraviolet         camera is      used
in place of the infrared camera 225,                       and black light which
irradiates the side surface of the gaming chip C with
ultraviolet rays              is used to cause the UV ink to emit
fluorescence.
 [0103]
          Further,         in the gaming chip C,       a mark m'       using the UV ink
                                               40

or the carbon black ink is            formed on a surface X of the common
color layer 502.         The mark m'     indicates       whether the gaming chip
5 is true or false, and the mark m' becomes visible when
irradiated       with ultraviolet       rays     (or infrared    rays),  and it  is
indicated whether the gaming chip 5 is                      true or false in
accordance with a combination of shapes of the mark m'                     and the
number of marks m'.             The  transparent layer 504           is
thermocompression bonded or applied on the outermost layer so
as to cover a print         506 (such as 100 points) for specifying the
game hall     or the mark m' on the surface, but embossing treatment
or vanish treatment is applied to the transparent layer 504,
and thus the gaming chips C are prevented from adhering to each
other, and slipping is             further improved.
 [0104]
           The R treatment        (R) is performed on the end of the
transparent       layer 504 of the outermost layer which has undergone
a print 506        (100 points or the like),             and the surface of the
common color layer 502 is            prevented from being deformed in           the
process of punching the gaming chip C and appearing on the side
surface.       Further, a sharp edge of the gaming chip C is            prevented
from remaining and damaging a hand and other gaming chips C.
The designated color layer 501 may be formedby one or a plurality
of colored layers.           Further,     metal or ceramics for increasing
the weight of the layer may be formed in the layer of the
designated color layer 501.               Further,      the RFID tag 503 may be
installed      in  a space which is      formed in     a part   of the designated
color layer 501 or between the designated color layer 501 and
                                           41

the common color layer 502.
 [0105]
           FIG.     4 is       a diagram illustrating          an example of an image
obtained by photographing a plurality of gaming chips C
contained in              the case 100 through the infrared              camera 225 and
the visible light camera 226.                       In this case, the case 100 may
be a two-stage chip float                    (an upper tray portion which is
particularly              movable in     a two-stage chip tray)          or a chip tray
which holds the gaming chip C in                     the game table.       Even when the
gaming chip C is              stacked in   the case 100 in the vertical           direction
as illustrated              in  FIG. 4,  the infrared     camera 225 and the visible
light camera 226 can photograph the code information 505.
Further,       it      is    possible to count the number of gaming chips C
by counting the designated color layer 501                            in the vertical
direction.            Even with the two-stage             tray,    when each stage is
developed,          it     is   possible to capture the side surfaces of all
the gaming chips C contained in the case 100 through the infrared
camera 225 and the visible light camera 226.
 [0106]
           In the present embodiment, the code information 505 is
indicated by the marks m arranged in a plurality of rows and
a plurality            of columns.        FIG.    5 is  a diagram for describing a
configuration of the code information 505.                           As illustrated         in
FIG. 5, upper and lower marks m are paired to form one code
element.          In the example of FIG. 5, one piece of code information
505 is      configured with a 10-digit                code element.      There are four
types of patterns                of one code element constituted             by a pair      of
                                                 42

upper and lower marks m,         four types of information can be

 [0111]
<Configuration of case>
           FIG.  7 is     a perspective view of a case 100.                The case 100
is    formed by combining the upper portion 101 and the lower
portion 102.           In   the present embodiment,          the upper portion 101
                                               44

and the lower portion 102 are made of transparent resin.                             As
described above,           since the infrared     camera 225 and the visible
light camera 226 of the inspecting device 200 of the present
embodiment       (hereinafter referred to simply as a "camera")
installed      above the receiving unit          210,  it    is   necessary for at
least     the upper surface of the case 100 to transmit light.                       In
other words,      in    the case 100,     a portion positioned between the
receiving unit         210 of the inspecting device 200 and the camera
when the case 100 is            received by the receiving unit           210 of the
inspecting device 200 needs to be a light               transmitting        portion.
In    the present embodiment,          the case 100 has a sealed structure
including the upper portion 101 and the lower portion 102,                         but
the light transmission portion may be in a perforated state.
 [0112]
          As described above,         the case 100 has a shape in          which the
five columns in which 20 gaming chips C are stacked and contained
are formed in        parallel,      and in   the example of FIG.         7,  a cross
section of each column is polygonal                  (octagonal) so that the
upperportion 101 and the lowerportion 102 substantially                       follow
the shape of the gaming chip C to be contained.
 [0113]
          FIG.  8 is    a perspective view of a case 100'             according to
a modified example,            and FIG.  9 is  a plan view of the case 100'.
The case 100'        also includes an upper portion 101'               and a lower
portion 102 made of a transparent resin.                       In the present
modified example,            the upper surface of the upper portion 101'
facing the camera is formed as a plane surface.                         Since the
                                           45

surface facing the camera is                    a plane surface,      a linear     shadow
caused by a corner of a polygon cross section of the case 100'
does not appear on the camera as illustrated                       in   FIG.   9,  and it
is possible to accurately identify information of the side
surface of the gaming chip C in image analysis on a captured
image of the camera.
 [0114]
<Use state of inspection system>
            FIG.     10 is    a diagram for describing an example of a use
state      of the inspection system 1 together with the distribution
of the gaming chips C.                    The gaming chip C is manufactured by
a manufacturing device 301 of a factory F                      (s1),    and 100 gaming
chips C are contained                  in   the case 100    (s2) .    The case     100 is
sealed with a seal at the factory F after the gaming chips C
are contained.               Further, the bar code BC indicating the case
identification             information uniquely specifying the case 100 is
affixed to the side surface of the case 100                           (s3).
 [0115]
           At this       time,   the case identification         information of the
bar code BC affixed             to the case 100 is       input to the manufacturing
management device 302 in                  the factory F (s4) .     Further, the case
100     containing the gaming chips C is transferred to the
inspecting device 200,                    the gaming chip information            (to be
described later             in detail)      assigned to the gaming chip C is        read,
and the pass/fail inspection is performed.                          The gaming chip
information read from the gaming chip C contained in                            the case
100 is       transferred        to the manufacturing management device 302
                                                 46

 (s5)  and associated with the case identification         information
through the manufacturing management device 302.             The
manufacturing management device 302 maybe a personal computer.
 [0116]
        The case 100 determined to be pass in the inspecting device
200 of the factory F is        conveyed from the factory F to a game
hall P     (s6) .   The case 100 is    first stored in  a storage R in
the game hall       P (s7) .  The inspecting device 200 is   installed
in  the storage R,     and the case 100 that  arrived from the factory
F is inspected through the inspecting device 200.
 [0117]
        Meanwhile, the case identification information and the
gaming chip information associated with the case identification
information are transmitted         from the manufacturing management
device 302 in the factory F to the use management device 303
in  the game hall     P.   The use management device 303 acquires the
case identification       information and the gaming chip information
associated with the case identification information from the
manufacturing management device 302 for each of a plurality            of
cases 100 containing the gaming chip C and includes           a storage
unit that stores the acquired information for each case 100.
The use management device 303 may be a personal computer.
 [0118]
        In   the inspection performed by the inspecting device 200
in the storage R,        an inspection is performed using the
information stored in        the use management device 303.     The case
100 determined to be pass in the inspection in the storage R
                                      47

is  carried       to a game table          T   (s9)  or carried     to a cashier CA
 (s10) .    Each of the game table               T and the cashier CA includes
the inspecting device 200,                  and the case 100        containing the
gaming chip C is            inspected by the inspecting devices 200 in                   a
sealed state.           In   the game table       T and the cashier CA,      the case
100 containing used gaming chips C is                   also inspected,       and the
inspecting device 200 is              also used for the inspection.             In the
inspection in        the three inspecting devices 200 in               the game hall
P,   the case       identification information transmitted from the
manufacturing management device 302 and stored in the use
management device 303 and the gaming chip information
associated with the case identification information are
referred to.
 [0119]
<Configuration of stored information>
          FIG.    11 is    a diagram illustrating           an example of content
of information which is generated by the manufacturing
management device 302,            transmitted       to the use management device
303,   and stored in          the use management device 303.             Information
is  generated for each case 100,                and the gaming chip information
of a plurality       of gaming chips C (100 gaming chips in the present
embodiment)        contained in        the case 100 is        associated with each
piece of case identification                 information      (Cal, Ca2,   Ca3,  ...   )
 [0120]
         As the gaming chip information,                information including a
combination of the individual identification                       information       (aa,
ab,   ac,   ... ,   du,    dv) uniquely specifying the gaming chip C and
                                              48

information      (r, r, r,    ...   , b, b)    specifying the value             (type)
of the gaming chip C is        stored in     the RFID tag 503,        information
including a combination of individual identification
information      (00001,   00002,     00003,    . . ., 00099,   00100)     uniquely
specifying the gaming chip C and information                  (1,  1,   1,   ...  , 2,
2)  specifying the value          (type) of the gaming chip is           stored as
the notation information of the side surface,                   and information
 (red, red, red,...,      blue,     blue) specifying the value             (type) of
the gaming chip C is      stored as the color information of the side
surface.
 [0121]
        The information stored in          the RFID tag 503 is        information
which is    electromagnetically          readable by the RFID reader 221
and corresponds to first          gaming chip information of the present
invention, and the notation information assigned to the side
surface and the color information are optically readable
information and correspond to second gaming chip information
of the present invention.
 [0122]
<Configuration of read information>
        FIG.  12 is   a diagram illustrating            an example of content
of information acquired from one case 100 through the bar code
reader 228,    the RFID reader 221,           the infrared      camera 225,        and
the visible    light    camera 226 in       the inspecting device 200.              An
English character string            stored in     the RFID tag 503 installed
in  each of a plurality        of gaming chips C is          read out from the
RFID reader 221.        A numeric string which is the notation
                                         49

information inscribed on the side surface is                   read out from the
infrared camera 225.            Further, the color of the side surface
is   read out from the visible          light    camera 226.      The identifying
unit     230 analyzes      (the image of)        the numeric      string     read out
from the infrared camera 225, identifies a number, specifies
information including the numeric string, and specifies the
designated color from the image of the side surface read out
from the visible light camera 226.
 [0123]
          Here,  the notation information and the designated color
information of the side surface of a plurality                     of gaming chips
C can be acquired in accordance with an arrangement order of
the gaming chips C in        the case 100, but the information acquired
from a plurality        of RFID tags 503 is          unable to be acquired in
accordance with the arrangement order of the gaming chips C.
In   other words,    it   is  difficult       to specify a gaming chip C from
which the information of the RFID tag 503 is obtained.
 [0124]
<Pass/fail determination method>
          Next, a pass/fail determination method in the computer
222    of the inspecting device 200 will be described.                         As
described above,        the identifying         unit  230 specifies       the gaming
chip information stored in the RFID tags 503 of each of a
plurality of gaming chips C contained in the case 100 on the
basis of a result        of reading the RFID reader 221,                analyzes the
infrared     image obtained by the infrared              camera 225,       specifies
the gaming chip information indicated by the notation
                                            50

information,       analyzes the visible      light   image obtained by the
visible light camera 226, and specifies the color of the
designated color layer 501.           On the basis of the information,
the determining unit       231 determines the authenticity/damage of
all    the gaming chips contained in      the case or the number of gaming
chips of each value on the basis of the information, and
determines whether the case 100             is pass or fail.      In the
following description, the gaming chip information stored in
the RFID tag 503 is referred to as               "first gaming chip
information",       and the notation information assigned to the side
surface of the gaming chip C and the color information of the
designated color layer 501 are referred               to as "second gaming
chip information".
 [0125]
 (First pass/fail determination method)
            In a first pass/fail determination method, the first
gaming chip information and the second gaming chip information
in   the same gaming chip are the same information as illustrated
in FIG. 13.        In an example of FIG. 13,        the first gaming chip
information is information including the individual
identification        information and the value information of each
gaming chip C, and the same content as the first gaming chip
information is       inscribed on the side surface in         a form of the
notation information as the second gaming chip information.
 [0126]
            The RFID reader 221 reads the first gaming chip
information from the RFID tag 503 of the gaming chip C and outputs
                                       51

the first      gaming chip information to the identifying                 unit   230,
the infrared camera 225 photographs the side surface of the
gaming chip C,       and the identifying      unit   230 specifies       the second
gaming chip information.             In this  case,   in  the identifying        unit
230, a correspondence relation between a plurality of pieces
of first      gaming chip information and a plurality                of pieces of
second gaming chip information is unclear.
 [0127]
           The determining unit        231 compares a plurality           of pieces
of first gaming chip information obtained by the identifying
unit 230 with a plurality of pieces of second gaming chip
information, and when a plurality             of pieces of first       gaming chip
information completely correspond to a plurality                     of pieces of
second gaming chip information in             a one-to-one manner,          that  is,
when all      pieces of first     gaming chip information coincide with
any one of second gaming chip information without overlapping,
the determining unit         231 determines that         a plurality      of gaming
chips C contained in        the case 100 are pass, but when a plurality
of pieces of first gaming chip information obtained by the
identifying      unit   230 do not completely coincide with a plurality
of pieces of second gaming chip information, the determining
unit    231 determines that      a plurality      of gaming chips C contained
in the case       100 are fail.
 [0128]
          As a case in    which a plurality        of pieces of first          gaming
chip information obtained by the identifying unit 230 do not
completely coincide with a plurality               of pieces of second gaming
                                           52

chip information,       there is a case in which any one of the gaming
chips C contained in       the case 100 is  a fake or a case in    which
the RFID tag 503 or the side surface of the gaming chip C is
damaged.     In other words,     the determining unit   231 determines
whether a plurality       of gaming chips C contained in   the case 100
are pass or fail      by determining the authenticity/damage of all
the gaming chips contained in the case 100.
 [0129]
 (Second pass/fail determination method)
         In a second pass/fail determination method, the first
gaming chip information and the second gaming chip information
in  the same gaming chip C are the same information as illustrated
in FIG. 14.      In an example of FIG. 14,     the first gaming chip
information is      the value information of each gaming chip C,     and
in  each gaming chip C,      the designated color is   assigned to the
designated color layer 501 of the side surface as the second
gaming chip information.
 [0130]
         The RFID reader 221 reads out the first gaming chip
information fromthe RFID tag503 of the gaming chip C and outputs
the first    gaming chip information to the identifying       unit  230,
the visible light camera 226 photographs the side surface of
the gaming chip C, and the identifying unit 230 analyzes the
image and specifies the second gaming chip information              (the
color of the designated color layer 501).
 [0131]
         In this case, in the identifying unit 230,         a
                                     53

correspondence relation           between a plurality          of pieces of first
gaming chip information and a plurality of pieces of second
gaming chip information is unclear, a plurality of pieces of

is    a case in   which any one of the gaming chips C contained in
the case 100 is a fake or a case in which the side surface of
any of the gaming chips C is damaged.                      In other words,         the
determining unit         231 determines whether a plurality                of gaming

gaming chip information and the second gaming chip information
in the same gaming chip C are different information as
illustrated          in  FIG. 15.     In   an example of FIG.      15,  information
of an English character string is stored in the RFID tag 503
of the gaming chip C as the first                gaming chip information,        and
the notation information of a numeric string is inscribed on
the side surface of the gaming chip C as the second gaming chip

 (Fourth pass/fail determination method)
            In a fourth pass/fail determination method, the first
gaming chip information and the second gaming chip information
in the same gaming chip C are different information as
illustrated          in FIG. 16.   In  an example of FIG.     16,   information
of an English character string is stored in the RFID tag 503
of the gaming chip C as the first              gaming chip information,       and
the designated color layer 501 of the side surface of the gaming
chip C is         colored in  the designated color corresponding to the

C contained in the case 100 is a fake or a case in which the
RFID tag 503 or the side surface of the gaming chip C is             damaged.
In    other words,     the determining unit    231 determines whether or

gaming chips C contained in        the case 100 and the number of gaming
chips C for each value.
 [0144]
 (Fifth pass/fail determination method)
            In a fifth pass/fail determination method, the first
gaming chip information and the second gaming chip information
in the same gaming chip C are different information as
illustratedin        FIG. 17.   In an example ofFIG. 17, the individual
identification        information including a numeric string        is stored
in the RFID tag 503 of the gaming chip C as the first gaming
                                       60

chip information,        and the value information of the gaming chip
C is     assigned to the side surface of the gaming chip C as the
second gaming chip information in the form of the designated
color of the designated color layer 501.
 [0145]
            The RFID reader 221 reads out the first gaming chip
information from the RFID tag 503 of the gaming chip C and outputs
the first       gaming chip information to the identifying           unit    230,
the visible light camera 226 photographs the side surface of
the gaming chip C and outputs a captured image to the identifying
unit 230, and the identifying unit 230 analyzes the captured
image and specifies the designated color which is the second
gaming chip information.         In this   case,  in the identifying         unit
230, a correspondence relation between a plurality of pieces
of first       gaming chip information and a plurality          of pieces of
second gaming chip information is unclear.
 [0146]
            The correspondence relation     between the first      gaming chip
information and the second gaming chip information is stored
in the use management device 303.              In an example of FIG. 17,
the individual identification           information uniquely specifying
the gaming chip C is associated with the designated color of
the designated color layer 501 of the side surface, that is,
the value information of the gaming chip C,            and it     is  possible
to understand the value of the gaming chip C when the individual
identification        information is     designated.   In  the case of the
present example,        the use management device 303 need not store
                                        61

a combination of the first gaming chip information and the
second gaming chip information for each piece of case
identification         information.     In   other words,       in   the present
example, the gaming chips C contained in case                      100 can be
inspected without using the case identification                     information.
 [0147]
            The determining unit     231 specifies    the first       gaming chip
information corresponding to the first              gaming chip information
identified by the identifying unit 230 from the first gaming
chip information stored in the use management device 303 and
specifies the second gaming chip information associated with
the first gaming chip information, that is,                    the value.     The
determining unit         231 can obtain the number of each value in              a
plurality       of pieces of second gaming chip information extracted
from the use management device 303 for one case by performing
the above process on all pieces of the first gaming chip
information identified by the identifying unit 230.
 [0148]
            The determining unit    231 compares the number of each value
obtained as described above with the number of each value in
the second gaming chip information identified                  for the case 100
from the identifying         unit  230.    When the numbers of each of all
the values coincide,          the determining unit      231 determines that
a plurality       of gaming chips C contained in      the case 100 are pass,
and when the number of any one of the values does not coincide,
the determining unit         231 determines that      a plurality       of gaming
chips C contained in the case 100                are fail.
                                        62

 [0149]
           As a case in which the number of each value in                 a plurality
of pieces of second gaming chip information extracted from the
use management device 303 does not coincide with the number of
each value in        the second gaming chip information identified                    for
the case 100 from the identifying                    unit   230,  there is   a case in
which any one of gaming chips C contained in the case 100 is
a fake or a case in          which the RFID tag 503 or the side surface
of the gaming chip C is           damaged.        In other words, the determining
unit      231 determines whether or not a plurality                  of gaming chips
C contained in         the case 100 are pass or fail             by determining the
authenticity/damage of all                the gaming chips C contained in             the
case 100       and the number of gaming chips C for each value.
 [0150]
           Although not       illustrated, even when the value of the
gaming chip C is          stored as the first             gaming chip information,
and the individual identification information of the gaming
chip C is stored as the second gaming chip information, the
pass/fail      determination can be performed similarly                  to the above
example.
 [0151]
           The first     to fifth     pass/fail        determination methods have
been described above,              but the determining unit           231 may employ
a combination of the above pass/fail                   determination methods.          In
addition to the above pass/fail determination methods, when
both the number of pieces of first                    gaming chip information and
the number of pieces of second gaming chip information read from
                                                63

a plurality        of gaming chips C contained in        the case 100 are not
a predetermined number            (100 in the present embodiment),              the
determining unit           231 may determine that      a plurality      of gaming
chips C contained in the case 100               are fail.
 [0152]
          The first    and second pass/fail       determination methods are
pass/fail      determination methods that           can be executed without
using the information stored in             the use management device 303
installed      in   the game hall    P and suitable     when executed by the
inspecting device 200 in the factory F,                  the third to fifth
pass/fail determination methods are pass/fail determination
methods using the information stored in the use management
device 303 installed in the game hall P and suitable when
executed by the inspecting device 200 in                the game hall      P,   but
the inspecting device 200 in          the game hall    P may employ the first
or second pass/fail determination method.                    When all the
inspecting devices 200 in           the game hall     P employ the pass/fail
determination method in           which the information stored in         the use
management        device 303 is    not used such as the first           or second
pass/fail      determination method,        the use management device 303
may be omitted.
 [0153]
          Further, the inspecting device 200 in           the game hall     P also
inspects the case 100 containing the used gaming chips C,                       but
in   the case,     the first,   second, or fifth pass/fail         determination
method in which information of the gaming chips to be contained
in the case need not be stored may be employed.

 [0154]
            Further, in the above embodiment, the gaming chip C
includes the individual identification             information and/or the
value information as the first            gaming chip information and/or
the second gaming chip information.               Here, the individual
identification         information is    information uniquely specifying
each gaming chip C, whereas the value information is           information
that can overlap each other in a plurality of gaming chips C
and can be regarded as information              (group information)
indicating         a group to which each gaming chip belongs.        In  the
present embodiment,         as the group information of the associated
group, instead of the value or in addition to the value, for
example, information of a gaming chip manufacturing time,                  a
manufacturer,         and/or a game hall    in which a gaming chip is   used
may be employed.
 [0155]
            In other words, both the first gaming chip information
and the second gaming chip information may include the
individual identification information identifying the gaming
chip,       the first   gaming chip information and the second gaming
chip information may include the group information indicating
the group to which the gaming chip belongs, the first gaming
chip information may include the individual identification
information identifying          the gaming chip,    and the second gaming
chip information may include the group information of the group
to which the gaming chip belongs, or, the first gaming chip
information may include the group information of the group to
                                         65

which the gaming chip belongs, and the second gaming chip
information may include the individual identification
information identifying the gaming chip.

a pass/fail      determination result            in   the determining unit    231.
These pass/fail result display screens                     are generated by the
computer 222 on the basis of the pass/fail                 determination result
in  the determining unit          231 and displayed on the display unit
223.     FIG.   18 illustrates      an example of a display screen in           the
case of "pass",        and FIG.   19 illustrates         an example of a display
screen in the case of "fail".
 [0157]
         As   illustrated in FIGS. 18 and 19,                a pass/fail result
display screen 800 includes a total                 of the number of detections
801 which is      the number of combinations of the first            gaming chip
information and the second gaming chip information read out from
the gaming chip C by the identifying unit 230, the number of
authorized gaming chips C 802,               and the number of unauthorized
gaming chips C 803.
 [0158]
          The computer 222 sets       a larger       one of the number of pieces
of first gaming chip information and the number of pieces of
second gaming chip information as the total of the number of
detections       801.      For example,      when 100 gaming chips C are
                                           66

contained in the case 100, and one of the 100 gaming chips C
has no RFID tag 503 therein,          the identifying      unit 230 specifies
100 pieces of second gaming chip information from a plurality
of gaming chips C but obtains only 99 pieces of first gaming
chip information.        In this    case, the computer 222 sets      100 which
is  the larger    of the first    gaming chip information and the second
gaming chip information as the total             of the number of detections
801.
 [0159]
        In the case of the first       or second pass/fail      determination
method,    the computer 222 decides the number of combinations of
the first gaming chip information and the second gaming chip
information that       are determined to coincide with each other as
the number of authorized gaming chips C 802,              and decides a number
obtained by subtracting          the number of authorized gaming chips
C from the total      of the number of detections 801 as the number
of unauthorized gaming chips C              803.
 [0160]
        In the case of the third       or fourthpass/fail       determination
method, the computer 222 decides a smaller one of the number
of pieces of first gaming chip information in which the
correspondence relation          with the first       gaming chip information
stored in      the use management device 303 has been confirmed and
the number of pieces of second gaming chip information in which
the correspondence relation with the second gaming chip
information stored in the use management device 303 has been
confirmed as the number of authorized gaming chips C 802,                     and
                                        67

decides a number obtained by subtracting the number of
authorized gaming chips C from the total of the number of
detections 801 as the number of unauthorized gaming chips C 803.
 [0161]
           In the case of the fifth       pass/fail    determination method,
the computer 222 decides the number of pieces of second gaming
chip information in         which the correspondence relation         with the
second gaming chip information stored in the use management
device 303 has been confirmed as the number of authorized gaming
chips C 802,         and decides a number obtained by subtracting          the
number of authorized gaming chips C from the total               of the number
of detections 801 as the number of unauthorized gaming chips
C 803.
 [0162]
           The pass/fail    result     display screen 800 includes a gaming
chip information display portion 804 that                 displays the gaming
chip information read out from the gaming chip C through the
identifying        unit  230.      In the gaming chip information display
portion 804,        when the gaming chip information stored in         the use
management device 303 is read or when the first gaming chip
information coincides with the second gaming chip information,
the gaming chip information is              colored and displayed,     and the
gaming chip information which is                stored in  the use management
device 303 but not read out is            displayed in white    (see FIG. 19)
 [0163]
           In the pass/fail result display screen 800,              when the
gaming chip information not stored in               the use management device
                                          68

303 is   read or when the first          gaming chip information does not
coincide with the second gaming chip information, the gaming
chip information is displayed outside the gaming chip
information display portion 804 as unauthorized gaming chip
information 805.

 (Gaming chip)
        FIG.    21 is   a side view of a gaming chip C'             according to
amodifiedexample.           In the gaming chip C of the above embodiment,
the designated color layer 501 is             sandwiched between the common
color layers 502,        but in     the example of FIG.     21,   in  the gaming
chip C',     a common color layer 502 is          formed as the center,          and
the designated color layer 501 is                formed as both       (upper and
lower) sides.         In the example of FIG. 21,           individual
identification information indicated by a 7-digit numeric
string    is  inscribed (printed)        on the side surface of the gaming
                                          69

chip C'      as code information 505'.                  In  the example of FIG.         21,
the code information 505'                 serving as the notation information
is    inscribed on the common color layer 502 in                        the middle.        In
this     case,   the code information 505'                 can indicate       10-th power
of 7 types of information.
 [0166]
           Further,     both the code information 505 indicated by the
presence/absence of the mark m described for the gaming chip
C of the above embodiment and the code information 505'                              of the
numeric string         illustrated         in   FIG.   21 are inscribed on the side
surface of the gaming chip C.                  In this    case, the code information
505 of the mark m and the code information 505'                          of the numeric
string      may be printed         with different       types of ink.       For example,
the code information 505 of the mark m may be printed                            with the
infrared reaction ink, and the code information 505'                                of the
numeric string        may be printed          with the UV reactive         ink.    In this
case, an infrared camera and an ultraviolet camera may be
prepared to photograph the side surface of the gaming chip C,
the code information 505 of the mark mmaybe readby the infrared
camera,      and the code information 505' of the numeric string                        may
be read by the ultraviolet camera.
 [0167]
           FIG.  22 is      a side sectional           view of the gaming chip C'
according to another modified example.                       The gaming chip C'' has
a multi-layer        structure         in  which a plurality         of plastic     layers
having different            colors are stacked,            a designated color layer
501     (a  colored layer)          is   arranged at least        in    the middle,     and
                                                70

a common color layer              (a white or light-colored               layer)     502 are
stacked on both sides of the designated color layer 501 in                                the
middle.        It   is desirable     that   the color ofthe common color layer
502 be thinner than the color of the designated color layer 501.
Since the gaming chip C''               has a multi-layer          structure       in   which
the designated color layer 501 is                arranged,        and the common color
layer 502 is         stacked on both sides of the designated color layer
501 in      the middle as described above,              it   is   possible to specify
a type of gaming chip C''                 (10 points, 20 points, 100 points,
1,000 points,           or the like)      by forming a stripe             pattern      on the
side surface in          a stack direction        and changing the color of the
designated color layer 501                 (red, green, yellow, blue, or the
like) as illustrated in FIG. 23.
 [0168]
          FIG.     23 is  a perspective view of stacked gaming chips C'',
FIG. 24 is a side view of the gaming chip C'',                            and FIG. 25 is
a plan view of the gaming chip C'' .                  As illustrated            in FIG.   23,
the gaming chip C' ' has a five or more-layer structure                            in   which
a print       507    (100 points or the like)          indicating         a type (value)
of gaming chip C'' is            performed on the surface (the upper surface
and the lower surface) of the common color layer 502,                                   a
transparent          layer 504 is     formed as the outermost layer,                  and the
respective layers              are thermocompression-bonded.                    The gaming
chip C'' is        formed using an elongated plastic                material such that
a state in which the respective layers                        (the designated color
layer 501,        the common color layer 502,           and the transparent             layer
504)    are thermocompression-bonded and adhered to each other in
                                              71

an elongated stated            (a five-layer structure or the like)             is
formed and then punched out into a circular                 shape, a rectangular
shape, or the like through a process or the like.                       When the
punching is performed through the press, dimensions of a die
and a punch of a mold for punching are designed, and R treatment
 (rounded corner) is        applied to the end of the transparent           layer
504     of the outermost layer.
 [0169]
           Further,  in  the gaming chip C'',            the mark m''  is  formed
on the surface of common color layer 502 using the UV ink or
the carbon black ink.            The mark m' ' indicates      whether the gaming
chip C' ' is    true or false,        and the mark m' ' becomes visible       when
irradiated      with ultraviolet         rays (or infrared      rays),  and it  is
indicated whether the gaming chip C''                    is true or false in
accordance with a combination of shapes of the mark m' ' and the
number of marks m''.              The transparent layer 504 is
thermocompression bonded or applied on the outermost layer so
as to cover the print        507 or the mark m',       but embossing treatment
is applied to the transparent layer 504, and thus the gaming
chips C''      are prevented from adhering to each other.
 [0170]
           The R treatment         (R) is performed on the end of the
transparent      layer 504 of the outermost layer which has undergone
a print 507       (100 points or the like),             and the surface of the
common color layer 502 is             prevented from being deformed in         the
process of punching the gaming chip C''                    and appearing on the
side surface.        Further,       a sharp edge of the gaming chip C' ' is
                                           72

prevented from remaining and damaging a hand and other gaming
chips C''.
 [0171]
          As illustrated          in   FIG.  22,   the designated color layer 501
may be formed by a plurality                of layers colored in          the designated
color       (three layers in          FIG.   22).      Since a plurality            of layers
colored in        the designated color              (three layers in          FIG.      22) are
thermocompression bonded to each other, the three-layer
structure       is    not visible        as illustrated          in  FIG.     22,     and FIG.
22 illustrates            the three layers of the designated color layer
501 for the sake of description.                       Further,     a partial         hollow B
is    formed in a middle layer among the three layers of the
designated color layer 501,                  and a RFID tag 503 is            installed      in
the partial hollow B.
 [0172]
           Since the gaming chip C,                C',   and C''      have a stacked
multi-layer         structure,        and a stripe       pattern     in  the lamination
direction       is   vividly      formed on the side surface as illustrated
in FIG. 2, FIG. 21,             and FIG. 22,         it is possible to easily and
accurately measure the color of the designated color layer 501
 (the type of gaming chip) and the number of designated color
layers 501 through image analysis as compared with a chip of
a related art.              FIG. 26 is a diagram illustrating an example
of an image obtained by photographing the stacked gaming chips.
As illustrated           in  FIG.    26, it  is  possible to photograph the side
surface of the gaming chip C through the visible                              light      camera
226 and clearly identify the designated color layer 501.
                                                73

Further,        it   is  possible to accurately analyze and determine an
image when an artificial                intelligence         utilization  type computer
or control system or a deep learning                          (structure)  technique is
used in       the image analysis.                Since the artificial      intelligence
utilization          type computer or control system or the deep learning
 (structure) technique                 is known to those skilled in the art,
detailed description thereof is omitted.
 [0173]
 (Detection of seal)
            As described above, the case 100 is sealed with a seal
after       a predetermined number of gaming chips C are contained.
The seal is         broken when the case is               opened to allow the contained
gaming chips to be withdrawn.                         The inspecting device 200 may
include a detecting             unit      that     detects    an unbroken seal affixed
to the case            100.    The detecting unit may detect the seal
optically          or magnetically.             In this     case, when an unbroken seal
is    not detected by the detecting unit,                      the determining unit     231
determines that            a plurality          of gaming chips C contained in          the
case 100         are fail.
 [0174]
 (Arrangement of components of inspecting device)
            In the above embodiment, all the components of the
inspecting device 200 are arranged in a single device as
illustrated           in  FIG.   6,   but the components may be distributedly
arranged.           For example, some or all of the computer 222,                       the
display unit 223,              and the communication unit 229 may be
implemented by a personal computer connected to the inspecting
                                                   74

device 200.         The distributedly arranged components may be
connected to be able to perform wired or wireless communication
or may be connected via a network such as the                           Internet.
 [0175]
          Further,      as illustrated       in    FIGS.    27 and 28,    the infrared
camera 225 and/or the visible                light       camera 226 and the arm 227
maybe separated from the inspecting device 200,                       and the cameras
may be connected to the computer 222.                        FIG.  27 illustrates         an
example in which only one of the infrared camera 225 and the
visible light camera 226 is                 installed separately from the
inspecting device 200, and FIG. 28 illustrates an example in
which the infrared           camera 225 is        installed      separately from the
inspecting device 200,                 and the visible light camera 226 is
installed     integrally         with the inspecting device 200.                  Further,
in addition to the infrared camera 225 and the visible light
camera 226,       an ultraviolet          camera may be installed              as a third
camera together with an ultraviolet                     lamp,  or one of the cameras
in   FIGS.   27 and 28 may be an ultraviolet                   camera equipped with
an ultraviolet lamp.

 (Gaming chip information)
          In the above embodiment,            in    the gaming chip C,         the gaming
chip information is stored in the RFID tag 503,                             the code
information 505 serving as the gaming chip information is
inscribed on the side surface, the designated color of the
designated color layer 501 of the side surface is also dealt
as the gaming chip information indicating the value of the
                                             75

gaming chip C, and one gaming chip C has the three pieces of
gaming chip information, but the present invention is not
limited to this      example,  and the gaming chip C may has only two
of the three pieces of gaming chip information.           When the gaming

may be formed by a plurality            of layers colored in     the designated
color     (three layers in FIG. 34).              Since a plurality of layers
colored in        the designated color          (three layers in   FIG.    34)   are
thermocompression bonded to each other, the three-layer
structure is not visible as illustrated in FIG. 34,                      and FIG.
34 illustrates           the three layers of the designated color layer
5501 for the sake of description.                    Further, a partial hollow
B   is formed in a middle layer among the three layers                       of the

of gaming chips to be stored is limited.                  The gaming chips C
are stored in   the case 5100 capable of containing a row of gaming
chips C stacked in a thickness direction, and the inspection
system 51 includes a reading device 5221 that                 reads the radio
tag 5503 of the gaming chip C in           the case 5100 and acquires the
gaming chip information of the gaming chip C and the determining
unit 5222 that compares the gaming chip information acquired
by the reading device 5221 with a maximum of the number of gaming
chips storable    in   the case 5100        (it   is  set to a maximum of 100
in  the present embodiment)       and determines an abnormality of the

installed         in   the storage R,         and the case 5100 that      arrived from
the factory F is             inspected through the inspecting device 5200.
 [0230]
           Meanwhile, the case identification information and the
                                                 93

gaming chip information associated with the case identification
information are transmitted           from the manufacturing management
device 5302 in        the factory F to the information database 5303
in   the game hall     P.    The information database 5303 acquires the
case identification          information and the gaming chip information
associated with the case identification information from the
manufacturing management device 5302 for each of a plurality
of cases 5100 containing the gaming chip C and includes a storage
unit   that    stores    the acquired information for each case 5100.
The information database 5303 may be a personal computer.
 [0231]
         In the inspection performed by the inspecting device 5200
in the storage R,           an inspection is performed using the
information stored in          the information database 5303.     The case
5100 determined to be pass in            the inspection in  the storage R
is carried to a game table T             (s9) or carried to a cashier CA
 (s10).     Each of the game table T and the cashier CA includes
the inspecting device 5200,            and the case 5100 containing the
gaming chip C is inspected by the inspecting devices 5200 in
a sealed state.           In the game table T and the cashier CA, the
case 5100 containing used gaming chips C is           also inspected,  and
the inspecting device 5200 is           also used for the inspection.   In
the inspection in         the three inspecting devices 5200 in    the game
hall P, the case identification information transmitted from
the manufacturing management device 5302 and stored in the
information database 5303 and the gaming chip information
associated with the case identification information are
                                         94

referred to.
[0232]
       Further, in the above embodiment, the gaming chip C
includes the identification information and/or the value
information as the radio tag information.       Here, the
identification information is    information uniquely specifying
each gaming chip C, whereas the value information is information
that can overlap each other in a plurality of gaming chips C
and can be regarded as information      (group information)
indicating a group to which each gaming chip belongs.       In the
present embodiment,   as the group information of the associated
group, instead of the value or in addition to the value, for
example, information of a gaming chip manufacturing time, a
manufacturer,   and/or a game hall in which a gaming chip is used
may be employed.
[0233]
       In other words, the radio tag information may include the
identification information identifying the gaming chip or may
include the group information indicating the group to which the
gaming chip belongs.
[0234]
 (Detection of seal)
       As described above, the case 5100 is sealed with a seal
after a predetermined number of gaming chips C are contained.
The seal is broken when the case is opened to allow the contained
gaming chips to be withdrawn.     The inspecting device 5200 may
include a detecting unit that detects an unbroken seal affixed
                                95

to the case         5100.    The detecting unit may detect the seal
optically       or magnetically.       In this   case, when an unbroken seal
is not detected by the detecting unit, the identification
content determining unit 5231 determines that a plurality of
gaming chips C contained in the case                 5100 are fail.
 [0235]
 (Arrangement of components of inspecting device)

the display unit          5223,  and the communication unit       5229 may be
implemented by a personal computer connected to the inspecting
device 5200.          The distributedly arranged components may be
connected to be able to perform wired or wireless communication
or may be connected via a network such as the                  Internet.
 [0236]
 (Display unit)
            In the above embodiment,      the example in which the display
unit 5223 is configured with a liquid crystal panel has been
described, but the display unit              5223 may be a lamp that    simply
indicates        only whether it    is  pass or fail    or may be a lamp that
performs digital display of the total                 of the number of
detections 5801,          the number of authorized gaming chips C 5802,
and the number of unauthorized gaming chips C 5803.
