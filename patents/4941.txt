                                            BACKGROUND
           Bromodomains refer to conserved protein structural folds which bind to N-acetylated
  lysine residues that are found in some proteins. The BET family of bromodomain containing
  proteins is comprised of four members (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDt). Each member of
  the BET family employs two bromodomains to recognize N-acetylated lysine residues found
  primarily, but not exclusively, on the amino-terminal tails of histone proteins. These
  interactions modulate gene expression by recruiting transcription factors to specific genome
  locations within chromatin. For example, histone-bound BRD4 recruits the transcription
  factor P-TEFb to promoters, resulting in the expression of a subset of genes involved in cell
  cycle progression (Yang et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 28: 967-976 (2008)). BRD2 and BRD3 also
  function as transcriptional regulators of growth promoting genes (LeRoy et al., Mol. Cell 30:
  51-60 (2008)). BET family members were recently established as being important for the
  maintenance of several cancer types (Zuber et al., Nature 478: 524-528 (2011); Mertz et al;
  Proc. Nat' L Acad. Sci. 108: 16669-16674 (2011); Delnore et aL, Cell 146: 1-14, (2011);
  Dawson et al, Nature 478: 529-533 (2011)). BET family members have also been
  implicated in mediating acute inflammatory responses through the canonical NF-KB pathway
   (Huang et al. Mol. Cell. Bio. 29: 1375-1387 (2009)) resulting in the upregulation of genes
   associated with the production of cytokines (Nicodeme et al., Nature 468: 1119-1123,
   (2010)), Suppression of cytokine induction by BET bromodomain inhibitors has been shown
   to be an effective approach to treat inflammation-mediated kidney disease in an animal model
   (Zhang, et al, J. Biol. Chem. 287: 28840-28851 (2012)). BRD2 function has been linked to
   predisposition for dyslipidemia or improper regulation of adipogenesis, elevated
   inflammatory profiles and increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases (Denis, Discovery
   Medicine 10: 489499 (2010)). The human immunodeficiency virus utilizes BRD4 to initiate
   transcription of viral RNA from stably integrated viral DNA (Jang et al., Mol. Cell, 19: 523
   534 (2005)). BET bromodomain inhibitors have also been shown to reactivate HIV
   transcription in models of latent T cell infection and latent monocyte infection (Baneijee, et
   al, J. Leukocyte Biol. doi:10.1189/jlb.0312165). BRDt has an important role in
   spermatogenesis that is blocked by BET bromodomain inhibitors (Matzuk, et al., Cell 150:

   673-684 (2012)). Accordingly, there is an ongoing medical need to develop new drugs to
   treat these indications.

   dioxido- 1,2-thiazolidinyl, 1,1 -dioxidothiomorpholinyl)) and the nitrogen atoms may
15 optionally be quarternized. Unless otherwise indicated, the foregoing heterocycloalkyls can
   be C-attached or N-attached where such is possible and which results in the creation of a

   junctions are at adjacent ring atoms. The fusion junctions may be at nitrogen (e.g.,
    indolizine) or carbon atoms in the 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl.
            The term "hydrogen" (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a
   hydrogen radical, and may be depicted as -H.
                                                    47

           The term "hydroxy" (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -OH.
           The term "carboxy" (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -C(O)-OH.
           The term "amino" (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -NH 2.
           The term "halogen" or "halo" (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a
 5 fluorine radical (which may be depicted as -F), chlorine radical (which may be depicted as
   Cl), bromine radical (which may be depicted as -Br), or iodine radical (which may be
   depicted as -I). The prefix "halo" indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached
   is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example,
   haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a
10 halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl, 1-bromoethyl, fluoromethyl,
   difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and 1,1,1 -trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a
   substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical, those halogen radicals may be
   identical or different (unless otherwise stated). Examples of haloalkyl include C1-C3
   haloalkyls, which is a halogenated alkyl containing from 1 to 3 carbons.
15         If a moiety is described as "substituted", a non-hydrogen radical is in the place of
   hydrogen radical of any substitutable atom of the moiety. Thus, for example, a substituted
   heteroaryl moiety is a heteroaryl moiety in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the
   place of a hydrogen radical on the heterocyclic ring. It should be recognized that if there are
   more than one substitution on a moiety, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or
20 different (unless otherwise stated).
           If a moiety is described as being "optionally substituted," the moiety may be either (1)
   not substituted or (2) substituted. If a moiety is described as being optionally substituted with
   up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that moiety may be either (1) not
   substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by
25 up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the moiety, whichever is less. Thus,
   for example, if a moiety is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non
   hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be
   optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has
   substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position)
30 would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if
   an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen
   radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non
   hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up
   to only 1 non-hydrogen radical.

 5 tritium ( 3H) or 14 C isotopes. Isotope-labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by
   the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such isotope
   labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in
   the Examples disclosed herein and Schemes by substituting a readily available isotope
   labeled reagent for a non-labeled reagent. In some instances, compounds may be treated with
10 isotope-labeled reagents to exchange a normal atom with its isotope, for example, hydrogen
   for deuterium can be exchanged by the action of a deuteric acid such as D 2 SO4/D 2 0. In
   addition to the above, relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed, for instance, in

20           The isotope-labeled compounds of the invention may be used as standards to
   determine the effectiveness of BET bromodomain inhibitors in binding assays. Isotope
   containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo
   metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic
   pathway of the nonisotope-labeled parent compound (Blake et al. J. Pharm.Sci. 64, 3, 367
25 391 (1975)). Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe, effective therapeutic
   drugs, either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the
   metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic (Foster et
   al., Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14, pp. 2-36, Academic press, London, 1985; Kato et
   al., J. Labelled Comp. Radiopharmaceut., 36(10):927-932 (1995); Kushner et al., Can. J.
30 Physiol.Pharmacol., 77, 79-88 (1999).
             In addition, non-radio active isotope containing drugs, such as deuterated drugs called
   "heavy drugs," can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to BET
   bromodomain activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its
   natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from
                                                    51

   about 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 42, 46, 50, 54, 58, 63, 67, 71,
   75, 79, 84, 88, 92, 96, to about 100 mol %. Replacement of up to about 15% of normal atom
   with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in
   mammals, including rodents and dogs, with minimal observed adverse effects (Czajka D M
 5 and Finkel A J, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1960 84: 770; Thomson J F, Ann. New York Acad. Sci
    1960 84: 736; Czakja D M et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1961 201: 357). Acute replacement of as
   high as 15%-23% in human fluids with deuterium was found not to cause toxicity (Blagojevic
   N et al. in "Dosimetry & Treatment Planning for Neutron Capture Therapy", Zamenhof R,
   Solares G and Harling 0 Eds. 1994. Advanced Medical Publishing, Madison Wis. pp.125
10  134; Diabetes Metab. 23: 251 (1997)).
            Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico-chemical properties such as pKa
   and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response
   of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand-receptor
   interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope-labeled molecule are
15 different from those of the unlabeled one, the chemical and biological properties are the
   same, with one important exception: because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope, any
   bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond
   between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly, the incorporation of an isotope at a site
   of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the
20 pharmacokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non-isotopic compound.

            it can be appreciated that the synthetic schemes and specific examples as illustrated in
   the synthetic examples section are illustrative and are not to be read as limiting the scope of
   the invention as it is defined in the appended claims. All alternatives, modifications, and
 5 equivalents of the synthetic methods and specific examples are included within the scope of
   the claims.
            Optimum reaction conditions and reaction times for each individual step can vary
   depending on the particular reactants employed and substituents present in the reactants used.
   Unless otherwise specified, solvents, temperatures and other reaction conditions can be
10 readily selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. Specific procedures are provided in the
   Examples section. Reactions can be worked up in the conventional manner, e.g. by
   eliminating the solvent from the residue and further purified according to methodologies
   generally known in the art such as, but not limited to, crystallization, distillation, extraction,
   trituration and chromatography. Unless otherwise described, the starting materials and
15 reagents are either commercially available or typically can be prepared from commercially
   available materials.
            Routine experimentations, including appropriate manipulation of the reaction
   conditions, reagents and sequence of the synthetic route, protection of any chemical
   functionality that can not be compatible with the reaction conditions, and deprotection at a
20 suitable point in the reaction sequence of the method are included in the scope of the
   invention. Suitable protecting groups and the methods for protecting and deprotecting
   different substituents using such suitable protecting groups are well known to those skilled in
   the art; examples of which can be found in T. Greene and P. Wuts, Protecting Groups in
   Organic Synthesis (3rd ed.), John Wiley & Sons, NY (1999), which is incorporated herein by
25 reference in its entirety. Synthesis of the compounds of the invention can be accomplished
                                                     59

   by methods analogous to those described in the synthetic schemes described hereinabove and
   in specific examples.
            Starting materials, if not commercially available, can be prepared by procedures
   selected from standard organic chemical techniques, techniques that are analogous to the
 5 synthesis of known, structurally similar compounds, or techniques that are analogous to the
   above described schemes or the procedures described in the synthetic examples section.
            When an optically active form of a compound is required, it typically can be obtained
   by carrying out one of the procedures described herein using an optically active starting
   material (prepared, for example, by asymmetric induction of a suitable reaction step), or by
10 resolution of a mixture of the stereoisomers of the compound or intermediates using a
   standard procedure (such as chromatographic separation, precipitation, crystallization, or
   enzymatic resolution).
            Similarly, when a pure geometric isomer of a compound is required, it typically can
   be prepared by carrying out one of the above procedures using a pure geometric isomer as a
15 starting material, or by resolution of a mixture of the geometric isomers of the compound or
   intermediates using a standard procedure such as chromatographic separation.
            Compounds of formula I can be used in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
   The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means those salts which are, within the scope
   of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower
20 animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like and are
   commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
            Pharmaceutically acceptable salts have been described in S. M. Berge et al. J.
   Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1977, 66: 1-19.
            Compounds of formula (I) may contain either a basic or an acidic functionality, or
25 both, and can be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, when desired, by using a
   suitable acid or base. The salts may be prepared in situ during the final isolation and
   purification of the compounds of the invention.
            Examples of acid addition salts include, but are not limited to acetate, adipate,
   alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate,
30 camphorsulfonate, digluconate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate,
   fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethansulfonate (isothionate),

   Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl
   halides such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and
   iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides
   such as, but not limited to, decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides;
 5 arylalkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others. Water or oil-soluble or
   dispersible products are thereby obtained. Examples of acids which may be employed to
   form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include such inorganic acids as
   hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid and such organic
   acids as acetic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, 4-methylbenzenesulfonic acid, succinic acid
10 and citric acid.
            Basic addition salts may be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification
   of compounds of this invention by reacting a carboxylic acid-containing moiety with a
   suitable base such as, but not limited to, the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a
   pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation or with ammonia or an organic primary, secondary
15 or tertiary amine. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, cations
   based on alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as, but not limited to, lithium, sodium,
   potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts and the like and nontoxic quaternary
   ammonia and amine cations including ammonium, tetramethylammonium,
   tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine,
20 diethylamine, ethylamine and the like. Other examples of organic amines useful for the
   formation of base addition salts include ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine,
   piperidine, piperazine and the like.
            The term "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug" or "prodrug"as used herein,
   represents those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the
25 scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and
   lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like,
   commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use.
            Compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms,
   including hydrated forms, such as hemi-hydrates. In general, the solvated forms, with
30 pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water and ethanol among others are equivalent
   to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention.
   Pharmaceutical Compositions
            This invention also provides for pharmaceutical compositions comprising a
   therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically
                                                   61

   acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or
   excipient therefor. The phrase "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a composition suitable
   for administration in medical or veterinary use.
           The pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a compound of formula (I), alone or
 5 or in combination with a second active pharmaceutical agent, may be administered to the
   subjects orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally,
   topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term
   "parenterally" as used herein, refers to modes of administration which include intravenous,
   intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and
10 infusion.
           The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used herein, means a non-toxic,
   inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary
   of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable
   carriers are sugars such as, but not limited to, lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as,
15 but not limited to, corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as, but not
   limited to, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered
   tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as, but not limited to, cocoa butter and
   suppository waxes; oils such as, but not limited to, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil,
   sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such
20 as, but not limited to, ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as, but not
   limited to, magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water;
   isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as
   other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as, but not limited to, sodium lauryl sulfate and
   magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening,
25 flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the
   composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.
           Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically
   acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as
   well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just
30 prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or
   vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene
   glycol and the like), vegetable oils (such as olive oil), injectable organic esters (such as ethyl
   oleate) and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the
                                                      62

   use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in
   the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.
           These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents,
   emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be
 5 ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben,
   chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic
   agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable
   pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents, which delay absorption
   such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
10         In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow the
   absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be
   accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with
   poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of
   dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively,
15 delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form may be accomplished by
   dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.
           Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in
   biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug
   to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be
20 controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and
   poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in
   liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.
           The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a
   bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid
25 compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable
   medium just prior to use.
           Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders
   and granules. In certain embodiments, solid dosage forms may contain from 1%to 95%
   (w/w) of a compound of formula I. In certain embodiments, the compound of formula I may
30 be present in the solid dosage form in a range of from 5% to 70% (w/w). In such solid
   dosage forms, the active compound may be mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically
   acceptable excipient or carrier, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers
   or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid; b) binders
   such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia;
                                                    63

   c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate,
   potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates and sodium carbonate; e) solution
   retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium
   compounds; g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents
 5 such as kaolin and bentonite clay and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium
   stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate and mixtures thereof. In the case
   of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.
           The pharmaceutical composition may be a unit dosage form. In such form the
   preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active
10 component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing
   discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or
   ampules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it
   can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The quantity of active
   component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.1 mg to 1000 mg,
15 from 1 mg to 100 mg, or from 1% to 95% (w/w) of a unit dose, according to the particular
   application and the potency of the active component. The composition can, if desired, also
   contain other compatible therapeutic agents.
           The dose to be administered to a subject may be determined by the efficacy of the
   particular compound employed and the condition of the subject, as well as the body weight or
20 surface area of the subject to be treated. The size of the dose also will be determined by the
   existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of
   a particular compound in a particular subject. In determining the effective amount of the
   compound to be administered in the treatment or prophylaxis of the disorder being treated,
   the physician can evaluate factors such as the circulating plasma levels of the compound,
25 compound toxicities, and/or the progression of the disease, etc. In general, the dose
   equivalent of a compound is from about 1 pg/kg to 100 mg/kg for a typical subject.
           For administration, compounds of the formula I can be administered at a rate
   determined by factors that can include, but are not limited to, the LD5 0 of the compound, the
   pharmacokinetic profile of the compound, contraindicated drugs, and the side-effects of the
30 compound at various concentrations, as applied to the mass and overall health of the subject.
   Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses.
           The compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of the invention can be
   administered at the initial dosage of about 0.001 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg daily. In certain
   embodiments, the daily dose range is from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. The dosages,
                                                    64

   however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the subject, the severity of the
   condition being treated, and the compound being employed. Determination of the proper
   dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Treatment may be
   initiated with smaller dosages, which are less than the optimum dose of the compound.
 5 Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under
   circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and
   administered in portions during the day, if desired.
            Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard
   filled gelatin capsules using such carriers as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular
10 weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
            The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills and granules can be
   prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known in
   the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and may
   also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially,
15 in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of
   embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.
            The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with
   one or more of the above-mentioned carriers.
            Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable
20 emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds,
   the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for
   example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol,
   isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene
   glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut,
25 corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene
   glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and mixtures thereof.
            Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions may also include adjuvants such as
   wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming
   agents.
30          Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as,
   for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters,
   microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, tragacanth and
   mixtures thereof.
                                                     65

            Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which
   can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating
   carriers or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are
   solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or
 5 vaginal cavity and release the active compound.
            Compounds of formula I may also be administered in the form of liposomes.
   Liposomes generally may be derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances.
   Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals which are
   dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and
10 metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in
   liposome form may contain, in addition to a compound of formula (I), stabilizers,
   preservatives, excipients and the like. Examples of lipids include, but are not limited to,
   natural and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), used separately or
   together.
15         Methods to form liposomes have been described, see example, Prescott, Ed., Methods
   in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976), p. 33 et seq.
           Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound described herein include
   powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile
   conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers
20 or propellants which may be required. Opthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and
   solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.
   Methods of Use
           The compounds of formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and
   pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically
25 acceptable salt thereof, can be administered to a subject suffering from a bromodomain
   mediated disorder or condition. The term "administering" refers to the method of contacting
   a compound with a subject. Thus, the compounds of formula I can be administered by
   injection, that is, intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneously,
   intraduodenally, parentally, or intraperitoneally. Also, the compounds described herein can
30 be administered by inhalation, for example, intranasally. Additionally, the compounds of
   formula I can be administered transdermally, topically, via implantation, transdermally,
   topically, and via implantation. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the formula I may
   be delivered orally. The compounds can also be delivered rectally, bucally, intravaginally,
   ocularly, andially, or by insufflation. Bromodomain-mediated disorders and conditions can
                                                   66

   be treated prophylactically, acutely, and chronically using compounds of formula I,
   depending on the nature of the disorder or condition. Typically, the host or subject in each of
   these methods is human, although other mammals can also benefit from the administration of
   a compound of formula I.
 5         A "bromodomain-mediated disorder or condition" is characterized by the
   participation of one or more bromodomains (e.g., BRD4) in the inception, manifestation of

   therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically
   acceptable salt thereof, to a subject in need thereof.
           The compounds of formula I can be co-administered to a subject. The term "co
   administered" means the administration of two or more different pharmaceutical agents or
 5 treatments (e.g., radiation treatment) that are administered to a subject by combination in the
   same pharmaceutical composition or separate pharmaceutical compositions. Thus co
   administration involves administration at the same time of a single pharmaceutical
   composition comprising two or more pharmaceutical agents or administration of two or more
   different compositions to the same subject at the same or different times.
10         The compounds of the invention can be co-administered with a therapeutically
   effective amount of one or more agents to treat a cancer, where examples of the agents
   include, such as radiation, alkylating agents, angiogenesis inhibitors, antibodies,
   antimetabolites, antimitotics, antiproliferatives, antivirals, aurora kinase inhibitors, apoptosis
   promoters (for example, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w and Bfl-1) inhibitors, activators of death receptor
15 pathway, Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors, BiTE (Bi-Specific T cell Engager) antibodies, antibody
   drug conjugates, biologic response modifiers, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, cell cycle
   inhibitors, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, DVDs (dual variable domain antibodies), leukemia
   viral oncogene homolog (ErbB2) receptor inhibitors, growth factor inhibitors, heat shock
   protein (HSP)-90 inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, hormonal therapies,
20 immunologicals, inhibitors of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), intercalating antibiotics,
   kinase inhibitors, kinesin inhibitors, Jak2 inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin
   inhibitors, microRNA's, mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitors,
   multivalent binding proteins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), poly ADP
   (adenosine diphosphate)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, platinum chemotherapeutics,
25 polo-like kinase (Plk) inhibitors, phosphoinositide-3 kinase (bromodomain) inhibitors,
   proteosome inhibitors, purine analogs, pyrimidine analogs, receptor tyrosine kinase
   inhibitors, etinoids/deltoids plant alkaloids, small inhibitory ribonucleic acids (siRNAs),
   topoisomerase inhibitors, ubiquitin ligase inhibitors, and the like, and in combination with
   one or more of these agents.
30         BiTE antibodies are bi-specific antibodies that direct T-cells to attack cancer cells by
   simultaneously binding the two cells. The T-cell then attacks the target cancer cell.
   Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab (Micromet MT201), blinatumomab
   (Micromet MT 103) and the like. Without being limited by theory, one of the mechanisms by
   which T-cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule
                                                    69

   components, which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard, Bcl-2 has been shown
   to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest
   that inhibition of Bcl-2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T-cells when targeted
   to cancer cells (V.R. Sutton, D.L. Vaux and J.A. Trapani, J. ofImmunology 1997, 158 (12),
 5 5783).
            SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified
   nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity, but rather impart increased
   stability and/or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include
   phosphorothioate groups, 2'-deoxynucleotide, 2'-OCH 3-containing ribonucleotides, 2'-F
10 ribonucleotides, 2'-methoxyethyl ribonucleotides, combinations thereof and the like. The
   siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins,
   single/double strands, bulges, nicks/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide
   active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of
   nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2
15 nucleotides can be present on the sense and/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the
   5'- and/ or the 3'-ends of a given strand.
            Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen
   binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen
   binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term "multispecific
20 binding protein" means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated
   targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding
   proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be
   monospecific (i.e., capable of binding one antigen) or multispecific (i.e., capable of binding
   two or more antigens). DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD
25 polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig's. Each half of
   a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, a light chain DVD polypeptide, and
   two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a
   light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen
   binding site. Multispecific DVDs include DVD binding proteins that bind DLL4 and VEGF,

   Assay
            Compound dilution series were prepared in DMSO via an approximately 3-fold serial
   dilution from one of the following:
   Assay method C: 1250 pM-21 nM
10 Assay method D: 500 pM-8.5 nM
   Assay method E: 0.47 mM to 7.8 nM
   Assay method F: 250 pM-4.2 nM
   Assay method G: 0.047 mM to 0.78 nM
   or 5-fold serial dilution from one of the following:
15 Assay method A: 2.5 mM-800 nM
   Assay method B: 2.5 mM-797 nM
            For Assay methods A, C, D, and F: Compounds were then diluted 6:100 in assay
   buffer (20 mM Sodium Phosphate, pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic
   acid, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM DL-Dithiothreitol) to yield 3X working solutions. Six
20 microliters (pL) of the working solution was then transferred to white, low-volume assay
   plates (Costar #3673). A 1.5X assay mixture containing His-tagged bromodomain,
   Europium-conjugated anti-His antibody (Invitrogen PV5596) and the Alexa-647-conjugated
   probe molecule was also prepared. Twelve pL of this solution were added to the assay plate
   to reach a final volume of 18 pL.
25          For Assay methods B, E, and G: Compound dilutions were added directly into white,
   low-volume assay plates (Perkin Elmer Proxiplate 384 Plus# 6008280) using a Labcyte Echo
   in conjunction with Labcyte Access and Thermo Multidrop CombinL robotics. Compounds
   were then suspended in eight microliters (pL) of assay buffer (20 mM Sodium Phosphate, pH
   6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate, 0.01%
30 Triton X-100, 1 mM DL-Dithiothreitol) containing His-tagged bromodomain, Europium
   conjugated anti-His antibody (Invitrogen PV5596) and Alexa-647-conjugated probe.
            The final concentration of 1X assay mixture for assay methods A, B, C, D, E, F, and
   G contains 2% DMSO, 8 nM His-tagged bromodomain, 1 nM Europium-conjugated anti-His

   tag antibody and 100 nM or 30 nM probe (for BDI or BDII, respectively) and compound
   concentration in the range of: 50 pM-16 nM for method A, 49.02 pM-15.63 nM for method
   B, 25 pM-423 pM for method C, 10 pM-169 pM for method D, 9.19 pM - 150 pM for
   method E, 5 pM- 85 pM for method F, and 0.92 pM - 15 pM for method G.
 5         After a one-hour equilibration at room temperature, TR-FRET ratios were determined
   using an Envision multilabel plate reader (Ex 340, Em 495/520).
           TR-FRET data were normalized to the means of 24 no-compound controls ("high")
   and 8 controls containing 1 pM un-labeled probe ("low"). Percent inhibition was plotted as a
   function of compound concentration and the data were fit with the 4 parameter logistic
10 equation to obtain IC50 s. Inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated from the IC50s, probe Kd
   and probe concentration. Typical Z' values were between 0.65 and 0.75. The minimum
   significant ratio was determined to evaluate assay reproducibility (Eastwood et al., (2006) J
   Biomol Screen, 11: 253-261). The MSR was determined to be 2.03 for BDI and 1.93 for
   BDII, and a moving MSR (last six run MSR overtime) for both BDI and BDII was typically <
15 3. The Ki values are reported in Table 1.
   MNX-1 cell line proliferation assay
           The impact of compounds of the Examples on cancer cell proliferation was determined
   using the breast cancer cell line MX-1 (ATCC) in a 3-day proliferation assay. MNX-1 cells were
   maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 C' and an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . For
20 compound testing, MX- 1 cells were plated in 96-well black bottom plates at a density of 5000
   cells/well in 90 pL of culture media and incubated at 370 overnight to allow cell adhesion and
   spreading. Compound dilution series were prepared in DMSO via a 3-fold serial dilution from 3
   mM to 0.1 pM. The DMSO dilution series were then diluted 1:100 in phosphate buffered saline,
   and 10 pL of the resulted solution were added to the appropriate wells of the MX-1 cell plate.
25 The final compound concentrations in the wells were 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001,
   0.0003 and 0.000 1 pM. After the addition of compounds, the cells were incubated for 72 more
   hours and the amounts of viable cells were determined using the Cell Titer Glo assay kit
   (Promega) according to manufacturer suggested protocol.
           Luminescence readings from the Cell Titer Glo assay were normalized to the DMSO
30 treated cells and analyzed using the GraphPad Prism software with sigmoidal curve fitting to
   obtain EC 50s. The minimum significant ratio (MSR) was determined to evaluate assay
   reproducibility (Eastwood et al., (2006) J Biomol Screen, 11: 253-261). The overall MSR
                                                  239

was determined to be 2.1 and a moving MSR (last six run MSR overtime) has been <2. The
EC 50 values are reported in Table 1 for the indicated compounds.

   LPS (lipopolysaccharide) induced IL-6 production mouse assay
           Compounds of the Examples listed in Table 3 were assayed for their ability to inhibit
   LPS (lipopolysaccharide) induced IL-6 production in mice. Severe combined
                                                 250

   immunodeficient female mice (5 per group) received an intraperitoneal challenge of
   lipopolysaccharide (2.5 mg/kg, L2630 E.coli 0111:B4) one hour after oral administration of
   compounds. Mice were euthanized 2 hours after lipopolysaccharide injection, blood was
   removed by cardiac puncture, and then the serum harvested from the blood samples was
 5 frozen at -80 'C. On the day of the assay the serum samples were brought to room
   temperature and then diluted 1:20 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 % bovine serum
   albumin. Interleukin-6 measurements were performed using a cytokine assay from Meso
   Scale Discovery (Gaithersburg, Maryland) for mouse serum analysis according to the
   manufacturer's protocol and read on a SECTOR Imager 6000 (Meso Scale Discovery,
10 Gaithersburg, Maryland) instrument. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism software
   (version 5.0) incorporating Dunnett's one way ANOVA. The IL-6 mean and standard
   deviation of the group of vehicle treated animals were compared with the IL-6 mean and
   standard deviation of the group treated with drug. A p value < 0.05 means that there is less
   than a 5% probability that the mean values in the two groups are equal. The % inhibition
15 values in Table 3 all exhibited a p value less than 0.05.

   Xenograft tumor growth inhibition assay
           The effect of example compounds to inhibit growth of human tumor xenografts
   implanted in mice was evaluated. Briefly, cells obtained from culture (MV4-11 and OPM-2)
 5 or tumor brie (MX-1) were suspended in cell culture medium (MEM, Suspension, no
   Calcium, no Glutamine, Life Technologies Corporation) containing Matrigel (phenol red
   free, Becton Dickinson Biosciences Discovery Labware) and inoculated subcutaneously
   (approximately 5 million per site) into the right hind flank of SCID-beige (MV4-1 1 and
   OPM-2) or SCID (MNX-1) female mice (Charles Rivers Labs) on study day 0. Administration
10 of compound formulated in 2% EtOH, 5% Tween-80, 20% PEG-400, 73% HPMC (Example
   240, OPM-2 and MX-1) or 5% DMSO, 5% ETOH, 30% PEG400, 60% Phosal 53 (Example
   240, MV4-11 and Examples 290 and 271, OPM-2) was initiated at the time of size match.
   Examples 285 and 293 were formulated in 2.5% DMSO, 10% ETOH, 27.5% PEG400, 60%
   Phosal 53 MCT.
15         Tumors were measured with a pair of calipers twice a week starting at the time of size
   match and tumor volumes were calculated according to the formula V = LxW 2/2 (V: volume,
   mm 3; L: length, mm. W: width, mm). Tumor volume was measured throughout the
   treatment period or until the mean tumor volume in each group reached an endpoint of >1000
   mm 3. Results are shown in Tables 4, 5, and 6.
