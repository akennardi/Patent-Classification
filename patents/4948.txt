SURGICAL STAPLING APPARATUS WITH TISSUE POCKETS
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] The present disclosure relates to surgical stapling apparatus for performing endoscopic
surgical procedures and methods of use thereof.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Surgical stapling apparatus that clamp, cut and/or staple tissue between opposing jaw
structure are well known in the art.    Such surgical stapling apparatus can include loading units
with a tool assembly having two elongated jaw members used to capture or clamp tissue. One
of the two jaw members usually carries a staple cartridge that houses a plurality of staples while
the other of the two jaw members has an anvil for forming the staples as the staples are driven
from the staple cartridge into a stapling area defined between the two jaw members. Generally,
a stapling operation is effectuated by a drive member (e.g., a cam bar, a drive sled or other
similar mechanism) having a cam member that travels longitudinally through channels defined
in the staple cartridge and acts upon staple pushers in the channels to sequentially eject the
staples from the staple cartridge. Additional stapling may be required when tissue captured
between the two jaw members migrates from the stapling area in response to the compressive
forces acting on the tissues resulting from the longitudinal travel of the drive member along the
two jaw members as the stapling apparatus is fired.
[0003] It would be desirable to provide a surgical stapling apparatus that reduces tissue
migration from the stapling area for improving surgical stapling.
OBJECT
[0004] It is an object of the present invention to at least substantially satisfy the above desire.
SUMMARY
[0005] According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a surgical stapling apparatus is
provided. The surgical stapling apparatus includes a first jaw member, a plurality of staples, a
second jaw member, and a tissue pocket. The first jaw member has a first tissue contact surface

                                                    2
that defines staple retention slots. Each of the staples is received in a respective one of the
staple retention slots of the first tissue contact surface. The second jaw member has a second
tissue contact surface that defines staple pockets aligned with the staple retention slots of the
first tissue contact surface. Each staple pocket of the second tissue contact surface is configured
to form a respective one of the staples as the surgical stapling apparatus is fired. The tissue
pocket is defined in one of the first or second tissue contact surfaces and configured to capture
tissue therein to prevent the tissue from migrating away from the first and second tissue contact
surfaces as the surgical stapling apparatus is fired.
[0006] In some embodiments, the tissue pocket may be positioned between two adjacent staple
retention slots of the staple retention slots.
[0007] In certain embodiments, the tissue pocket may be positioned between two adjacent staple
pockets of the staple pockets.

defined in one or both of the first and second peripheral edges. The tissue pockets may include

                                                    3
a first set of tissue pockets and a second set of tissue pockets. The first set of tissue pockets may
be defined in the first tissue contact surface at a location offset from the first peripheral edge.
The second set of tissue pockets may be defined in the second tissue contact surface at a location
offset from the second peripheral edge.
[0013] In certain embodiments, the tissue pocket may define an open curve. In some
embodiments, the tissue pocket may define a closed curve.
[0014] According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure, an end effector for a surgical
stapling apparatus is provided. The end effector includes a cartridge assembly, an anvil

second tissue contact surfaces and is configured to capture tissue therein to prevent the tissue
from migrating away from the first and second tissue contact surfaces as the knife moves
relative to the anvil and cartridge assemblies.
[0015] In some embodiments, the end effector further includes a second tissue pocket defined in
one of the first or second tissue contact surfaces.
[0016] In certain embodiments, the tissue pocket may include tissue pockets defined in the first
tissue contact surface and tissue pockets defined in the second tissue contact surface.
[0017] In some embodiments, the cartridge member may extend to a first peripheral edge and
the anvil assembly may extend to a second peripheral edge. The tissue pocket may be defined in
one of the first or second peripheral edges. The tissue pocket may include tissue pockets
defined in one or both of the first and second peripheral edges. The tissue pockets may include
a first set of tissue pockets and a second set of tissue pockets. The first set of tissue pockets may
be defined in the first tissue contact surface at a location offset from the first peripheral edge.

                                                  4

extrusion forces, compression forces and/or other similar forces imparted to the tissue as a result
of operation of the surgical stapling apparatus.   In the following description, well-known
functions or constructions are not described in detail to avoid obscuring the present disclosure in
unnecessary detail.
[0029] Turning now to FIGS. 1 and 2, an electromechanical surgical stapling system or
apparatus, generally referred to as 10, includes a surgical device 100 in the form of a powered
handheld electromechanical instrument, an adapter assembly 200, and a surgical loading unit
(e.g., multiple- or single-use loading unit) or an end effector 300. The end effector 300 includes
an anvil assembly 310 and a cartridge assembly 320 that are movable between an open position
(FIG. 3) and a closed position (FIG. 4) to selectively clamp tissue "T" (FIG. 4) for cutting
and/or stapling the tissue "T." The cartridge assembly 320 includes a stapling and cutting
cartridge or reload 330 that may be selectively removable from the cartridge assembly 320. The
surgical device 100 is configured for selective connection with the adapter assembly 200, and, in
turn, the adapter assembly 200 is configured for selective connection with the end effector 300.

                                                   6
Together, the surgical device 100 and the adapter assembly 200 cooperate to actuate the end
effector 300.
[0030] In some embodiments, the surgical device 100 of the electromechanical surgical stapling
system 10 defines a longitudinal axis "X" and includes a handle housing 102 that defines a
cavity "C" for selective removable receipt of a rechargeable battery 103. The battery 103 is
configured to supply power to electrical components of the surgical device 100. The cavity "C"
supports a controller or circuit board 105 configured to control various operations of the surgical
device 100 and a drive mechanism 106 configured to drive rotatable shafts and/or gear
components (not shown) within the handle housing 102 in order to perform various operations
of the surgical device 100. For instance, the drive mechanism 106 may be operable to
selectively articulate and/or rotate the end effector 300 about, and/or relative to, the longitudinal
axis "X" of the electromechanical surgical stapling system 10; to selectively move the anvil
assembly 310 and/or the cartridge assembly 320 with respect to one another between the open
and closed positions to clamp tissue; and/or to fire the reload 330. The battery 103, controller
105, and/or drive mechanism 106 may be operably coupled to one or more triggers 107a, 107b
such as finger-actuated control buttons, rocker devices, and/or the like to effectuate various
functions of the electromechanical surgical stapling system 10 such as those described above.

U.S. Patent No. 5,964,394 (transverse stapling apparatus) for more detailed descriptions of each
of these surgical stapling apparatus, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated by
reference herein.
[0033] Turning now to FIGS. 3-5, the anvil assembly 310 of the end effector 300 includes an
anvil body 312 and an anvil plate 314 supported on the anvil body 312. The anvil plate 314
extends to peripheral edges 315 and includes a tissue contact surface 314a (FIG. 3A). The tissue
contact surface 314a of the anvil plate 314 defines staple forming pockets 314b configured to
receive and form staples 334 ejected from the cartridge assembly 320. The staple forming
pockets 314b of the tissue contact surface 314a are positioned in one or more rows that may be
in the form of longitudinal arrays along the tissue contact surface 314a. Adjacent staple forming
pockets 314b of the tissue contact surface 314a may be disposed in longitudinally and/or
laterally spaced relation. In some embodiments, adjacent staple forming pockets 314b and/or
inner and/or outer tissue pockets 314d, 314c may be in the form of annular arrays that are
radially spaced apart (e.g., a circular stapling apparatus).
[0034] The anvil plate 314 further includes outer tissue pockets 314c formed in the peripheral
edges 315 of the tissue contact surface 314a of the anvil plate 314 and inner tissue pockets 314d
formed along the tissue contact surface 314a at locations adjacent to the staple forming pockets
314b and between the outer tissue pockets 314c. For example, adjacent inner tissue pockets
314d may be positioned at longitudinally and/or laterally spaced locations relative to one
another along the tissue contact surface 314a of the anvil plate 314.
[0035] Each of the inner and outer tissue pockets 314c and 314d are configured to capture tissue
"T" clamped between the anvil and cartridge assemblies 310, 320 while the anvil and cartridge

                                                  8
assemblies 310, 320 are disposed in the closed position (FIG. 4) to prevent tissue migration
during a firing of the surgical system 10. The anvil plate 314 also defines a knife channel 314e
that extends longitudinally through the anvil plate 314. The knife channel 314e may be
disposed centrally between one or more of the rows of the staple forming pockets 314b or tissue
pockets 314c, 314d.
[0036] The cartridge assembly 320 of the end effector 300 includes a support body 322 and a
reload 330 configured for selective attachment to the support body 322. In some embodiments,
the cartridge assembly 320 further supports a lead screw 324 (FIG. 5) that is operatively coupled
to the drive mechanism 106 (FIG. 1) of the surgical device 100 to enable the drive mechanism
106 to rotate the lead screw 324. The lead screw 324 is threadably coupled to a drive beam 326
and rotatable to advance the drive beam 326 along the anvil and cartridge assemblies 310, 320.
The drive beam 326 supports a distally extending knife 328 and is configured to translate
longitudinally through the end effector 300 to approximate/unapproximate the anvil and
cartridge assemblies 310, 320 between the open and closed positions (FIGS. 3 and 4,
respectively) and to sever tissue "T."
[0037] The reload 330 of the cartridge assembly 320 includes a cartridge body 332 having a
tissue contact surface 332a. The tissue contact surface 332a of the cartridge body 332 defines
longitudinally extending rows of staple retention slots 332b that support rows of staples 334
therein. The longitudinally extending rows of staple retention slots 332b of the cartridge
assembly 320 correspond to, and align with, the longitudinally extending rows of the staple
forming pockets 314b (FIG. 3A) of the anvil assembly 310. The cartridge body 332 further
includes tabs 332c that snap-fit to the support body 322 of the cartridge assembly 320. The
reload 330 further defines a longitudinally extending knife slot 332d that extends through the
tissue contact surface 332a and is configured to receive the knife 328 of the drive beam 326 as
the drive beam 326 advances therethrough. The reload 330 further supports an actuation sled
336 (FIG. 5) that is engagable with the drive beam 326 and advanceable along the cartridge
body 332 of the reload 330 to engage pushers 338 (FIG. 5) supported within the cartridge body
332. The pushers 338 are positioned to support the staples 334 in the reload 330. The pushers
338 are also positioned to vertically advance through the staple retention slots 332b of the tissue
contact surface 332a of the cartridge body 332 to eject the staples 334 for formation of the
staples 334 against the staple forming pockets 314b (FIG. 3A) of the anvil assembly 310 as the
actuation sled 336 engages the pushers 338.

                                                  9
[0038] Similar to the tissue contact surface 314a of the anvil assembly 310, the tissue contact
surface 332a of the reload 330 defines inner tissue pockets 332e and outer tissue pockets 332f
that may have the same function and construction as the inner and outer tissue pockets 314c,
314d of the anvil assembly 310. Each of the tissue pockets 314c, 314d, 332e, 332f is configured
to prevent tissue migration from a stapling area "SA" (FIG. 5) defined between the first and
second tissue contact surfaces 314a, 332a of the anvil plate 314 and cartridge body 332 during a
firing of the surgical system 10 (FIG. 1).
[0039] The inner and outer tissue pockets 314d, 314c of the anvil assembly 310 and the inner
and outer tissue pockets 332e, 332f of the reload 330 may have any suitable shape such as
circular, non-circular, polygonal, rectangular, open, closed, etc. For example, the inner tissue
pockets 314d of the anvil assembly 310 and/or the inner tissue pockets 332e of the reload 330
may include closed circular-shaped curves and the outer tissue pockets 314c of the anvil
assembly 310 and/or the outer tissue pockets 332f of the reload may include open crescent
shaped curves. In certain embodiments, the outer tissue pockets 314c, 332f may define a
scalloped profile along a length of the end effector 300. In some embodiments, one or more of
the tissue pockets 314c, 314d, 332e, 332f may include multiple shapes at one location. One or
more of the tissue pockets 314c, 314d, 332e, 332f may include any suitable dimension such as
smaller and/or larger than one or more of the staple forming pockets 314b and/or the staple
retaining slots 332b.
[0040] In use, the trigger 107b (FIG. 1) of the surgical instrument 100 may be actuated to cause
the lead screw 324 of the end effector 300 to advance the drive beam 326 of the end effector 300
axially through the end effector 300. As the drive beam 326 advances through the end effector
300, the anvil and cartridge assemblies 310, 320 of the end effector 300 clamp together in the
closed position (FIG. 4) to clamp tissue "T" in the stapling area "SA" defined between the anvil
and cartridge assemblies 310, 320. As the anvil and cartridge assemblies 310, 320 are
approximated, the anvil and cartridge assemblies 310, 320 clamp tissue "T" to compress the
clamped tissue "CT" (FIG. 5) into the inner and outer tissue pockets 314c, 314d, 332e, 332f of
the respective anvil and cartridge assemblies 310, 320.
[0041] Continued distal advancement of the drive beam 326 of the end effector 300 causes the
drive beam 326 to engage the actuation sled 336 of the reload 330 and advance through the
longitudinal knife slots 332d, 314e of the reload 330 and anvil plate 314, respectively. Distal

                                                  10
advancement of the drive beam 326 advances the actuation sled 336 into engagement with the
pushers 338 of the reload 330 to fire the staples 334 from the staple retention slots 332b of the
reload 330 for forming against the corresponding staple forming pockets 314b defined within
the anvil plate 314 of the anvil assembly 310. As the drive beam 326 advances, the drive beam
326 pushes through and compresses the clamped tissue "CT" (FIG. 5) as the knife 328 of the
drive beam 326 cuts the clamped tissue "CT." With portions of the clamped tissue "CT"
captured within the tissue pockets 314c, 314d, 332e, 332f of the anvil and cartridge assemblies
310, 320, the tissue pockets 314c, 314d, 332e, 332f prevent the clamped tissue "CT" from
migrating away or otherwise extruding from the stapling area "SA" in response to the pushing or
compressive forces imparted on the clamped tissue "CT" as the drive beam 326 pushes through
the clamped tissue "CT."
[0042] Reverse rotation of the lead screw 334 causes the drive beam 326 to retract so that the
anvil and cartridge assemblies 310, 320 open or to unapproximate the end effector 300, whereby
the reload 330 can be replaced so that the end effector 300 can then be re-fired as needed or
desired.
[0043] As can be appreciated, securement of any of the components of the presently disclosed
devices can be effectuated using known fastening techniques such welding, crimping, gluing,
etc.
[0044] The various embodiments disclosed herein may also be configured to work with robotic
surgical systems and what is commonly referred to as "Telesurgery." Such systems employ
various robotic elements to assist the clinician and allow remote operation (or partial remote
operation) of surgical instrumentation. Various robotic arms, gears, cams, pulleys, electric and
mechanical motors, etc. may be employed for this purpose and may be designed with a robotic
surgical system to assist the clinician during the course of an operation or treatment. Such
robotic systems may include remotely steerable systems, automatically flexible surgical
systems, remotely flexible surgical systems, remotely articulating surgical systems, wireless
surgical systems, modular or selectively configurable remotely operated surgical systems, etc.
[0045] The robotic surgical systems may be employed with one or more consoles that are next
to the operating theater or located in a remote location. In this instance, one team of clinicians
may prep the patient for surgery and configure the robotic surgical system with one or more of

                                                   11
the instruments disclosed herein while another clinician (or group of clinicians) remotely control
the instruments via the robotic surgical system. As can be appreciated, a highly skilled clinician
may perform multiple operations in multiple locations without leaving his/her remote console
which can be both economically advantageous and a benefit to the patient or a series of patients.
[0046] The robotic arms of the surgical system are typically coupled to a pair of master handles
by a controller. The handles can be moved by the clinician to produce a corresponding
movement of the working ends of any type of surgical instrument (e.g., end effectors, graspers,
knifes, scissors, etc.) which may complement the use of one or more of the embodiments
described herein. The movement of the master handles may be scaled so that the working ends
have a corresponding movement that is different, smaller or larger, than the movement
performed by the operating hands of the clinician. The scale factor or gearing ratio may be
adjustable so that the operator can control the resolution of the working ends of the surgical
instrument(s).
[0047] The master handles may include various sensors to provide feedback to the clinician
relating to various tissue parameters or conditions, e.g., tissue resistance due to manipulation,
cutting or otherwise treating, pressure by the instrument onto the tissue, tissue temperature,
tissue impedance, etc. As can be appreciated, such sensors provide the clinician with enhanced
