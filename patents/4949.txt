       BINDER COMPOSITION AND COATING COMPOSITION MADE THEREOF
         The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent application
 number 2013402860, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.
                                   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates to a binder composition and a coating composition made
 thereof with reduced odor and volatile organic compounds (VOC) release.
                                        INTRODUCTION
         Binders are commonly used in interior and exterior wall coatings. Low VOC and low
 odor binder and coating products are desired in the industry. For wall coating applications,
 vinyl acetate comprised binder is widely used, especially in interior wall coating for its
 inexpensiveness and relatively low VOC impurities except acetic acid and low odor.
         Vinyl ester     of versatic  acid   incorporated   vinyl acetate   binder has improved
 performances, such as water and alkali resistance, UV resistance, and stain repellency.
         More and more coatings involve both vinyl acetate and vinyl ester of versatic acid
 these days. However, vinyl ester of versatic acid is a compound with smelly odor and is
 volatile into the air. The odor and its release into the air are very hard to be overcome since
compounds of vinyl ester of versatic acid have high boiling points.
         It is therefore still desired in the technical art for coating composition made of
 compounds of vinyl ester of versatic acid with reduced odor and volatile organic compounds
 (VOC) release. It is also desired that this binder composition is a vinyl ester of versatic acid
 based binder.
         Any reference herein to a patent document or other matter which is given as prior art is
 not to be taken as an admission that that document or matter was known or that the information
 it contains was part of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of any of the
 claims.
         Throughout the description and claims of the specification, the word "comprise" and
 variations of the word, such as "comprising" and "comprises", is not intended to exclude other
 additives, components, integers or steps.

           An aliquot of 2g (recorded accurately) homogenized sample was weighted into a
   20ml centrifuge vial. An acetonitrile solvent solution was added to the vial and their exact
   weights     were     recorded.  The   acetonitrile     solution     comprised  5000ppm     2(2
10 ethoxyethoxy)ethanol by weight as the internal standard, and 1000ppm ethyl oxalate by
   weight as the VOC marker. The vial was vortex centrifuged, shook for 1min, and held for
   5mins, then was vortex centrifuged again and shook for 1min to mix the sample with the
   markers. The vial was then vortex centrifuged at 4000rpm for 20mins. The supernatant of the
   mixture was taken out and filtered through a 0.45um syringe filter. The filtration was then

           Dispersion 1
           A monomer emulsion was prepared by first mixing 336.llg DI water, 55.17g A-102,
   and 23.66g 15-S-40, and followed by adding 13.26g SVS, 1310.70g VA, 331g VEOVA1O,
   16.71g acrylamide, and 690g DI water. The emulsion was charged to a 5L 4-neck round
10 bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen gas blanket, a thermometer, a
   condenser, a heating mantel and a temperature controller. The contents of the flask were
   heated to 81'C under a nitrogen atmosphere. lOg FeSO 4 7H 20 (0.2wt%), 2.lg EDTA (1%),
   3.75g SPS in 21g DI water and 80.90g E-1476 were added to the stirred flask. The flask was
   rinsed with 30g DI water. The monomer emulsion, the solution of 3.75g SPS dissolved in
15 70.46g DI water and the solution of 0.80g IAA and 2.00g sodium acetate dissolved in 70.46g
   DI water were then added to the flask over 180 minutes.           Reaction temperature was
   maintained at 75'C. Next, 38g DI water was used to rinse the emulsion feed line to the flask.
   After the contents of the flask were cooled to 70 0C, 1.18g t-BHP in 7.00g DI water, and
   1.18g IAA in 30g DI water were added to the flask. The flask was held for 10 minutes. The
20 flask temperature was cooled to 65 0C, then 0.71g t-BHP in 7g DI water, and 0.71g IAA in
   19g DI water were added to the flask. The flask was held for 10 minutes. Before the flask
   temperature was approaching 60 0C, 0.71g t-BHP in 7g DI water, and 0.71g IAA in 19g DI
   water were added to the flask. The flask was hold for 10 minutes.
           When the flask temperature was cooled to lower than 50 0 C, the contents of the flask
25 were neutralized to a pH of 4.64 by adding 27.56g NaOH solution (5.66wt%). After the
   solution of 10.86g KATHON TM LXE biocide in 8g DI water and 1.OOg NOPCOTM NDW
   defoamer were added to the flask. The gel was removed by filter and the resulting dispersion
   had a 52.310%solid and a 366nm particle size.
