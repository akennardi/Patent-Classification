                       DISH ANTENNA MOUNTING ASSEMBLY
   1. Field of the Utility model
            The present utility model relates to a support or a mounting means of a
   dish antenna, and more particularly to a dish antenna mounting assembly that is
 5 able to adjust mounting position of the dish antenna.
   2. Description of Related Art
            A dish antenna or free to air antenna is a device used to receive
   electromagnetic waves. The dish antenna has a satellite and a feed horn and is a
   kind of antenna that is specialized for receiving television signals transmitted to
10 a television set. The dish antenna installed outdoors can receive more adequate
   signals due to less obstacles interfering with the electromagnetic waves. The dish
   antenna is often installed at a high place such as a rooftop, a roof valley, a roof
   ridge, or a wall of residential or commercial houses and buildings.
            The dish antenna is mounted to an antenna mounting assembly that is
15 fixed to two parallel rafters of a building. A conventional antenna mounting
   assembly has a fastening assembly and an antenna mount. The fastening
   assembly is disposed between the two parallel rafters and has two opposite ends.
   The two opposite ends of the fastening assembly respectively abut against the
   two parallel rafters and are respectively fixed to the two parallel rafters. The
20 antenna mount is fixed to the fastening assembly and has a mounting mast. A
   dish antenna is mounted to the mounting mast.
            However, the antenna mount of the conventional antenna mounting
   assembly is welded to the fastening assembly and is unable to be adjusted
   relative to the fastening assembly. Therefore, the antenna mount is unable to be

                                           2
   adjusted positions or orientations. The conventional antenna mount directly
   welded onto the fastening assembly not only failed for various adjustments but
   also difficult to be packaged and transported.
            The main objective of the present utility model is to provide a dish
 5 antenna mounting assembly that is easy to be packaged, transported and installed.
   Entire mounting assembly suits for a wide range of roof angle.
            The mounting assembly comprises a fastening assembly and an antenna
   mount. The fastening assembly has a first assembling component and a second
   assembling component. The first assembling component has a receiving tube
10 and a first fastening unit. The receiving tube has two opposite ends and an
   opening formed at one of the two opposite ends of the receiving tube. The first
   fastening unit is connected to the other one of the two opposite ends of the
   receiving tube. The second assembling component is movably mounted to the
   first assembling component and has an inserting tube and a second fastening unit.
15 The inserting tube has two opposite ends. One of the two opposite ends of the
   inserting tube is inserted in the opening of the receiving tube. The second
   fastening unit is connected to the other one of the two opposite ends of the
   inserting tube. The antenna mount has a supporting plate, two U-bolts, and a
   mounting mast. The two U-bolts are connected to the supporting plate and
20 mounted around one of the receiving tube and the inserting tube. The mounting
   mast is fixed on the supporting plate.
            Other objects, advantages, and novel features of the utility model will
   become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in
   conjunction with the accompanying drawings.
