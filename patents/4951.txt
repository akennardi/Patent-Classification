35 Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
                                      10380655_1 (GHatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

                               - 8
   having a game controller arranged to implement a game and,
   separately, remote  (viz. from the game controller)
   compositing client, as described in greater detail below.
   In the embodiment, the compositing client takes the form
 5 of a field programmable gate array (FPGA), however, the
   compositing client may comprise, for example, a processor,
   a personal computer, a set top box, or a mobile
   telecommunications device such as a telephone or PDA.
10 General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
15 the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
20 and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
25 such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
30 receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
35 and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.           For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
                                       10380655_1 (GHKatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

                              - 9
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
 5
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components.  At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 12 and a game controller
   14 as illustrated in Figure 1.  The player interface is
10 arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
15
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 16 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 18, a game play
20 mechanism 20 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions                (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 22.
   The game controller 14 is in data communication with the
25 player interface and typically includes a processor 24
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display.  Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 26 but can also be hardwired.
30 Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:                a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
35 (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
                                      10380655_1 (GHKatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

                              - 10
   stored in memory   and generating outputs        (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs).         Most processors
   are general purpose units, however, it is also know to
 5 provide a specific purpose processor.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 30 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   30 includes a console 32 having a display 34 on which are
10 displayed representations of a game 36 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 40 of the gaming machine 30
   houses a bank of buttons 42 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 40 also houses a credit input
15 mechanism 44 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 44A and a bill collector 44B.      Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.  Other gaming machines may be configured for ticket
20 in such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticket.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
25 example as part of a loyalty program.         (Player marketing
   modules are also know by other names, for example, they
   are often referred to as a player tracking module                  (PTM).)
   The player tracking device may be in the form of a card,
   flash drive or any other portable storage medium capable
30 of being read by the reading device. In some embodiments,
   the player marketing module may provide an additional
   credit mechanism, either by transferring credits to the
   gaming machine from credits stored on the player tracking
   device or by transferring credits from a player account in
35 data communication with the player marketing module.
   A top box 46 may carry artwork 48, including for example
                                       10380655_1 (GHatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

                             -  11
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.              Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 50 of the console 32.   A coin tray 52 is mounted
 5 beneath the front panel 50 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 30.
   The display 34 shown in Figure 2 includes a video display
   unit 34A, particularly a cathode ray tube screen device.
10 Alternatively, video display unit 34A may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.   The top box 46 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit 34B, which may
15 be of the same type as video display unit 34A, or of a
   different type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
20 different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 60 includes a game controller 62 having
   a processor 64 mounted on a circuit board.             Gaming machine
   60 includes instructions and data to control operation of
25 the processor 64, and an operating system 66.                The
   instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 64 are stored in a memory 68, which is in data
   communication with the processor 64.       Typically, the
   gaming machine 60 will include both volatile and non
30 volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 68.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 70 for purposes
35 including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 74 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
                                       10380655_1 (GHKatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

                              - 12
   machine 60.   The input/output interface 74 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
 5 devices.   A random number generator module 76 generates
   random numbers for use by processor 64.          Persons skilled
   in the art will appreciate that the reference to random
   numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
10 In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 80
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 62 including one or more video displays 82, a
   touch screen and/or buttons 84  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 86, a printer 88,
15 a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 90, a coin
   output mechanism 92 and speakers 94.       Additional hardware
   may be included as part of the gaming machine 60, or
   hardware may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation.   For example, while buttons or touch
20 screens are typically used as input devices in gaming
   machines to allow a player to place a wager and initiate a
   play of a game any input device that enables the player to
   input game play instructions may be used. For example, in
   some gaming machines a mechanical handle is used to
25 initiate a play of the game.
   In addition, the gaming machine 60 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 78.
   The network card may, for example, send status
30 information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                      In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
35 communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
                                       10380655_1 (GHKatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 68.   The memory 68 includes RAM 68A,
 5 EPROM 68B and a mass storage device 68C.          The RAM 68A
   typically temporarily holds program files for execution by
   the processor 102 and related data.      The EPROM 68B may be
   a boot ROM device and/or may contain some system or game
   related code.   The mass storage device 68C is typically
10 used to store game programs, the integrity of which may be
   verified and/or authenticated by the processor 102 using
   protected code from the EPROM 68B or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
15 gaming machine 60 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 82, 84, 86, 88, 90,         92,     94 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 62.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 100 in accordance with an
20 alternative embodiment.   The gaming system 100 includes a
   network 102, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 104, shown arranged in three banks 106 of
   two gaming machines 104 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 102.   The gaming machines 104 provide a player
25 operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 30,  60 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.   While banks 106 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
30 or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 108 may also be connected to the
   network 102.   For example, the displays 108 may be
   associated with one or more banks 106 of gaming machines.
35 The displays 108 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 104,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
                                       10380655_1 (GHKatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

   In a thick client embodiment, game server 110 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
 5 104 and the gaming machine 104 implements part of the
   game.  With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide or constitute a game controller.                       A
   database management server 112 may manage storage of game
10 programs and associated data for downloading or access by
   the gaming machines 104 in a database 112A.             Typically, if
   the gaming system enables players to participate in a
   Jackpot game, a Jackpot server 114 will be provided to
   perform accounting functions for the Jackpot game.                    A
15 loyalty program server 116 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 110 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 104 and the gaming machine 104 essentially
20 provides only the player interface.     With this embodiment,
   the game server 110 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
25 display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
30 client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
35 administration of the gaming network 102, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 118, and a
   licensing server 120 to monitor the use of licenses
                                      10380655_1 (GHKatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

                              -   15
   relating to particular games.     An administrator terminal
   122 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 102 and the devices connected to the network.
 5 The gaming system 100 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 124.
10 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.      For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
15 separate server may be provided.     For example, the game
   server 110 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.   Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
20 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Figure 6A is a further schematic view of gaming machine 60
25 including various modules    (such as game controller 62);
   some of these modules are implemented based on program
   code and data stored in memory 68.       Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that various of the modules could be
   implemented in some other way, for example by a dedicated
30 circuit.
   Referring to Figure 6A, as described above gaming machine
   60 includes game controller 62.     Game controller 62
   includes a game application 132 that includes a graphics
35 or game engine 134, such as a Mercury brand graphics
   engine.   (It will be appreciated by those in the art that
   graphics engine 134 may alternatively be provided within
                                         10380655_1 (GHKatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

                              - 16
   game controller 62 by a module that is separate from,
   rather provided in, game application 132.)
   Gaming machine 60 includes a plurality of FPGAs 136
 5 mounted on a circuit board (or on respective circuit
   boards), separate or remote from game controller 62.                       Each
   FPGA 136 includes a respective graphics remote application
   138, and acts as a remote, programmable compositing client
   for graphical output that is to be displayed to a
10 corresponding video display 82a, 82b.        In the depicted
   embodiments, gaming machine 60 includes two FPGAs 136
   acting as compositing clients for respective video display
   82a, 82b, but it will be appreciated that in other
   embodiments only a single FPGA and video display may be
15 provided, or plural video displays connected to a single
   FPGA (depending on processing power and the number of
   video outputs of the FPGA),  or more than two FPGAs with a
   correspondingly greater number of video displays.
20 Graphics engine 134 of game controller 62 manages
   (including setting up) renderable graphics assets for use
   in graphical output ultimately to be output to video
   displays 82a, 82b.   These source graphics assets include,
   for example, sprites and text.   Graphics engine 134
25 communicates with FPGA 136 via a USB communications link
   140, which may alternatively be - for example - a serial
   or ethernet link.   Graphics engine 134 transmits the
   graphics assets on demand to the respective FPGA 136 via a
   communications link 140.   Graphics engine 134 also
30 transmits control data for controlling the graphical
   output to respective FPGA 136, via communications link
   140; in this manner, graphics engine 134 controls various
   visual aspects  (including positioning, rotation, scaling
   and fading) of the graphical output.       Each FPGA 136
35 renders the graphical output and transmits the rendered
   graphical output via a DVI, D-sub video link (or other
   suitable communication link) 144 to the respective video
                                       10380655_1 (GHKatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

                              - 17
   display 82a, 82b.
   Each FPGA 136 has memory, which is handled much as
   graphics engine 134 handles its texture cache.                 If a
 5 graphics asset is visible, FPGA 136 loads it; when a
   graphics asset is out of scope, the graphics asset is
   freed so that the memory of the respective FPGA 136 has a
   small footprint.
10 It should be noted that one or more of video displays 82a,
   82b may be a small or secondary screen interface                  (such as
   for displaying a dynamic pay table, a dynamic button deck
   or a progressive display).   Indeed, the same approach may
   be employed to display the output of a player tracking
15 module  (PTM), for inspection by an administrator, either
   associated with gaming machine 60 or provided in
   administrator terminal 122.
   This configuration is expected to improve speed in some
20 applications, and with minimal data storage requirements,
   in rendering rich scenes and live text.         As rendering is
   off-loaded to FPGAs 136, game controller 62 need only
   handle layout and update handling.     Data transfer over
   communications link 140  (between graphics engine 134 and
25 FPGAs 136) is minimized; it is envisaged that it may in
   many applications be as low as an average of 1 kB per
   frame of graphical output.   Furthermore, this approach
   allows game controller 62 to take advantage of any
   blitters on FPGAs 136.   It may be particularly attractive
30 for use in controlling the graphical output displayed on
   secondary or small video displays, as the described
   approach allows the elimination of a separate game circuit
   board for driving such secondary displays.
35 Figure 6B is a view of a variation 60' of gaming machine
   60 according to this embodiment.   Gaming machine 60'                    is,
   in many respects, identical with gaming machine 60 of
                                       10380655_1 (GHKatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

                             -  18
   Figure 6A, and like reference numerals have been used to
   identify like features.  However, gaming machine 60'
   employs FPGAs 136 as compositing clients for secondary
   video displays 82a, 82b.   Gaming machine 60' has two
 5 principal video displays 82c, 82d, but principal video
   displays 82c, 82d are driven by graphics engine 134 via a
   standard video card 146 provided in game controller 62 and
   respective DVI or D-sub video links 148a, 148b                (or other
   suitable communication links) connected to standard video
10 outs of video card 146.
   Thus, gaming machine 60' employs a combination of video
   displays, with graphical output rendered in a conventional
   manner to principal video displays 82c, 82d by graphics
15 engine 134 and graphical output rendered to secondary
   video displays 82a, 82b by FPGAs 136.
   Figure 7 is a further, simplified schematic view of gaming
   system 100, depicting game server 110 and three
20 representative gaming machines 104a,b,c.          Gaming machines
   104a,b,c are, in this embodiment, identical, but exemplary
   gaming machine 104c is shown in greater detail.                  Gaming
   machine 104c includes some components that are comparable
   to components of gaming machine 60 of Figure 6A, so like
25 reference numerals have been used to indicate like
   features.  For example, gaming machine 104c has a
   plurality of FPGAs 136 mounted on a circuit board (or on
   respective circuit boards).   Each FPGA 136 includes a
   respective graphics remote application 138, and acts as a
30 remote, programmable compositing client for graphical
   output that is to be displayed to a corresponding video
   display 82a, 82b.  In the depicted embodiments, gaming
   machine 104c includes two FPGAs 136 acting as compositing
   clients for respective video display 82a, 82b, but it will
35 be appreciated that in other embodiments only a single
   FPGA and video display may be provided, or a single FPGA
   with plural video displays, or more than two FPGAs with a
                                       10380655_1 (GHKatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

                             - 19
   greater number of video displays.
   However, gaming machine 104c also includes a
   communications hub 150, such as a USB or Ethernet hub,
 5 according to the communications protocol of communications
   between game server 110 and gaming machine 104c, and game
   server 110 communicates with gaming machine 104c                 (and
   correspondingly with gaming machines 104a,b) via a
   communications link 152 which may again comprise a USB,
10 serial or Ethernet link.  Gaming machine 104c further
   includes communications links 158 between hub 150 and
   respective FPGAs 136.  Communications links 158 may also
   comprise USB, serial or Ethernet links.
15 Game server 110 includes a game application 154 that
   includes a graphics or game engine 156; these are
   respectively comparable to game application 132 and
   graphics engine 134 of gaming machine 60 of Figure 6A, and
   thus graphics engine 156 manages renderable graphics
20 assets for use in graphical output ultimately to be output
   to video displays 82a, 82b of gaming machine 104c                  (and
   indeed the corresponding video displays of gaming machines
   104a,b).
25 FPGAs 136 of gaming machine 104c  (and of corresponding
   FPGAs of gaming machines 104a,b) thus receive renderable
   graphic assets and graphical output control data from
   graphics engine 156 via communications links 152 and 158,
   graphics engine 150 transmitting the graphics assets on
30 demand to the respective FPGA 136.
   Each FPGA 136 renders the graphical output and transits
   the rendered graphical output via a DVI or D-sub video
   link 144 to the respective video display 82a, 82b.
35 Graphics engine 150 controls various visual aspects
   (including positioning, rotation, scaling and fading) of
   the graphical output displayed on video display 82a,82b of
                                      10380655_1 (GHKatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

                              -  20
   gaming machine 104c  (and similarly on the video displays
   of gaming machines 104a,b).
   It will be appreciated that, in a variation of gaming
 5 system 100 of Figure 7, one or more of gaming machines
   104a,b,c may include further video displays comparable to
   video displays 82c, 82d of gaming machine 60' of Figure
   6B, driven by respective graphics cards located either in
   such gaming machines or in game server 110.               Also, in
10 other variations gaming machines 104a,b,c are different,
   such that gaming system 100 includes a mixture of gaming
   machines including one or more gaming machines comparable
   to gaming machine 60 of Figure 6A and one or more gaming
   machine comparable to gaming machine 60'           of Figure 6B.
15
   The basic method of the above embodiments of the invention
   is summarised in flow diagram 160 of Figure 8.                   Flow
   diagram 160 presents the steps of the method sequentially,
   but it will be appreciated that multiple instances of each
20 step will occur during a game, and in most cases
   essentially concurrently.    Referring to Figure 8, at step
   162, graphics engine 134 manages renderable graphics
   assets for use in graphical output.        At step 164, graphics
   engine 134 provides the graphics assets on demand to FPGAs
25 136.  At step 166, FPGAs 136 render graphical output
   including graphics assets to video displays 82a, 82b.
   At step 168, graphics engine 134 controls positioning,
   rotation, scaling and fading    (and optionally the layout)
30 of the graphical output.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
35 electronically, for example digitally by a processor.
   Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that the
   method could be embodied in program code. The program code
                                         10380655_1 (GHKatters) P83010.AU.3 20/06/18

                              - 21
   could be supplied in a number of ways, for example on a
   tangible computer readable storage medium, such as a disc
   or a memory  (for example, that could replace part of
   memory 68)  or as a data signal (for example, by
 5 transmitting it from a server).   Persons skilled in the
   art, will appreciate that program code provides a series
   of instructions executable by the processor.
   It will also be understood by persons skilled in the art
10 of the invention that many modifications may be made
   without departing from the scope of the invention;                    in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
   further embodiments.
15
   It is to be understood that, if any prior art is referred
   to herein, such reference does not constitute an admission
   that the prior art forms a part of the common general
   knowledge in the art in any country.
