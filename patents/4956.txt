                SYSTEM, METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RAPID FILM PRE
                                        VISUALIZATION
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] This invention relates generally to pre-visualization of film, e.g. feature films. More
particularly, this invention relates to methods, systems and apparatuses for rapid, near real
time or real-time pre-visualization of films.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002] Pre-visualization is a technique whereby a script or storyline is rendered into one or
more images representative of that script or storyline. Traditional methods involved the
generation of comics, storyboards, proposed frame sketches, etc., by an artist reading the
script in an attempt to capture a writer's or director's vision. More recently, computer
animation, possibly even using motion capture technologies with an actor or stuntman, have
been used to produce proposed pre-visualizations for later review by a director.
[0003] However, a common problem with all of these approaches is the fact that all of these
pre-visualization activities are merely attempts by others to capture the vision (action, style of
the shot, etc.) of a director on a scene by scene director. While a director or producer might
review a script with a traditional pre-visualization team prior to generation of the pre
visualization materials, it is a common problem that the end result is not what a director or
producer ultimately wants. This may be on the level of disliking one particular action
sequence, not liking a series of pans or angles on some or all of the pre-visualization
materials, or simply not liking the feel of the pre-visualization materials.
[0004] Dislike of the pre-visualization materials by a director or producer sends a pre
visualization team back to the drawing boards for generating second (or multiple) attempts to
capture the vision of the director before the film can move forward. Accordingly, this
process is expensive and inaccurate, involving many artists and/or animators over a several
weeks or months, before further production can proceed. Additionally, because the creative
vision of the producers and directors was not ongoing in the animators' process, all this work
might be scrapped when the final product was shared with the Studio, exec producers or the
director.
                                                  1

[0005] Also, in general, motion capture of live performance in real time has also been
extremely inefficient and expensive. For example, in the making of the film AVATAR,
James Cameron's LightStorm production company developed a filming system and process
requiring; costly, tethered light reflective mo-cap suits, a huge (warehouse sized) volume
filled with IR cameras and HD cameras, and a heavy and bulky virtual hand-held, tethered
camera wielded by the director (weighing approximately 35 lbs). The footage secured within
that virtual camera was limited artistically to a camera lens view of the action, and the
walking distance of the director. Additionally, the actual actors whose performances were
necessary for the production spent months on call and on set to pre-capture their contributions
to the film, thus further representing huge financial and time expenses. Because of these
limitations, the captured footage was actual final film footage (which would have been
captured after the pre-visualization stage).
[0006] Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an improved system, method and apparatus
for rapid film pre-visualization that avoids the above described problems and disadvantages.
SUMMARY
[0007] The above described and other problems and disadvantages of the prior art are
overcome and alleviated by the present system, method and apparatus for rapid film pre
visualization, including a motion capture component interfacing with wearable motion
capture sensors; a virtual digital rendering component configured to receive the captured
motion and re-create such motion in a three dimensional virtual space; a display component
configured to display an output of the virtual digital rendering component; and a controller
component, configured to interface with the virtual digital rendering component and allow a
user to navigate within the three dimensional virtual space to control the visual aspects of one
or more shots within the three dimensional virtual space.
[0008] In exemplary embodiments, a user (e.g., a director) can navigate through the space in
real time to generate pre-visualizations according to the user's preference or vision.
Exemplary embodiments allow for rough pre-visualizations, e.g. using MAYA as the virtual
digital rendering component to output flat shaded blasts for approval. Other exemplary
embodiments allow for more developed pre-visualzations, e.g., using an engine such as
                                                 2

CRYENGINE 3 to provide development (e.g., virtual terrain, etc.) to the three dimensional
virtual space defined by the pre-visualization process.
[0009] Also in exemplary embodiments, the controller may be a handheld device
incorporating a screen along with one or more hand controllers, wherein the hand controllers
are configured to provide navigation in the three dimensional virtual space and to provide
film camera controls, such as pan, tilt, zoom, etc. In one particular exemplary embodiment,
at least one hand control includes a navigation control that provides six degrees of movement
within the three dimensional virtual space (for reference, the "SpaceNavigator" from
3dConnexion provides six degrees of motion control). In exemplary embodiments, the
controller's physical position and positional changes are tracked via a magnetic field, e.g.,
such as is done with the Razer Hydra system in video gaming, to provide additional
navigation functionality to the controller. In other embodiments, rather than using a controller
hand component similar the "SpaceNavigator", two hand controllers similar to the Razer
Hydra controller may be interconnected by a bar. In any of the controller embodiments, a
screen or viewfinder may or may not be used (e.g., mounted on a bar extending between left
and right hand controller units), according to the preference of the user.
[0010] In other exemplary embodiments, the motion capture component utilizes plural radio
frequency (RF) detectors in a motion grid (an exemplary motion grid may contain, e.g., nine
RF detectors and head and foot tags, which facilitate removing drift inherent in the system).
An exemplary system includes an XSENS system, including such a motion grid and MVN
suits (which include accelerometers therein). An exemplary system for interfacing with the
virtual digital rendering component (e.g., MAYA) includes an IKinema system, which
generates 'stick figures' from the positional data emitted by accelerometers in the suit(s). In
exemplary embodiments, the virtual digital rendering component (e.g., MAYA), provides the
environment framework for generating characters in a virtual three dimensional space.
[0011] In other exemplary embodiments, a motion capture component detects the position of
and motion of the face of a performer. In one such exemplary embodiment, a performer
wears an infrared camera on a head rig pointing back at the face of the performer.
Information from the facial capture may be fed into a virtual digital rendering component
(e.g., MAYA), either alone or in addition to the exemplary motion capture (utilizing
performer worn suits) described above. Subsequent pre-visualization processing of the data
                                                 3

may then be performed by a director or animator, either in real time with the motion capture
or subsequent to any motion capture.
[0012] According to some or all of the above exemplary embodiments, the present invention
thus provides systems, methods and apparatuses that provide fast pre-visualization for films
utilizing control input, such as input from a director, to shape the pre-visualization. Thus,
exemplary embodiments might provide a system where performers (actors, stuntmen, etc.)
wearing wireless suits are choreographed in real time by a film's director. The director can
sit in front of a display that shows the output of the captured motion in a three dimensional
virtual environment and can both navigate and shape the visual shot within the three
dimensional virtual environment according to the director's taste and vision. The pre
visualizations can be output in basic form (e.g., flat shaded blasts) or within a virtual world
generated from an engine, such as the CRYENGINE 3, UNREAL engine, etc. The pre
visualizations can be generated on-set with the motion capture and with the director, in
addition to the data being subsequently available (after motion capture) for off-set variations.
[0013] The above discussed and other features and advantages of the present invention will
be appreciated and understood by those skilled in the art from the following detailed
description and drawings.

[0037] Further to the brief description provided above and associated textual detail of each of

the present invention.
[0038] As described herein, example embodiments of the present invention may include
systems, methods and apparatus for rapid film pre-visualization, including a motion capture
component interfacing with wearable motion capture sensors; a virtual digital rendering
component configured to receive the captured motion and re-create such motion in a three
dimensional virtual space; a display component configured to display an output of the virtual
digital rendering component; and a controller component, configured to interface with the
virtual digital rendering component and allow a user to navigate within the three dimensional
virtual space to control the visual aspects of one or more shots within the three dimensional
virtual space.
                                                 7

[0039] In exemplary embodiments, a user (e.g., a director) can navigate through the space in
real time to generate pre-visualizations according to the user's preference or vision.
Exemplary embodiments allow for rough pre-visualizations, e.g. using MAYA as the virtual
digital rendering component to output flat shaded blasts for approval. Other exemplary
embodiments allow for more developed pre-visualzations, e.g., using an engine such as
CRYENGINE 3 to provide development (e.g., virtual terrain, etc.) to the three dimensional
virtual space defined by the pre-visualization process.
[0040] Also in exemplary embodiments, the controller may be a handheld device
incorporating a screen along with one or more hand controllers, wherein the hand controllers
are configured to provide navigation in the three dimensional virtual space and to provide
film camera controls, such as pan, tilt, zoom, etc. In one particular exemplary embodiment,
at least one hand control includes a navigation control that provides six degrees of movement
within the three dimensional virtual space (for reference, the "SpaceNavigator" from
3dConnexion provides six degrees of motion control). In exemplary embodiments, the
controller's physical position and positional changes are tracked via a magnetic field, e.g.,
such as is done with the Razer Hydra system in video gaming, to provide additional
navigation functionality to the controller. In other embodiments, rather than using a controller
hand component similar the "SpaceNavigator", two hand controllers similar to the Razer
Hydra controller may be interconnected by a bar. In any of the controller embodiments, a
screen or viewfinder may or may not be used (e.g., mounted on a bar extending between left
and right hand controller units), according to the preference of the user.
[0041] In other exemplary embodiments, the motion capture component utilizes plural radio
frequency (RF) detectors in a motion grid (an exemplary motion grid may contain, e.g., nine
RF detectors and head and foot tags, which facilitate removing drift inherent in the system).
An exemplary system includes an XSENS system, including such a motion grid and MVN
suits (which include accelerometers therein). An exemplary system for interfacing with the
virtual digital rendering component (e.g., MAYA) includes an IKinema system, which
generates 'stick figures' from the positional data emitted by accelerometers in the suit(s). In
exemplary embodiments, the virtual digital rendering component (e.g., MAYA), provides the
environment framework for generating characters in a virtual three dimensional space.
                                                 8

[0042] In other exemplary embodiments, a motion capture component detects the position of
and motion of the face of a performer. In one such exemplary embodiment, a performer
wears an infrared camera on a head rig pointing back at the face of the performer.
Information from the facial capture may be fed into a virtual digital rendering component
(e.g., MAYA), either alone or in addition to the exemplary motion capture (utilizing
performer worn suits) described above. Subsequent pre-visualization processing of the data
may then be performed by a director or animator, either in real time with the motion capture
or subsequent to any motion capture.
[0043] Exemplary facial capture procedures in accordance with the above follow: An
exemplary process begins with an actor or stunt professional wearing a motion capture suit
with an infrared camera on a head rig pointing back at the face of the actor or stunt
professional. The infrared camera technology could be wireless or could have the camera
wired into a computer that is configured to capture a performance as a file (e.g., as a Quick
Time file). Additionally, the system could be configured to use facial markers for such
capture (utilizing placement of key readable markers physically placed directly on the
actors/stunt performers faces); or the system can be marker-less, e.g., similar to the Motek
system illustrated at
http://www.motekentertainment.com/index.php?option=com          content&task=view&id=17&Ite
mid=67. Reference is also made to FIGURE 13, which illustrates an example of such facial
capture utilized by the Motek Company.
[0044] In a further exemplary process, the actor or stunt performer runs through a broad
range of facial expressions. This enables the software within the facial capture system to
'understand' the actor's or stunt performer's features. At this juncture, the facial expressions
may be recorded in a convenient file format, e.g., a Quick Time video. This recording may
be fed into a suitable virtual digital rendering component, e.g. a MAYA system, along with
any information secured from the actor's or stunt performer's physical movements, e.g. as
detected by mo-cap suits.
[0045] Additionally or alternately, information from a bone driven face rig may be fed into
the virtual digital rendering component for the geometry and topography of the actor's or
stunt performer's face. The movements of the facial features captured by the infrared
camera and recorded as a video file may then be fed into a plug-in (i.e., a plug-in supporting
                                                  9

such bone driven face rig that is configured to feed into the virtual digital rendering
component) tied to the bone driven rig, so that the face appears within normal human
parameters.
[0046] In exemplary embodiments, the data streams from both the mo-cap suit regarding the
physical placement of the actor's or stunt performer's body in time and space and the data
stream from the facial capture infrared camera which provides input about the facial
expression upon the actor's or stunt performer's face during performance can be processed
through the pre-visualization system described herein. These data streams enable the director
or animator to effectively pre-visualize a scene from both the actor's or stunt performer's
actions and facial expressions within an established environment in a cry
engine/sandbox. Utilizing the virtual camera and overall pre- visualization system, the dual
data streams of physical movement, body placement in time and space and facial expression
expressed during those movements can be edited and re-edited into a seamless action
sequence.
[0047] While the above example describes pre-recording of an actor's performance, it should
be recognized that such pre-recording is not necessary, if desired. In one such example, a
performance can be fed from a camera directly to a bone based rig and driven in real time.
[0048] According to some or all of the above exemplary embodiments, the present invention
thus provides systems, methods and apparatuses that provide fast pre-visualization for films
utilizing control input, such as input from a director, to shape the pre-visualization. Thus,
exemplary embodiments might provide a system where performers (actors, stuntmen, etc.)
wearing wireless suits are choreographed in real time by a film's director. The director can
sit in front of a display that shows the output of the captured motion in a three dimensional
virtual environment and can both navigate and shape the visual shot within the three
dimensional virtual environment according to the director's taste and vision. The pre
visualizations can be output in basic form (e.g., flat shaded blasts) or within a virtual world
generated from an engine, such as the CRYENGINE 3, UNREAL engine, etc. The pre
visualizations can be generated on-set with the motion capture and with the director, in
addition to the data being subsequently available (after motion capture) for off-set variations.
Further, due to the relatively small size of various components, the present system provides a
                                                 10

portable capture, processing and pre-visualization system that permits easy relocation and use
in office type settings.
[0049] Hereinafter, example embodiments of the present invention are described in detail.
[0050] Turning to FIGURE 1, a flowchart of an exemplary system includes a motion
capturing component 12, shown here as an XSENS system, including such a motion grid and
MVN suits (which include accelerometers therein). The present inventors have also modified
the suits with attachment points for harnesses via reinforced holes and reinforced
accelerometers.
[0051] An exemplary system for interfacing with the virtual digital rendering component 16
(e.g., MAYA) includes an IKinema system 14, which generates 'stick figures' from the
positional data emitted by accelerometers in the suit(s). In exemplary embodiments, the
virtual digital rendering component 16 (e.g., MAYA), provides the environment framework
for generating characters in a virtual three dimensional space. While the following portions
of the specification specifically refer to various specific systems, such as XSENS, IKinema,
MAYA, CRYENGINE 3, Adobe, etc., it should be recognized that they are merely
exemplary systems, and other systems may be used within the basic framework of the
invention.
[0052] Referring still to FIGURE 1, in exemplary embodiments, a controller 18 acts as a
virtual camera within the framework provided by MAYA 16 via a virtual camera plugin 18.
Generated pre-visualization may then be output simply, e.g., as flat shaded blasts, for
approval, or with additional detail, such as a virtual world provided by an engine 22 such as
CRYENGINE 3. This additional detail may be provided with the MAYA or
MAYA/CINEBOX data for display to the director so that the director receives an immersive
image (even to the level of detail representative of actual film production) for use of the
virtual camera controller to direct action. Once a pre-visualization is considered satisfactory
(at 20), it may further be exported as a known or common format for storage (at 24).
[0053] Referring now to FIGURE 2, an exemplary diagram of a set including exemplary
aspects of the present invention is shown in perspective. An XSENS motion capture system
is illustrated, including performers in motion sensing suits 26. The XSENS system includes
RF detectors 28, which detect motion of the suits on a stage 30. Various terminals, shown
                                                 11

generally at 32, are also illustrated for motion capture and three dimensional virtual
environment rendering. An exemplary director's area 34 and exemplary directed image
processing area 36 are also generally illustrated, but will be described in more detail below.
[0054] Referring now to FIGURE 3, an exemplary motion capture and virtual environment
rendering terminals are generally shown at 32. A first exemplary terminal 36 (labeled as a
MVN Studio) captures data from the suits 26. A second exemplary terminal 38 (labeled as
MAYA TD) renders the captured data into a three dimensional virtual environment. A third
exemplary terminal 40 (labeled as MAYA/CINEBOX AD) provides an optional image
enhancement, such as rendering the captured motion for a given suit a specific character for
viewing by the director or other user.
[0055] FIGURE 4 further shows exemplary capture of data within the MVN motion grid
(including the RF detectors 28) of position and motion of the MVN suits 26 at the MVN
Studio terminal 36.
[0056] FIGURE 5 further shows exemplary conversion of the "stick figure" information into
character information at the MAYA TD terminal 38.
[0057] FIGURE 6 shows exemplary and optional additional shading or stereoscopic
processing of the MAYA image at the MAYA/CINEBOX AD terminal 40.
[0058] FIGURE 7 shows an exemplary director's area 34 and an exemplary directed image
processing area 36 together as a "virtual village." The exemplary director's area 34 includes
a controller 18 that acts as a director's virtual camera in the virtual environment and a multi
panel set view 42 to immerse the director in the virtual environment while directing the
camera action. The exemplary directed image processing area 36 (labeled in FIGURE 7 as
Adobe Premiere) includes software to edit the director's virtual shots.
[0059] FIGURE 8 illustrates the director's area 34 in more detail, including the exemplary
multi-panel set view 42 and an exemplary handheld controller 18 with an integrated screen 44
imitating a camera's viewfinder.
[0060] FIGURE 9 similarly illustrates the directed image processing area 36 in more detail,
showing an editing interface 46 and a display 48 showing the finished editing product.
                                                  12

[0061] FIGURE 10 illustrates an exemplary controller 18 that acts as a virtual camera for a
director. The exemplary controller includes a first handheld portion 50, which is configured
with a navigation toggle 52 having six degrees of motion. The illustrated exemplary first
handheld portion 50 is a modified controller with a toggle portion from a "SpaceNavigator"
product made by 3dConnexion. A second handheld controller 54 is tethered to the first
handheld controller 50 by an adjustable bar 56. The illustrated exemplary second handheld
controller 54 is derived from a Razer Hydra control system (which is shown generally at 58
in FIGURE 12). In exemplary embodiments, the illustrated system would also make use of
the magnetic Orb Controller (60 in FIGURE 12) from the Hydra kit.
[0062] FIGURE 11 shows another exemplary controller 18. This exemplary controller
includes first 50 and second 54 handheld controllers (with the first optionally configured as a
Razer Hydra controller), a connection bar 56, and a video screen 44 (also shown in FIGURE
8) that is configured to act as a virtual viewfinder for a director or user.
[0063] It should be emphasized that the above-described example embodiments of the
present invention, including the best mode, and any detailed discussion of particular
examples, are merely possible examples of implementations of example embodiments, and
are set forth for a clear understanding of the principles of the invention. Many variations and
modifications may be made to the above-described embodiment(s) of the invention without
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the present invention
should not be construed as being limited to a pre-visualization setting, since it should be
recognized that the ability to direct via the controller captured action in a three dimensional
virtual environment may be equally applicable to capture of finished film shots as to capture
of shots for pre-visualization of films. All such modifications and variations are intended to
be included herein within the scope of this disclosure and the present invention and protected
by the following claims.
