environment-friendly simple ceramic combined cabinet that can be combined with metal
blocks and can be mounted and dismounted repeatedly.
BACKGROUNDART
      Floor cabinets that are made of wood veneer plates and stainless steel plates on the
market are generally applied to kitchens, bathrooms, indoors and outdoors at present. The
cabinets made of wood veneer plates are poor in water-proof performance, mold-proof
performance and corrosion resistance and also poor in environmental friendliness; the floor
cabinets made of stainless steel plates can generate high noise when storing articles such as
tableware and sanitary ware and are prone to deformation and poor in electric conductivity
and corrosion resistance; floor cabinets made of marble plates are mostly connected with
chemical glue and are poor in bearing capacity, can generate radiation and are prone to
breakage; only one side of the marble plates is polished, and dirt is prone to being
accumulated in holes in the other sides of the marble plates, and consequentially the marble
plates are difficult to clean. Floor cabinets that are made of artificial stones, quartz stones and
other materials are all synthesized through chemical raw materials, thereby being poor in
environmental friendliness and having great influences on human bodies.
