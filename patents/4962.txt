                      ADJUSTABLE DIVIDER ARRANGEMENT FOR A LUGGAGE CASE
                                               TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]            The present disclosure relates generally to luggage articles, and more specifically
to an adjustable internal divider arrangement for a luggage case.
                                                 BACKGROUND
[0002]            It is often desirable to at least partially secure the contents within a luggage case
and/or divide the internal volume of a luggage case into separate compartment or
compartments. Some luggage cases accordingly include internal dividers provided inside the
case in a fixed height, flat position from the bottom wall of the case and typically centrally
between the two opposing shells of the luggage case and separating the internal case
volume into a separate compartment. The internal divider may be moveable to allow access
to the divided compartment but is typically at a fixed height. Such luggage cases often
include a separate tensioning system underneath the internal divider to hold contents in
place. Traditional tensioning systems, which may also be used without an internal divider,
include a cross-strap system with webbings or elastic members holding down the contents.
The cross straps, however, do not generate an even pressure and therefore cause creases
or wrinkles in the clothing. The internal divider(s) in some luggage cases are also not
completely fixed to the luggage case, presenting gaps between the internal divider and the
case through which a user's contents can undesirably shift.
[0003]            It is therefore desirable to provide an improved luggage case, and more specifically
an improved divider arrangement for adjustably coupling the internal divider to a luggage
case that addresses one or all of the above described problems and/or which more generally
offers improvements or an alternative to existing arrangements.
                                                    SUMMARY
[0004]            The present disclosure provides an adjustable divider arrangement for a luggage
case, as described below and defined in the accompanying claims. The present disclosure
advantageously provides a divider arrangement that provides improved adjustment of a
movable internal divider to the luggage case. For example, the divider arrangement
according to the present disclosure may allow the internal divider to be movably mounted
within the luggage case. The internal divider may be adjustably secured within the luggage
case via one or more strap and buckle configurations to press the internal divider against the
9893278_1 (GHMatters) P107837.AU

                                                    2
contents positioned below the internal divider. The large flat area of the internal divider
generates an even pressure on the contents, which can limit wrinkling of clothing secured
beneath the internal divider. Furthermore, the internal divider allows the contents of the case
to be compressed within the case such that more items can be packed within the case.
Preferably, the internal divider is fixed to the sidewalls of the luggage case to avoid small
items from coming out from under the internal divider and becoming trapped in the case
opening and/or preventing closing of the case. The internal divider is also preferably
mounted under spring bias to lift the internal divider away from an opposing wall of the
luggage case for easy packing.
[0005]            Embodiments of the present disclosure may include an adjustable divider
arrangement for a luggage case. The luggage case may include a plurality of walls defining
an internal storage volume, an internal divider separating the internal storage volume into a
first storage volume, at least two straps positioned near opposite ends or sides of the internal
divider and each connected to at least one of the walls of the luggage case, and at least one
buckle mounted on the internal divider. The plurality of walls may include opposing major
faces and a plurality of sidewalls. The first storage volume may be defined between the
internal divider and an opposing wall, preferably a major face. The divider may be movably
mounted relative to the opposing wall. Each strap may be connected to at least one of the
walls of the luggage case on or proximate to the opposing wall. Each buckle may adjustably
grip a corresponding strap at different positions along the length of the strap so as to secure
the internal divider to the strap at different positions along the length of the strap and thereby
to position the internal divider at different heights from the opposing wall of the luggage case.
[0006]            In one embodiment, there is provided a luggage case comprising: a plurality of
walls defining an internal storage volume, the plurality of walls including opposing major
faces and a plurality of sidewalls; an internal divider separating the internal storage volume
into a first storage volume defined between the internal divider and an opposing wall, the
internal divider movably mounted relative to the opposing wall, and wherein the internal
divider is a divider panel; at least two straps positioned near opposite ends or sides of the
internal divider and each connected to at least one of the walls of the luggage case on or
proximate to the opposing wall; and at least one buckle mounted on the internal divider, each
buckle adjustably gripping a corresponding strap at different positions along the length of the
strap so as to secure the internal divider to the strap at different positions along the length of

and preferably around substantially all, of a periphery of the internal divider to the luggage
case, and preferably to the sidewalls of the luggage case. The internal divider may include a
gusset, and preferably a flexible fabric gusset, coupling at least a portion of the periphery of
the internal divider to at least a portion of the periphery of the luggage case. The divider, and
preferably the divider and the gusset, may completely close off the first storage volume.
[0008]            In some embodiments, the at least two straps may include four straps positioned at
opposing corners of the internal divider.
[0009]            In some embodiments, the internal divider may be joined to the luggage case at
least adjacent a split line of the luggage case. The split line may define a first shell and a
second shell such that each shell includes a major face and a plurality of opposing sidewalls
extending from the major face.
[0010]            In some embodiments, the internal divider may include a selective opening defined
therein to allow selective access to the first storage volume through the internal divider. The

                                          DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0030]            According to the present disclosure, an adjustable divider arrangement is provided
for adjustably mounting an internal divider within the internal storage volume of a luggage
case. The divider arrangement includes at least two straps positioned near opposite ends or
sides of the internal divider and each connected to at least one of the walls of the luggage
case on or proximate to a wall opposing the internal divider, and at least one buckle mounted
on the internal divider. Each buckle may adjustably grip a corresponding strap at different
positions along the length of the strap so as to secure the internal divider to the strap at
different positions along the length of the strap and thereby to position the internal divider at
different heights from the opposing wall.
[0031]            According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, illustrated in Figs. 1-3B, a
luggage case 100 includes a housing formed from a plurality of walls or panels (hereinafter
"walls" for the sake of convenience without intent to limit) defining an internal storage volume
102 in which to carry a user's belongings. In one embodiment, the luggage case 100, which
may be rectangular in shape, includes at least one shell, such as a first shell 104 and a
second shell 106 defined by a split line 108. The luggage case 100 may be transformable
between a closed configuration (see Fig. 1) and an open configuration (see Fig. 2). For
example, the first and second shells 104, 106 may be pivotably attached together (e.g., via a
hinge structure or similar mechanism). In such embodiments, the first and second shells 104,
106 may be pivoted towards or away from each other to close or open the luggage case 100,
respectively. The hinge structure may be a fabric strip, a piano hinge, a living hinge, spaced
apart discrete hinges, a zipper structure, or an articulating joint made of elastomeric material
or the like, among others.
[0032]            In a preferred embodiment the luggage case 100 is an upright spinner case (see
Fig. 1), but could be any type of typical luggage case. In one embodiment, a split line 108
defines the first and second shells 104, 106 such that each shell includes a major face 120
and a plurality of opposing sidewalls 122 extending from the major face 120. Together, the
opposing sidewalls 122 define respective peripheral edges 124 of the first and second shells
104, 106 at the split line 108 between the first and second shells 104, 106. In some
embodiments, a frame may be coupled to at least one of the first and second shells 104, 106
at the peripheral edge 124. The first and second shells 104, 106, which may be front and
9893278_1 (GHMatters) P107837.AU

                                                        6
rear shells or a lid and a base, respectively, may be sized identically to each other, or one of
the shells (e.g., the rear shell) may be sized to include a larger or smaller internal volume.
The split line 108 may extend longitudinally along the luggage case 100 substantially parallel
to the major faces 120 of the first and second shells 104, 106. In some embodiments, the
split line 108 may jog or extend at an angle relative to at least one major face 120 of the
luggage case 100. In some embodiments, the luggage case 100 may further include one or
more support members, positioned on the bottom end wall. In some embodiments, the
support member is a foot. In some embodiments, the support member is a plurality of
wheels, such as spinner wheels, positioned on a bottom end wall. The plurality of wheels
may be positioned on the bottom end wall of the front and/or rear shell(s). In some
embodiments, the luggage case may also include one or more carry handles positioned on a
side or end wall and/or a retractable tow handle, extendible from a top face or end wall of the
luggage case.
[0033]            Depending on the particular application, the luggage case 100 may include a
closure mechanism 126. The closure mechanism 126 may be secured along the respective
peripheral edges 124 of the first and second shells 104, 106 to allow selective user actuation
for opening and closing of the luggage case 100. In the open configuration, the closure
mechanism 126 is disengaged along substantially the entire length of the split line 108,
allowing the first and second shells 104, 106 to pivot relative to each other to any amount
from partially open to fully open. The closure mechanism 126 is disclosed herein primarily as
a zipper closure, although other types of closure mechanisms are contemplated, including
without limitation a plurality of closure mechanisms (e.g., one or more latches) spaced
discretely along the split line 108.
[0034]            As described herein, and as illustrated in Figs. 2-3B, the luggage case 100 includes
an internal divider 140 separating the internal storage volume 102 into a plurality of storage
portions. In one embodiment, the internal divider 140 separates the internal storage volume
102 into a first storage volume or compartment 142 (hereinafter "first storage volume" for the
sake of convenience without intent to limit) defined between the internal divider 140 and an
opposing wall 144 of the luggage case 100 (see Figs. 3B-5). Depending on the particular
application, the opposing wall 144 may be any of the walls defining the housing of the
luggage case 100. In a preferred embodiment, however, the opposing wall 144 is one of the
major faces 120 of the luggage case 100. For example, in one embodiment, the first storage
9893278_1 (GHMatters) P107837.AU

                                                       7
volume 142 may be defined between the internal divider 140 and one of the front or rear
faces of the luggage case 100.
 [0035]           As described below, the internal divider 140 is movably mounted within the internal
storage volume 102 of the luggage case 100. For example, the internal divider 140, which
 may be rectangular in shape, may be provided on at least one shell (e.g., on the first shell
 104, on the second shell 106, or on each of the first and second shells 104, 106). In each
embodiment, the internal divider 140 is movably mounted relative to the opposing wall 144.
 In such embodiments, the internal divider 140 may move towards or away from the opposing
wall 144 to secure various amounts or volume of user belongings, such as varying amounts
or volume of clothing, within the first storage volume 142. For instance, the internal divider
 140 may be positioned away from the opposing wall 144 to secure an increased amount
and/or an increased volume of user belongings within the first storage volume 142 (see Fig.
4). In like manner, the internal divider 140 may be positioned towards the opposing wall 144
to secure a decreased amount and/or a decreased volume of user belongings within the first
storage volume 142 (see Fig. 5).
 [0036]           In one embodiment, the internal divider 140 may be adjustably coupled to the
 luggage case 100 to accommodate various volumes of user belongings within the first
storage volume 142. For example, the internal divider 140 may move relative to the opposing
wall 144 and tightened against the user belongings within the first storage volume 142. For
 instance, to accommodate for a decreased volume of user belongings within the first storage
volume 142, the internal divider 140 may move towards the opposing wall 144 and tightened
against the user belongings in a first position (see Fig. 5). To accommodate for an increased
volume of user belongings within the first storage volume 142, and also more generally allow
easier initial packing, the internal divider 140 may move away from the opposing wall 144
and then tightened against the user belongings in or towards a second position (see Fig. 4).
This also compresses a user's belongings and the contents to allow more room for other
 belongings within the remainder of the internal volume of the luggage case 100 as well as
securing a user's belongings within the luggage case 100.
 [0037]           The internal divider 140 may be coupled to the luggage case 100 in a variety of
 manners. In one embodiment, the internal divider 140 may be sealingly joined or coupled
around at least a portion, and preferably around substantially all, of a periphery of the internal
divider 140 to the luggage case 100. In a preferred embodiment, the internal divider 140 is
joined to the sidewalls 122 of the luggage case 100. Depending on the particular application,
9893278_1 (GHMatters) P107837.AU

                                                      8
the internal divider 140 may be joined to the sidewalls 122 at any position between the major
face 120 and the peripheral edge 124, such as at the peripheral edge 124 or below the
peripheral edge 124, among others. For example, the internal divider 140 may be joined to
the sidewalls 122 at least adjacent the split line 108 of the luggage case 100. In one
embodiment, illustrated in Figs. 2-5, a gusset 150 may couple at least a portion of the
periphery of the internal divider 140 to at least a portion of the periphery of the luggage case
100, such as defined by the sidewalls 122. In one embodiment, the internal divider 140
and/or the gusset 150 may be joined to a frame extending adjacent the peripheral edge 124
of the first or second shell 104, 106. In embodiments with a gusset, the gusset 150 may be
configured to allow movement of the internal divider 140 relative to the opposing wall 144.
For instance, the gusset 150 is preferably flexible, such as being formed from a flexible fabric
material. As described below, the internal divider 140, and preferably the internal divider 140
and the gusset 150, may completely close off the first storage volume 142. For example, the
gusset 150 may seal the internal divider 140 to the luggage case 100 to limit undesirable
removal or insertion of small items from or into the first storage volume 142.
[0038]            In a preferred embodiment, the internal divider 140 includes a peripheral frame 160
(see Figs. 4 and 5). The peripheral frame 160 supports the internal divider 140 within the
internal storage volume 102. For example, the internal divider 140 may include a planar
panel 162. The planar panel 162 may be flexible, such as being formed from flexible fabric
material. In some embodiments, the planar panel 162 may be semi-rigid. For example, the
planar panel 162 may be a panel or injected frame over-injected with a semi-rigid material to
define a screen. The planar panel 162 may be attached to the peripheral frame 160 such that
the planar panel 162 is at least partially maintained in a taut condition. In some
embodiments, the planar panel 162 may correspond to the shape and size of the internal
storage volume 102.
[0039]            The peripheral frame 160 may be arranged in substantially any manner. In a
preferred embodiment, the peripheral frame 160 includes a plurality of elongate rods 164,
such as pultrusions, which may be formed from blended steel wire in substantially any cross
sectional shape (e.g., square shaped, round, oval, etc.). At least two of the rods 164 may be
connected together to define a frame structure, the frame structure extending adjacent one
or more of the sidewalls 122. Depending on the particular embodiment, the peripheral frame
160 may extend around, or at least partially around, the periphery of the internal divider 140.
In each embodiment described herein, the peripheral frame 160 may move adjacent the

opposing wall 144. Depending on the particular embodiment, the peripheral frame 160 may
be positioned closely adjacent the sidewalls 122 or may be spaced away from the sidewalls
122 to provide a desired aesthetic and/or functional characteristic. For instance, spacing the
peripheral frame 160 away from the sidewalls 122 may lengthen the gusset 150 to allow the
internal divider 140 to move towards or away from the opposing wall 144 a greater amount.
[0040]            The internal divider 140 may include other features for convenience. In one
embodiment, illustrated in Figs. 2-3B, the internal divider 140 may include a selective
opening 170 defined therein (e.g., within the planar panel 162) to allow access to the first
storage volume 142 through the internal divider 140. The opening 170 may be selectively
opened (see Fig. 3B) and closed (see Figs. 2 and 3A) to allow selective access to the first
storage volume 142. For example, the opening 170 may be selectively opened and closed by
a zipper closure 172. The zipper closure 172 may be positioned at or within the perimeter of
the frame structure. As described more fully below, the opening 170 may be selectively
opened and closed independent of the internal divider 140 moving relative to the opposing
wall 144. For example, and without limitation, the internal divider 140 may be moved towards
or away from the opposing wall 144 regardless of whether the opening 170 is opened or
closed. In similar fashion, the opening 170 may be opened or closed regardless of the
position of the internal divider 140 relative to the opposing wall 144.
[0041]            Alternatively, the internal divider 140 could be joined to the walls of the luggage
case 100 directly via a zip to allow the internal divider 140 for at least part of its periphery to
be released from the walls to allow access to the first storage volume 142 below the internal
divider 140. For example, the internal divider 140 may be joined to the sidewalls 122 and/or
the major face 120 of the luggage case 100 via a zipper tape. One half of the zipper tape
may be attached to the luggage case 100, and the other half of the zipper tape may be
attached to the internal divider 140, such as via stitching, adhesive, and/or seam welding,
among others.
[0042]            The luggage case 100 includes at least one strap 180 (e.g., at least one strap, at
least two straps, four straps, etc.) arranged to control movement and/or adjust the position of
the internal divider 140 within the internal storage volume 102 (see Figs. 2-5). For example,
as explained below, each strap 180 may be adjusted to define the position of the internal
divider 140 relative to the opposing wall 144, such as limiting the extent of movement of the
internal divider 140 away from the opposing wall 144. In one embodiment, an effective length
9893278_1 (GHMatters) P107837.AU

                                                       10
of one or more straps 180 may be shortened (e.g., tightened) to move the internal divider
140 towards the opposing wall 144 to decrease the volume of the first storage volume 142. In
one embodiment, decreasing the volume of the first storage volume 142 may tighten the
internal divider 140 against the contents positioned within the first storage volume 142. For
example, the one or more straps 180 may be tightened to press the internal divider 140
against the contents positioned within the first storage volume 142 such that the contents are
compressed a desired amount, as described below. For example, each strap 180 may be
adjusted to press the internal divider 140 against the contents to limit movement of the
contents within the first storage volume 142 during transport. In embodiments where the
internal divider 140 includes a planar panel 162, the planar panel 162 may provide an
increased surface area configured to engage the contents within the first storage volume 142
compared to traditional elastic strap compression systems. The increased surface area of the
planar panel 162 may provide an even pressure over a larger area of the contents, which
may limit wrinkling of clothing secured within the first storage volume 142, for instance.
[0043]            In like manner, the effective length of one or more straps 180 may be lengthened
(e.g., loosened) to allow the internal divider 140 to be moved away from the opposing wall
144. For example, the strap(s) 180 may be lengthened to increase the volume of the first
storage volume 142. In one embodiment, increasing the volume of the first storage volume
142 may loosen the internal divider 140 against the contents positioned within the first
storage volume 142. Additionally or alternatively, increasing the volume of the first storage
volume 142 may permit a user to place desired contents within the first storage volume 142,
such as filling the first storage volume 142 with a desired amount of clothing.
[0044]            In one embodiment, illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, each strap 180 may be positioned
near an end or side of the internal divider 140 and connected to at least one of the walls of
the luggage case 100, such as on or proximate to the opposing wall 144. In embodiments
including two or more straps 180, the straps 180 may be positioned at opposite ends or sides
of the internal divider 140 to control the movement and/or the position of the opposing ends
of the internal divider 140. For example, at least two straps 180 may be positioned adjacent
each respective corner of each opposing end of the internal divider 140. In a preferred
embodiment, the luggage case 100 includes four straps 180 positioned towards or at the four
corners of the internal divider 140. Preferably, each strap 180 is connected to the luggage
case 100 below the internal divider 140, such as to or adjacent the major face 120 opposing
the internal divider 140 (see Figs. 4 and 5). In one embodiment, each strap 180 may be
9893278_1 (GHMatters) P107837.AU

                                                   11
connected to the opposing wall 144 of the luggage case 100. Each strap 180 may be flexible,
such as being formed from flexible webbing material.
[0045]            The luggage case 100 may include at least one buckle 190 (e.g., one buckle, two
buckles, four buckles, etc.) mounted on the internal divider 140, such as to correspond with
each strap 180 (see Figs. 4 and 5). In such embodiments, each strap 180 may extend from
the luggage case 100 to a corresponding buckle 190 to secure the internal divider 140 within
the internal storage volume 102. Each buckle 190 may adjustably grip its corresponding
strap 180 to position the internal divider 140 at a desired distance or height (H) away from
the opposing wall 144. For example, each buckle 190 may adjustably grip its corresponding
strap 180 at different positions along the length of the strap 180 so as to secure the internal
divider 140 to the strap 180 at different positions along the length of the corresponding strap
180, which may position the internal divider 140, such as the ends of the internal divider 140,
at different heights H from the opposing wall 144 of the luggage case 100 (see Figs. 4 and
5). In some embodiments, each buckle 190 may be biased to automatically lock onto a
corresponding strap 180 as the strap 180 is tightened to pull the internal divider 140 towards
the opposing wall 144. Additionally or alternatively, each buckle 190 may be selectively
releasable to allow the strap 180 to move in an opposite direction and allow the internal
divider 140 to be moved away from the opposing wall 144, as described more fully below.
[0046]            Each buckle 190 may be mounted to the internal divider 140 in a variety of
manners. For example, as described below, at least a portion of each buckle 190 may be
mounted to the planar panel 162. Additionally or alternatively, at least a portion of each
buckle 190 may be mounted to the peripheral frame 160 of the internal divider 140. Each
buckle 190 may be releasably or fixedly secured to the internal divider 140. For example, at
least a portion of each buckle 190 may be formed integrally with a portion of the peripheral
frame 160. Additionally or alternatively, portions of each buckle 190 may be stitched, welded,
and/or adhesively attached to the internal divider 140 (e.g., to the planar panel 162).
[0047]            Each buckle 190 may include substantially any configuration operable to adjustably
grip a corresponding strap 180. In one embodiment, each buckle 190 may be configured
such that a corresponding strap 180 may move relative to the buckle 190 freely in one
direction but may be limited from moving relative to the buckle 190 in an opposite direction.
For example, the strap 180 may move freely relative to the buckle 190 in a first direction
(e.g., upwards in Figs. 4 and 5) to allow the internal divider 140 to be tightened against the
contents within the first storage volume 142. For instance, each buckle 190 may be arranged
9893278_1 (GHMatters) P107837.AU

                                                     12
such that the strap 180 may move freely relative to the buckle 190 in the first direction to
decrease the effective length of the strap 180 (i.e., the length of the strap 180 between the
internal divider 140 and the luggage case 100). To limit loosening of the internal divider 140,
the strap 180 may be limited from moving relative to the buckle 190 in a second direction
(e.g., downwards in Figs. 4 and 5). For example, each buckle 190 may be arranged such that
movement of the strap 180 relative to the buckle 190 in the second direction increases the
grip between the buckle 190 and the strap 180 to limit undesired lengthening of the strap
180.
[0048]            In one non-limiting example, each buckle 190 may include a first member 192 and
a second member 194 (see Figs. 6 and 7). The first and second members 192, 194 may
interlock together in a manner to permit a degree of movement of the second member 194
relative to the first member 192 to adjustably grip a corresponding strap 180, as described
more fully below. The first member 192 may include a pair of opposing walls 196 defining a
cavity 198 therebetween, the strap 180 arranged to extend through the cavity 198. As
illustrated in Fig. 7, the opposing walls 196 may converge towards each other such that the
cavity 198 includes a narrower width nearer the bottom of the first member 192. As described
below, the converging nature of the opposing walls 196 may facilitate the adjustable gripping
nature of the buckle 190. In some embodiments, the first member 192 may include a flange
200 extending away from at least one of the opposing walls 196. In such embodiments, the
flange 200 may be coupled to the internal divider 140 to mount the buckle 190 to the internal
divider 140. For example, and without limitation, the planar panel 162 may be stitched to the
flange 200 (see Figs. 4 and 5). Additionally or alternatively, the peripheral frame 160 may be
coupled to the flange 200, such as via structure surrounding a portion of the peripheral frame
160 and stitched to the flange 200 (see dashed structure shown in Figs. 4 and 5).
[0049]            The second member 194 may be configured to interlock with the first member 192.
For instance, in the embodiments of Figs. 7-9, the second member 194 may include a first
portion 210 and a second portion 212 extending from the first portion 210. The second
portion 212 may be sized and shaped to be inserted at least partially within the cavity 198
defined in the first member 192. In such embodiments, each buckle 190 may include an
engagement member 220 coupled to the second portion 212 to adjustably grip the strap 180.
The engagement member 220 may be roller 222 rotatably coupled to the second portion 212.
As explained below, the roller 222 may permit selective movement of the strap 180 through
the buckle 190 while simultaneously providing selective grip between the strap 180 and the
9893278_1 (GHMatters) P107837.AU

                                                    13
buckle 190 to secure the internal divider 140 to the strap 180 at different positions along the
length of the strap 180. For example, the roller 222 may be biased to automatically lock onto
a strap 180 as the strap 180 is tightened. In such embodiments, the roller 222 may be
selectively releasable to disengage the strap 180, as described below.
[0050]            In one non-limiting example, illustrated in Fig. 7, the roller 222 may include
opposing end pins 230 arranged to be received within opposing slots 232 defined within the
second portion 212. The slots 232 may be elongated such that the roller 222 is permitted to
move axially along the length of the slots 232 to adjustably grip the strap 180. For example,
the roller 222 may move, such as automatically, to a first position (e.g., lowered downwards
toward the bottom of the buckle 190) to grip the strap 180 between the roller 222 and the first
member 192 (e.g., between the roller 222 and one of the opposing walls 196 of the first
member 192). To release the grip between the roller 222 and the first member 192, the roller
222 may be moved to a second position (e.g., lifted upwards toward the top of the buckle
190). In such embodiments, movement of the roller 222 relative to the first member 192 may
change the distance between the roller 222 and the first member 192. For instance,
movement of the roller 222 to the first position may decrease the distance between the roller
222 and the first member 192. In like manner, movement of the roller 222 to the second
position may increase the distance between the roller 222 and the first member 192. This
varying distance may be realized in a variety of ways. For example, in a preferred
embodiment, the converging nature of the opposing walls 196 may change the distance
between the roller 222 and the first member 192 as the roller 222 moves within the cavity
198. Additionally or alternatively, the structure of the second member 194 may define the
varying distance between the roller 222 and the first member 192, such as the slots 232
being angled towards one of the opposing walls 196, among others.
[0051]            The varying distance between the roller 222 and the first member 192 may be
configured to selectively bind the strap 180 within the buckle 190. For example, once the
roller 222 is positioned in its first position, the strap 180 may be compressed between the
roller 222 and the first member 192 to provide a sufficient degree of friction between the
buckle 190 and the strap 180. In such embodiments, continued movement of the strap 180 in
the second direction may increasingly compress the strap 180 between the roller 222 and the
first member 192, thereby locking the buckle 190 to the strap 180 when the internal divider
140 is pressed against the contents within the first storage volume 142. Once the roller 222
is positioned in its second position, compression of the strap 180 between the roller 222 and
9893278_1 (GHMatters) P107837.AU

                                                      14
the first member 192 is decreased (e.g., removed) such that the strap 180 may move freely
relative to the buckle 190.
[0052]            In some embodiments, the roller 222 may be biased to automatically seat in its first
position to automatically lock onto the strap 180. For instance, the roller 222 may be biased
towards its first position via gravity, a biasing element (e.g., a spring), and/or via movement
of the strap 180 itself through the buckle 190, as noted above. The automatic seating
characteristic of the roller 222 (and more generally the engagement member 220) to its first
position may allow the buckle 190 to automatically lock onto the strap 180 as the strap is
tightened to pull the internal divider 140 towards the opposing wall 144. In such
embodiments, the roller 222 may be selectively releasable from the strap 180. For example,
movement of the roller 222 to its second position may release the strap 180 to allow the strap
180 to move in an opposite direction within the buckle 190 and allow the internal divider 140
to be moved away from the opposing wall 144. The roller 222 may be moved to its second
position in various manners, such as via movement of the second member 194 relative to the
first member 192 of the buckle 190, as explained below.
[0053]            In another non-limiting example, illustrated in Figs. 8-10, the roller 222 may be a
hollow tube. In such embodiments, opposing bosses 240 may extend from the second
portion 212 and towards each other. The roller 222 may be rotatably coupled to the bosses
240 to permit substantially the same functionality of the embodiments described above with
reference to Fig. 7. For instance, the bosses 240 may be sized annularly smaller than the
internal bore of the roller 222 to permit the roller 222 to be moved to its first and second
positions, as described above.
[0054]            In some embodiments, the second member 194 of each buckle 190 may move
relative to the first member 192 to position the roller 222 in its first and second positions to
selectively bind or release the strap 180 within the buckle 190, respectively. For instance, the
second member 194 may be moved downwards, such as automatically as described above
or via manual manipulation by a user, to position the roller 222 lower within the cavity 198 of
the first member 192 (e.g., in its first position) (see Fig. 5). Similarly, the second member 194
may be moved upwards to position the roller 222 higher within the cavity 198 of the first
member 192 (e.g., in its second position) (see Fig. 4). To limit disassembly of the first and
second members 194, the second member 194 may be snap fitted to the first member 192.
For instance, as illustrated in Figs. 6 and 8, the second member 194 may include a resilient
tab 250 including a shelf 252 extending outwardly from the tab 250, the shelf 252 arranged to
9893278_1 (GHMatters) P107837.AU

                                                  15
engage a bottom surface of the first member 192 to limit movement of the second member
194 away from the first member 192.
[0055]            The second member 194 may include other features for convenience. For example,
the first portion 210 of the second member 194 may be a substantially planar element sized
larger than the opening to the cavity 198 within the second member 194. Such a
configuration may limit movement of the second member 194 towards the first member 192.
In some embodiments, a slot 260 may be defined within the first portion 210 (see Figs. 6 and
7). The slot 260 may be defined above the cavity 198 of the first member 192. In such
embodiments, the strap 180 may extend through the cavity 198 of the first member 192 and
through the slot 260 of the second member 194, such as in substantial alignment. In some
embodiments, a handle 262 may extend from the first portion 210 (e.g., from the top of the
first portion 210). In such embodiments, a user may grasp the handle 262 (either directly or
indirectly) to move the second member 194 relative to the first member 192 to selectively
release the strap 180 from the buckle 190, such as moving the second member 194 away
from the first member 192 to move the roller 222 to its second position, as described above.
In one embodiment, an end of the strap 180 may be coupled to the handle 262 to limit
removal of the strap 180 through the buckle 190. In some embodiments, a release strap 264
may be coupled to the handle 262 (see Figs. 4 and 5). In such embodiments, the release
strap 264 may be pulled to selectively release the strap 180 from the buckle 190, such as
moving the second member 194 away from the first member 192 to move the roller 222 to its
second position, as described above. In some embodiments, the strap 180 and the release
strap 264 may include indicia indicating to a user which strap to pull to either tighten or
loosen the internal divider 140.
[0056]            The luggage case 100 may include a plurality of corner members 270 arranged to
hold the peripheral frame 160 in place within the internal storage volume 102 of the luggage
case 100. In a preferred embodiment, the corner members 270 bias the internal divider 140
towards one of two directions (see Figs. 4 and 5). In one embodiment, the corner members
270, which may include a spring or other biasing component, may bias the internal divider
140 relative to the opposing wall 144 of the luggage case 100. For example, the corner
members 270 may bias the internal divider 140 towards or away from the opposing wall 144.
In some embodiments, the corner members 270 may bias the internal divider 140 towards
and/or away from the opposing wall 144 based on the distance of the internal divider 140
from the opposing wall 144. For example, the corner members 270 may bias the internal
9893278_1 (GHMatters) P107837.AU

                                                      16
divider 140 away from the opposing wall 144 when the internal divider 140 is positioned at or
above the point at which the corner members 270 are connected to the luggage case 100.
This may help to lift the internal divider 140 away from the opposing wall 144 for easy
packing of the first storage volume 142. In similar fashion, the corner members 270 may bias
the internal divider 140 towards the opposing wall 144 when the internal divider 140 is
positioned at or below the point at which the corner members 270 are connected to the
luggage case 100. This may help to position the internal divider 140 adjacent the opposing
wall 144 should the first storage volume 142 not be utilized or desired. Such a biasing
configuration may allow the internal divider 140 to "flip" from an upper protruding position
(see Fig. 3A) to a lower inverted position (see Fig. 2), or vice-versa.
[0057]            Though the corner members 270 preferably bias the internal divider 140 towards
and/or away from the opposing wall 144, the members 270 may be non-biasing in some
embodiments. In such embodiments, the corner members 270 simply hold the peripheral
frame 160 in place. In one embodiment, the corner members 270 may be semi-rigid strips or
flexible straps to locate and hold the peripheral frame 160 in place. In the embodiments
described herein, the corner members 270 may be located at the corners of the peripheral
frame 160. The corner members 270 may extend diagonally within the luggage case 100.
[0058]            The corner members 270 may be coupled to the internal divider 140 in numerous
manners. For example, and without limitation, the corner members 270 may be coupled to
the buckles 190, such as to the first member 192 of the buckles 190. Additionally or
alternatively, the corner members 270 may be coupled to the peripheral frame 160 of the
internal divider 140 (e.g., at the corners of the peripheral frame 160). In a preferred
embodiment, the luggage case 100 includes four corner members 270 positioned near the
corners of the internal divider 140 and towards the corners of the luggage case 100, though
other configurations are contemplated. As shown, the corner members 270 may be
concealed from view beneath the gusset 150.
[0059]            Operation of the internal divider 140 will now be discussed in detail. To pack the
first storage volume 142, the internal divider 140 may be moved away from the opposing wall
144, such as under the bias of the corner members 270, to increase the volume of the first
storage volume 142 (see Fig. 2). The selective opening 170 within the planar panel 162 of
the internal divider 140 may be opened to access the first storage volume 142 (see Fig. 3B).
A user may then pack the first storage volume 142 with a desired amount of belongings,
such as clothing. The opening 170 may then be selectively closed to define a contiguous
9893278_1 (GHMatters) P107837.AU

                                                     17
panel of the internal divider 140. The straps 180 may be moved relative to the buckles 190 in
the first direction to tighten the straps 180 by decreasing their effective lengths, thereby
pressing the internal divider 140 against the contents within the first storage volume 142. The
straps 180 may be tightened until the contents are compressed a desired amount by the
internal divider 140, such as a sufficient amount to limit shifting of the contents during
transport. The compressed contents may provide a counter force against the internal divider
140 tending to bias the internal divider 140 away from the opposing wall 144, which biases
each strap 180 to move in the second direction relative to the buckle 190. As described
above, biased movement of the straps 180 in the second direction relative to the buckles 190
effectively locks the straps 180 within the buckles 190, such as via the roller 222 of each
buckle 190 being positioned in its first position.
[0060]            Should a user desire to decrease the amount of compression on the contents (e.g.,
to unpack the first storage volume 142), the user may release the gripping engagement of
the buckles 190 on the straps 180. For example, the user may lift the second member 194 of
the buckle 190 relative to the first member 192 to position the roller 222 in its second
position, thereby releasing the friction engagement between the straps 180 and the buckles
190. The effective length of each strap 180 may then be increased to decrease the amount
of compression on the contents within the first storage volume 142. The opening 170 within
the internal divider 140 may be opened and the contents within the first storage volume 142
removed.
[0061]            The luggage case 100 may be formed from a variety of materials and means. For
example, the luggage case 100 may be formed from a thermoplastic material (self-reinforced
or fiber reinforced), ABS, polycarbonate, polypropylene, polystyrene, PVC, polyamide, and/or
PTFE, among others. In some embodiments, the peripheral frame 160 may be extruded from
aluminum or other similar metal. In addition, the peripheral frame 160 may be formed from
fiber reinforced epoxy, resin, or other similar material. The luggage case 100 may be formed
or molded in any suitable manner, such as by plug molding, blow molding, injection molding,
extrusion, casting, or the like. The luggage case 100 may be formed from soft side material
and/or hard side material. The soft side material may be nylon, canvas, polyester, leather,
PVC, polypropylene, polyethylene, and/or PTFE, among others. The hard side material may
be a thermoplastic material (self-reinforced or fiber reinforced), ABS, polycarbonate,
polypropylene, polystyrene, PVC, polyamide, and/or PTFE, among others.
