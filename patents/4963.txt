TECHNICAL FIELD
      The disclosure relates to the technical field of cosmetic containers, in particular to a novel cosmetic bag.
BACKGROUND ART
      Most of the current cosmetic bags are used in the form of a bag in which cosmetic accessories directly stored
and stacked together. Such a solution does not solve the problem of easy collision between cosmetics, and fails to
protect fragile and expensive cosmetics, so that such cosmetic bags are not only exposed to inadequate protection,
but also inconvenient to carry.
      Therefore, it is very important to redesign a cosmetic bag that is highly protected. portable, durable and easy
to clean. At the same time, it can also re-design the storage space according to individual needs, so that the local
spaces in the bag can be freely combined.

storage space can be freely combined and upper and lower parts are divided.
      To achieve the above purpose, the technical scheme of the disclosure is as follows:
      A novel cosmetic bag includes a upper cover and a cosmetic accessory bottom case, wherein a sewing chain
is provided on the respective edge of the upper cover and the cosmetic accessory bottom case; the sewing chains
are locked by the sewing zippers between them; the sewing zippers are respectively arranged on the left and right
sides of the connecting bar; the upper cover is connected to the cosmetic accessory bottom case through the
connecting bar; the upper cover is provided with a cosmetic brush area, which is provided with four brush bags;
the brush bags on the left and right sides are respectively provided with a brush bag specific velcro tape; the top
of the cosmetic brush area is provided with a protective cover covering the brush bag; the brush bag is separated
from the cosmetic accessory bottom case by the protective cover; a set of zippers is provided on the right side of
the cosmetic brush area; the internal bottom surface of the cosmetic accessory bottom case is provided with a
sponge layer: the inner side of the cosmetic accessory bottom case and the sponge layer are respectively provided
with a velcro tape; the velcro tape respectively corresponds to a bending patch at the outer corner of a thickened
inner sponge frame, and is bonded and fixed with the thickened inner sponge frame through the bending patch;
the thickened inner sponge frame divides the cosmetic accessory bottom case into four different areas.
      For a further description of the disclosure, the upper cover and the cosmetic accessory bottom case are made

                                                 DESCRIPTION
of oxford cloth or other similar materials.
      For a further description of the disclosure, the cosmetic brush area is divided by the set of zippers into
interlayers, which can be opened by pulling the set of zippers.
      For a further description of the disclosure, the protective cover is further provided with an adhesive patch
corresponding to the brush bag specific velcro tape.
      For a further description of the disclosure, the sponge layer is made of flame-retardant sponge.
      For a further description of the disclosure, the hardened sponge used in the thickened inner sponge frame is
medium in hardness.
      For a further description of the disclosure, the thickened inner sponge frame is composed of three sponge
frames spliced together, and each of which is provided with a bending patch that is allowed to be bonded to
another bending patch.
      For a further description of the disclosure, the thickened inner sponge frame can be combined into any area
shape, so that any bending patch can be freely bonded to any velcro tape to form various spatial shapes.
      For a further description of the disclosure, the cosmetic accessory bottom case is further provided with a
handle on the outside.
      Compared with the prior art, the disclosure has the following beneficial effects:
      (1) The spaces of areas can be freely combined through the securing method of velcro tape to ensure that a
variety of shapes and sizes of cosmetics and cosmetic accessories are applicable;
      (2)  The cosmetics and cosmetic accessories can be protected from the shocking, squeezing and pressing
caused by the external force through the securing method of the velcro tape with the thickened inner sponge
frame, in order to ensure the high safety of cosmetics and cosmetic accessories;
      (3) The problem of how to sort and classify cosmetics and cosmetic accessories properly can be solved
with the various shapes of areas divided at one's option
      (4)  Through the ultra-light design combination of velcro tape and the material of oxford cloth, the
problems of bulky cosmetic bag and lack of portability can be solved.
