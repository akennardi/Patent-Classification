ABSTRACT
A pipe working tool includes a generally cylindrical body, the body having a base and a
cylindrical wall that extends from a periphery of the base. A series of circumferentially
spaced bevelling formations are arranged on the wall and extend internally, with respect to
the wall, to engage an end of a pipe received in the body, the bevelling formations each
defining a cutting edge that tapers inwardly and distally with respect to the base so that the
end of the pipe is bevelled upon rotation of the body. A series of circumferentially spaced
squaring formations are arranged on the base, and extend internally, with respect to the
base, to engage an end of the pipe received in the body, the squaring formations each
defining a cutting edge that is substantially orthogonal to the cylindrical wall.

FIELD
[0001]        This invention relates to a pipe working tool. More particularly, this
invention relates to a pipe working tool for working a pipe end.
SUMMARY
[0002]        According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a pipe
working tool, which includes:
             a generally cylindrical body, the body having a base and a cylindrical wall
that extends from a periphery of the base;
             a series of circumferentially spaced bevelling formations arranged on the
wall, and extending internally, with respect to the wall, to engage an end of a pipe
received in the body, the bevelling formations each defining a cutting edge that
tapers inwardly and distally with respect to the base so that the end of the pipe is
bevelled upon rotation of the body; and
             a series of circumferentially spaced squaring formations arranged on the
base, and extending internally, with respect to the base, to engage an end of the pipe
received in the body, the squaring formations each defining a cutting-edge that is
substantially orthogonal to the cylindrical wall.
[0003]       The base may be substantially planar.
[0004]       The base and the cylindrical wall may be of metal. It is envisaged that the
base and the cylindrical wall may be of other materials, such as reinforced plastics
material, or a ceramic material.
[0005]       Each bevelling formation may include a slotted opening with a leading
edge that tapers inwardly from the base. A cutting member may extend inwardly from
a trailing edge of the opening and angularly with respect to a radial line from a centre
of the base to the trailing edge. The cutting edge may be defined on a longitudinal
free edge of the cutting member. The longitudinal free edge may be sharpened or
edged to define the cutting edge.
[0006]       A fixed longitudinal edge of the cutting member may be welded to the
longitudinal edge of the opening. Alternatively, the cutting member may be the
product of a process in which the wall is cut along a line that is angularly offset

                                             2
relative to an axis of rotation of the base and along a circumferential line so that the
cutting member may be bent inwardly and subsequently edged or sharpened.
[0007]        Instead of being edged or sharpened, a cutting tool can be secured to the
cutting member in a replaceable manner.
[0008]        Each squaring formation may include a rectangular opening that extends
radially inwardly from the wall. The rectangular opening may have an open side at a
periphery of the base so that the rectangular opening is in the form of a rectangular
slot. A cutting member may extend inwardly from a longitudinal edge of the opening
and angularly with respect to a radial plane of rotation of the tool.
[0009]        The cutting edge of the squaring formation may be defined on a
longitudinal free edge of the cutting member. The longitudinal free edge may be
sharpened or edged to define the cutting edge.
[0010]       A fixed longitudinal edge of the cutting member may be welded to the
longitudinal edge of the opening. Alternatively, the cutting member may be the
product of a process in which the base is cut along one radial line and a
circumferential line inward of the periphery of the base. The cutting member may be
bent inwardly and subsequently edged.
[0011]        Instead of being edged or sharpened, a cutting tool can be secured to the
cutting member in a replaceable manner.
[0012]        The pipe working tool may be detachably connected to a rotary drive. To
that end, an adapter mount may be positioned on the base to suit adapters for
different types of rotary drives, including direct or side rotary drives used for drills and
for angle grinders or side cutters, respectively. The adapter mount may include a
mount body that defines a threaded passage, centrally located through the base. A
threaded shaft of an adapter can be threaded into the threaded passage. The
adapter mount may also define locating formations to receive drive projections of the
adapter or of an angle wrench spanner.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0023]       In figures 1 to 6, reference numeral 10 generally indicates one
embodiment of a pipe working tool, in accordance with the invention.
[0024]       The pipe working tool 10 includes a generally cylindrical body 12. The
body 12 has a base 14 and a cylindrical wall 16 that extends from a periphery 18 of
the base 14.
[0025]       The base 14 is planar so that the cylindrical wall 16 extends generally
orthogonally from the base 14.
[0026]       The base 14 and the cylindrical wall 16 are of metal, such as steel. It is
envisaged that the base 14 and the cylindrical wall 16 can be of other material, such
as a reinforced plastics material. The base 14 and the cylindrical wall 16 can be of a
one-piece, unitary structure. Alternatively, the base 14 can be welded or otherwise
fixed to the cylindrical wall 16. Lugs 20 extend from a proximal end of the cylindrical
wall 16. The periphery 18 of the base 14 defines corresponding recesses 22 in which

                                             4
the lugs 20 are received. This serves to locate the base 14 relative to the wall 16
prior to welding or fastening.
[0027]       A series of circumferentially spaced bevelling formations 22 are arranged
on the wall 16 and extend internally, with respect to the wall 16, to engage an end of
a pipe received in the body. The bevelling formations 22 each define a cutting edge
24 that tapers inwardly and distally with respect to the base 14 so that the end of the
pipe is bevelled upon rotation of the body 12.
[0028]       Each bevelling formation 22 includes a slotted opening 25. The slotted
opening 25 has an open end at the base 14. The slotted opening 25 is further defined
by a leading edge 26, a trailing edge 28 and a distal edge 30 (figure 3). The leading
edge 26 tapers in a direction of rotation from the distal edge 30 to the base 14. The
trailing edge 28 is generally orthogonal to the distal edge 30 and the base 14.
[0029]       Each cutting formation 22 further includes a cutting member 32 that
extends from the trailing edge 30 in the direction of rotation of the tool 10, and
radially inwardly with respect to the wall 16. Each cutting member 32 is sharpened or
edged to define the cutting edge 24.
[0030]       The cutting member 32 can be welded or otherwise fixed to the trailing
edge 30. Alternatively, the cutting member 32 can be formed by cutting the wall 16 to
form the edges 26, 30 and then bending or partially folding a resultant member
radially inwardly to a predetermined extent to form the cutting member 32.
[0031]       A series of circumferentially spaced squaring formations 34 are arranged
on the base 14 and extend radially inwardly from the periphery 18 of the base 14 to
engage the end of the pipe received in the body 12. The squaring formations 34 each
define a cutting edge 36 that extends inwardly and is generally orthogonal to the wall
16.
[0032]       Each squaring formation 34 includes a rectangular slotted opening 38.
The slotted opening 38 has an open end at the periphery 18. The slotted opening 38
is further defined by a leading edge 40, a trailing edge 42 and an internal edge 43.
[0033]       The squaring formation 34 includes a cutting member 44 that extends
from the trailing edge 42, in the direction of rotation of the tool 10, and axially
inwardly with respect to the wall 16. Each cutting member 44 is sharpened or edged
to define the cutting edge 36.

                                             5
[0034]       The cutting member 44 can be welded or otherwise fixed to the trailing
edge 30. Alternatively, the cutting member 44 can be formed by cutting the base 14
to form the edges 40, 42 and then bending or partially folding a resultant member
longitudinally inwardly to a predetermined extent to form the cutting member 44.
[0035]       The body 12 is dimensioned so that an end of a pipe to be worked can be
received in the body 12 up to distal end of each cutting edge 24. Upon rotation of the
tool, the cutting edge 24 forms a chamfer or bevel as the tool 10 is urged onto the
pipe end. As the pipe end moves closer to the wall 16, the cutting edges 36 remove
material from the end of the pipe. Since the cutting edges 36 are oriented generally
orthogonally with respect to the wall 16, this serves to square off the end of the pipe.
Thus, the end of the pipe can be bevelled and squared in a single operation.
[0036]       An adapter mount 46 is arranged on the wall 16. The adapter mount 46
defines a threaded passage 48 that extends through the wall 16. A collar screw (not
shown) of a mandrel 51 can be threaded into the passage. A shaft 50 (figures 5 and
6) of an arbor 56 can be engaged with a direct rotary drive, such as that for a drill 47,
or a side rotary drive, such as that for an angle grinder 49, or the like, and can be
threaded into a collar 57 of the mandrel 51.
[0037]       The adapter mount 46 also defines locating openings or holes 54. These
are positioned on a proximal side to receive drive pins 55 of the mandrel 51 so that,
as a flange nut 59 of the collar 57 is tightened, the drive pins 55 can be driven into
the holes 54. On a distal side of the mount 46, the holes 54 are positioned to receive
drive projections of a spanner or wrench to fasten the tool 10 to the mandrel 51.
[0038]       Threaded components of other forms of adapter can also be received in
the passage 48. It follows that the tool 10 can be used with a variety of direct and
side rotary drive mechanisms.
[0039]       In figure 7, reference numeral 60 generally indicates another embodiment
of a pipe working tool. With reference to the preceding drawings, like reference
numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.
[0040]       The tool 60 does not include the squaring formations.
[0041]       In figure 8, reference numeral 70 generally indicates another embodiment
of a pipe working tool. With reference to the preceding drawings, like reference
numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.

                                              6
[0042]       In this embodiment, the cutting members 32, 44 are not sharpened.
Rather, blades or cutters 72 are detachably fastened to the members 32, 44. The
detachable fastening can be with fasteners 74 that can be loosened to remove the
cutters 72 or tightened to fasten the cutters 72 in place. The cutters 72 can be
fastened to each of the members 32, with each of the members 44 being sharpened,
or vice versa.
[0043]       In figures 9 and 10, reference numeral 80 generally indicates a further
embodiment of a pipe working tool. With reference to the preceding drawings, like
reference numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.
[0044]       The tool 10 includes four bevelling formations 22 and four squaring
formations 34. In contrast, the tool 80 includes six bevelling formations 22 and six
squaring formations 34. It is envisaged that more or fewer bevelling and squaring
formations can be provided.
[0045]       Furthermore, the body 12 of the tool 80 is of a unitary one-piece
construction.
[0046]       Still further, the base 14 includes peripheral, radially inwardly directed
recesses 82 that accommodate the cutting members 32.
[0047]       As described above, the tool 10, 80 can both bevel and square a pipe
end in a single operation. It will be appreciated this can save a significant amount of
time since it is not necessary to grind pipe joints prior to permit.
[0048]        Furthermore, the adapter mount 46 allows the tool 10, 80 to be used with
a variety of direct and side rotary drive mechanisms such as those used for drills and
for angle grinders or side cutters.
[0049]       The appended claims are to be considered as incorporated into the
above description.
[0050]       Throughout the specification, including the claims, where the context
permits, the term "comprising" and variants thereof such as "comprise" or
"comprises" are to be interpreted as including the stated integer or integers without
necessarily excluding any other integers.
[0051]       The word "proximal" is to be understood as that side or orientation that is
close to an operator when compared with a side or orientation described as "distal".

[0052]      It is to be understood that the terminology employed above is for the
purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The described
embodiments are intended to be illustrative of the invention, without limiting the
scope thereof. The invention is capable of being practised with various modifications
and additions as will readily occur to those skilled in the art.
[0053]      Words indicating direction or orientation, such as "front", "rear", "back",
etc, are used for convenience. The inventor(s) envisages that various embodiments
can be used in a non-operative configuration, such as when presented for sale. Thus,
such words are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.
