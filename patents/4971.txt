20 Description of an Embodiment of the                      Invention
   Referring to the drawings, there is                      shown a schematic
   block diagram of a gaming system 10 arranged to implement
   a probabilistic base game of the type wherein several
25 symbols              from a set of symbols are randomly displayed, and
   a game outcome is determined on the basis of the displayed
   symbols.                  With some    such probabilistic games, the set of
   symbols              include standard symbols         and function symbols,   and
   the       outcome of the base game is determined on the basis of
30 the       displayed standard symbols and the function associated
   with any displayed function symbol.                       For example,  standard
   symbols may resemble fruit                    such as   apples, pears and
   bananas with a win outcome being determined when a
   predetermined number of the                     same  fruit appear on a display
35 in the same line,                    scattered, and so on.    The  function
   associated with a function symbol may be                      for example a
   974U13_1 (GHMatters)P78383AU.3

                                                  -  8
   wild function wherein display of the                       function symbol  is
   treated during consideration of the game outcome as                        any of
   the       standard symbols.               A function symbol may be
   represented as the word "WILD", a star, or by any other
 5 suitable word or symbol.                      Other functions are also
   envisaged such as                   scatter functions, multiplier functions,
   repeat win                  functions, jackpot      functions and feature
   commencement functions.
10 In one embodiment of the present gaming system, operation
   is such that                   a feature game    is triggered when a defined
   trigger condition exists during implementation of a base
   game, which may be occurrence of a defined game outcome,
   occurrence of a game event during a game                       such as display
15 of a particular symbol,                    in  response to player input, based
   on the amount or type of bet                      placed, when a special   game
   is purchased by a player, or based on any other condition.
   During the                  feature game,   a game arrangement    is provided
   whereby a movable object is displayed on a display of the
20 gaming system and the outcome of the                       feature game is
   dependent on the position of the movable object.                        In order
   to facilitate movement of the object by a player,
   directional controls are provided by displaying
   directional control representations on the                       display and
25 incorporating a touch screen into the display.                        In this
   way, a player                   is able to control movement of the movable
   object relative to the                    screen and thereby influence     the
   outcome of the                   feature game.    One or multiple moves of the
   object may be allocated to the player depending on the
30 rules of the game.
   In another embodiment of the present gaming system,
   operation is such that as                     game play progresses a player is
   able to earn moves                   in a  feature game based on defined
35 criteria,                 for example when a defined game event       occurs
   during implementation of a base game, based on the amount
   974U13_1 (GHMatters)P78383AU.3

                                                - 9
   or type of bet placed, based on the total coin in amount,
   or based on any other defined criteria.                    With this
   embodiment, the gaming system may be arranged so as                    to
   enable a player to accumulate moves during play of a base
 5 game and to selectively or based on game rules                    enter the
   feature game to make one or more moves of the movable
   object.
   Referring to Figure                   1, a schematic diagram of core
10 components of a gaming system 10 is                   shown.  The core
   components comprise a player interface 30 and a game
   controller 32.                    The player interface 30 is arranged to
   enable interaction between a player and the gaming system
   and for this purpose includes input/output components
15 required for the player to enter instructions and play the
   game.
   Components of the player interface 30 may vary but                    will
   typically                 include a credit mechanism 34 to enable a player
20 to input               credits and receive payouts, one or more displays
   36,       at least             one of which comprises a touch screen, and a
   game play mechanism 38 arranged to enable a player to
   input game play instructions.
25 The game controller 32                   is in data communication with the
   player interface 30 and typically includes a processor 39
   arranged to process game play instructions and output game
   player outcomes to the display 36.                    Typically, the game
   play instructions are                   stored as program code in  a memory
30 42 that can also be hardwired.                    It will be understood that
   in this specification the term "processor" is used to
   refer generically to any device that can process game play
   instructions and may include a microprocessor,
   microcontroller, programmable logic device or other
35 computational device such as a personal computer or a
   server.

   A    functional diagram illustrating operative components of
   the       game controller 32              is shown in Figure 2.
 5 In this example, the memory                     42 is arranged to store
   symbols              data 14 for use in a game.         The memory 42 is also
   arranged to store game                    instruction data 18 indicative of
   game instructions usable by the gaming machine 10 to
   control operation of the game.
10
   The game controller 32                    includes a symbol  selector 20 which
   is arranged during implementation of a base game to select
   several              symbols       from the available symbols  14, in this
   example by                  spinning reels   containing the  symbols and
15 stopping the reels                    so as to display at  least one symbol on
   each reel.                     In this example, the  selection carried out by
   the       symbol            selector 20   is made using a random number
   generator 22.
20 It will be appreciated that the                     random number generator 22
   may be of a type which is arranged to generate pseudo
   random numbers based on a seed number, and that in this
   specification the term "random" will be understood
   accordingly to mean truly random or pseudo random.
25
   With this embodiment, the game controller 32 also
   comprises a trigger determiner 24 arranged to determine
   whether a trigger condition exists.                      Occurrence of a
   trigger condition may cause a feature game to commence
30 wherein a player is able to make one or more moves of an
   object.                A trigger condition may be occurrence of a game
   event          such as a defined game outcome, or may be detection
   of a defined input                    from a player.
35 In one embodiment, the game                     controller 32 also includes a
   move accumulator 25 arranged to maintain a running total
   974U13_1 (GHMatters)P78383AU.3

                                                - 11
   of moves available to a player, the move accumulator 25
   being responsive to one or more game events                    such that the
   move total increases when a defined game event occurs.
 5 The gaming system includes a feature implementer 26
   arranged to implement a                   feature game when a trigger
   condition exists, and a touch screen 27 usable to receive
   move instructions from a player during a feature game.
10 The game controller 32 also                    comprises an outcome evaluator
   28 which               in accordance with the game instructions      18
   determines game outcomes during a base game based on the
   symbols              selected for display to the player by the symbol
   selector 20,                   and during a feature game based on the
15 position of a movable object.
   In the embodiments described below, the symbol selector
   20,       the trigger determiner 24, the move accumulator 25,
   the       feature implementer 26 and the outcome evaluator 28
20 are at least partly implemented using the processor 39 and
   associated software, although it will be understood that
   other implementations are                   envisaged.
   The gaming system 10 can take a number of different                     forms.
25
   In a first                  form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most                   components required for implementing
   the       game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
30 In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the       game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are               located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
35 For example, a "thick client"                    architecture may be used
   wherein part                   of the game is executed on a player operable
   974U13_1 (GHMatters)P78383AU.3

                                                -   12
   gaming machine and part of the game                     is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server;                     or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most                     of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
 5 operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs                   from the player.
   However,              it will be understood that other arrangements are
10 envisaged.                    For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective                   functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are                   selectively modifiable.    For example,
   the       gaming system may operate in               stand alone gaming
15 machine mode,                   "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
20 A gaming system in the                   form of a   stand alone gaming
   machine 40 is                   illustrated in Figure 3.   The gaming machine
   40 includes a console 42 having a primary display 44 on
   which is displayed representations of a game                     46 that  can

   The or each display 44,                  58 may be in the    form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.                Alternatively, the or each display 44,       58 may be
10 a liquid crystal display, plasma                     screen, or any other
   suitable video display unit.                      In the present embodiment
   wherein the secondary display is used to implement                      a
   feature game, the                  secondary display 58 comprises a touch
   screen usable by a player to control movement of an object
15 during feature game play.                     In an alternative embodiment
   wherein the primary display is used to implement a                      feature
   game, the primary display 44 comprises                     a touch screen.
   The primary display 44 in this example is arranged to
20 display representations of several reels, each reel                       of
   which has                 several associated symbols.      Typically 3,   4 or 5
   reels are provided.                   During operation of a base    game, the
   reels          first appear to rotate then stop with typically
   three          symbols visible on each reel.             Base game outcomes
25 are determined on the basis of the visible symbols
   together with any                  special functions associated with the
   symbols.
   A player marketing module                   (PMM) 62 having a display 64     is
30 also provided.                   The PMM 62 allows the player to interact
   with a player                  loyalty system.     The PMM has a magnetic card
   reader for the purpose of reading a player tracking
   device, for example as part of a loyalty program.                       However
   other reading devices may be employed and the player
35 tracking device may be in the form of a card, flash drive
   or any other portable storage medium capable of being read
   974U13_1 (GHMatters)P78383AU.3

                                                 - 14
   by the reading device.                     In this example, the PMM 62   is a
   Sentinel III                   device produced by Aristocrat Technologies
   Pty Ltd.
 5 In one embodiment, the PMM 62 includes a touch screen and
   the       display 64 of the PMM 62               is used to display the
   feature game including directional                     controls used by a
   player to control movement of an object during the                      feature
   game.            Alternatively, the feature game may be displayed on
10 the primary display 44 or the secondary display 58,                      and
   the PMM 62 may include a touch screen with the display 64
   of the PMM 62 used to display directional controls used by
   a player to control movement of an object during the
   feature game.

   The PMM 62 may be arranged to communicate with a remote
   server such that the status of the feature game including
   the number of available moves remaining, and the position
   of each object in the feature game are stored at the
20 remote server and are                    retrievable by a PMM  62 associated
   with any gaming machine.                     In this way,  a player is able to
   commence play of a feature game at                     a gaming machine and
   subsequently resume                   feature game play at the same gaming
   machine or a different gaming machine.

   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a gaming machine 100 which may be the same                     as or different
   to the gaming machine shown in Figure 3.
30 The gaming machine                   100  includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.                     Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102                     in accordance with the
   present invention are                    stored in a memory  103 which is in
   data communication with the processor 102.

   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
 5 Figure 5 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory                  103.  The memory  103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass                   storage device 103C.   The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                     The
10 EPROM         103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some        system or game related code.             The mass storage device
   103C        is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
15 or elsewhere.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104                   for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit,                  an input/output  (I/O) interface 105   for
20 communicating with a player                   interface 120 of the gaming
   machine 100,                  the player interface 120  having several
   peripheral                 devices.   The input/output interface   105  and/or
   the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for storing associated instructions and
25 data for use with the input/output interface or the
   peripheral                 devices.   A random number generator module     113
   generates                random numbers for use by the processor 102.
   In the example                  shown in Figure 4,  the peripheral devices
30 that        communicate with the game controller 101 comprise one
   or more displays 106, a touch screen and bank of buttons
   107,        a card and/or ticket reader 108,            a printer 109,   a
   bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a coin

   In addition, the gaming machine                     100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
 5 information, accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.
10 It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine                  100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 may be
   provided remotely from the game                     controller 101.
15 Figure            6 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.                   The gaming system 200     includes a
   network 201, which                  for example may be an Ethernet network,
   a LAN or a WAN.                   In this example, two banks    203 of two
   gaming machines 202                  are connected to the network 201.      The
20 gaming machines 202                  provide a player operable interface
   and may be the                  same as the gaming machines 40,100     shown in
   Figures              3 and 4,     or may have simplified functionality
   depending on the requirements for implementing game play.
   While banks 203 of two gaming machines are illustrated in
25 Figure            6, banks of one,       three or more gaming machines are
   also envisaged.
   One       or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.                   The displays   204 may, for example, be
30 associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.

   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202       and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game                    server 205
   and the gaming machine                  202   implement part of the game,
 5 they        collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management                  server 206 may manage   storage of game programs
   and associated data                  for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202                  in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in                    a Jackpot
10 game, a Jackpot server                  207 will be provided to monitor and
   carry out the                  Jackpot game.
   In a variation of the above thick client embodiment, the
   gaming machine 202                  may implement the game, with the    game
15 server 205                  functioning merely to   serve data indicative of
   a game to the gaming machine 202                    for implementation.
   With this                 implementation, a data    signal containing a
   computer program usable by the client terminal to
20 implement the gaming system may be transferred from the
   game server to the                  client terminal,   for example in
   response to a request by the client terminal.
   In a thin client embodiment, the game server 205
25 implements most or all of the game played by a player
   using a gaming machine                  202 and the gaming machine 202
   essentially provides only the player interface.                      With this
   embodiment, the game server                    205 provides the game
   controller. The gaming machine will                    receive player
30 instructions, and pass the                    instructions to the game server
   which will process them and return game play outcomes to
   the       gaming machine            for display.    In a thin client
   embodiment, the gaming machines could be computer
   terminals,                  e.g. PCs running software that provides a
35 player interface operable using standard computer input
   and output components.

   relating to particular games.                      An administrator terminal
   210       is provided to allow an administrator to monitor the
   network 201 and the devices                    connected to the network.
10 The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local                  networks such as a corporate network,
   and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,                     for
   example through a firewall 211.
15 The gaming system 200 also                    comprises a loyalty program
   server 212                  and a feature database 214.     The loyalty
   program server 212                  is arranged to communicate with the
   player marketing modules                   (PMM) 62 of gaming machines 202
   associated with the gaming system 200                     so as to track
20 player behaviour and, in one embodiment,                     so as to store
   feature game data including data indicative of the type of
   feature game to be                  implemented at    a gaming machine, and
   the       game state of the feature game so that the feature
   game may be continued on a different gaming machine.                        In
25 this example,                  for this purpose, the    feature database 214
   includes a plurality of feature game records 216,                     each
   feature game record 216 being associated with a player and
   being arranged to store                  feature game data associated with
   the player.

   The gaming system is arranged to implement one or more
   feature games.                 A feature game may commence automatically
   on the basis of occurrence of a trigger condition, such as
   a game event occurring during a base game, or in response
15 to player input.
   A specific example will now be described in relation to
   flow diagram 250 shown in Figure 7 which illustrates steps
   252 to 264 of a method of gaming implemented by a gaming
20 system.                In this example, the gaming machine is a stand
   alone gaming machine 40.
   In this example, five virtual reels are provided and, as
   such, representations of the reels are displayed on a
25 graphical display device 44 of a gaming machine 40.                 The
   gaming machine 40 in this example includes a secondary
   display 58 and a touch screen associated with the
   secondary display 58.
30 In this example, the gaming system is arranged to commence
   a feature game 258 when a trigger condition exists in the
   form of appearance of a particular symbol combination such
   as a defined number of scattered symbols.                  When a trigger
   condition occurs 256 after a reel spin 254,                 directional
35 controls are shown on the secondary display 58 which are
   used to control movement of an object in the feature game,
   974U13_1 (GHMatters)P78383AU.3

                                              - 20
   as shown in Figure 8.                  In this example, the directional
   controls 270 appear as arrows                  distributed adjacent edges
   of the secondary display 58.                   As an alternative, the
   directional controls may take the form of a cross 272 as
 5 shown in Figure                9,  respective legs 274 of which are used
   to control movement of an object.                   The number of moves
   available to a player may be predefined, may be randomly
   selected, or may accumulate based on game events occurring
   during base game play.
10
   The feature game may be of any type wherein the                  game
   outcome is dependent on the position of a movable object,
   for example a strategy type game                  such as chess, a search
   game of the type such as                 a treasure hunt wherein with each
15 move a player moves a character to a location on a map
   which potentially contains a prize, a sport type game                   such
   as soccer wherein with each move a player controls the
   direction of a goalkeeper or the                  shot direction of a
   soccer character, or any other game wherein movement of an
20 object by a player                 influences the outcome of the game.
   After each movement of the movable object, after all
   available moves have been made, or after the feature game
   reaches a state of completion, the gaming system
25 determines an outcome of the feature game 260                  and a prize
   is paid if applicable 264.
   A    further specific example will now be described in
   relation to flow diagram 300                  shown in Figure 10 which
30 illustrates steps                 302 to 322  of a method of gaming
   implemented by a gaming system.                   In this example, the
   gaming machine is a networked gaming machine 202 of the
   type        shown in Figure 6.
35 In this example, five virtual reels are provided and, as
   such, representations of the reels                  are displayed on a
   974U13_1 (GHMatters)P78383AU.3

                                                 - 21
   graphical display device 44 of a gaming machine 202.                       The
   gaming machine 202                    in this example includes a PMM display
   64      and a touch               screen associated with the PMM display 64.
 5 In this example, the gaming system is arranged to commence
   a feature game 314                    when a trigger condition exists in the
   form of a player input                    indicative that the player wishes
   to commence the feature game.                      When the trigger condition
   occurs 310,                    directional controls are  shown on the PMM
10 display 64                  which are used to control movement of an object
   in the feature game.                     In this embodiment, the number of
   moves available to a player accumulate based on game
   outcomes occurring during base game play, and the feature
   game may be caused to commence by a player at any time.
15
   The feature game in this example is a chess                      game 330 as
   shown in Figure 11.                     The chess game  330 may be displayed
   on the PMM 64 together with the directional                      controls as
   shown in Figure 11,                    or the  chess game may be displayed on
20 the primary or secondary display with the directional
   controls shown on the PTM display 64.
   With each available move, a player may make any valid move
   of the player's chess pieces according to the rules                      of
25 chess, after which the gaming machine 202                      will
   automatically move one of the machine's                      chess pieces.
   After completion                    of the chess  game, the gaming system
   determines whether the player has won the chess                      game or
   whether other feature game                     conditions correspond to a
30 winning outcome and a prize is paid if appropriate.
   In this example, the gaming machine 202 is in networked
   communication with the                    loyalty program server 212 which is
   arranged to store details                     of the current  feature game in  a
35 feature game record 216                    such as the  current state of the
   feature game including in this example the                      current
   974U13_1 (GHMatters)P78383AU.3

                                 - 22
   position of the chess pieces.      After each move has been
   made by a player, the feature game record 116 is updated.
   When a player wishes to recommence the feature game,
   either from the same gaming machine or from a different
 5 gaming machine, the gaming machine 202 communicates with
   the loyalty program server and retrieves the required data
   from the relevant feature game record 116 in order that
   the feature game may be recommenced.
10 It will be understood that, in this way, a player is able
   to earn moves for a feature game during normal base game
   play, and to make moves for the feature game from any
   gaming machine associated with the gaming system.
15 Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a
   skilled addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the
   present invention.
