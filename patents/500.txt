                                      ROTATIONAL DRIVER
   FIELD
   The invention relates to rotational drive tools and to attachments therefor.
   BACKGROUND
 5 Rotational drive tools of the type illustrated in Figure 1 are often referred to as
   'nutrunners',' torque wrenches' or 'torque guns', etc. Such tools are used in industry for
   tightening nuts and bolts and other similar tasks.
   The tool 1 includes a handle 3 integrally moulded with a housing 5 housing a motor. A
   gearbox 7 is at least axially fixed to the front of the housing 5. An externally-splined
10 tubular boss 9 forwardly projects from the gearbox 7 and a square-profiled drive member
   11 projects forwardly from the boss 9. The axially-splined exterior of the boss 9 is fixed
   relative to the exterior of the gearbox 7 and the housing 5 and is often referred to as a
   serpentine.
   A wide variety of attachments have been developed for this style of rotational driver,
15 such as the reaction arm 13. The reaction arm 13 includes a portion 15 shaped to
   embrace and engage the serpentine of the boss 9 so that the reaction arm is restrained
   from rotation about the axis of the gearbox 7. Reaction arms are often axially restrained
   relative to the gearbox 7 via a grub screw passing axially through the serpentine
   embracing portion 15 of the arm.
20 Figure 3 shows the use of such a tool to tighten a nut. For this purpose, the reaction arm
   13 and a socket 15 are fitted to the tool 1. The socket 15 includes a rearwardly-open
   square-profiled bore dimensioned to receive and be driven by the member 11, and also
   a forwardly-open hexagonal-profiled bore to receive and rotationally drive a nut. The
   assembled tool, attachment and socket set 1, 13, 15 is engaged with a nut to be

   P1292AU1I
                                                    2
   tightened so that the arm 13 engages a feature fixed relative to the axis of the nut to be
   tightened, so that the body of the gearbox does not rotate when torque is applied to the
   nut. In the example of Figure 3, the arm 13 engages an adjacent nut N.
   A trigger 17 of the tool 1 is squeezable to actuate the motor to produce a rotational
 5 drive. The motor may be, for example, a mains-electric motor, a battery-electric motor, a
   hydraulic motor or a pneumatic motor. The gearbox receives the rotational drive from the
   motor and in turn rotationally drives the socket 15 via the member 11. The socket 15 in
   turn drives the nut.
   In some applications, it is not possible or convenient to move the tool 1 into close
10 proximity to a nut that is to be tightened. For this purpose, a variety of extension pieces
   have been developed. Figure 1 illustrates an extension piece 19 including a reaction
   arm welded to an outer body of the extension piece. The outer body of the extension
   piece fits over the forward end of the tool and mates with the serpentine of the boss 9.
   An inner body of the extension piece is journalled to rotate within the outer body to
15 transmit shaft power from the member 11 to a similar drive-transmitting member 11' at
   the forward end of the extension 19.
   Figure 6 illustrates another extension piece 21, the outer body of which has a serpentine
   at its forward end, to which a reaction arm 13' is mounted. A socket 15' is also attached
   at the forward end of the extension 21. In other applications, it is not possible or
20 convenient to coaxially align tool 1 and a nut that is to be tightened. For this purpose,
   various offset tools, similar to the offset tool 23 of Figure 7, have been developed. Figure
   7 shows a gearbox 25 coupled with the offset tool 23. The offset tool 23 serves to
   laterally transmit rotational drive from the gearbox 25 to a hex socket 27. The axis of hex
   socket 27 is laterally displaced from the axis of the gearbox.
25 Extension pieces and offset tools and other attachments have conventionally been
   attached with the aid of a radially-oriented grub screw engaging the serpentine of the
   tool 1 as described in respect of the reaction arm 13. The present inventor has

   P1292AU1I
                                                  3
   recognised that this long-accepted mode of engagement is less than entirely reliable.
   From time to time, various attachments have fallen off tools. This can be very
   dangerous. Attachments such as extension pieces 19, 21 are heavy. A falling extension
   piece could injure the worker operating the tool or, worse still, potentially fatally injure a
 5 worker at a lower level of a construction site. In other instances, reaction arms have
   axially slipped the serpentine during operation. This slippage, in the context of tools
   having a gearbox housing fully fixed relative to the handle, suddenly and without
   warning exposes the operator to the torque of the tool. This can result in strain and
   crushing injuries.
10 In various applications, it is important to know the torque applied to a driven element
   such as a nut. For this purpose, rotational drive tools typically incorporate some means
   by which the applied torque is controlled. This may entail sensors arranged to sense the
   torque transmitted via the member 11, or to sense feedback from the motor unit. The
   present inventor has also recognised that the conventional mode of attaching a reaction
15 arm typically involves some degree of play between the arm and the tool, that this play
   can lead to misalignment between the axis of the tool and the nut (or other driven
   member), and that this misalignment can result in the tool applying about 15% less than
   the desired torque to the nut.
   Instead of the grub screw, some rotational drivers incorporate circlips sitting in front of
20 the serpentine. Circlips are considered fiddly and inconvenient, and relative to the use of
   grub screws offer no improvement in terms of alignment. Attaching a circlips in this way
   also offers a less than entirely reliable means of attachment. It is easy to inadvertently
   misalign a circlip so that it does not seat within its groove properly. Moreover, the
   inventor has observed that the mentioned misalignment can cause even a correctly
25 installed circlip to conically deform and forwardly escape its groove. Of course, such
   circlip arrangements are incompatible with many attachments such as the extensions
   19, 21.

   It is not admitted that any of the information in this patent specification is common
   general knowledge, or that the person skilled in the art could be reasonably expected to
   ascertain or understand it, regard it as relevant or combine it in any way before the
   priority date.

   DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
   The following examples are intended to illustrate the scope of the invention and to
   enable reproduction and comparison. They are not intended to limit the scope of the
10 disclosure in any way.
   Figure 8 shows a set 29 including a tool 31 and an attachment 33 in the form of a
   reaction arm. The tool 31 includes a handle 35. Optionally, as illustrated, the handle is
   integrally formed with a housing 37 in which a motor is housed. The gearbox 25 is
   mounted to the front of the housing 37 to receive rotational drive from the motor. A
15 square-profiled member 39 projects from the forward end of the gearbox 25 to
   rotationally drive an element such as the socket 15.
   The gearbox 25 includes a housing 41 which presents a cylindrical exterior. The housing
   41 is at least axially fixed relative to the housing 37. A tubular boss 43 projects forwardly
   from the forward end of the housing 41. An exterior of the boss 43 defines a serpentine.
20 The housing 41 houses an arrangement of gears which transmit drive from the motor to
   the member 39. The gears define a reduction ratio whereby the member 39 operates at
   a lower speed but higher torque than the motor produces. The arrangement of gears is
   omitted from Figure 10 for clarity.

   P1292AU1I
                                                    8
   A square-profiled rib 44 concentrically encircles a forward end of the housing 41's
   cylindrical exterior. The rib 44 serves two purposes. Firstly, it radially reinforces the
   housing 41 to resist deformation resultant from the action of the internally-carried gear
   mechanism. Secondly, the rib 44 defines a rearward-facing annular surface 45 which
 5 provides an anchor point against which the attachment 33 can be rearwardly drawn to
   more securely and accurately align the attachment 33 relative to the tool 31. In this
   example, the rib 44 is integral to the housing 44, although optionally the rib (or another
   anchor arrangement) could be one or more attached pieces.
   A collar 47 is fitted to the gearbox. The collar 47 includes a cylindrical wall dimensioned
10 to slide over the cylindrical exterior of the rib 44. The rear end of the collar 47 includes a
   short, inwardly-projecting flange dimensioned so that it cannot pass over the rib 44 to
   limit forward movement of the collar 47. The front of the collar 47 sits forward of the rib
   44 and is internally threaded.
   The attachment 33 includes a serpentine-engaging portion 51 shaped to encircle and
15 engage the serpentine of the boss 43. An externally-threaded ring 53 projects
   rearwardly from the serpentine-engaging portion 51. To fit the attachment 33 to the tool
   31, the portion 51 is placed over member 39 and boss 43 so that the portion 51 engages
   the boss 43 to rotationally fix the attachment 33 relative to the housing 41 and to the tool
   31 more generally. With further rearward movement of the attachment 33, and
20 potentially also forward movement of the collar 47, the threads of the portion 51 are
   moved into engagement with the threads of the collar 47. The collar 47 may then be
   rotated about the axis of the tool 31 (i.e. relative to the rotationally-fixed ring 53) to
   tighten that engagement.
   With ongoing tightening of the collar 47, the attachment 33 is rearwardly urged until a
25 rearward face 55 of the portion 51 is brought into engagement with a forward-facing
   portion 57 of the tool. In this example, the forward-facing portion 57 is a planar face, at
   the front of the gearbox, encircling the formation 53. For the avoidance of doubt, the

   P1292AU1I
                                                  9
   arrows F and R in Figure 10 illustrate the forward and rearward directions respectively
   as those terms, and similar terms, are used herein.
   The collar 47 thus constitutes an arrangement for rearwardly urging the attachment 33
   so that the face 55 is clamped against the face 57.
 5 The mutual engagement of the faces 55, 57 provides for a more accurate alignment
   between the axes of the attachment 33 and the tool 31, which in turn leads to torque
   being more accurately applied. Whilst the contacting surfaces 55, 57 are simple planar
   surfaces in this example, other attachment-aligning contact configurations are possible.
   In this example, the collar 47 is an integrally-formed metallic component and a resilient
10 element, in the form of O-ring 59, is captured between the flange 49 and the rib 44. The
   O-ring 59 provides a degree of resilience whereby the collar 47 can be conveniently
   hand tightened, yet the attachment 33 remains securely and reliably retained. Other
   forms of resilient element may be incorporated within the clamping arrangement and yet
   other clamping arrangements may have no resilient element at all.
15 In operation, the flange 49 engages the rearward-facing portion 59a of the O-ring 59 and
   the collar 47 engages the ring 53. The collar acts between that rearward-facing portion
   59a and the ring 53 to rearwardly urge the attachment 33 to clamp the portions 55, 57
   against each other. The O-ring 59 is axially supported by the rib 44 in this example.
   Other forms of axial support are possible.
20 The collar 47 is at the rear of the attachment 33. By locating the collar in this region, the
   described means of attachment is compatible with a wide range of attachments
   including attachments similar to attachments 19, 21 and 23. Moreover, the threaded
   engagement provides for a simple yet secure and reliable means of attachment. In
   particular, the collar 47 provides for convenient tool-less operation.
25 The rib 44 serves to prevent the collar 47 from being forwardly released from the
   cylindrical exterior of the gearbox 25. The housing 37 likewise projects outwardly

   P1292AU1I
                                                 10
   beyond the cylindrical exterior of the gearbox 25 whereby the collar 47 is captured on
   the gearbox.
   It will be appreciated that the described arrangement is a very significant advance over
   the described prior art arrangements. Many variations over the example of Figures 8 to
 5 10 are possible and would be advantageous over the described prior art. The invention
   is not limited to this described example. Rather, it is defined by the claims.
   The threading engagement between the tool 1 and the attachment 33 offers advantages
   in and of itself. Indeed, simply extending the rib 44 so that a screw may be passed
   axially therethrough to engage a suitable threaded bore within the attachment 33 would
10 be an advance over the prior art arrangements.
   On the other hand, other advantageous variants do without threaded portions. By way of
   example, the collar 47 might be replaced by a lever lock ring to engage the rib 44 and a
   complementary rib formed at the rear of the attachment 33 so as to mutually clamp
   those ribs in a manner akin to the closures often applied to large paint cans.
15 The tool 31 carries the collar 47, although it is also possible that the collar might be
   carried by the attachment 33.
   The portion 59a is rearward of the serpentine-defining boss 43, although potentially the
   rib 44 could be moved forward to sit on an annular extension of the cylindrical wall of the
   housing 41. This might entail the tool 33 being formed with a tubular boss shaped to fit
20 within this wall and to engage the serpentine.
   Likewise, it would of course be trite to swap the male and female threads between the
   collar 47 and the ring 53. This might entail enlarging the ring 33 to sit over the collar.
   Whilst the reaction torque-transmitting feature takes the form of the serpentine about the
   exterior of the boss 43, other formations are possible. By way of example, this formation
25 might take the form of a square-profiled bore into which a square-profiled tubular boss of

   P1292AU1I
                                                 11
   the attachment is receivable. Likewise, the member 39 may itself be a socket for
   rotationally driving an element.
   Not all variants of the device entail a gearbox. For example, a suitable motor might be
   mounted inside the housing 41 and directly drive the member 39.
 5 In this example, the portion 59a is part of the toroidal exterior of the O-ring. Other forms
   of rearward-facing portion are possible, e.g. the rearward-facing portion might be a
   portion of a helical face within a thread.
   An outwardly-opening circlip groove 61 encircles a forward end of the boss 41 whereby
   the tool 31 is compatible with attachments designed for this mode of attachment, e.g.
10 attachments which do not include the ring 53. Likewise, it remains possible to attach
   attachments with the aid of a grub screw passing at least approximately radially through
   the serpentine-engaging portion 51 of the attachment.
