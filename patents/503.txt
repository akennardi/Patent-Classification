SUBSTITUTED N-(1H-INDAZOL-4-YL)IMIDAZO[1,2-a]PYRIDINE-3-CARBOXAMIDE
        COMPOUNDS AS TYPE III RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITORS
[0001]          The present invention relates to novel compounds, to pharmaceutical
compositions comprising the compounds, to processes for making the compounds, and to the
use of the compounds in therapy. More particularly, it relates to certain substituted N-(1H
indazol-4-yl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide compounds which are inhibitors of type
III receptor tyrosine kinases such as PDGFR and/or cFMS and/or cKIT, which are useful in
the treatment of fibrosis, bone-related diseases, cancer, autoimmune disorders, inflammatory
diseases, cardiovascular diseases, pain and bums.
[0002]          PDGFR is expressed on early stem cells, mast cells, myeloid cells,
mesenchymal cells, and smooth muscles cells. PDGFR-            has been implicated in myeloid
leukemias. Recently, it was shown that activating mutations in PDGFR-a kinase domain are
present in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) (Wong et al., 2007, Histopathology 51(6):
758-762).
[0003]          PDGFR has been shown to be a potent mitogen for myofibroblast formation, a
signature of fibrotic conditions and implicated in the progression of fibrosis (Bonner, J. et al.,
1998, American Journal Physiology 274 (1Pt1): L72-L80).
[0004]          In addition, blockade of PDGF signaling has been demonstrated to reduce the
development of fibrosis in various experimental models (Yoshiji, et al., 2006, Int. J. Mol.
Med. 17:899-904).       Imatinib, for example, a known inhibitor of PDGF signaling, has
demonstrated anti-fibrotic activity in several animal models of fibrosis (Akhmetshina, A., et
al., 2009, Arthritis Rheumatism 60(1): 219-224; Vuorinen, K., et al., 2007, Experimental
Lung Research 33(7): 357-373; Aono, Y., et al., 2005, American Journal Respiratory Critical
Care Medicine 171(11): 1279-1285). There are multiple case reports of patients with fibrotic
conditions benefiting from treatment with Imatinib           (Kay, J., et al., 2008, Arthritis
Rheumatism 58(8): 2543-2548; Distler J., et al., 2008, Arthritis Rheumatism 58(8): 2538
2542; Hirose, Y., et al., 2002 International Journal Hematology 76(4): 349-353).       Imatinib
recently completed a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study in patients with
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
[00051          Macrophage     colony-stimulating   factor-i  receptor (CSF-1R),    a tyrosine
receptor kinase also known as cFMS, is the receptor for colony stimulating factor-i (CSF-1),
also known as M-CSF.         CSF-1 is an important growth factor for bone progenitor cells,
monocytes, macrophages, and cells of macrophage lineage such as osteoclasts and dendritic

    WO 2012/082689                                                         PCT/US2011/064549
                                                2
cells. Binding of CSF-1 to the cFMS extracellular domain induces cFMS dimerization and
trans-autophosphorylation of the intracellular cFMS kinase domain. Once phosphorylated,
cFMS serves as a docking site for several cytoplasmic signaling molecules, the activation of
which leads to de novo gene expression and proliferation. Robust expression of cFMS is
restricted to monocytes, tissue macrophages, and osteoclasts, and therefore cFMS inhibitors
may be useful in treating diseases where osteoclasts, dendritic cells and macrophages are
pathogenic, such as autoimmune/inflammatory diseases, cancer and bone-related diseases.
[0006]          Bone is a dynamic tissue, subject to a constant remodeling process that
operates to maintain skeletal strength and health. This remodeling process entails two phases:
an osteolysis phase and an osteogenesis phase. In osteolysis, osteoclast cells invade bone and
erode it by releasing acids and enzymes that dissolve collagen and minerals. This creates a
small cavity in the bone. In osteogenesis, osteoblast cells deposit new collagen and minerals
into the cavity. When osteolysis and osteogenesis are in balance, no net change in bone mass
results.   However, in certain disease states, osteolysis is more active than osteogenesis,
resulting in a net loss of bone.
[00071          One particularly serious cause of localized excessive osteolysis is cancer
metastasis to bone. Cancer cells often secrete factors, such as M-CSF, that promote osteoclast
development and activity. When such cancers establish themselves in bone, they promote
extensive osteolytic damage and can result in, for example, bone fracture and spinal
compression. Such tumor-associated osteolysis coincides with many types of malignancies,
including hematological malignancies (e.g., myeloma and lymphoma) and solid tumors (e.g.,
breast, prostate, lung, renal and thyroid). Accordingly, there remains a need for therapies that
reduce or delay complications which arise from the spread of cancer to the bone.
[0008]          When excessive osteolysis occurs throughout broad areas of the skeleton, it
falls under the generic description osteoporosis. Common types of osteoporosis include age
related, post-menopausal, treatment-induced bone loss (e.g., as a result of treatment with
glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, or anti-androgen therapy), diabetes-associated and
disuse osteoporosis. In the United States alone, millions of individuals suffer from the disease
and its attendant pain, deformities and debilitating fractures.
[0009]          Osteoclasts   are multinucleated    cells that are derived     from monocytic
precursors and operate under the control of numerous cytokines and growth factors.
Differentiation of the monocytic precursors into osteoclasts is a complex process that requires
both M-CSF and RANKL (receptor activator of the NF-kappa B ligand).                   Inhibiting

    WO 2012/082689                                                        PCT/US2011/064549
                                                3
osteoclast development and function is a desirable approach to treating excessive osteolysis.
However, the currently available substances that do so have limited utility, and often cause
significant side effects. Thus, a continuing need exists for effective and practical treatments
for excessive osteolytic conditions.
[0010]          Macrophages, which are related to osteoclasts, play an important role in
inflammatory disease, cancer and bone disorders.        For example, macrophages, which are
related to osteoclasts, are a major component of the host cellular response to cancers, and can
contribute to tumor growth. In particular, macrophages, as well as tumor cells, secrete M
CSF,     a key cytokine for development of osteoclasts from monocyte precursors.
Macrophages, as well as monocytes and some tumor cells, also express M-CSF receptors.
[0011]          Solid tumors comprise a number of cell types, including macrophages. These
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are believed to play a number of roles to promote
tumor progression and metastasis (Pollard, J.W., Nat. Rev. Cancer, 2004, 4:71; Lewis, C.E.
and Pollard, J.W., Cancer Res., 2006, 66:605). Upon recruitment to the tumor environment,
macrophages release factors involved in the growth and motility of tumor cells.
Monocyte/macrophage development and proliferation depends upon the signaling pathway of
CSF-1R and its ligand CSF-1. Recent depletion studies in cancer models showed a role for
M-CSF in promoting tumor growth and progression to metastasis (Chitu, V. and Stanley,
E.R., Curr. Opin. Immunol., 2006, 18:39-48;        Pollard, J.W., Nature Rev. Cancer, 2004,
80:59-65; Paulus, P., et al., Cancer Res. 2006, 66:4349-4356). Inhibition of this pathway
therefore could reduce TAM levels, leading to multiple effects on tumor types in which
macrophages have a significant presence.
[0012]          Macrophages are also a predominant source of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the destructive pannus of rheumatoid arthritis. TNF and IL-I
activate stromal expression of hematopoietic factors including CSF-1. In turn, CSF-1 recruits
monocytes and promotes macrophage survival, functional activation, and in some settings,
proliferation.    Thus, TNF and CSF-1 interact in a perpetuating cycle that leads to
inflammation and joint destruction. Macrophage numbers are also elevated in atherosclerotic
plaque (Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1985, 109: 445-449) where they are thought to contribute to
disease progression.
[0013]          Inflammatory mechanisms are also believed to play an important role in
hyperalgesia resulting from nerve injury.         Nerve damage can stimulate macrophage
infiltration and increase the number of activated T cells (Abbadie, C., 2005, Trends Immunol.

    WO 2012/082689                                                         PCT/US2011/064549
                                                  4
26(1):529-534).       Under these conditions, neuroinflammatory and immune responses
contribute as much to the development and maintenance of pain as the initial damage itself.
The role of circulating monocytes/macrophages             in the development    of neuropathic
hyperalgesia and Wallerian degeneration due to partial nerve injury was confirmed in an
animal model (Liu et al., Pain, 2000, 86: 25-32) in which macrophages were depleted
following sciatic nerve ligation.          In this study, treatment of nerve-injured rats with
liposome-encapsulated Cl 2MDP (dicloromethylene diphosphonate), which is reported to
effectively reduce the number of macrophages at the site of nerve transaction, alleviated
thermal hyperalgesia and reduced degeneration of both myelinated and unmyelinated axons.
In addition, in many instances neuropathic pain is associated with nerve inflammation
(neuritis) in the absence of nerve injury. Based on an animal model of neuritis (Tal M., Curr.
Rev. Pain 1999, 3(6):440-446), it has been suggested that there is a role for some cytokines in
nociception and hyperalgesia by evoking peripheral sensitization, in which trauma and
classical tissue inflammation are not seen. Thus, macrophage depletion by administration of
a cFMS inhibitor could have clinical potential in treatment or prevention of neuropathic pain,
either as a result of nerve injury and in the absence of nerve injury.
[0014]           Several classes of small molecule inhibitors of cFMS said to be useful for
treating cancer, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are known (Huang, H. et al., J. Med.
Chem, 2009, 52, 1081-1099; Scott, D.A. et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett., 2009, 19, 697
700).
[00151            C-KIT receptor, also called CD 117, is expressed on the surface of various
cell types, including hematopoietic stem cells.       This cytokine receptor is associated with
certain forms of gastric cancer (Novak, C. et al., 2010 Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 10(7): 624
634).   Imatinib and Sunitinib are both inhibitors of cKIT and are generally effective in
treatment of patients with GIST. Eventually, however, patients develop resistance to both
agents and alternative options remain limited.
[0016]           There is evidence that cKIT and mast cells play a detrimental role in settings
of fibrosis.    For example, mast cells are concentrated in the lesional small-airway sub
epithelium in obliterative bronchiolitis (Fuehrer, N. et al., 2009, Archives Pathology
Laboratory Medicine 133(9): 1420-1425). In addition, there is evidence that cKIT positive
cells are involved in the pathogenesis of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (Ozel, S. et al.,
2009, Journal Pediatric Urology, August 27).

    WO 2012/082689                                                          PCT/US2011/064549
                                                 5
[00171          Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) involves the increase of blood
pressure in the pulmonary artery and there is evidence that dysfunctional endothelial
progenitors over-expressing cKIT contribute to the pathology of PAH (Toshner, M., et al.,
2009, American Journal Critical Care Medicine 180(8): 780-787).

[00201]        The terms "(1-6C)alkyl", "(1-4C)alkyl" "(2-4C)alkyl" and "(2-6C)alkyl" as
used herein refers to saturated linear or branched-chain monovalent hydrocarbon radicals of
one to six carbon atoms, one to four carbon atoms, two to four carbon atoms, or two to six
carbon atoms, respectively. Examples include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl,
isopropyl, 1-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, 2-methyl-2-propyl, pentyl and hexyl.
[00202]        The    terms    "(1-6C)alkoxy",     "(1-4C)alkoxy",   "(2-4C)alkoxy"   and   "(2
6C)alkoxy" as used herein refer to saturated linear or branched-chain monovalent alkoxy
radicals of one to six carbon atoms, one to four carbon atoms, two to four carbon atoms, or
two to six carbon atoms, respectively, wherein the radical is on the oxygen atom. Examples
include methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, and butoxy.
[00203]        When a chemical formula is used to describe a substituent, the dash on the left
or the right side of the formula indicates that the free valance is on the left of the right
portion, respectively, of the substituent.
[00204]        The term "halogen" includes fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.
[002051        It will be appreciated that certain compounds according to the invention may
contain one or more centers of asymmetry and may therefore be prepared and isolated as a
mixture of isomers such as a racemic or diastereomeric mixture, or in an enantiomerically or
diastereomerically pure form. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of
the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as
well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention.
[00206]        It may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and/or
from starting materials.    The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated
and/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by techniques
common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization
from    a  solvent   or   solvent   mixture,   distillation, sublimation,  or   chromatography.
Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase
and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid
chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed
("SMB") and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small

                                                28
scale thin layer and flash chromatography. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most
likely to achieve the desired separation.
[002071         Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a
diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g.,
chiral auxiliary, such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the
diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the
corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC
column. Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the
basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art,
such as by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.
[002081         A single stereoisomer, for example, an enantiomer, substantially free of its
stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using methods known in
the art, such as    (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and
separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric
compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion
to the pure stereoisomers, and (3)        separation of the substantially pure or enriched
stereoisomers    directly under chiral conditions.      See: Wainer, Irving W., ed. Drug
Stereochemistry: Analytical Methods and Pharmacology. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc.,
1993.
[0001]          Under method (1),      diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of
enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, a-methyl
  -phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic
functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid.     The diastereomeric salts may be
induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of
the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such
as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid, can result in formation of
the diastereomeric salts.
[0002]          Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one
enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (Eliel, E., and S. Wilen.
Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322).
Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with
enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by
separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A

                                                29
method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester,
e.g., (-) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, a-methoxy-a
(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III, Peyton. "Resolution of (+)-5-Bromonomicotine.
Synthesis of (R)- and (S)-Nomicotine of High Enantiomeric Purity." J. Org. Chem. Vol. 47,
No. 21 (1982): pp. 4165-4167), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the 1H NMR spectrum
for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers
of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase
chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines
(WO 96/15111).
[00209]         By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by
chromatography      using a chiral    stationary phase      (Lough, W.J.,    ed.   Chiral Liquid
Chromatography. New York: Chapman and Hall, 1989; Okamoto, Yoshio, et al. "Optical
resolution of dihydropyridine enantiomers by high-performance liquid chromatography using
phenylcarbamates of polysaccharides as a chiral stationary phase." J. of Chromatogr. Vol.
513 (1990): pp. 375-378).        Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by
methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as
optical rotation and circular dichroism.
[00210]         In one embodiment, a compound of Formula I can be enriched in one
enantiomer over the other by up to 80% enantiomeric excess.              In one embodiment, a
compound of Formula I can be enriched in one enantiomer over the other by up to 85%
enantiomeric excess. In one embodiment, a compound of Formula I can be enriched in one
enantiomer over the other by up to 90% enantiomeric excess.              In one embodiment, a
compound of Formula I can be enriched in one enantiomer over the other by up to 95%
enantiomeric excess.
[00211]         As used herein, the term "enantiomeric excess" means the absolute difference
between the mole fraction of each enantiomer.
[00212]         It will further be appreciated that an enantiomer of a compound of the
invention can be prepared by starting with the appropriate chiral starting material.
[00213]         In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular
chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the
compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed
line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.

[00214]         It will also be appreciated that certain compounds of Formula I may be used as
intermediates for the preparation of further compounds of Formula I.
[002151         The compounds of Formula I include salts thereof. In certain embodiments,
the salts are pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In addition, the compounds of Formula I
include other salts of such compounds which are not necessarily pharmaceutically acceptable
salts, and which may be useful as intermediates for preparing and/or purifying compounds of
Formula I and/or for separating enantiomers of compounds of Formula I.
[00216]         It will further be appreciated that the compounds of Formula I and their salts
may be isolated in the form of solvates, and accordingly that any such solvate is included
within the scope of the present invention.
[002171           Compounds of the invention may also contain unnatural proportions of
atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. That is, an
atom, in particular when mentioned in relation to a compound according to Formula I,
comprises all isotopes and isotopic mixtures of that atom, either naturally occurring or
synthetically produced, either with natural abundance or in an isotopically enriched form.
For example, when hydrogen is mentioned, it is understood to refer to 1H, 2H, 3H or mixtures
thereof; when carbon is mentioned, it is understood to refer to "C,    1C,   1C, "C or mixtures
thereof; when nitrogen is mentioned, it is understood to refer to     1N, 1N,    "N or mixtures
thereof; when oxygen is mentioned, it is understood to refer to        o,     NO, N o     180 or
mixtures thereof; and when fluoro is mentioned, it is understood to refer to         18F, 19F or
mixtures thereof. The compounds according to the invention therefore also comprise
compounds with one or more isotopes of one or more atom, and mixtures thereof, including
radioactive compounds, wherein one or more non-radioactive atoms has been replaced by one
of its radioactive enriched isotopes.      Radiolabeled compounds are useful as therapeutic
agents, e.g., cancer therapeutic agents, research reagents, e.g., assay reagents, and diagnostic
agents, e.g., in vivo imaging agents. All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present
invention, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the
present invention.

[00299]         Examples of bone-related diseases include metastatic bone disease, treatment
induced bone loss, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Paget's disease,
and periodontal disease. The osteoporosis may be attributed to (1) menopause in women, (2)
aging in men or women, (3) suboptimal bone growth during childhood and adolescence that
resulted in failure to reach peak bone mass, and/or (4) bone loss secondary to other disease
conditions, eating disorders, medications and/or medical treatments (for example, as a result
of treatment with glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibition therapy, or anti-androgen therapy).
[00300]         Other osteolytic diseases that can be treated according to the present invention
are more localized. A particular example is metastatic tumor-induced osteolysis. In this
condition, bone cancers or bone metastases induce localized osteolysis that causes pain, bone
weakness and fractures. Such localized osteolysis also permits tumors to grow larger by
creating more space for them in the bone and releasing growth factors from the bone matrix.
Cancers presently known         to  cause tumor-induced      osteolysis include   hematological

[00331]         Compounds were screened for inhibition of PDGFR beta phosphorylation in
the HS27 human fibroblast cell line. Cells were seeded into a 96 well tissue culture plate,
then incubated overnight in a 37 'C, 5% CO 2 incubator.         The following day, cells were
treated for one hour with test compound dilutions. After stimulation with PDGF-BB ligand
for 5 minutes, cells were lysed and added to a sandwich ELISA plate from R&D Systems to
detect levels of phospho PDGFR beta. A standard 4-parameter logistic model was fit to the
inhibitor dose response curves, with the IC5 0 being defined as the concentration of inhibitor
giving 50 percent of control (POC).

[00332]         Compounds were screened for inhibition of PDGFR beta phosphorylation in
the HS27 human fibroblast cell line. Cells were seeded into a 96 well tissue culture plate,
then incubated overnight in a 37 'C/5% CO 2 incubator. The following day, cells were treated
for one hour with test compound dilutions. After stimulation with PDGF-BB ligand for 10
minutes, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes.
This was followed by washing in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 and permeabilizing in 100%
MeOH for 10 minutes. Cells were incubated in blocking buffer for 1 hour. Antibodies to
phosphorylated PDGFR3 and total ERK were added to the cells and incubated for 3 hours.
After washing with PBS/0.2% Triton X-100, the cells were incubated with fluorescently
labeled secondary antibodies for an additional hour. Cells were then washed with PBS and
analyzed for fluorescence at both wavelengths using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System
(LI-COR Biosciences). Phosphorylated PDGFR signal was normalized to total ERK signal.
A standard 4-parameter logistic model was fit to the inhibitor dose response curves, with the
IC 50 being defined as the concentration of inhibitor giving 50 percent of control (POC).

lysed in a manner which preserves phosphoproteins, and the lysate was analyzed by ELISA
(R&D Systems, Human Phospho-M-CSF R DuoSet IC DYC3268), in which total cFMS
protein in the lysate is captured and phosphotyrosine residues of cFMS are detected.        A

Sodium hydride (60% in mineral oil; 43.56 g; 1089 mmol) was added to a 3L reaction flask
under nitrogen. A mechanical stirrer and thermocouple was attached. Dry diglyme (400 mL)
was added. A solution of 2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)ethanol (157 g; 1089 mmol) in diglyme

(450 mL) was added slowly with stirring. The mixture was stirred with warming to 40 'C for
1 hour. 4-Chloropyridin-2-amine (70.0 g; 544.5 mmol) was added as a solid. The mixture was
heated to 80 OC with stirring until effervescence had ceased. The temperature was increased
to 157 0C for 16 hours. The mixture was allowed to cool and diluted with water (500 mL).
THF (1000 mL) was added followed by sodium chloride (sufficient to saturate the aqueous
phase). The phases were separated and the aqueous phase was further extracted with THF (3
x 800 mL). Additional water was added as required to aid in phase separation. The combined
organic phases were dried with sodium sulfate (1000 g) for 16 hours and filtered. The solvent
was removed under vacuum to remove the majority of the THF. The solution was filtered
through Celite to remove fine particulates rinsing with diglyme. The diglyme was removed
under vacuum (10 mm Hg vacuum, with the bath temperature increased to 60 0 C).             The
residue was placed under high vacuum for 1 hour and then triturated with ether (400 mL).
The resulting solids were collected by filtration, washed with ether and dried under vacuum
to give the product (100.4 g) as an off white solid.
[003371         Step B: Preparation of 4-(2-(4-Methylpiperazin-1-Yl)ethoxy)pyridin-2-amine:
Potassium 2-Chloro-3-ethoxy-3-oxoprop-1-en-1-olate        (120 g, 635 mmol) was suspended
(through vigorous magnetic stirring) in 1800 mL of ether and 6N sulfuric acid (53 mL, 317
mmol) was added slowly. The lower aqueous suspension was sampled periodically for
acidity. Additional water (100 mL) was added to aid in phase separation. When the pH of the
lower (aqueous) phase dropped below 3, the ether phase was separated. The aqueous phase
was further extracted with ether (200 mL). The combined ether phases were dried over
sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate for 10 minutes. The solution was filtered and
concentrated under reduced pressure, with the temperature not exceeding 20 0 C. An off-white
semi-solid (100 g) was obtained. This was dissolved in absolute ethanol (800 mL). 4-(2-(4
Methylpiperazin-1-yl)ethoxy)pyridin-2-amine      (Preparation C; 75 g, 317 mmol) was added,
and the mixture was heated under nitrogen at 65 0 C for 18 hours. The mixture was cooled to
ambient temperature and the resulting suspension was evaporated to dryness under reduced
pressure. The resulting solids were triturated with THF, collected by filtration and then dried
under vacuum. The material (an HCl salt) was mixed with water (1 L) and ethanol (500 mL).
Sodium bicarbonate (50 g) was added and the mixture was stirred for 18 hours.              The
suspension was evaporated to dryness under vacuum. The solids were extracted with a large
volume of ethyl acetate (4L) and THF (IL) until no further product was extracted. The
organic solution was further dried with sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate, filtered and

charged with 2-chloro-4-fluoropyridine (20 g, 152 mmol), tert-butyl carbamate (89 g, 760
mmol), tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium (1.39 g, 1.52 mmol), X-PHOS (1.48 g, 3.10
mmol), cesium carbonate (99 g, 588 mmol), and tetrahydrofuran (500 mL) under an
atmosphere of dry nitrogen. The mixture was heated at reflux under nitrogen for 7 hours. A
further 1 equivalent of cesium carbonate was added and the reaction was heated a further 7
hours. The mixture was cooled to ambient temperature, filtered through Celite and washed
with ethyl acetate.   The filtrate was partitioned between saturated sodium bicarbonate and
ethyl acetate. The aqueous phase was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The combined
organic phases were washed with brine and dried with sodium sulfate, concentrated under
vacuum, and purified by column chromatography to give tert-butyl 4-fluoropyridin-2
ylcarbamate as a pale yellow solid (22.6 g).
[00340]         Step B: Preparation of 4-fluoropyridin-2-amine:     A flask was charged with
tert-butyl 4-fluoropyridin-2-ylcarbamate (3.5 g, 16.5 mmol) and dichloromethane (100 mL).

The mixture was cooled to 0-5OC using an ice/water bath. Trifluoroacetic acid (75 mL) was
added slowly with continued stirring. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 16
hours. The mixture was concentrated under vacuum before partitioning between saturated
sodium bicarbonate and ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was washed with ethyl acetate
twice. The combined organic phases were washed with brine and dried with sodium sulfate
before concentrating under vacuum to give 4-fluoropyridin-2-amine as a pale yellow solid
(1.76 g).
[00341]         Step C: Preparation of ethyl 7-fluoroimidazo[1,2-alpyridine-3-carboxylate: 4
Fluoropyridin-2-amine (10.0 g, 48.0 mmol) was mixed with ethanol (40 mL) in a reaction
flask, under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. A solution of ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxopropanoate
(5% in benzene, 178 mL (commercial solution from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc.) was
added. The mixture was heated to 60 'C under nitrogen for 4 hours. After allowing the
mixture to cool the solvent was removed under vacuum to give a brown solid. The solid was
mixed with ethyl acetate (300 mL) and sodium bicarbonate solution (75 mL) and stirred to
dissolve. The phases were separated and the bicarbonate solution was extracted further with
ethyl acetate (75 mL). The combined ethyl acetate extracts were dried over sodium sulfate,
filtered and concentrated under vacuum to give a solid. The crude material was dissolved in
ethyl acetate and passed through a short column of silica, eluting with ethyl acetate. Factions
containing the desired product were concentrated to give ethyl 7-fluoroimidazo[1,2
a]pyridine-3-carboxylate as a white solid (13 g).
[00342]         Step D:  Preparation of ethyl 6-chloropicolinate:   A flask equipped with a
condenser was charged with 6-chloropicolinic acid (23.5 g, 149 mmol), 100 mL of ethanol
and 400 mL of toluene. To this was added 4 mL of sulfuric acid and the mixture was warmed
to reflux for three hours, and then allowed to cool to ambient temperature.       The reaction
mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the resulting oil was taken up in 200
mL of ethyl acetate, washed with 10% aqueous potassium carbonate, dried over sodium
sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 26 g of ethyl 6-chloropicolinate
(94%).
[003431         Step E: Preparation of ethyl 6-(prop-1-en-2-Vl)picolinate:   A first flask was
charged with 1,4-dioxane/H 20 (50 mL/10 mL). The flask was cooled to 0 'C and vacuum

and sodium 2'-(dicyclohexylphosphino)-2,6-dimethoxybiphenyl-3-sulfonate (0.6959 g, 1.358
mmol). The second flask was also evacuated with vacuum and back filled with N 2 for 3
times.   The cold degassed dioxane/H 20 was then added to the second flask, which was
evacuated with vacuum and back filled with argon 5 times. The reaction mixture was heated
to 80 'C for 3 hours. The reaction was cooled to ambient temperature and concentrated under
reduced pressure. The residue was then diluted with EtOAc (200 mL). The organic layer
was washed with saturated NaHCO 3 , dried (Na 2 SO 4) and concentrated to give a quantitative
yield of ethyl 6-(prop-1-en-2-yl)picolinate, which was used in the next step without further
purification.
[00344]         Step F: Preparation of ethyl 6-isopropylpicolinate: To ethyl 6-(prop-1-en-2
yl)picolinate (4.63 g, 24.2 mmol) in EtOH (50 mL) was added Pd/C (0.61 g, 0.573 mmol).
The reaction mixture was purged with nitrogen three times and then with hydrogen three
times. A hydrogen balloon was applied to the reaction for three hours. The reaction was then
purged with N 2 , filtered through Celite and washed with EtOH (100 mL).          Solvent was
removed under reduced pressure to give 4.36 g (93%) of ethyl 6-isopropylpicolinate.

6-Isopropylpyridin-2-yl)methanol     (40 g, 0.265 mol) was dissolved in 500 mL of dry
dichloromethane and chilled to 0 'C. To this was added thionyl chloride (37.8 g, 0.317 mol)
and the mixture was stirred for one hour. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under
reduced pressure to give a quantitative yield of 2-(chloromethyl)-6-isopropylpyridine
hydrochloride.
[003471         Step C: Preparation of 3-bromo-4-nitro-1H-indazole:         To a flask equipped
with a mechanical stirrer was added sodium acetate (26.4 g, 0.306 mol), 4-nitro-1H-indazole
(50 g, 0.306 mol), 300 mL of acetic acid and 300 mL of chloroform. Bromine (51.4 g, 0.322
mol) in 60 mL of acetic acid was added to the reaction mixture over 3.5 hours, while the
temperature was kept under 25 'C.       The reaction mixture was stirred for two hours, then
concentrated under reduced pressure. Water (500 mL) was added to the resulting solids. The
solids were collected by filtration, washed with 500 mL of water, and dried under vacuum to
give 68 g (92%) of 3-bromo-4-nitro-1H-indazole.

boronic acid (72 g, 1.20 mol), Pd(PPh 3) 4 (9.7 g, 0.0084 mol), potassium carbonate (99.5 g,
0.719 mol), followed by 200 mL of water.          This mixture was purged with argon for 10
minutes, flask sealed and heated to 120 'C for 16 hours. Another 1.5 mol% of Pd(PPh 3) 4 was
added followed by another 2 equivalents of methyl boronic acid, and the mixture warmed to
120 'C for 24 hours. The mixture was diluted with water and extracted with EtOAc. The
combined organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated.              Column
chromatography (5% ethyl acetate/hexane to 10% ethyl acetate/hexane) gave 54 g (73%) of
1-((6-isopropylpyridin-2-yl)methyl)-3-methyl-4-nitro-1H-indazole as an orange/yellow solid.

added, and the mixture was warmed to 70 'C.             After about one hour, an additional 2
equivalents of 3.2 M aqueous HCl were added and the mixture stirred at 70 'C for 16 hours.
At this point, an additional 30 g of potassium 2-chloro-3-ethoxy-3-oxoprop-1-en-1-olate were
added and the mixture stirred at 70 'C for 2 hours to facilitate completion of the reaction.
The mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and 500 mL of water were added, followed
by adjustment of the pH to 11 with 10% aqueous sodium carbonate. After stirring for several
hours, the precipitated solids were collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give 31 g

[00624]         Step A: Preparation of 3-iodo-4-nitro-1H-indazole: A solution of 4-nitro-1H
indazole (50.0 g; 306 mmol) in DMF (600 mL) was cooled to 5 'C under a nitrogen
atmosphere with stirring. Powdered potassium hydroxide (68.8 g; 1226 mmol) was added. A
solution of iodine (156 g; 613 mmol) in DMF (200 mL) was added slowly to the reaction
mixture over 2 hours maintaining the temperature between 5 and 10 'C. The mixture was
stirred at 25 'C for 24 hours.     Additional iodine (39.0 g; 153.2 mmol) and potassium
hydroxide (17.2 g; 306.5 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred at 25 'C for an
additional 12 hours.    The reaction mixture was added to an aqueous solution of sodium
bisulfite (10% solution; 3300 mL) with stirring. The resulting precipitate was collected by
filtration and washed with water. The material was dried in a vacuum oven at 40 'C.        The
material was dissolved in methylene chloride/methanol (10:1; 1.5 L) and filtered through
Celite@ to remove inorganic impurities. Concentration of the solution under vacuum gave 3
iodo-4-nitro-1H-indazole as a yellow solid (75 g).

to 0 'C utilizing an ice/water bath. Potassium 2-methylpropan-2-olate (81.95 g, 693.8 mmol)
was added and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. The ice/water bath was removed and
the mixture was stirred for an additional 2 hours at ambient temperature. The mixture was
concentrated under vacuum. Water (500 mL) was added and the mixture was extracted with
dichloromethane. The combined extracts were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and
concentrated under vacuum to give 2-chloro-4-(2-methoxyethoxy)pyridine as a gold colored
oil (115 g).

tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (2.26 g; 2.468 mmol) were combined in a reaction
flask under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (150 mL) was added.
The mixture was degassed by alternately evacuating the flask followed by filling with dry
nitrogen (three times). The mixture was cooled to 0-5 'C using an ice/water bath. LHMDS
(325 mL, 325.0 mmol) was added by addition funnel while maintaining the temperature
below 5'C. The ice/water bath was removed and the mixture was heated to reflux (60-65'C)
for 1.5 hours.    After allowing the mixture to cool an ice/water bath was put in place.
Hydrochloric acid (2N; 300 mL) was added with stirring, maintaining the temperature below
30 'C. After stirring for 15 minutes the mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel with
the addition of methyl t-butyl ether (300 mL) and water (20 mL). The phases were separated.
The aqueous phase was basified by the addition of sodium hydroxide (50%; 10 mL) and then
extracted with dichloromethane. The combined dichloromethane extracts were dried over
sodium sulfate and filtered. Heptane (300 mL) was added. The solution was concentrated
under vacuum to about one third the initial volume. Heptane (200 mL) was added. Further
concentration resulted in solids precipitating. The solids were collected by filtration and
washed with heptane (100 mL). The solids were dried under vacuum at 55 'C to give 4-(2

bicarbonate solution (50 mL) and stirred to dissolve. The phases were separated and the
bicarbonate solution was extracted with further ethyl acetate (50 mL). The combined ethyl
acetate extracts were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum to
give a brown solid (7.0 g). The material was dissolved in ethyl acetate and passed through a
short column of silica, eluting with ethyl acetate. Factions containing product were
concentrated to give ethyl 7-(2-methoxyethoxy)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxylate         as a

Lithium hydroxide monohydrate (0.962 g; 22.9 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred
under an atmosphere of nitrogen and heated at 40'C for 22 hours. The mixture was allowed
to cool and then concentrated under reduced pressure to give a yellow gum. Water (50 mL)
was added and the mixture stirred to until homogeneous. Hydrochloric acid (2N) was added
with stirring to adjust to pH 3. The mixture was cooled with an ice/water bath. The resulting
precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with a small amount of water (10 mL). The
material was dried under vacuum to give 7-(2-methoxyethoxy)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3

chloride (0.23 mmol; 2M solution in methylene chloride). The mixture was stirred in a sealed
vial until effervescence ceased (approximately 30 minutes), with occasional venting to
release gas. 1-Benzyl-1H-indazol-4-amine (Example 155, Steps A-B; 47 mg; 0.21 mmol) was
added as a solution in methylene chloride (1 mL) followed by diisopropylethylamine (33 mg;
0.25 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 16 hours at ambient temperature, during which time
a suspension formed. The mixture was partitioned between water and methylene chloride
and the suspension was extracted multiple times with methylene chloride. The combined
organic phases (which contained suspended solids) were concentrated under reduced
pressure. The resulting solid material was triturated with ether and collected by filtration.
