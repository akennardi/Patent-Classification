[00106]      In some embodiments, the processes described herein are improved methods for
commercial chemical manufacturing of Compound 1 or Compound 2. Without being bound to a
particular theory or mechanism of action, the processes described herein significantly improve
the overall efficiency and product yield of Compound 1 or Compound 2. Previous processes
(e.g., U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2010/0305 122 and 2012/0157470, and International Patent
Publication Nos. WO 2011/15096 and WO 2012/071336) were found to lack feasibility for
production of Compound 1 on a commercial scale. Thus, the processes provided herein
represent improved methods for the synthesis of compounds in quantities required for clinical
and/or commercial development. Improvements relative to these previous processes include, but
are not limited to, overall yield of Compound 1 or Compound 2, overall process efficiency and
economics, mild reaction conditions, practical isolation/purification procedures, and viability for
commercialization.
[00107]      The improved process provided herein involves a selective nucleophilic aromatic
substitution reaction ("SnAr reaction") of compounds (B) and (C), which can be carried out
under milder conditions with a shorter reaction time when compared to previously described
processes as found, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2010/0305122 and
2012/0157470, and International Patent Publication Nos. WO 2011/15096 and WO
2012/071336. Without being limited by theory, the improved SnAr reaction of compound (B)
and (C) does not generate regioisomeric side products which necessitate further purification to
remove the side products, as was the case in previously described processes. The SnAr reaction
in the previous process also requires a longer reaction time and harsh reaction conditions which
result in a low overall yield relative to the processes described herein. Furthermore, the previous

processes also require tedious purification of the intermediates which is impracticable on a large,
commercial scale process. The processes described herein are more convergent than prior
processes, resulting in a highly efficient cross-coupling reaction of compound (D) and the free
base of compound (I) in high yield. In some embodiments, the processes described herein utilize
crystalline solid intermediates (H) and (I), which allow efficient purification by crystallization to
remove impurities - advantages not available in previously described processes.
[00108]      The following schemes illustrate one or more embodiments of the process provided
herein. In some embodiments, the compound of formula (D) is prepared from compound (B)
and compound (C) as shown in Scheme 1 below. The compound of formula (B) may be
prepared by techniques known in the art, e.g., as shown in WO 2000/047212 and J. Am. Chem.
Soc., 1959, 81: 743-747. The compound of formula (C) may be prepared by techniques known

[00116]     In some embodiments, the preparation of the compound of formula (K) from
compound (D) and compound (I) is air and/or moisture sensitive, and is therefore performed
under an inert atmosphere, e.g., using nitrogen or argon gas.
[00117]     Without being bound to a particular theory, the use of compound (D) as an
intermediate in the preparation of the compound of formula (1) and the compound of formula (2)
as shown above in Schemes 1 to 6 is an improvement over previously described processes for the
preparation of the compound of formula (1) and the compound of formula (2). In some

embodiments, the improvements include higher product yields, shorter reaction times. In some
embodiments, the improvements are provided when R is tert-butyl in compound (D).

[00147]      General Considerations:this chemistry is considered air and moisture sensitive.
While the catalyst precursors in their solid, dry form can be handled and stored in air without
special precautions, contact with even small amounts of solvent may render them susceptible to
decomposition. As a result, traces of oxygen or other competent oxidants (e.g., solvent
peroxides) must be removed prior to combination of the catalyst precursors with solvent and care
must be used to prevent ingress of oxygen during the reaction. Also, care must be taken to use
dry equipment, solvents, and reagents to prevent formation of undesirable byproducts. The
sodium t-butoxide used in this reaction is hygroscopic and it should be properly handled and
stored prior to or during use.
[00148]     To a 2.0 L three-neck RB flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer were charged the
bis-hydrochloride salt (Compound (I), 42.5 g) and toluene (285 ml). 20% K 3 P0    4 (285 ml) was

added and the biphasic mixture was stirred for 30 min. The layers were separated and the
organic layer was washed with 25 %NaCl (145 ml). The organic layer concentrated to 120 g
and used in the coupling reaction without further purification.
[00149]     NaOtBu (45.2 g) and Compound (I) in toluene solution (120 g solution - 30 g
potency adjusted) were combined in THF (180 ml) in a suitable reactor and sparged with
nitrogen for NLT 45 min. Pd 2 dba3 (0.646 g), Compound (J) (0.399 g), and Compound (D) (40.3
g) were combined in a second suitable reactor and purged with nitrogen until oxygen level was
NMT 40 ppm. Using nitrogen pressure, the solution containing Compound (I) and NaOtBu in
toluene/THF was added through a 0.45 pm inline filter to the second reactor (catalyst,
Compound (J) and Compound (D)) and rinsed with nitrogen sparged THF (30 ml.).
[00150]     The resulting mixture was heated to 55 'C with stirring for NLT 16 h, then cooled to
22 'C. The mixture was diluted with 12% NaCl (300 g) followed by THF (300 ml). The layers
were separated.
[00151]     The organic layer was stirred with a freshly prepared solution of L-cysteine (15 g),
NaHCO 3 (23 g), and water (262 ml). After 1 h the layers were separated.
[00152]     The organic layer was stirred with a second freshly prepared solution of L-cysteine
(15 g), NaHCO 3 (23 g), and water (262 ml). After 1 h the layers were separated. The organic
layer was washed with 12 %NaCl (300 g), then filtered through a 0.45 pm inline filter. The
filtered solution was concentrated in vacuo to ~ 300 mL, and chased three times with heptane
(600 mL each) to remove THF.
[00153]     The crude mixture was concentrated to 6 volumes and diluted with cyclohexane (720

min. Seed material was charged and the mixture was held at 65 'C for 4 hours. The suspension
was cooled to 25 'C over NLT 8 h, then held at 25 'C for 4 hours. The solids were filtered and
