10                                             BACKGROUND
           Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway in both animals and plants that
   is essential for development, differentiation, homeostasis, and survival. In animals,
   autophagy serves principally as an adaptive mechanism to protect organisms against
   diverse pathologies, including infection, cancer, neurodegeneration, heart disease, and
15 aging. The repertoire of routine housekeeping functions performed by autophagy
   includes elimination of defective proteins and organelles, prevention of the
   accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates, and elimination of intracellular
   pathogens. The autophagy pathway is uniquely capable of degrading entire organelles,
   such as mitochondria, peroxisomes, and endoplasmic reticulum.
20         Multiple reports indicate that proteins required for autophagy induction, such as
   sirtuin 1 , have reduced expression in aged tissues; levels of autophagy have been
   shown to diminish with age. Reduced levels of autophagy have also been associated
   with obesity, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease,
   osteoarthritis, and age-related macular degeneration.
25         A number of compounds that stimulate autophagy have been identified,
   including rapamycin, resveratrol, metformin, spermidine, and glucosamine.

                                            - 1a
Urolithins are ellagitannin- and ellagic acid-derived metabolites produced, e.g., by
mammalian colonic microflora, including human colonic microflora. Urolithins are known
to exhibit anti-oxidant activity

                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
20 Overview
           Autophagy is a process by which cells degrade their own components, recycling
   amino acids and other building blocks that can be reused. Such degradation is performed by
   lysosomal acidic hydrolases. It is a tightly regulated process that plays an important role in
   normal cell growth, development, and homeostasis, helping to maintain a balance between
25 the synthesis, degradation, and subsequent recycling of cellular products. It is a major
   mechanism by which starving cells can reallocate nutrients from less-essential processes to
   more essential processes.
           During nutrient starvation, increased levels of autophagy lead to the breakdown of
   non-vital components and the release of nutrients, ensuring that vital processes can
30 continue. Mutant yeast cells that have a reduced autophagic capability rapidly perish in
   nutrient-deficient conditions. A gene known as Atg7 has been implicated in nutrient
                                             - 13 -

   mediated autophagy, and studies in mice have shown that starvation-induced autophagy
   was impaired in Atg7-deficient mice. Komatsu M et al. (2005) J Cell Biol. 169:425-434.
           Autophagy degrades damaged organelles, cell membranes, and proteins. The failure
   of autophagy is thought to be an important factor in the accumulation of cell damage and,
 5 therefore, aging.
           Three types of autophagy can be distinguished, depending on the pathway along
   which cellular components are delivered to lysosomes: macroautophagy, microautophagy,
   and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA).
   Macroautophagy
10         Macroautophagy involves the degradation of long-lived proteins and whole cellular
   organelles through a multistep process (Figure 1). Macroautophagy begins with the
   formation of a double-layered isolation membrane (phagophore) around the molecules
   and/or organelles to be degraded. The phagophore engulfs cytosolic components and seals
   around the content, forming an autophagosome. Eventually, the autophagosome fuses with
15 a lysosome, evolving into an autophagolysosome (or autolysosome), wherein lysosomal
   hydrolases digest the cargo. Microautophagy involves the direct sequestration of cytosolic
   components through invaginations or armlike projections of the lysosomal membrane.
   Microautophagy may serve for the turnover of long-lived proteins; however, the
   significance and regulation of this type of autophagy remain poorly understood. Finally,
20 chaperone-mediated autophagy is a highly selective process devoted to the degradation of
   soluble cytosolic proteins.
           The microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), a mammalian
   homolog of the yeast Atg8, is a soluble protein with a molecular mass of approximately 17
   kDa which is distributed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues and cultured cells.          It is
25 processed immediately after its synthesis by Atg4B, a cysteine protease, that exposes the C
   terminal glycine residue (LC3-I). During autophagy, autophagosomes engulf cytoplasmic
   components, including cytosolic proteins and organelles. Concomitantly, a cytosolic form
   of LC3 (LC3-I) is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to form and LC3-PE
   conjugate (LC3-II), which is recruited to autophagosomal membranes (Figure 1).
30         p62, also known as sequestosome-1, was identified as a novel partner of the atypical
   protein kinase Cs (aPKCs) and is a ubiquitiously expressed cellular protein. p62 is known
   to have domains that interact with and bind to ubiquitinated proteins, and it has been
                                            - 14 -

   identified as a component of inclusion bodies observed in human diseases, especially
   neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis) as well as in liver diseases.    p62 also has been identified as an LC3
   interacting protein and it has been demonstrated that an 11 amino acid sequence in the
 5 mouse p62 serves to recognize the LC3 protein. As seen in Figure 1, LC3 binds to p62 and
   transports it (and any ubiquitinated proteins or cell components bound to it) into the
   autophagosome, where it is degraded. Consequently, one of the hallmarks of autophagy is
   an increase in the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I with a concomitant decrease in the level of cellular
   p62.
10         Of the three types of autophagy described, macroautophagy is the best characterized
   in mammalian cells. Starvation is the strongest stimulus of macroautophagy. During
   nutrient deprivation, macroautophagy breaks down cellular components, generating amino
   acids, fatty acids, and carbohydrates, which can be harnessed for energy production and for
   the synthesis of essential cellular molecules. Macroautophagy is also involved in specific
15 cytosolic rearrangements during embryogenesis and postnatal development. Furthermore,
   macroautophagy is induced during viral or bacterial infections, in hypoxia, and under
   various stress conditions, including radiation exposure and increased reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) generation. In these circumstances, macroautophagy is essential for the
   maintenance of cell homeostasis by its promotion of the removal of damaged components.
20 Indeed, impairments in macroautophagy induce premature aging and shorten the lifespan in
   several organisms, including C. elegans, yeast, and Drosophila. Hars ES et al. (2007)
   Autophagy 3:93-95; Matecic M et al. (2010) PLoS Genet. 6:e1000921; Lee JH et al. (2010)
   Science 327:1223-1228. Conversely, upregulation of macroautophagy is proposed to be a
   major mechanism underlying the lifespan-extending properties of calorie restriction. Toth
25 ML et al. (2008) Autophagy 4:330-338; Morselli E et al. (2010) Cell Death Dis. 1:e10.
           More than 35 Atg (AuTophaGy-related) proteins have been identified in yeasts and
   mammals; however, the precise role each Atg protein plays during autophagy is not yet
   fully established. As illustrated in Figure 1, the process of macroautophagy can be divided
   into discrete steps, namely, induction and nucleation, expansion, fusion, and degradation.
30 The induction phase is mediated by the ULK1-Atg13-FIP200 kinase complex. The
   regulation of the nucleation stage, which consists of the recruitment of Atg proteins to the
   phagophore assembly site, is not yet completely understood. However, the vacuolar protein
   sorting-34 (Vps34), a class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (P13K), is required for this
                                             - 15 -

   step. Vps34 associates with Beclin1, the mammalian homologue of yeast Atg6, and
   subsequently recruits Atgl4 and Vps15 (p150) to the preautophagosomal structure. The
   elongation     and expansion of the phagophore membrane require two ubiquitin-like
   conjugation systems involving Atg12 (conjugated to Atg5)            and Atg8/microtubule
 5 associated protein 1 light chain-3 (LC3, conjugated to phosphatidyl ethanolamine), along
   with other Atg proteins such as Atg9 and Atg 16. The fusion of the autophagosome with a
   lysosome relies on canonical cellular fusion machinery that consists of the Rab-SNARE
   (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive    factor Attachment protein REceptor) system and
   requires the presence of lysosomal membrane-associated protein-2 (LAMP-2) and the UV
10 radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG). Finally, the digestion of the cargo is
   accomplished by lysosomal hydrolases, followed by the transportation of degraded
   components into the cytoplasm by lysosomal efflux transporters such as Atg22.
           With regard to the regulation of macroautophagy, motor, the mammalian target of
   rapamycin, is considered to be a major checkpoint, linking the cellular nutritional state with
15 the level of ongoing autophagy. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTOR is active and inhibits
   the ULK1-Atg13-FIP200 complex required for the induction of macroautophagy. Energy
   deprivation leads to mTOR inactivation and stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase
   (AMPK), which both induce macroautophagy. AMPK functions as an energy-sensing
   kinase and is activated by increases in the cellular AMP to ATP ratio. Under such
20 circumstances, AMPK promotes autophagy by directly activating ULKI and by relieving
   the mTOR-mediated inhibition of macroautophagy.
           Macroautophagy can be selectively directed toward the removal of particular
   targets, e.g., peroxisomes (pexophagy), endoplasmic reticulum (reticulophagy), intracellular
   lipids (lipophagy), ribosomes (ribophagy), and intracellular pathogens (xenopathy).
25 Likewise, mitochondria can be selectively targeted for degradation via macroautophagy
   (mitophagy).
   Mitophagy: A Specialized Form ofMacroautophagy
           Mitophagy is a highly selective process that can promote the elimination of
   dysfunctional or unnecessary mitochondria. Wang K et al. (2011) Autophagy 7:297-300.
30 The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (AVm) represents a major trigger of
   mitophagy. Indeed, laser-induced photo damage of selected mitochondria inside living
   hepatocytes results in the rapid dissipation of AVm, followed by the quick removal of
                                            - 16 -

   depolarized mitochondria through mitophagy. In addition, oxidative damage can lead to the
   formation of asymmetrical daughter mitochondria characterized by different AXm, with
   autophagy specifically targeting mitochondria with lower Avm. Apart from the degradation
   of damaged mitochondria under stress conditions, mitophagy is essential for mitochondrial
 5 turnover in the basal state and during cell differentiation, such as the maturation of
   reticulocytes into mature red blood cells.
            Investigations into the molecular regulation of mitophagy have unveiled several
   mitophagy-specific proteins. Parkin and Pink1 are believed to play important roles in the
   selective degradation of damaged mitochondria, at least under certain circumstances. Parkin
10 is a cytosolic E3-ubiquitin ligase that is selectively recruited to dysfunctional mitochondria
   and assists in their removal by mitophagy. Narenda D (2008) J Cell Biol. 183:795-803.
   Pink1 is imported into healthy mitochondria through a Avm-dependent process and is
   degraded by the presenilin-associated rhomboidlike (PARL) protease. Matsuda N et al.
   (2010) J Cell Biol. 189:211-221. The dissipation of AVm results in the accumulation of
15 Pink1 on the mitochondrial surface, leading to the recruitment of Parkin, which
   ubiquitinates outer membrane proteins, including the voltage-dependent anion channel
   (VDAC). It is proposed that ubiquitin-tagged mitochondria are targeted directly to
   autophagic     vacuoles   through the interaction of ubiquitinated         proteins with the
   autophagosomal marker LC3 (Atg8). In addition, Parkin can ubiquitinate the inner
20 mitochondrial membrane and apoptosis regulator protein B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2),
   thereby de-repressing Beclinl.
            Recent evidence also suggests that the opening of the mitochondrial permeability
   transition pore (mPTP) may be required for the selective removal of damaged
   mitochondria. Opening of the mPTP causes a sudden increase of the inner membrane
25 permeability to solutes with molecular weight up to 1500 Da. This results in mitochondrial
   depolarization, activation of the mitochondrial ATPase (i.e., ATP synthase operating in
   reverse), and swelling and rupture of the outer membrane. The loss of AVm subsequent to
   permeability transition targets individual mitochondria for degradation. The loss of AVm
   and the activation of macroautophagy are prevented by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the
30 mPTP component cyclophilin D. Furthermore, starvation fails to induce macroautophagy in
   cyclophilin D-deficient murine cardiomyocytes, whereas autophagy is enhanced even under
   fed conditions in cardiac cells from mice overexpressing cyclophilin D. The nicotinamide
                                              - 17 -

   adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3)               appears to be
   critically involved in the control of mPTP by modulation of cyclophilin D.
            Similar to the mPTP, the apoptotic proteins Bnip3 (Bcl-2 and adenovirus ElIB 19
   kDa-interacting protein-3) and Nix (Nip3-like protein X) are thought to trigger selective
 5 mitophagy through mitochondrial depolarization. Moreover, Bnip3 may induce mitophagy
   by competitively disrupting the inhibitory interaction between Bcl-2 and Beclinl. Finally,
   Nix associates with mitochondrial membranes and directly interacts with LC3 (Atg8).
            Although the molecular regulation of mitophagy has not yet been completely
   elucidated, the mTOR/AMPK pathway is proposed to be a major checkpoint. AMPK, in
10 addition to stimulating mitochondrial removal through autophagy, enhances the activity of
   sirtuin-1   (SIRTI)     and its downstream target PGC-la, resulting in stimulation of
   mitochondrial      biogenesis. Hence, through the activity of AMPK, mitophagy and
   mitochondrial biogenesis are coordinately regulated, maintaining a healthy and functional
   pool of mitochondria in the cell.
15          Lipophagy is a recently recognized alternative pathway of lipid metabolism in
   which     intracellular   lipid droplet    triglycerides  and    cholesterol are taken up   by
   autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation by acidic hydrolases, thereby
   releasing free fatty acids. Lipophagy, therefore, functions to regulate intracellular lipid
   stores, cellular levels of free lipids, such as fatty acids, and energy homeostasis.
20          Xenophagy is a recently recognized mechanism of defense against various types of
   intracellular pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella typhimurium,
   Legionella pneumophila, Brucella species, Chlamydia species, Coxiella burnetti, Listeria
   monocytogenes,        Shigella flexneri,      Rickettsia   species,   Mycobacterium   marinum,
   Burkholderiaspecies, and Francisellatularensis.
25          Microautophagy involves lysosomes directly engulfing cytoplasm by invagination,
   protrusion, or septation of the lysosomal limiting membrane.
   Chaperone-mediatedautophagy
            Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) concerns only those proteins that have a
   consensus peptide sequence that can be recognized by the binding of a hsc70-containing
30 chaperone/co-chaperone complex. The CMA substrate/chaperone complex then moves to
   the lysosomes, where the CMA receptor lysosome-associated membrane protein type-2a
                                                 - 18 -

   (LAMP-2A) recognizes it. The protein is unfolded and translocated across the lysosome
   membrane assisted by the lysosomal hsc70 on the other side. Thus, CMA substrates are
   translocated across the lysosomal membrane on a one-by-one basis, whereas in
   macroautophagy and microautophagy the substrates are engulfed or sequestered in bulk.
 5 Moreover, CMA degrades only certain proteins and not organelles.
   Exemplary Therapeutic Indicationsfor IncreasedA utophagy
           Compounds, compositions, and methods of the invention can be used to treat and
   prevent any of the following therapeutic indications for increased autophagy.
         Autophagy Protects Organismsfrom Metabolic Stress
10         Nutrient deprivation, growth factor depletion, and hypoxia can induce metabolic
   stress leading to the induction of autophagy and to the generation of free amino acids and
   fatty acids. These can be recycled in a cell-autonomous fashion and be used for 1) de novo
   synthesis of proteins important in the stress response, and 2) fueling the TCA cycle to
   maintain ATP function. The importance of this process is demonstrated in the inability of
15 mice and C. elegans with deficiencies in the ATG proteins important for autophagy to resist
   starvation. Thus, a critical role for autophagy is the mobilization of intracellular energy
   resources to meet cellular and organismal demand for metabolic substrates.
         Induction ofAutophagy for Treatment of the Heart
           Cardiomyocyte function and survival rely critically on the presence of basal levels
20 of cardiomyocyte autophagy.      Autophagic recycling of damaged cellular components in
   nutrient-rich conditions constitutes a major means of protein and organelle quality control,
   ridding the cell of defective (e.g., misfolded or oxidized) proteins and dysfunctional
   organelles. This fact is highlighted by the observation that abrogation of autophagic
   pathways in adult heart by conditional inactivation of either the Atg5 or Atg7 genes triggers
25 rapid-onset cardiac hypertrophy, left ventricular dilation, and diminished cardiac output.
           Danon disease, a condition marked by severe and progressive myopathy, stems from
   defective fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. In early cardiac development, Atg5
   disruption provokes in utero defects and embryonic lethality. At the other end of the age
   spectrum, age-related declines in the efficiency of autophagic clearance likely contribute to
30 progressive accumulation of defective proteins and organelles which ultimately lead to
   functional deterioration over time. Normal aging is associated with loss of cardiac function
                                            - 19 -

   mainly due to impaired relaxation during diastole. Varying formulations of caloric
   restriction (CR) can prolong lifespan and improve LV diastolic function; the underlying
   mechanisms are believed to be the induction of autophagy. Together, these facts highlight
   the vital housekeeping role for cardiomyocyte autophagy as a mechanism of protein and
 5 organelle surveillance and quality control.
          Autophagy Can Improve Skeletal Muscle Function in Setting of MuscularAtrophy
            Skeletal muscle adapts its capacity to levels of load and utilization. A central aspect
   of this adaption is the regulation of fiber remodeling through degeneration or regeneration
   of muscle fibers.
10        In the absence of muscle activity, muscular atrophy occurs, resulting in decreased
   muscular capacity.     This atrophy has been shown to occur due to increased levels of
   oxidative stress in disused muscle. Attenuation of this oxidative stress could lead to
   decreased atrophy.
            The autophagy process, and in particular mitophagy are important in clearing
15 damaged mitochondria and reducing the effects of increased oxidative stress on muscle
   functional capacity. Failure of the autophagy process has been shown to be an important
   contributing factor to muscle disuse atrophy, by failing to remove damaged mitochondria.
   This decrease in mitochondria turnover leads to an accumulation of dysfunctional organs
   and ensuing muscle damage.
20        PreservingAutophagy Function DuringAging Can Improve Sarcopenia
            Skeletal muscle atrophy and impaired muscle strength represent an important health
   issue and may occur as a consequence of immobilization, disuse, injury, starvation, and
   aging. In particular, advanced age is ineluctably accompanied by the loss of muscle mass
   and strength. This condition, known as sarcopenia of aging, has significant effects on
25 individual health and impacts the severity of frailty. Moreover, poor muscular strength is
   highly predictive of disability and mortality, and general weakness often results in the loss
   of independent living, thereby affecting individual quality of life and imposing a high
   burden on healthcare expenditure. Aside from aging, skeletal muscle can undergo
   significant atrophy following disuse.
30          Sarcopenia is characterized by a gradual loss of muscle proteins. The size of stable
   post-mitotic tissues, such as skeletal and cardiac muscles, is regulated by protein turnover,
                                             - 20 -

   and skeletal muscle is influenced by a balance between protein synthesis and degradation
   and the turnover of contractile proteins.     A key factor influencing the development of
   sarcopenia is the imbalance between the rates of protein synthesis and degradation. Protein
   degradation in skeletal muscle cells is essentially mediated by the activity of two highly
 5 conserved pathways:      the autophagic lysosomal pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome
   pathway.
           Recent studies have shown that the impaired autophagy seen in ATG7 null muscles
   is characterized by muscle atrophy, weakness, and features of myofiber degeneration.
   Consequently, autophagy has been found to be essential for myofiber maintenance and for
10 the clearance of damaged proteins and altered organelles.
           Autophagy, which is activated when skeletal muscle is under nutritional stress (such
   as metabolic stress), plays a role in the catabolic condition and in the degradation of
   macromolecules and organelles. Catabolic pathways are accelerated during exercise to
   supply energy and substrates to the muscle for continuation of contractions. It has been well
15 established that the rates of amino acid (relatively small) and glucose oxidation are
   increased during endurance exercise, and increased energy consumption is likely required
   to induce autophagy.       It has been shown that autophagy is required for myofiber
   maintenance and for the clearance of damaged proteins and altered organelles.
           Mild exercise has been shown to improve muscle function and decrease the decline
20 in muscle function observed in sarcopenia. These positive benefits are at least in part due to
   an exercise induced improvement in the autophagy process. In aging mice, the autophagy
   proteins LC3-II, Beclin-1, ATG7, and MuRF-1 significantly decrease with age in muscle.
   However, mice undergoing a training regimen during the aging process show a significantly
   attenuated decrease in these autophagy proteins. In overweight older women, mild exercise
25 has been shown to increase the transcript levels of the autophagy regulators LCB3, Atg7,
   and LAMP-2 and thus improve the autophagy process. Thus, preservation of autophagy
   may play an important role in skeletal myocyte homeostasis and optimal mitochondrial
   turnover in aged muscle.
           An age-related attenuation of autophagy has been shown and results in a diminished
30 efficiency of protein degradation and the clearance of damaged organelles. A decrease in
   proteolytic activity has been considered responsible, at least in part, for the accumulation of
   damaged cellular components in almost all tissues of aging organisms.
                                            - 21 -

         Improving Autophagy as a Therapeutic Targetfor Muscle DegenerativeDiseases
           Muscular     dystrophies  are a    group of genetic,    hereditary   muscle   diseases
   characterized by defects in muscle proteins. These defects result in progressive skeletal
   muscle damage accompanied by myofiber necrosis and chronic local inflammation, leading
 5 to substitution of myofibers by connective and adipose tissue.        In Duchenne muscular
   dystrophy (DMD), the most severe form of these diseases, the continuous and progressive
   skeletal muscle damage leads to complete paralysis and death of patients, usually by
   respiratory and/or cardiac failure.
           The therapeutic protocols currently in use, based on corticosteroid administration,
10 provide some delay in the progression of the disease, but they are associated with severe
   side effects. Therapies that substitute corticosteroids or at least may act as corticosteroid
   sparing drugs are thus being actively pursued, and biological mechanisms relevant to
   skeletal muscle homoeostasis are explored, in order to identify new targets.
           Autophagy is emerging as an important process that limits muscle damage.
15 Inhibition/alteration  of autophagy contributes to myofiber degeneration           leading to
   accumulation of abnormal organelles. Mutations that inactivate Jumpy, a phosphatase that
   counteracts the activation of VPS34 for autophagosome formation and reduces autophagy,
   are associated with a centronuclear myopathy. This observation suggests that unbalanced
   autophagy is pathogenic in muscle degeneration. Likewise, hyperactivation of Akt as a
20 consequence of muscle-specific deletion of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
   leads to inhibition of autophagy and to a muscle phenotype resembling the one observed in
   muscular dystrophy. The validity of autophagy modulation as a therapeutic strategy has
   been shown in a mouse model of Ulrich myopathy characterized by defective autophagy
   and accumulation of dysfunctional organelles.      Forced reactivation of autophagy in these
25 animals yielded a beneficial therapeutic response.
           In vivo and ex vivo analyses have shown that autophagy is defective in both the
   human (DMD) and mouse (mdx) muscular dystrophy and that such defect contributes to the
   pathogenesis of the disease. Muscle biopsies from DMD patients have been shown to have
   significantly lower levels of LC3 II and significant accumulation of p62, a protein known to
30 be incorporated into autophagosomes and efficiently degraded, with respect to tissues from
   control, non-affected individuals.
           A low protein diet has been shown in mice to lead to a prolonged induction of
                                             -22  -

   autophagy. In mice with DMD fed a low protein diet, an induction of autophagy leads to an
   improvement and management in the disease progression.            Significant improvements in
   muscle function have been observed with an improvement of whole body tension, reduced
   muscle fibrosis, decreased collagen disposition, reduced accumulation of damaged
 5 organelles and reduced apoptosis of muscle fibers.
           This demonstrates that induction of autophagy is an important homoeostatic
   mechanism that is disrupted in dystrophic muscles and indicates that novel therapeutic
   approaches aimed at reactivating autophagy can serve as a valuable strategy to reduce
   muscle damage in DMD.
10       Autophagy Protectsthe Liverfrom Oxidative Stress and Disease
           During liver diseases such as cancer and cirrhosis, the liver can undergo tissue
   hypoxia. This process has been shown to induce an autophagy process, which if inhibited
   resulted in increased apoptosis of liver cells.
           In al-antitrypsin deficiency, the most common genetic cause of human liver
15 disease, there is significant chronic inflammation and eventual carcinogenesis. In this
   disease, a point mutation occurs in al-antitrypsin Z (ATZ) leading to improperly folding
   and accumulation of aggregates.         Deletion of ATG5 in hepatic cell lines lead to an
   accumulation of the mutant ATZ protein, demonstrating the important role for autophagy in
   reducing the impact of liver disease.
20       Autophagy Is Importantin Limiting Ischemic Reperfusion Injury
           With advancing age, patients are more likely to acquire primary and secondary
   hepatic malignancies that are amenable to surgical resection and transplantation. Though
   the elderly patients may be treated surgically, the aged liver has significantly decreased
   reparative capacity following ischemia and reperfusion injury associated with these
25 operations.
         Ischemic preconditioning is the only promising strategy for improving the outcome of
   liver surgery, but its beneficial effects are limited to young patients. To date, no therapeutic
   strategy can suppress the age-dependent ischemia and reperfusion injury.
           A reduction in autophagy has been observed in the old cells subjected to a severe
30 stress such as ischemia followed by reperfusion.               Studies have shown that by
   overexpression of autophagy genes in aged livers of mice, autophagy was increased and
                                               -23 -

    hepatocyte cell survival was increased after ischemia and reperfusion.           Consequently,
    defective autophagy has been shown to be a causal mechanism for the age-dependent
    hepatic reperfusion injury and that enhancement of autophagy has been demonstrated to
    offer therapeutic benefit and reducing age-mediated liver ischemia reperfusion injury.
 5        Autophagy in IntestinalEpithelial Cells as a Therapeutic Target
            The intestinal epithelium interfaces directly with a diverse community of bacteria
    that includes benign commensals, opportunistic pathogens, and overt pathogens, and
    consequently is the first line of defense against bacterial invasion of host tissues. One
    means that the epithelial cells employ to defend themselves includes secreting antimicrobial
10  proteins.    Unfortunately, there are some intestinal pathogens, including Salmonella
    tyhpimurium or opportunistically invasive commensal bacteria, such as Enterococcus
   faecalis,which can avoid this first line of defense and enter the epithelial cells.
            Autophagy has been shown to be essential for the recognition and degradation of
    intracellular pathogens, acting as an innate barrier to infection. In cell culture, autophagy
15  has been shown to limit the replication of certain bacterial species.
            It has been shown via genetic studies of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that
    autophagy plays an important role in the intestinal immune homeostasis. IBD is a chronic
    inflammatory disease of the intestine that arises from dysregulated interactions with
    resident microbiota.
20          Recently, it has been shown that polymorphisms in genes in the autophagic pathway
    are linked to Crohn's disease (CD).       Crohn's disease is a chronic form of IBD that can
    affect any part of the gastrointestinal system, but is usually found in the colon or terminal
    ileum. The average onset is at 27 years of age in humans, and is usually present throughout
    the normal lifespan of the individual. It is characterized by severe colitis, strictures, and
25  perianal fistulas, typically requiring surgery.
            The chronic inflammatory process characteristic of CD requires the intensive
    interaction between intestinal epithelial cells and immune competent cells. In CD, there is
    an exaggerated immune response to the intestinal microbiota, characterized by an abnormal
    increase in Thl7 cells, which play a major role in autoimmunity, and a down-regulation of
30  Treg cells important for controlling the immune response.
            It has recently been shown that intestinal epithelial cell autophagy is essential for
                                               - 24 -

   mammalian intestinal defense against invasive bacteria. Autophagy in the epithelial cells
   protects against the dissemination of invasive bacteria. Following oral infection with the
   invasive pathogen Salmonella typhimurium as well as Enterococcus faecalis, mouse
   epithelial cells activate autophagy as a consequence of exposure to these pathogens.
 5 Autophagy was also shown to be critical to limit the extra-intestinal spread of S.
   typhimurium. This indicates that autophagy is a key epithelial cell-autonomous mechanism
   of antibacterial defense that protects against dissemination of intestinal bacteria.
           The present invention provides the know-how to use compounds that include
   urolithins and their precursors as enhancers of autophagy for the administration to and the
10 treatment of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or Crohn's disease (CD)
   and in need of increasing the levels of autophagy in their in the epithelial cells of the
   intestine in order to treat either IBD or CD.
          Autophagy is Importantin Aging CardiacMuscle
           The effects of autophagy induction on improved outcome for ischemic injury and
15 muscle maintenance makes it especially relevant for cardiac muscle maintenance and
   protection from injury.      Cardiac muscle undergoes progressive decline in mitochondrial
   function, similar to that observed in skeletal muscle, resulting in an increase in reactive
   oxygen species, as well as an increase in the accumulation of defective organelles. The
   clearance of these damaged organelles by autophagy is important for the maintenance of
20 cardiac muscle function. As autophagy decreases with age, promoting autophagy can serve
   to protect cardiac muscle function.
           Cardiac muscle is also strongly exposed to ischemic episodes during cardiac
   infarcts.  The level of cardiac muscle damage that these ischemic episodes produce is
   strongly dependent on the ability of the cells to mount an effective autophagy response to
25 clear damaged organelles.       In aged animals, a defective autophagy response leads to an
   increase in cardiac muscle damage after ischemic events. Thus, promotion of autophagy
   during these acute events could serve to protect cardiac muscle from damage.
          Autophagy is Importantin the Inflammatory Process
           Due to the role of autophagy in clearing defective organelles, a defect in this process
30 leads to a buildup of cellular debris and the induction of apoptosis. Autophagy also plays
   an important role in defending the organism against microbial pathogens by inducing their
   degradation. Additionally, autophagy plays an important role in the trafficking events that
                                              - 25 -

   activate innate and adaptive immunity.
           The autophagic removal of apoptotic corpses is critical for preventing danger
   signals that could lead to an inflammation response. In an impaired autophagy response,
   where apoptotic clearance is not efficient the resulting induction of inflammation, could
 5 overcome tolerance to self-antigens leading to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus
   erythematosus.     Thus, induction of autophagy could serve to decrease inflammatory
   responses and the development of autoimmune diseases.
         Applications ofAutophagy for Treatment of Disordersof the Liver
           A number of features of hepatocytes and the liver as a whole make this organ
10 particularly dependent on autophagy.         The liver is rather unique in its regenerative
   properties as while hepatocytes are normally in a quiescent state, they retain the ability to
   quickly enter the cell cycle when there is a loss of liver tissue due to injury or surgical
   removal. The lack of cell turnover makes hepatocytes particularly vulnerable to the effects
   of impaired autophagy, as cells having long lives accumulate high levels of damaged
15 organelles, protein aggregates, etc. that are normally cleared by autophagy. This leads to
   cellular injury and potentially to transformation.
           HepatocellularLipid Metabolism
           The liver serves as the second largest repository of stored lipids in the body after
   adipose tissue. Hepatocytes are a major cellular storehouse for neutral lipids in the form of
20 triglycerides (TGs) and cholesterol esters contained in specialized organelles termed lipid
   droplets (LD). Autophagy mediates the breakdown of intracellular LD stores through the
   process of lipophagy. This enables the hepatocytes to rapidly mobilize their lipid stores in
   times of metabolic need. The loss of hepatocyte autophagy leads to a marked increase in
   hepatic TG and cholesterol content, indicating that lipophagy limits lipid accumulation by
25 the liver in vivo. Also, lipophagy controls cellular energy homeostasis by providing free
   fatty acids (FFA) from the breakdown of TGs, which subsequently drives mitochondrial 0
   oxidation and cellular ATP generation. It has been shown that the autophagosomal protein
   LC3, critical for autophagosome membrane formation, associates with LDs.
           Autophagy ProtectsAgainst Hepatic Diseases
30          SERPINA1/al-anti-trypsin deficiency (ATD) is the most common genetic cause of
   human liver disease in children.         This disease is caused by homozygosity for the
                                              -26-

   SERPINA1/al-antitrypsin Z allele SERPINAl-Z, a point mutation, which renders the
   hepatic secretory glycoprotein SERPINAl         prone to misfolding, polymerization, and
   aggregation. The mutant SERPINAl-Z protein accumulates in hepatocytes and the levels
   of SERPINAl found in the blood and body fluids are reduced to 10-15% of those normally
 5 observed. Accumulation of mutant SERPINAl-Z in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of
   hepatocytes leads to liver damage by a gain-of-function.           It has been shown that
   intracellular degradation of SERPINAl-Z aggregates and polymers involves the autophagic
   pathway.
            The drug carbamazepine, known to induce autophagy, was recently shown to be
10 effective in cell based and mouse model of ATD.       Carbamazepine increases autophagic
   degradation of SERPINAl-Z in cultured cells and when provided orally to the PiZ mouse
   model of ATD, it reduced the hepatic load of SERPINAl-Z.              Additionally, inducing
   autophagy reduced hepatic fibrosis. Consequently, drugs enhancing autophagy are
   attractive candidates for improving the liver disease that develops in some patients with
15 ATD.
            The present invention provides the know-how to use compounds that include
   urolithins and their precursors as enhancers of autophagy for the treatment of individuals
   with ATD and in need of increasing the levels of autophagy in their liver and hepatocytes in
   order to reduce liver toxicity.
20          Autophagy ProtectsAgainst NonalcoholicFatty Liver Disease
            Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an important component of the
   metabolic syndrome together with obesity and diabetes. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum
   of hepatic abnormalities that range from simple fatty liver or steatosis, to fatty liver with
   hepatocellular injury and inflammation, which is known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
25 (NASH).     NAFLD is now the most prevalent liver disease in the USA and accounts for
   about 75% of all chronic liver diseases.
            The most important role of autophagy in fatty liver disease could be to regulate the
   process of excessive lipid accumulation. In fact, mice with a hepatocyte-specific knockout
   of Atg7, a protein required for autophagy, consuming a high-fat diet led to a marked
30 increase in liver TGs and cholesterol content, showing that autophagy defects can induce
   hepatic steatosis. When considering NASH, while its exact causes are unknown, free fatty
   acid (FFA)-induced lipotoxicity has been implicated in the mechanisms of hepatocellular
                                            - 27 -

   injury of this disease. Evidence points to the fact that hepatocyte autophagy renders the
   cells more resistant to injury from FFA.
           Autophagy is an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of
   both NAFLD and NASH. Therapeutic intervention to increase autophagy may reverse not
 5 only the hepatic manifestations of NAFLD, including hepatocellular steatosis and injury,
   but also some of the underlying metabolic abnormalities of the disease via its effects on
   insulin resistance. Additionally, treatment by increasing autophagy may prevent common
   end-stage complications of NAFLD, such as hepatocellular carcinoma.
           The present invention provides the know-how to use compounds that include
10 urolithins and their precursors as enhancers of autophagy for the treatment of individuals
   with NAFLD and in need of increasing the levels of autophagy in their liver and
   hepatocytes in order to treat these conditions.
           Autophagy ProtectsAgainst Alcoholic Liver Disease
           Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of chronic liver disease, and like
15 NAFLD, has a wide spectrum of pathogenic features, that range from steatosis to sever
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
           Autophagy has been shown to play a role in treating ALD. For example, induction
   of autophagy by administration of rapamycin significantly suppresses acute alcohol
   induced steatosis. Also, a common feature of chronic alcohol abuse is the formation of
20 hepatic protein aggregates known as Mallory-Denk bodies, which are cytosolic inclusion
   bodies enriched with Krt8/keratin 8 and Krt18 and proteins that include ubiquitin.
   Rapamycin treatment significantly reduces the number of Mallory-Denk bodies in
   proteasome inhibitor-treated KRT8 transgenic mice.
           Consequently, enhancing hepatic autophagy is an attractive target for improving
25 alcohol-induced liver disease.       The present invention provides the know-how to use
   compounds that include urolithins and their precursors as enhancers of autophagy for the
   treatment of individuals with ALD and in need of increasing the levels of autophagy in their
   liver and hepatocytes in order to treat this condition.
           Autophagy ProtectsAgainst Drug-InducedLiver Injury
30         Most drugs are metabolized and detoxified in the liver, making the liver the
   principal target for drug damage.       Liver injury due to drugs is a common cause for the
                                               -28-

   withdrawal of approved drugs on the market, and it is thought that drug-induced
   hepatotoxicity is responsible for more than half of acute cases of liver failure.
   Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol and N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP), is a
   widely used antipyretic and analgesic drug and is also the most common source of severe
 5 drug-induced hepatotoxicity. At therapeutic levels APAP is safe, but overdosing leads to
   toxicity mainly due to its reactive metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI).
   NAPQI can deplete hepatic stores of glutathione (GSH), an intracellular antioxidant.
   Following the depletion of GSH, NAPQI is known to react with cellular proteins as well as
   mitochondrial proteins to form protein adducts.        These APAP-induced mitochondrial
10 protein adducts can then lead to mitochondrial damage and subsequent necrosis.
           When autophagy is enhanced with rapamycin, APAP-induced necrosis is
   significantly inhibited, both in cultured primary hepatocytes and in the livers of mice.
   Treatment with rapamycin two hours after APAP administration has been seen to
   significantly improve APAP-induced liver injury, even though APAP metabolism and
15 hepatic GSH depletion have already occurred. This is particularly important as patients at
   risk for hepatotoxicity from an acute APAP overdose do not receive medical care until they
   are past the metabolic phase.       Consequently, pharmacologic intervention targeting an
   enhancement of autophagy holds a potential therapeutic benefit for individuals with a risk
   of APAP hepatotoxicity following an overdose.
20         The present invention provides the know how-to use compounds that include
   urolithins and their precursors as enhancers of autophagy for the treatment of individuals at
   risk of hepatotoxicity due to drug side effects and in need of increasing the levels of
   autophagy in their liver and hepatocytes in order to treat or prevent the potential drug
   toxicity.
25       Autophagy is Importantin Limiting Ischemia/ReperfusionInjury
           Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a causal factor contributing to morbidity and
   mortality. The vulnerability of the liver to I/R injury is a major obstacle to liver resection
   and transplantation surgery where reperfusion after sustained ischemia is unavoidable
   during hepatectomy and vascular reconstruction. Mitochondrial dysfunction is known to be
30 one of the critical downstream events that lead to I/R-mediated cell death.
           Autophagy clears abnormal or dysfunctional mitochondria to ensure an optimal
   cellular function and survival. With impaired or insufficient mitophagy, cells accumulate
                                            - 29 -

   damaged mitochondria, which subsequently leads to uncontrolled ROS formation,
   mitochondrial DNA mutation, energetic failure, and ultimately cell death. Consequently,
   the failure of mitophagy to remove a small number of damaged mitochondria during I/R
   can have a significant impact on hepatocellular function and viability.         Mitophagy is
 5 essential for hepatic function and survival following I/R injury.
           While minimizing I/R injury plays an important role in the outcome of transplanted
   young livers, aged livers are even more susceptible to negative impact of I/R injury. In the
   case of aged livers, hepatocytes fail to respond to the I/R stress and upregulate their
   endogenous protective autophagy response. Similar to young livers following prolonged
10 ischemia, aged livers after short-term ischemia accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria,
   undergo mitochondrial permeability transition, and lose their viability soon after
   reperfusion.
           Methods of enhancing autophagy, including pre-ischemia nutrient depletion and
   over expression of pro-autophagy genes ATG7 or BECN1, lead to the suppression of the
15 mitochondrial     permeability transition and increases      hepatocyte survival following
   reperfusion.
           This indicates that treatments with agents that induce autophagy in the liver will
   offer protection during a situation of I/R and help to minimize cellular injury.          Such
   treatments are applicable in situations of the transplantation of both young and aged livers.
20 Treatments may involve: (i) pre-treatments of the liver tissue ex vivo by perfusion of the
   liver with a solution that contains an inducer of autophagy; (ii) treatment of the liver donor
   with an autophagy inducer; or (iii) treatment of the liver recipient prior to, during the
   operation and/or immediately after the surgical intervention.      Of course, these treatment
   modalities may be applied individually or in any combination (for example: 1 and 2; 2 and
25 3; 1 and 3; 1, 2, and 3).
           The present invention provides the know-how to use compounds that include
   urolithins and their precursors as enhancers of autophagy for the treatment of individuals
   and their livers, that may be at risk of I/R injury. These compounds may be provided orally
   or parenterally to the donor or recipient, or provided in a preconditioning solution that may
30 be applied to the resected liver tissue.
         Autophagy and Osteoarthritis
           Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common aging-related joint pathology and is
                                               -30 -

   characterized by degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) and reduced cartilage
   cellularity.  Changes in the articular cartilage appear to be critical in OA initiation and
   progression. Chondrocytes are the only cell population of adult articular cartilage. The
   capacity of the adult articular chondrocytes to regenerate the normal cartilage matrix
 5 architecture is limited and declines with aging, due to cell death and abnormal
   responsiveness to anabolic stimuli. Articular cartilage is characterized by a very low rate of
   cell turnover and it has been shown that autophagy play an important role in chondrocyte
   cellular function and survival. In fact, autophagy is a constitutively active and protective
   process for the maintenance of cartilage homeostasis. Studies have shown both in joint
10 aging and OA in humans and in mice that there is a reduction in the expression of
   autophagy regulators, which was accompanied by an increase in chondrocyte apoptosis.
   Compromised autophagy is thought to contribute to the development of OA. It has been
   shown that treatment with the compound rapamycin, a known inducer of autophagy, has
   been able to increase activation of LC3 in cartilage in an animal model of OA and
15 consequently reduce the severity of articular cartilage degradation. In the present invention,
   urolithins and their precursors have been shown to increase the levels of autophagy in
   tissues following oral consumption, making them ideal candidates for the treatment and
   reduction of the severity of osteoarthritis in young and aging humans and mammals.
         Metabolic Syndrome, Diabetes, and Obesity
20          Compounds and methods of the invention are useful in the treatment and prevention
   of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. As used herein, the term
   "metabolic syndrome" refers to a combination of medical disorders that, when occurring
   together, increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It affects one
   in five people in the United States and prevalence increases with age. Some studies have
25 shown the prevalence in the United States to be an estimated 25% of the population. In
   accordance with the International Diabetes Foundation consensus worldwide definition
   (2006), metabolic syndrome is central obesity plus any two of the following:
        * Raised triglycerides: > 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), or specific treatment for this lipid
        abnormality;
30      - Reduced HDL cholesterol: < 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) in males, < 50 mg/dL
        (1.29 mmol/L) in females, or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality;
                                              -31  -

        * Raised blood pressure: systolic BP > 130 or diastolic BP >85 mm Hg, or treatment
        of previously diagnosed hypertension; and
        * Raised fasting plasma glucose: (FPG)>100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), or previously
        diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
 5       Autophagy and NeurodegenerativeDiseases
           In   neurodegenerative     diseases,   brain tissue  accumulates    autophagosomes,
   demonstrating an increase in autophagy, which in model organisms has been shown to have
   a protective effect.   It plays an important role in clearing the misfolded proteins that
   accumulate as a result of several neurodegenerative diseases. These include proteins that
10 have polyQ repeats as seen as in Huntington's diseases and spinocerebellar ataxia, mutant
   a-synucleins involved in Parkinson's as well as tau aggregates.
           Knockdown of ATG genes important in autophagy in C. elegans resulted in
   increased aggregate formation and toxicity of PolyQ proteins. In Alzheimer's disease the
   autophagy process is impaired as a result of a defect in autophagosomal maturation that
15 could be an important reason for aggregate accumulation. By contrast, autophagy induction
   by rapamycin in both Drosophila and mouse models of polyQ disease protected these
   animals from neurotoxicity. These results demonstrate that autophagy induction can have a
   protective role in neuronal cells against neurodegeneration.
           The development of neurodegenerative diseases in patients implies that autophagy
20 can reach a saturation point in which the ability to degrade mutant protein aggregates is
   exceeded.     Thus, promotion of autophagy could help in delaying the onset of
   neurodegeneration disease.
         Cognitive Disorder
           Compounds and methods of the invention are useful for treating a cognitive
25 disorder. As used herein, a cognitive disorder refers to any condition that impairs cognitive
   function. In one embodiment, "cognitive disorder" refers to any one or more of delirium,
   dementia, learning disorder, attention deficit disorder (ADD),         and attention deficit
   hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).      In one embodiment, the cognitive disorder is a learning
   disorder. In one embodiment, the cognitive disorder is attention deficit disorder (ADD). In
30 one embodiment, the cognitive disorder is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
           Compounds and methods of the invention are useful for improving cognitive
   function, even in the absence of a cognitive disorder. As used herein, "cognitive function"
                                              - 32 -

   refers to any mental process that involves symbolic operations, e.g., perception, memory,
   attention, speech comprehension, speech generation, reading comprehension, creation of
   imagery, learning, and reasoning. In one embodiment, "cognitive function" refers to any
   one or more of perception, memory, attention, and reasoning.              In one embodiment,
 5 "cognitive function" refers to memory.
            Methods for measuring cognitive function are well known and can include, for
   example, individual or battery tests for any aspect of cognitive function. One such test is
   the Prudhoe Cognitive Function Test.        Margallo-Lana et al. (2003) J Intellect Disability
   Res. 47:488-492.     Another such test is the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), which is
10 designed to assess orientation to time and place, registration, attention and calculation,
   recall, language use and comprehension, repetition, and complex commands. Folstein et al.
   (1975) J Psych Res. 12:189-198.        Other tests useful for measuring cognitive function
   include the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) (Rosen et al.
   (1984) Am J Psychiatry. 141(11):1356-64) and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test
15 Automated Battery (CANTAB) (Robbins et al. (1994) Dementia. 5(5):266-81). Such tests
   can be used to assess cognitive function in an objective manner, so that changes in
   cognitive function, for example in response to treatment in accordance with methods of the
   invention, can be measured and compared.
          ProteinMisfolding and Aggregation
20          These diseases and disorders, which are collectively referred to herein as "amyloid
   related diseases", fall into two main categories: (a) those which affect the brain and other
   parts of the central nervous system; and (b) those which affect other organs or tissues
   around the body.
            Examples of amyloid-related diseases which fall under these two categories are
25 listed in the following two sections; however, many other examples of rare, hereditary
   amyloid-related diseases are known which are not included here, and additional forms of
   amyloid-related disease are likely to be discovered in future.
            NeurodegenerativeDiseasesAssociated with Amyloidosis
            Many different neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the misfolding and
30 aggregation of a specific protein or peptide in a particular part of the brain, or elsewhere in
   the central nervous system, depending on the specific disease. Examples of such diseases
   follow.
                                             - 33 -

           Various forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as Down's syndrome, hereditary
   cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (HCHWA, Dutch type), cerebral amyloid
   angiopathy, and possibly also mild cognitive impairment and other forms of dementia are
   associated with the aggregation of a 40/42-residue peptide called 0-amyloid, AP(1-40) or
 5 A(1-42), which forms insoluble amyloid fibers and plaques in the cerebral cortex,
   hippocampus or elsewhere in the brain, depending on the specific disease. Alzheimer's
   disease is also associated with the formation of neurofibrillary tangles by aggregation of a
   hyperphosphorylated protein called tau, which also occurs in frontotemporal dementia
   (Pick's disease).
10         Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system
   atrophy (MSA) are associated with the aggregation of a protein called a-synuclein, which
   results in the formation of insoluble inclusions called Lewy bodies. Huntington's disease
   (HD), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, also known as Kennedy's disease),
   dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), different forms of spinocerebellar ataxia
15 (SCA, types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), and possibly several other inheritable neurodegenerative
   diseases are associated with the aggregation of various proteins and peptides that contain
   abnormally expanded glutamine repeats (extended tracts of polyglutamine). Creutzfeldt
   Jakob disease (CJD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cows, scrapie in sheep,
   kuru, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS), fatal familial insomnia, and possibly
20 all other forms of transmissible encephalopathy are associated with the self-propagating
   misfolding and aggregation of prion proteins.
           Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and possibly also some other forms of motor
   neuron disease (MND) are associated with the aggregation of a protein called superoxide
   dismutase.
25         Familial British dementia (FBD) and familial Danish dementia (FDD), respectively,
   are associated with aggregation of the ABri and ADan peptide sequences derived from the
   BRI protein.
           Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (HCHWA, Icelandic type) is
   associated with the aggregation of a protein called cystatin C.
30         Systemic DiseasesAssociated with Amyloidosis
           In addition to the neurodegenerative diseases listed above, a wide variety of
   systemic ageing-related or degenerative diseases are associated with the misfolding and
                                             - 34 -

   aggregation of a particular protein or peptide in various other tissues around the body (i.e.,
   outside of the brain). Examples of such diseases follow.
           Type II diabetes mellitus (also known as adult-onset diabetes, or non-insulin
   dependent diabetes mellitus) is associated with the aggregation of a 37-residue peptide
 5 called the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, or "amylin"), which forms insoluble deposits
   that are associated with the progressive destruction of insulin-producing 0 cells in the islets
   of Langerhans within the pancreas.
           Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) and prostatic amyloid are associated with the
   aggregation of a protein called    2 -microglobulin, either in bones, joints and tendons in
10 DRA, which develops during prolonged periods of hemodialysis, or within the prostate in
   the case of prostatic amyloid.
           Primary systemic amyloidosis, systemic AL amyloidosis and myeloma-associated
   amyloidosis are associated with the aggregation of immunoglobulin light chain (or in some
   cases immunoglobulin heavy chain) into insoluble amyloid deposits, which gradually
15 accumulate in various major organs such as the liver, kidneys, heart and gastrointestinal
   (GI) tract.
           Reactive systemic AA amyloidosis, secondary systemic amyloidosis, familial
   Mediterranean fever, and chronic inflammatory disease are associated with the aggregation
   of serum amyloid A protein, which forms insoluble amyloid deposits that accumulate in
20 major organs such as the liver, kidneys and splee. Senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA),
   familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC) are
   associated with the misfolding and aggregation of different mutants of transthyretin protein
   (TTR), which form insoluble inclusions in various organs and tissues such as the heart
   (especially in FAC), peripheral nerves (especially in FAP) and gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
25 Another form of familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP, type II) is associated with the
   aggregation of apolipoprotein Al in the peripheral nerves. Familial visceral amyloidosis
   and hereditary non-neuropathic systemic amyloidosis are associated with misfolding and
   aggregation of various mutants of lysozyme, which form insoluble deposits in major organs
   such as the liver, kidneys and spleen.
30         Finnish hereditary systemic amyloidosis is associated with aggregation of a protein
   called gelsolin in the eyes (particularly in the cornea).

            Fibrinogen a-chain amyloidosis is associated with aggregation of the fibrinogen A
   a- chain, which forms insoluble amyloid deposits in various organs, such as the liver and
   kidneys.
            Insulin-related amyloidosis occurs by the aggregation of insulin at the site of
 5 injection in diabetics.
            Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is associated with the aggregation of calcitonin
   in surrounding tissues.
            Isolated atrial amyloidosis is associated with the aggregation of atrial natriuretic
   peptide (ANP) in the heart.
10          Various forms of cataract are associated with the aggregation of y-crystallin proteins
   in the lens of the eyes.
         Autophagy and EndothelialCell Function and Associated Diseases
            Endothelialcell dysfunction
            Global endothelial cell dysfunction occurs in several diverse diseases such as
15 diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and atherosclerosis.          In these diseases
   endothelial cell dysfunction is thought to occur as a result of stress-induced premature
   senencense (SIPS).         SIPS is characterized by subverted autophagy and lysosomal
   dysfunction, with the accumulation of autolysosomal vacuoles.
            Endothelial cell dysfunction also occurs as a result of aging with an increased
20 incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This increase in cell dysfunction correlates with a
   decrease in autophagy.       In older humans, expression of autophagy markers in arterial
   endothelial cells was impaired by 50% (P <0.05) and was associated with a 30% (P <0.05)
   reduction in arterial endothelium-dependent dilatation (EDD).           Similarly, in C57BL/6
   control mice aging was associated with a 40% decrease (P <0.05) in arterial markers of
25 autophagy and a 25% reduction (P <0.05) in EDD, demonstrating that impaired autophagy
   is a cause of age-related arterial dysfunction.
            In old mice, treatment with the autophagy-enhancing agent trehalose restored
   expression of autophagy markers, rescued NO-mediated EDD by reducing oxidative stress,
   and normalized inflammatory cytokine expression.           The present invention provides the
30 know-how to use compounds that include urolithins and their precursors as enhancers of
   autophagy for the treatment of individuals having health conditions linked to endothelial
                                               - 36 -

   cell dysfunction and in need thereof.
           Endothelialcell injury
           Endothelial cell injury can occur as a result of disease processes such as sickle cell
   anemia or thalassemia in which pathologically high levels of heme and iron release can
 5 occur. Severe skeletal muscle damage, as well as cardiac ischemia injury results in the
   release of the heme protein, myoglobin, which also results in endothelial cell injury. This
   damage to the vascular endothelial cells can lead to vascular dysfunction and an increase in
   cardiovascular complications. Endothelial cell injury caused by heme toxicity is associated
   with a progressive decrease in endothelial cell mitochondrial membrane potential, leading
10 to apoptosis.
           Micro- and macro-vascular complications are commonly seen in diabetic patients,
   and endothelial dysfunction contributes to the development and progression of the
   complications.    Abnormal functions in endothelial cells lead to the increase in vascular
   tension and atherosclerosis, followed by systemic hypertension as well as increased
15 incidence of ischemia and stroke in diabetic patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction appears to
   be central to the vascular endothelial dysfunction. Enhanced mitochondrial fission and/or
   attenuated fusion leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and disruption of the endothelial
   physiological    function.     Abnormal mitochondrial        biogenesis and disturbance     of
   mitochondrial autophagy increase the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, such as
20 irreversibly depolarized or leaky mitochondria, and facilitate cell death.        Augmented
   mitochondrial ROS production and Ca 2 - overload in mitochondria not only cause the
   maladaptive effect on the endothelial function, but also are potentially detrimental to cell
   survival.
           Endothelial cell injury can also result from cardiac procedures such as angioplasty,
25 bypass surgery, and valve replacement.         Upregulation of autophagy should lead to a
   reduction in the injury to the associated endothelial cells.
           Strategies that increase autophagy would have clear therapeutic potential.        The
   present invention provides the know-how to use compounds that include urolithins and their
   precursors as enhancers of autophagy for the treatment of individuals having health
30 conditions linked to endothelial cell injury resulting from disease processes such as
   diabetes, sickle cell anemia, or thalassemia, as well as protecting endothelial cells from the
   more acute effects of severe muscle injury.

         Autophagy and Cancer
           Autophagy and cancer have similar regulatory pathways, with several tumor
   suppression genes such as PTEN, TSCI and TSC2 leading to the upstream inhibition of
   TOR signaling, leading to the stimulation of autophagy.        Additionally, the autophagy
 5 protein, Beclin1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor deleted in many human cancers.
   These results demonstrate that autophagy plays an important role in tumor suppression.
         Aging
           By far the greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's
   disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is aging.
10 Mitochondria have been thought to contribute to aging through the accumulation of
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and net production of reactive oxygen species
   (ROS).     Although most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome,
   mitochondria contain many copies of their own DNA.            Human mtDNA is a circular
   molecule of 16,569 base pairs that encodes 13 polypeptide components of the respiratory
15 chain, as well as the rRNAs and tRNAs necessary to support intramitochondrial protein
   synthesis using its own genetic code. Inherited mutations in mtDNA are known to cause a
   variety of diseases, most of which affect the brain and muscles -- tissues with high energy
   requirements.   It has been hypothesized that somatic mtDNA mutations acquired during
   aging contribute to the physiological decline that occurs with aging and aging-related
20 neurodegeneration.    It is well established that mtDNA accumulates mutations with aging,
   especially large-scale deletions and point mutations. In the mtDNA control region, point
   mutations at specific sites can accumulate to high levels in certain tissues:     T414G in
   cultured fibroblasts, A189G and T408A in muscle, and C150T in white blood cells.
   However, these control-region "hot spots" have not been observed in the brain.        Point
25 mutations at individual nucleotides seem to occur at low levels in the brain, although the
   overall level may be high. Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-cloning-sequencing
   strategy, it was found that the average level of point mutations in two protein-coding
   regions of brain mtDNA from elderly subjects was ~2 mutations per 10 kb. Noncoding
   regions, which may be under less selection pressure, potentially accumulate between twice
30 and four times as many. The accumulation of these deletions and point mutations with
   aging correlates with decline in mitochondrial function.          For example, a negative
   correlation has been found between brain cytochrome oxidase activity and increased point
   mutation levels in a cytochrome oxidase gene (CO1).
                                              - 38 -

            Net production of ROS is another important mechanism by which mitochondria are
   thought to contribute to aging. Mitochondria contain multiple electron carriers capable of
   producing ROS, as well as an extensive network of antioxidant defenses. Mitochondrial
   insults, including oxidative damage itself, can cause an imbalance between ROS production
 5 and removal, resulting in net ROS production.             The importance to aging of net
   mitochondrial ROS production is supported by observations that enhancing mitochondrial
   antioxidant defenses can increase longevity.          In Drosophila, overexpression of the
   mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and
   methionine sulfoxide reductase prolongs lifespan. This strategy is most successful in short
10 lived strains of Drosophila, and has no effect in already long-lived strains. However, it has
   recently   been    shown that     overexpression   of catalase   experimentally  targeted to
   mitochondria increased lifespan in an already long-lived mouse strain.
         Improving Activity DuringAging
            Activity in animals is driven largely by circadian rhythm and is synchronized to the
15 environment.      Disruption of the circadian rhythm or a desynchronization with the
   environment can lead to increase in nighttime wakefulness or daytime naps.
            Normal aging is accompanied by declining locomotor activity, altered circadian
   rhythms, as well as altered sleep and food intake patterns. These effects lead to a decrease
   in alertness and vigilance decreases in the elderly, leading to an increase in nighttime
20 wakefulness, as well as an increase in daytime naps. Activity patterns can also be disrupted
   in a similar way by disease, such as Alzheimer's Disease.
            Age-dependent changes in activity rhythms are also observed in other animals, for
   example, rats, hamsters, mice and dogs, with an increase in fragmentation and a decrease in
   synchronization with the environment.        These age-dependent circadian disruptions have
25 been linked to the degeneration of the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Sleep
   disruption in both humans and rodents have been shown to contribute to age-dependent
   cognitive dysfunction.
            The increasing disruption of circadian rhythms is accompanied by a gradual decline
   in motor activity with age in several species, including humans, mice, monkeys, and dogs.
30 Of particular note, the daytime activity of senior dogs (>10 years of age) declines as
   compared to young and middle-aged dogs. These changes in activity can be monitored by
   devices intended to measure activity, for example, by means of an accelerometer or by
                                              - 39 -

   employing motion sensing cameras.
           Many of the disruptions seen in aging as a result of decreased activity are also
   observed in younger populations where cultural trends have resulted in decreased activity,
   accompanied with increased caloric intake, leading to an obesity epidemic. The resulting
 5 caloric imbalance has led to an increase in several disease conditions such as type 2
   diabetes, colon cancer, and metabolic syndrome, as well as mental health issues. Several
   prospective cohort studies and meta-analysis in humans have shown that physical inactivity
   is associated with an elevated risk for the development of metabolic syndrome, type 2
   diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, and cardiovascular disease.
10         Both humans and animals, particularly dogs, would benefit from the present
   invention and its ability to improve activity both during the youth and aging periods of life.
           In one embodiment, the urolithin or precursor would increase activity of the
   recipient, human or animal.      In yet another embodiment, the increase in activity is an
   increase by 1% to 100%. For example, the activity may be increased by 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%,
15 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, or 10%. In certain embodiments, the increase in activity is an
   increase of 5-10%, 10-150%, 15-20%, 20-250%, 25-300%, 30-350%, 35-40%, 40-450%, 45-50%,
   50-55%, 55-60%, 60-65%, 65-70%, 70-75%, 75-80%, 80-85%, 85-90%, 90-95%, and 95
   100%.
           In one embodiment, treatment by urolithin or a precursor thereof would increase
20 activity and lead to a reduction in risk of metabolic syndrome.          In one embodiment,
   treatment by urolithin or a precursor thereof would increase activity and lead to a reduction
   in risk of type 2 diabetes. In one embodiment, treatment by urolithin or a precursor thereof
   would increase activity and lead to a reduction in risk of hypertension, coronary artery
   disease, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. In one embodiment, treatment by urolithin or a
25 precursor thereof would increase activity and improve cognitive function.

15         In one embodiment, a urolithin precursor is punicalagin (PA). In one embodiment, a
   urolithin precursor is punicalin (PB). See, for example, Figure 2. In one embodiment, a
   urolithin precursor is ellagic acid (EA). In one embodiment, a urolithin precursor is
   provided as an isolated urolithin precursor, e.g., isolated from a natural food source or
   prepared by total synthesis. Isolated urolithin precursors are usually purified from natural
20 sources or synthesized de novo; some urolithin precursors, including EA, are commercially
   available from suppliers, such as Sigma Aldrich.
           Also in accordance with the invention, precursors of urolithins also include natural
   foods containing ellagitannins and ellagic acid, especially natural foods that are rich in
   ellagitannins, ellagic acid, or both ellagitannins and ellagic acid. Such foods include
25 without limitation certain berries, grapes, pomegranates, rose hips, and nuts. In one
   embodiment, the natural food is pomegranate.
           Additionally, precursors of urolithins include processed foods and drinks prepared
   from such natural foods. The processed food can take any form, including, for example,
   jams, jellies, preserves, pastes, spreads, juices, wines, extracts, concentrates, and the like. In
30 one embodiment, the processed food is pomegranate juice.

10          In one embodiment, the urolithin precursor is an ellagitannin.
            In one embodiment, the ellagitannin is selected from the group consisting of
   castalagin, castalin, casuarictin, chebulagic acid, chebulinic acid, gemin D, grandinin,
   pedunculagin, punicalagin, punicalin, roburin A, strictinin, tellimagrandin I, tellimagrandin
   II, terflavin A, terflavin B, tergallagin, Lambertianin C, Sanguiin H-6, Sanguiin H-10, and
15 vescalagin.
   Ellagitannins
            Among the more than 500 hydrolysable tannins hitherto characterized, ellagitannins,
   which produce ellagic acid upon hydrolysis, constitute the largest group; the remaining
   group is gallotannins (galloylglucoses).         The ellagitannins include: (1) monomeric
20 ellagitannins,   (2) C-glycosidic ellagitannins with an open-chain glucose core, (3)
   condensates of C-glycosidic tannins with flavan-3-ol (complex tannin), (4) oligomers which
   are produced through intermolecular C-O or C-C bonds between monomers, and (5) other
   ellagitannins. Unlike the condensed tannins that are widespread throughout the plant
   kingdom, ellagitannins have been found only in dicotyledoneous angiosperms. Among the
25 plant families rich in ellagitannins are the Myrtaceae, Lythraceae, Onagraceae,
   Melastomataceae, and Combretaceae. These families belong to the order Myrtales
   according to the plant classification systems of New Engler, Cronquist, and APGII
   (angiosperm phylogeny group).
            Ellagitannins are characterized by the presence of one or more
30 hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) unit(s) on a glucopyranose core. The HHDP group is
   biosynthetically formed through intramolecular, oxidative C-C bond formation between
                                              - 89 -

  neighboring galloyl groups in galloylglucoses. They are easily hydrolyzed, either
  enzymatically or with acid, to liberate a stable ellagic acid as the dilactone form of
  hexahydroxydiphenoic acid. In addition to the HHDP group, other constituent acyl units in
  ellagitannins include a galloyl group and HHDP metabolites such as valoneoyl,
5 dehydrohexahydroxydiphenoyl (DHHDP), and chebuloyl groups. Referring to Table 2,
  variations in the number and position of these acyl units on the glucose core provide a
  variety of analogs such as tellimagrandin I (1), and 11 (2), pedunculagin (6), casuarictin (7),
  chebulagic acid (14), and chebulinic acid (15).

           C-Glycosidic ellagitannins have been found in many plant families, including
  Lythraceae, Myrtaceae, Combretaceae, Melastomataceae, and Punicaceae, as well as
  Fagaceae,Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae,Rosaceae, Theaceae, and Elaeagnaceae.They are
5 categorized into two types: castalagin-type, which contain a flavogalloyl unit participating
  in the C-glucosidic linkage, such as castalagin (16) and its C-I epimer, vescalagin (18), and
  casuarinin-type, which contain an HHDP unit, such as casuarinin (20) and stachyurin (21).

   condensed structure of C-glycosidic tannins (vescalagin-type or stachyurin-type) with
   flavan-3-ol (catechin or epicatechin). Unlike the C-glycosidic tannins, these tannins have
 5 been found in a rather limited number of plant species belonging to the Combretaceae,
   Myrtaceae, Melastomataceae, Fagaceae, and Theaceae families. Table 6 presents a

           Oligomeric ellagitannins are common among many plant families, including the
   Fagaceae, Rosaceae, Coriariaceae, Onagraceae, Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae, and
10 Lythraceae. This class of tannins is divided into three sub-groups based on structural
   features: (1) oligomers that contain a valoneoyl group or its equivalent, formed by
   intermolecular C-O bonds between an HHDP group and a galloyl group of a neighboring
   monomer; (2) macrocyclic oligomers formed by two C-O bonds; and (3) C-glycosidic
   tannin oligomers produced by intermolecular C-C bond formation between C-1 of one
15 monomer and the aromatic ring of another. Table 7 presents a representative list of
   oligomeric ellagitannins.

            Unfortunately, for the most part ellagitannins are poorly absorbed by the human gut.
   However, a number of metabolites derived from ellagitannins are absorbed by the human
   gut,   including certain    metabolites    ultimately   formed in    the gut by     commensal
 5 microorganisms (i.e., intestinal microflora).
            Ellagitannins release ellagic acid under physiological conditions in vivo, and ellagic
   acid is then gradually metabolized by the gut microflora in the intestine to produce urolithin
   A (UA), urolithin B, urolithin C, and urolithin D. Once the metabolites are absorbed, they
   are further metabolized to produce urolithin glucuronides and/or sulfates, to give a
10 combination of metabolites secreted in the bile.
            Ellagic acid is normally found in relatively low amounts in plant tissues. Ellagic
   acid is thought to be derived from ellagitannins, which when broken down form
   hexahydroxydiphenic acid, which spontaneously converts to ellagic acid. Some additional
   sources of ellagic acid are shown in Table 10.

           Pomegranate (Punicagranatum) fruits are ancient medicinal foods which have been
   used for centuries in folk medicine. They are consumed fresh and as juice, which is an
   excellent source of ellagitannins and ellagic acid. Ellagitannins in pomegranate fruit husk
   and juice include punicalin, punicalagin, corilagin, casuarinin, terminalin/gallagyldilacton,
 5 pedunculagin, tellimagrandin, granatin A, and granatin B. Other parts of the pomegranate
   plant contain additional ellagitannins, including punicafolin, punicacortein A, punicacortein
   B, punicacortein C, punicacortein D, and punigluconin. Commercial juices contain
   gallagyl-type ellagitannins, including punicalagin isomers (1500-1900 mg/L), undefined
   hydrolyzable tannins (400-500 mg/L), and ellagic acid and its glycosides (120-260 mg/L).
10 Gil et al. (2000) J. Agric. Food Chem. 48:4581-4589. Punicalagins, ellagitannins in which
   gallagic and ellagic acids are linked to a glucose molecule, are abundant in pomegranate
   peel. Punicalagin isomers and ellagic acid derivatives are not present in the aril juice, but
   during industrial juice processing they are extracted from the husk and membrane
   surrounding the arils and released in large quantities into the juice.
15         Urolithins are metabolites of ellagic acid, punicalagin (PA), punicalin (PB),
   tellimagrandin (TL), and other ellagitannins. Ellagic acid (EA) is abundant in pomegranate
   juice. Gil et al. (2000) J. Agric. Food Chem. 48:4581-4589. The ellagitannin tellimagrandin
   (TL) has been previously isolated from pomegranate and other plants. Structural formulas
   for UA, PA, PB, EA, and TL are presented in Figure 2.
20         As mentioned above, ellagitannins generally are not absorbed in the gut. Rather,
   they release EA in the gut, which is only poorly absorbed in the stomach and small
   intestine. EA is largely metabolized by unidentified bacteria in the intestinal lumen to
   produce urolithins. Microbial metabolism starts in the small intestine and the first
   metabolites produced retain four phenolic hydroxyls (urolithin D, four hydroxyl groups),
25 and these are further metabolized along the intestinal tract to remove hydroxyl units leading
   to urolithin C (three hydroxyls), urolithin A (two hydroxyls) and B (one hydroxyl) in the
   distal parts of the colon (Figure 3). The absorbed metabolites are conjugated with
   glucuronic acid (one or two units), and/or methyl ethers (when ortho-dihydroxyl groupings
   are present). Urolithin A and B conjugates are the main metabolites detected in plasma and
30 urine,   although some trihydroxy       derivatives  (hydroxyl-UA)     or EA-dimethyl ether
   glucuronide have also been detected in smaller amounts. The tetrahydroxy-urolithins,
   trihydroxy-urolithins, and EA derivatives generally are not detected in peripheral plasma,
   but they are absorbed in the small intestine and they are transported to the liver where they
                                             - 102 -

   are further metabolized and excreted with bile to the small intestine establishing an
   enterohepatic circulation that is responsible for the relatively long life of urolithins in
   plasma and urine.
            In addition to natural food sources, many papers have appeared on the biosynthesis,
 5 isolation, and biological activity of tannins, especially ellagitannins, over the last twenty
   years. Access to pure ellagitannins by isolation from natural sources may be cumbersome
   and yield only relatively small quantities of pure natural products. See, for example, Okuda
   et al., (1982) Chem Pharm Bull. 30:4230-4233; Okuda et al. (1982) Chem Pharm Bull.
   30:234-4236. It is therefore notable that methods for total synthesis of many ellagitannins
10 are known. See, for example, Khanbabaee, K., Strategies for the synthesis of ellagitannins,

   Methods of Increasing Autophagy, Increasing Longevity, and Treating or Preventing
   Diseases and Disorders Using Urolithins and Related Compounds
15          In certain embodiments, the invention provides methods of increasing or enhancing
   autophagy, both in vivo and in vitro, methods of increasing longevity, and methods of
   treating or preventing various diseases and conditions using urolithins and precursors
   thereof. In particular embodiments, a disease or disorder treated or prevented according to
   the present invention is a disease or disorder associated with reduced autophagy, or which
20 would benefit from increased autophagy, including but not limited to any of the diseases
   and conditions described herein.
            An aspect of the invention is a method of treating or preventing a disease or
   condition associated with, or characterized by, reduced or decreased autophagy, or which
   would benefit from increased autophagy. The method includes the step of administering to
25 a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a urolithin or precursor
   thereof. In particular embodiments, any of the urolithins or precursors thereof described
   herein may be used to practice any aspect of the invention.
            As used herein, unless the context makes clear otherwise, "treat," and similar words
   such as "treatment,"      "treated," "treating,"   etc., indicates an approach for obtaining
30 beneficial or desired results, including clinical results. Treatment can involve optionally
   either the reduction or amelioration of symptoms of the disease or condition, or the
   delaying of the progression of the disease or condition. In some embodiments, treatment is
                                             - 103  -

   achieved by reducing the duration of the disease or condition.            Administration of a
   compound described herein may, in some embodiments, treat one or more of such
   symptoms.
           As used herein, unless the context makes clear otherwise, "prevent," and similar
 5 words such as "prevention," "prevented," "preventing," etc., indicates an approach for
   preventing, inhibiting, or reducing the likelihood of the onset or recurrence of a disease or
   condition.     It also refers to preventing, inhibiting, or reducing the likelihood of the
   occurrence or recurrence of the symptoms of a disease or condition, or optionally an
   approach for delaying the onset or recurrence of a disease or condition or delaying the
10 occurrence or recurrence of the symptoms of a disease or condition. As used herein,
   "prevent" and similar words also includes reducing the intensity, effect, symptoms or
   burden of a disease or condition prior to onset or recurrence of the disease or condition.
          An aspect of the invention is a method of increasing autophagy in a cell, comprising
   the step of contacting a cell with an effective amount of a urolithin or a precursor thereof to
15 increase autophagy in the cell. In particular embodiments, the cell is present within a
   subject, e.g., a mammal. In addition, the invention includes a method of increasing
   autophagy in a cell, wherein the cell is present in a subject, e.g., a mammal, comprising the
   step of providing to the subject an effective amount of a urolithin or a precursor thereof to
   increase autophagy in the cell.
20         An aspect of the invention is a method of increasing autophagy in a cell, comprising
   the step of contacting a cell with an effective amount of a urolithin, or a precursor thereof,
   to increase autophagy in the cell.
           In particular embodiments, a urolithin is a compound having a structure set forth in
   Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III, including any one of the specific compounds of
25 Formula II or Formula III described herein. An "effective amount" as used herein refers to
   an amount that is sufficient to achieve or realize a specified or desired biological effect.
   For example, an effective amount of a urolithin to increase autophagy in a cell is an amount
   of a urolithin that is sufficient to increase autophagy in the cell.
           An increase in autophagy in a cell can be measured using any suitable assay for
30 measuring autophagy. For example, autophagy formation can be determined by using the
   fluorescent     dye monodansylcadaverine         (MDC)   (Sigma-Aldrich,    30432). This dye
   selectively labels autophagic vacuoles. Biederbick A et al. (1995) Eur. J. Cell. Biol. 66:3
                                               - 104 -

   14. Autophagy may also be determined by examining the change in the ratio of the proteins
   involved in autophagy, such as LC3-II to LC3-I, for example, using Western blot analysis.
   With such a method, an increase in the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio in a treated cell above the
   baseline, untreated cells LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, would be considered as an increase in
 5 autophagy.      Examination of other protein levels such as p62 may also help in the
   confirmation. For the purposes of calculating the percent (%) increase in autophagy in a
   cell, the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I at baseline (B-Ratio) and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I during
   treatment (T-Ratio) may be employed.          The percent (%) increase can be determined
   mathematically, for example, by the formula 100x[((T-Ratio)-(B-Ratio))/(B-Ratio)].
10          Autophagy is said to be increased in a cell if it is measurably greater than autophagy
   that is or would be present in an untreated or placebo control cell. In one embodiment
   autophagy is said to be increased in a cell if it is greater by a statistically significant amount
   or degree than autophagy that is or would be present in an untreated or placebo control cell.
   In certain embodiments, the increase in autophagy is an increase of at least 5%, at least
15 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at
   least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 100%, at least 150%, at least
   200%, at least 300%, at least 400%, at least 500%, at least 600%, at least 700%, at least
   800%, at least 900%, at least 1,000%or greater than 1,000%, as compared to the level of
   autophagy present in an untreated cell or a cell treated with a placebo.
20          In certain embodiments, the increase in autophagy is an increase of 5-5 0 0 %, 10
   500%, 15-500%, 20-500%, 25-500%, 30-500%, 40-500%, 50-500%, 60-500%, at least 70
   500%, 80-500%, 90-500%, 100-500%, 150-500%, 200-500%, 300-500%, or 400-500%, 5
   1,000%,     10-500%,    15-1,000%, 20-1,000%, 25-1,000%, 30-1,000%, 40-1,000%, 50
   1,000%, 60-1,000%, at least 70-1,000%, 80-1,000%, 90-1,000%, 100-1,000%, 150-1,000%,
25 200-1,000%, 300-1,000%, 400-1,000%, 500-1,000%, 600-1,000%, 700-1,000%, 800
   1,000% or 900-1,000%, as compared to the level of autophagy present in an untreated cell
   or a cell treated with a placebo.

   the cells are induced pluripotent stem cells. In certain embodiments, the cells are adult stem
   cells. In certain embodiments, the cells are hematopoietic stem cells. In certain
   embodiments the cells are cancer cells. In certain embodiments, the cells are present in an
 5 isolated organ or bloc of organs, such as an organ or bloc of organs harvested for
   transplantation or maintained ex vivo. In certain embodiments, the cells are present in a
   tissue or tissue slice. In various embodiments, the cells are contacted with the urolithin or
   precursor thereof in vivo, ex vivo, or in vitro.
            An aspect of the invention is a method of increasing longevity in an animal,
10 comprising the step of administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a
   urolithin or a precursor thereof to increase autophagy in the animal, thereby increasing
   longevity of the animal.
            The term "longevity" as used herein with reference to longevity of an animal refers
   to the lifespan of an individual organism. Although longevity can be measured in an
15 individual organism, it is common to measure and compare mean or median longevity of
   populations of individual organisms. For example, longevity may be measured and
   compared as mean survival in an experimental treatment group and a suitably selected
   untreated or placebo control group. Longevity may also be considered in populations of
   individuals affected with a health condition in need of autophagy. Treatment of such
20 individuals shall increase their longevity as compared to their untreated counterparts. In one
   embodiment, longevity is actual longevity. In one embodiment, longevity is actuarial
   longevity.
            The term "longevity" as used herein with reference to longevity of eukaryotic cells
   in vitro refers to the lifespan of an individual cell. Although longevity can be measured for
25 an individual cell, it is common to measure and compare mean or median longevity of
   populations of individual cells. For example, longevity may be measured and compared in
   terms of mean survival in an experimental treatment group and a suitably selected untreated
   or placebo control group. The term "longevity" also refers to the lifespan of a cell that is
   subjected to certain metabolic stresses. In one embodiment, metabolic stresses are due to
30 nutrient deprivation, growth factor depletion, or hypoxia.        For example, treatment of
   metabolically stressed cells by a urolithin or a precursor, either directly in vitro, ex vivo or
   in vivo by administration to a subject, would lead to an increase in the longevity of these
   metabolically stressed cells and in the case of ex vivo and in vivo treatment, an increased
                                              - 107 -

   longevity of these metabolically stressed cells would improve the function of tissues which
   they comprise.
            In one embodiment, longevity is said to be increased when it is at least 5 percent

            Autophagy is known to be strongly induced by caloric restriction (e.g., starvation),
   and inhibited by the mTOR pathway. Caloric restriction, without malnutrition, has been
   reported to delay aging and extend lifespan in a number of species, including insects,
   worms, mice, rats, fish, monkeys, and even humans. See, for example, Fontana L et al.
30 (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101:6659-6663; Colman RJ et al. (2009) Science 325:201
                                              - 203 -

   204. Additionally, long-term calorie restriction has been reported to be highly effective in
   reducing the risk of atherosclerosis in humans. Fontana L et al. (supra).
            Moreover, inhibition of the mTOR pathway is known to promote autophagy, and
   inhibitors of the mTOR pathway are known to activate autophagy. Inhibitors of the mTOR
 5 pathway are known to include rapamycin, metformin, and resveratrol. Additional agents
   known to stimulate autophagy, albeit via different mechanism(s), include spermidine,
   clonidine, rilmenidine, tyramine, morphine, baclofen, mastoparan, propranolol, bupivacain,
   N-dodecyl lysinamide, tamoxifen, interferon (IFN)-gamma, trehalose and vinblastine. In
   one embodiment of this aspect, the autophagy inducing compound is selected from the
10 group    consisting of Loperamide, Amiodarone, Niguldipine,           Pimozide, Nicardipine,
   Penitrem A, Fluspirilene, and Trifluoerazine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
            Rapamycin        ((3S,6R,7E,9R,1OR,12R,14S,15E,17E,19E,21S,23S,26R,27R,34aS)

   oxaazacyclohentriacontine-1,5,11,28,29(4H,6H,31H)-pentone),       also known as sirolimus, is
   a macrolide immunosuppressant agent. It was approved by the FDA in September 1999 and
   is marketed under the trade name Rapamune@ by Pfizer (formerly by Wyeth). It binds to
   the cytosolic protein FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) to form a complex that inhibits the
20 mTOR pathway by directly binding the mTOR ComplexI (mTORC 1). In C. elegans and in
   yeast, rapamycin extends lifespan only under conditions in which autophagy can be
   induced. Rapamycin was first shown to extend lifespan in eukaryotes in 2006. Powers et al.
   ((2006) Genes Dev. 20:174-184) showed a dose-responsive effect of rapamycin on lifespan
   extension in yeast cells. Building on this and other work, in a 2009 study, the lifespans of
25 mice fed rapamycin were increased between 28 and 38% from the beginning of treatment,
   or 9 to 14% in total increased maximum lifespan. Harrison DE et al. (2009) Nature
   460:392-395. Of particular note, the treatment began in mice aged 20 months, the
   equivalent of 60 human years.
            Metformin    (NN-Dimethylimidodicarbonimidic        diamide;   rosiglitazone) is   a
30 thiazolidinedione compound in a class of oral antidiabetic drugs known as the biguanide
   class. It is commercially available in the United States as Glucophage, Fortamet, Glumetza,
   and Riomet, principally for use in the treatment of type 2 (insulin resistant) diabetes
                                             -204 -

   mellitus. Dowling RJO et al. (2007) Cancer Res. 67:10804-10812 reported that metformin
   inhibits the mTOR pathway in breast cancer cells.
           Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a natural phenol found in the skin of
   red grapes and other fruits, and it is an indirect activator of sirtuin 1. It has also been
 5 produced by chemical synthesis. Farina A et al. (2006) Nat. Prod. Res. 20:247-252.
   Resveratrol is available as a nutritional supplement from a number of commercial suppliers.
   A number of studies have reported that resveratrol extends lifespan in yeast, C. elegans,
   Drosophila, certain fish, and mice. In addition, Brito PM et al. (2009) Atherosclerosis
   205:126-134 reported that resveratrol inhibits the mTOR pathway.
10         Baur JA et al. (2006) Nature 444:337-342 reported that resveratrol shifts the
   physiology of middle-aged mice on a high-calorie diet towards that of mice on a standard
   diet and significantly increases their survival. According to Baur et al., resveratrol produces
   changes associated with longer lifespan, including increased insulin sensitivity, reduced
   insulin-like growth factor-i       (IGF-I) levels, increased AMP-activated protein kinase
15 (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator la (PGC-la)
   activity, increased mitochondrial number, and improved motor function. Parametric
   analysis of gene set enrichment revealed that resveratrol opposed the effects of the high
   calorie diet in 144 out of 153 significantly altered pathways.
           Pearson KJ et al. (2008) Cell Metab. 8:157-168 reported that resveratrol-fed elderly
20 mice show a marked reduction in signs of aging, including reduced albuminuria, decreased
   inflammation and apoptosis in the vascular endothelium, increased aortic elasticity, greater
   motor coordination, reduced cataract formation, and preserved bone mineral density.
           In addition to resveratrol, other small molecules have been reported to activate
   sirtuins and extend lifespan in yeast, including butein (3,4,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone),
25 piceatannol        (3,5,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-trans-stilbene),       isoliquiritigenin     (4,2',4'
   trihydroxychalcone),     fisetin (3,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone),   and quercetin (3,5,7,3',4'
   pentahydroxyflavone). Howitz KT et al. (2003) Nature 425:191-196; Wood, JG et al.
   (2004) Nature 430:686-689, corrigendum Nature 431:107.
           The effects of various treatments on aging and longevity are commonly assessed on
30 invertebrates, including nematodes (C. elegans), yeast, and fruit flies (Drosophila). C.
   elegans, in particular, is the most commonly employed in vivo model for determining
   impact on longevity due to its short lifespan and ease of genetic manipulation.
                                               -205-

   Pharmaceutical interventions found to extend the lifespan of C. elegans have also been
   shown to extend the lifespan of yeast and fruitflies.
            Importantly, in accordance with the instant invention, urolithin A has been found to
   be unexpectedly more potent, in terms of life extension, than any of rapamycin, resveratrol,
 5 metformin, or spermidine. Referring to Table 11, it is clear that urolithins are the most
   potent among all of the compounds listed, in terms of life extension, increasing mean life
   extension by 75% versus 27% for metformin, the most potent other compound listed. This
   illustrates that urolithins show superior effects with respect to their ability to delay the
   negative consequences linked to aging. The effects of other urolithins have also shown
10 impressive effects on life span extension (Figure 4). Similar effects are seen across all of
   the urolithins tested, so the compound class as a whole is expected to show comparable
   effects.

            In addition to their usefulness in extending longevity, methods and compositions of
   the invention are also believed to be useful for extending health span. As used herein,
   "health span" (or, equivalently, "healthspan") refers to the period of an individual's life
30 during which they are generally healthy and free from serious or chronic illness. In one
   embodiment, "health span" (or, equivalently, "healthspan") refers to the period of time
                                              -210-

   during which an individual meets one or more selected measures of health. An increase in
   health span refers to an extension in the period of health, according to such measures, as
   compared to the period of health in a control population. An increase in health span can be
   measured, e.g., by determining the length of time that an individual continues to meet the
 5 selected measure(s) of health.
           The urolithin or precursor thereof may be administered, alone or together with at
   least one other agent, to a subject (e.g., a mammal) in any of a variety of ways. For
   example, the urolithin or precursor thereof can be administered orally or parenterally.
   Parenterally includes, without limitation, intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally,
10 subcutaneously, intra-articularly, intrasynovially, intraocularly, intrathecally, topically, or
   by inhalation. As such, the form of the urolithin or precursor thereof dose can be any of a
   variety of suitable forms, including neat compounds, natural foods, processed foods, natural
   juices, concentrates and extracts, injectable solutions, microcapsules, nano-capsules,
   liposomes, plasters, inhalation forms, nose sprays, nosedrops, eyedrops, sublingual tablets,
15 and sustained-release preparations.
           The compounds of this invention can be provided in isolated form. As used herein,
   the term "isolated" means substantially removed from other compounds or components
   with which the compound of interest may otherwise be found, for example, as found in
   nature. In one embodiment, a compound is isolated when it is essentially completely
20 removed from other compounds or components with which the compound of interest may
   otherwise be found. In one embodiment, a compound is isolated when it is pure.
           The compounds of this invention can be incorporated into a variety of formulations
   for therapeutic administration. More particularly, the compounds of the present invention
   can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by combination with appropriate
25 pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, and may be formulated into preparations in
   solid, semi-solid, liquid or gaseous forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granules,
   ointments, solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants, gels, microspheres, and aerosols.
   As such, administration of the compounds can be achieved in various ways, including
   without limitation oral, buccal, rectal, intravenous,         intramuscular, intraperitoneal,
30 intradermal, transdermal, and intratracheal administration. The active agent may be
   systemic after administration or may be localized by the use of regional administration,
   intramural administration, or use of an implant that acts to retain the active dose at the site
   of implantation.

           The compounds of the invention can also be formulated as food additives, food
   ingredients, functional foods, dietary supplements, medical foods, nutraceuticals, or food
   supplements. In certain embodiments, compounds of the invention can be included into
   nutraceutical beverages of varying volumes to permit the administration of a daily dose in a
 5 convenient format. As a non-limiting example, beverages may deliver effective doses in a
   final volume ranging from 5 mL to 1,000 mL, delivered as a single dose or multiple doses.
   In certain embodiments, compositions and methods of the invention are utilized for and in
   non-human animals. Accordingly, compounds and compositions of the invention may be
   formulated as veterinary products. Compounds and composition may also be formulated
10 into functional foods for administration to animals, for example, dogs, cats, horses, etc.
           In pharmaceutical dosage forms, the compounds may be administered in the form of
   their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.     The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is
   intended to encompass any and all acceptable salt forms derived from a physiologically
   acceptable acid or base. The compounds of the present invention may be utilized as the
15 free acid or free base. Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in the
   form of acid or base addition salts, which may be formed by methods well known in the art.
           The compounds may also be used in appropriate               association with other
   pharmaceutically active compounds. The following methods and excipients are merely
   exemplary and are in no way limiting.
20         For oral preparations, the compounds can be used alone or in combination with
   appropriate additives to make tablets, powders, granules or capsules, for example, with
   conventional additives, such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch or potato starch; with binders,
   such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, corn starch or gelatins; with
   disintegrators, such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; with
25 lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate; and if desired, with diluents, buffering
   agents, moistening agents, preservatives and flavoring agents.
           The compounds can be formulated into preparations for injections by dissolving,
   suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent, such as vegetable or
   other similar oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher aliphatic acids or
30 propylene glycol; and if desired, with conventional, additives such as solubilizers, isotonic
   agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and preservatives.

           The compounds can be utilized in aerosol formulation to be administered via
   inhalation. The compounds of the present invention can be formulated into pressurized
   acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen and the like.
           Furthermore, the compounds can be made into suppositories by mixing with a
 5 variety of bases such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases. The compounds of the
   present invention can be administered rectally via a suppository. The suppository can
   include vehicles such as cocoa butter, carbowaxes and polyethylene glycols, which melt at
   body temperature, yet are solidified at room temperature.
           Unit dosage forms for oral or rectal administration such as syrups, elixirs, and
10 suspensions may be provided wherein each dosage unit, for example, teaspoonful,
   tablespoonful, tablet or suppository, contains a predetermined amount of the composition
   containing one or more compounds of the present invention. Similarly, unit dosage forms
   for injection or intravenous administration may comprise the compound of the present
   invention in a composition as a solution in sterile water, normal saline or another
15 pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein each dosage unit, for example, mL or L,
   contains a predetermined amount of the composition containing one or more compounds of
   the present invention.
           Implants for sustained release formulations are well-known in the art. Implants are
   formulated as microspheres; slabs, etc., with biodegradable or non-biodegradable polymers.
20 For example, polymers of lactic acid and/or glycolic acid form an erodible polymer that is
   well-tolerated by the host. The implant containing the inhibitory compounds may be placed
   in proximity to a site of interest, so that the local concentration of active agent is increased
   relative to the rest of the body.
           The term "unit dosage form", as used herein, refers to physically discrete units
25 suitable as unitary dosages for human and animal subjects, each unit containing a
   predetermined quantity of compounds of the present invention calculated in an amount
   sufficient to produce the desired effect in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable
   diluent, carrier or vehicle. The specifications for the novel unit dosage forms of the present
   invention depend on the particular compound employed and the effect to be achieved, and
30 the pharmacodynamics associated with each compound in the host.
           The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as vehicles, adjuvants, carriers or
   diluents, are readily available to the public. Moreover, pharmaceutically acceptable
                                              -213-

   auxiliary substances, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents,
   stabilizers, wetting agents and the like, are readily available to the public.
            For clinical use, the urolithin or urolithin precursor is administered in a
   therapeutically effective amount. As used herein, an "effective amount" refers to an amount
 5 that is sufficient to achieve or realize a specified or desired biological effect. As used
   herein, a "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount sufficient to realize, in a
   single dose or multiple doses, a desired therapeutic effect. A skilled artisan can determine
   therapeutically effective amounts based on in vitro, preclinical, or clinical studies, or any
   combination thereof
10          In one embodiment urolithins and their precursors can be delivered by means of
   natural products. One of these is the pomegranate, which contains ellagitannins and ellagic
   acid.    Pomegranates may be processed in several ways for practicing this invention.
   Pomegranate juice can vary widely in terms of its polyphenol constituents, particularly
   punicalagin, the ellagitannin having the highest concentration found in the pomegranate.
15 The starting material (i.e., pomegranates and their variety), the method of juicing, as well as
   the storage conditions will affect punicalagin levels found in the final juice product. Table
   12 below provides examples of juices that have been store bought and of different origins.
   A large variation in punicalagin from one juice batch to another is observed. For the
   purpose of practicing this invention it is advantageous that individuals consume a
20 standardized batch of juice that is delivering known and consistent levels of ellagitannins.
   Presently in the marketplace pomegranate juice is not standardized by ellagitannin levels
   and dosing is not indicated. Consequently, currently available juices are not suitable for
   effectively practicing the invention as they do not offer the possibility of consistent dosing
   by an individual, due to the wide variations of ellagitannins and their concentrations found
25 in the different products.

           As described earlier, the consumption of ellagitannins by humans leads to the
   formation of urolithins by the gut microflora prior to their absorption. It is believed that
   consumption of ellagitannins holds the potential to modify the microflora of the gut. In one
 5 study in rats it was observed that urolithins were found in the urine only following four
   days of consumption, suggesting that the rats required time to adapt their microflora to
   metabolize pomegranate tannins to produce the urolithin metabolites. Cerda et al. (2003)
   Eur J Nutr 42:18-28. This finding suggests that optimal dosing of ellagitannins in humans
   may require a similar period for each individual's microflora to adapt optimally to
10 metabolize consumed ellagitanins or ellagic acid equivalents into urolithins.
           With urolithin precursors, including but not limited to ellagitannins and ellagic acid,
   a minimal treatment period sometimes may be needed prior to observing autophagy or the
   health benefits, depending on the subject. For example, this pre-treatment period may be 1,
   2,3,4,5,6,7, 8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,
15 29, 30, or 31 days, or 1, 2, or 3 months.
           Additionally, it has been shown that individuals' microflora compositions can vary
   dramatically and that some individuals may metabolize ellagitannins more completely than
   others. For instance, following the consumption of pomegranate juice, some individuals
   may preferentially convert ellagitannins or ellagic acid equivalents into urolithin A, while
20 others may preferentially convert into urolithin C. Also, it has been observed that certain
   individuals are high converters (i.e., a high level of urolithins are formed in the gut from
   consumed ellagitannins and ellagic acid equivalents), while others are low converters (i.e.,
   only a low level of urolithins are formed in the gut from consumed ellagitannins and ellagic
   acid equivalents). These differences in metabolite production from high producer to low
25 producer and variations of urolithin are believed to be due to differences in colonic
   microflora and the potential requirement for an adaptation period. Cerda et al. (2004) Eur J
   Nutr 43:205-220. Consequently, due to these variations when administering ellagitannins
                                             - 215 -

   and their equivalents, for certain applications it may be beneficial to administer urolithins
   directly.
           Dosing will generally be daily to weekly. In one embodiment, dosing is at least
   weekly. For example, a subject may receive one dose once weekly, twice weekly, thrice
 5 weekly, or every other day. In one embodiment, dosing is at least daily. For example, a
   subject may receive one or more doses daily.
           It is believed that dosing for greatest efficacy in humans involves extended, daily
   administration, e.g., when delivering ellagitannins, amounts equivalent to at least 16 ounces
   (500 mL) of pomegranate juice per day. Extended use is contemplated to include use for 1
10 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, or even longer.
           For clinical use, a urolithin or precursor may be administered to treat either a
   chronic or an acute condition. As autophagy is observed to be increased in cells in less than
   one day, for example after 8 hours, urolithins and their variants of Formula I, Formula II
   and Formula III may be administered in an acute fashion to treat a condition acutely in need
15 an induction of autophagy.         Such instances may include conditions due to reperfusion
   injuries (for example, organ transplantation), heart attack, stroke, ischemic insult, during
   surgery (for example, during an angioplasty procedure or replacement of a heart valve), or
   following a traumatic injury.
           For clinical use, a urolithin or precursor thereof will generally be administered in an
20 amount equal or equivalent to 0.2 - 2000 milligram (mg) of urolithin per kilogram (kg) of
   body weight of the subject per day. In one embodiment, the urolithin or precursor thereof is
   administered in a dose equal or equivalent to 2 - 2000 mg of urolithin per kg body weight
   of the subject per day. In one embodiment, the urolithin or precursor thereof is administered
   in a dose equal or equivalent to 20 - 2000 mg of urolithin per kg body weight of the subject
25 per day. In one embodiment, the urolithin or precursor thereof is administered in a dose
   equal or equivalent to 50 - 2000 mg of urolithin per kg body weight of the subject per day.
   In one embodiment, the urolithin or precursor thereof is administered in a dose equal or
   equivalent to 100 - 2000 mg of urolithin per kg body weight of the subject per day. In one
   embodiment, the urolithin or precursor thereof is administered in a dose equal or equivalent
30 to 200 - 2000 mg of urolithin per kg body weight of the subject per day. Where a precursor
   of urolithin is to be administered rather than a urolithin, it is administered in an amount that
   is equivalent to, i.e., sufficient to deliver, the above-stated amounts of urolithin.

         The formulations of urolithin or precursor thereof can be administered to human
   subjects in therapeutically effective amounts. Typical dose ranges are from about 0.01
   microgram/kg to about 2 mg/kg of body weight per day. The dosage of drug to be
   administered is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of the disorder, the
 5 overall health status of the particular subject, the specific compound being administered, the
   excipients used to formulate the compound, and its route of administration. Routine
   experiments may be used to optimize the dose and dosing frequency for any particular
   compound.
         In one embodiment, the urolithin or precursor thereof is administered at a
10 concentration in the range from about 0.001 microgram/kg to greater than about 500 mg/kg.
   For example, the concentration may be 0.001 microgram/kg, 0.01 microgram/kg, 0.05

            The term "effective amount" refers to the amount of the urolithin or precursor
   thereof required to enhance autophagy, e.g., in a disease associated with misfolded protein
   aggregates. The effective amount of the urolithin or precursor thereof used to enhance
   autophagy varies depending upon the manner of administration, the age, body weight, and
15 general health of the subject. An effective amount of the urolithin or precursor thereof, as
   defined herein, may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, and weight of
   the subject, and the ability of the urolithin or precursor thereof to elicit a desired response in
   the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response.
   An effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects (e.g., side effects)
20 of the autophagy inducing compound are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial
   effects. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of the urolithin or precursor thereof
   (i.e., an effective dosage) may range from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably
   about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight,
   and even more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or
25 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may
   influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the
   severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the
   subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically
   effective amount of the urolithin or precursor thereof can include a single treatment or,
30 preferably, can include a series of treatments. In one example, a subject is treated with the
   urolithin or precursor thereof in the range of between about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight,
   one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more
   preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or
                                              -219-

   6 weeks. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of the urolithin or precursor
   thereof used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular
   treatment.

   The solution was stirred at that temperature for 17 hours. Then ice was added thoroughly to
   the mixture. The yellow precipitate was filtered and washed with cold water to give a
15 yellow solid which was heated to reflux in acetic acid for 3 hours. The hot solution was
   filtered quickly and the precipitate was washed with acetic acid, then with diethyl ether to

           Step 1: Preparation of compound 3
           Oxalyl chloride (1.07 mL; 12.6 mmol; 1.1 eq.) and dimethylformamide (1 drop;
   cat.) were added to a cold (0 C) suspension of 2-bromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid 2 (3.00
   g; 11.5 mmol; 1.0 eq.) in dichloromethane (20 mL). After addition, the reaction mixture
15 was stirred for 5 minutes at 0 'C and then for 16 hours at room temperature. The reaction
   mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting oil was solubilized in
   dichloromethane (10 mL) and cooled to 0 'C. 2,3-Methoxyphenol 1 (1.90 g; 12.6 mmol; 1.1
   eq.) and triethylamine (2.4 mL; 17.2 mmol; 1.5 eq.) were successively added and the
   mixture was stirred for 5 minutes. Acetonitrile (10 mL) was finally added and the resulting
                                            - 226  -

   solution was stirred for 16 hours at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by
   addition of a saturated solution of ammonium chloride and the layers were separated. The
   aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane and the combined organic layers were
   dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude
 5 was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to yield the title compound 3.
            Step 2: Preparation of compound 4
            Sodium acetate (1.79 g; 21.8 mmol; 2.0 eq.), (S)-Phos (451 mg; 1.1 mmol; 0.1 eq.)
   and palladium diacetate (244 mg; 1.1 mmol; 0.1 eq.) were successively added to a solution
   of 3 (4.32 g; 10.9 mmol; 1 eq.) in dimethylacetamide (200 mL) under an argon atmosphere.
10 The reaction mixture was stirred at 130 'C for 3 days. The reaction was quenched by
   addition of water and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane. The combined
   organic layers were washed with brine, dried over sodium sulphate, and concentrated under
   reduced pressure. The remaining dimethylacetamide was eliminated using a Hickman
   apparatus. The crude dark oil was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to yield
15 the title compound 4.
            Step 3: Preparation of compound 5
            Boron tribromide (726 [tL; 10.3 mmol; 5.0 eq.) was added to a cold (15 'C) solution
   of compound 4 (650 mg; 2.0 mmol; 1.0 eq.) in chloroform (7.3 mL). After the addition, the
   reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature and stirred for 15 minutes. The
20 mixture was then heated up to 60 'C and stirred for 4 days. The reaction was quenched by
   addition of methanol and the mixture was evaporated to dryness. The crude was purified by
   column chromatography on Cis to yield pure compound 5.

   Urolithins Extend Lifespan in C. elegans
25          C. elegans strains were cultured at 20 'C on nematode growth media (NGM) agar
   plates seeded with E. coli strain OP50. Strain used was wild-type Bristol N2 provided by
   the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (University of Minnesota). All Compounds were
   dissolved in DMSO. Animals were exposed to compounds from eggs on plates seeded with
   live OP50 bacteria. Control plates were prepared with the corresponding concentrations of
30 DMSO (0.1%). For lifespan tests, worms were observed using a Nikon SMZ1500
   stereomicroscope (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA). Briefly, 10 L4 worms were transferred on
                                             - 227 -

   plates containing NGM medium with either vehicle alone (DMSO 0. 1%) or test compounds
   dissolved in DMSO (DMSO 0.1%) and seeded with E. coli strain OP50. After 3 days
   (corresponding to day 0), newly developed 60 to 100 L4 worms were used per condition,
   scored and transferred to fresh plates every 3 days starting from day 1 (young adult worms).
 5 All lifespan experiments were performed at 20 'C. Animals that crawled off the plate or
   had an "exploded vulva" phenotype were censored.
           Treatment with urolithins A, B, C, and D at a concentration of 50 tM extended the
   lifespan in C. elegans (Figure 4). Ellagic acid (EA) at the same concentration showed no
   effects in prolonging the lifespan of the C. elegans.
10         Treatment with urolithin A extended the lifespan in C. elegans in a dose-dependent
   manner (Figure 5). At a concentration of 10 tM the median lifespan increased by 27.7 %,
   and at a concentration of 50 tM the median lifespan increased by 75%.

   Urolithin A Activates AMPK/aak-2 and SIRT1/sir-2.1 to Mediate Longevity
15         Lifespan assays were performed with (A) wild-type (N2), (B) sir-2.1(ok434)
   mutant, (C) aak-2(ok524), (D) daf-16(mu86), (E) eat-2(ad465) and (F) daf-2(e1370) mutant
   strains of C. elegans maintained during their full life on plates supplemented with either 50
     iM of urolithin A or with a control treatment and seeded with OP50 bacteria.        Control
   plates without urolithin A contained an equivalent concentration of DMSO. Worm lifespan
20 assays were performed at 20 'C. Animals that crawled off the plate or had an "exploded
   vulva" phenotype were censored.
           sir-2.1: sir-2.1 encodes the mammalian homolog of the NAD-dependent deacetylase
   SIRTI in C. elegans. SIR-2.1/SIRT1 activity is mediated by NAD* level and is well
   described to be involved in longevity regulation in yeast, C. elegans, and Drosophila in
25 response to caloric restriction.
           aak-2/AMPK: aak-2 encodes the mammalian homolog of the AMP-dependent
   kinase AMPK in C. elegans.
           daf-16 encodes a FOXO transcription factor.
           eat-2 encodes a protein involved in pharyngeal pumping.

             Results are shown in Table 16 and Figure 6. As shown in the figure, urolithin A
   significantly extended lifespan in wild-type C. elegans by 75%, showing that urolithin A is
   a pro-longevity compound.

   Energy Stress - Caloric Restriction Pathway
             The sir-2.1 mutant completely suppressed the activity of urolithin A on the
   extension of median lifespan in C. elegans. This indicates that sir-2.1 is required for the
   lifespan extension induced by urolithin A and that urolithin A is dependent on sir-2.1 to
10 extend lifespan.
             The aak-2 mutant significantly suppressed the lifespan extension phenotype induced
   by urolithin A from a 75% increase in mean lifespan down to a 12.5% extension. This
   indicates that aak-2 plays an important role in the lifespan subsequent to urolithin A
   exposure. This also demonstrates that urolithin A activation of AMPK is a key step in the
15 lifespan extension induced by urolithin A.
   Insulin Signaling Pathway
             The daf-2 mutant completely suppressed the activity of urolithin A on the extension
   of median lifespan in C. elegans. This indicates that daf-2 is required for the lifespan
   extension induced by urolithin A and that urolithin A is dependent on daf-2 to extend
20 lifespan.
             Treatment of C. elegans with either rapamycin, resveratrol, or metformin induces an
                                             - 229 -

   increase in worm mean lifespan, which has been shown to be a result of acting on the
   autophagy pathway.
           It is worth noting that the lifespan extension induced by urolithin A treatment (75%)
   is much greater than the life extension induced by either resveratrol (12.6%), rapamycin
 5 (19%), or metformin (27%) alone.
   Example 7
   Urolithin A Increases Mitochondrial Activity in C. elegans
           C. elegans strains were cultured at 20 'C on nematode growth media (NGM) agar
   plates seeded with HT 115 bacteria and containing 50 iM urolithin A or a corresponding
10 concentration of DMSO as a control. The worms were treated from eggs to the first day of
   adulthood. The strains used were the SJ4103 (zcIs14[myo-3::GFP(mit)]), which is a stable
   transgenic line expressing a mitochondrially localized green fluorescent protein (GFP) with
   a cleavable mitochondrial import signal peptide under the control of the specific body wall
   muscle promoter myo-3. GFP expression and quantification was carried out according to
15 the protocol previously described. Durieux J et al. (2011) Cell 144:79-91. Worms were
   treated with 50 piM urolithin A from eggs and GFP was monitored after one day of
   adulthood. Fluorimetric assays were performed using a Victor X4 multilabel plate reader
   (Perkin-Elmer Life Science). Eighty worms were picked at random (20 worms per well of a
   black-walled 96-well plate), and each well was read four times and averaged.
20         The results in Figure 7 show that treatment of worms with urolithin A induces the
   expression of the mitochondrial GFP reporter driven by the muscle-specific myo-3
   promoter in C. elegans. This striking increase in GFP expression provides clear evidence
   that mitochondrial capacity was increased due to the urolithin A. To permit such an
   increase in observed GFP signal, mitochondria in muscle must either be enlarged or more
25 numerous in these worms.
   Example 8
   Urolithin A Increases Mitochondrial Function in Aged C. elegans
           C. elegans strains were cultured at 20 'C on nematode growth media (NGM) agar
   plates seeded with E. coli strain OP50. Strain used was wild-type Bristol N2 provided by
30 the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (University of Minnesota). Urolithin A was dissolved in
   DMSO. Animals were exposed to compounds from eggs on plates seeded with live OP50
                                              -230-

   bacteria. Control plates were prepared with the corresponding concentration of DMSO
   (0.1%).
           Measurement of oxygen consumption is a direct indicator of mitochondrial activity.
   The effect of urolithin A on mitochondrial activity in aged C. elegans (10 days old) was
 5 assessed by treating C. elegans with urolithin A for 10 days of adulthood, at which time
   oxygen consumption was measured using the Seahorse XF24 equipment (Seahorse
   Bioscience Inc., North Billerica, MA). 250 ten-day-old C. elegans were used per condition.
   C. elegans were recovered from NGM plates with M9 medium, washed three times in 2 mL
   M9 to eliminate residual bacteria, and resuspended in 500 gL M9 medium. Worms were
10 transferred into 24-well standard Seahorse plates (#100777-004) (50 worms per well) and
   oxygen consumption was measured. The basal oxygen consumption of the worms was first
   measured over 30 minutes at 5-minute intervals (0 min, 5 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min, and
   30 min) with 5 replicates per interval. Respiration rates were normalized to the exact
   number of worms per well determined after the completion of the experiment using a
15 stereomicroscope. After determining the basal oxygen consumption, uncoupled oxygen
   consumption      was     measured      by     adding   carbonylcyanide-p-(trifluoromethoxy)
   phenylhydrazone (FCCP) at the 30 minute time point to the media in order assess the
   maximal oxygen consumption capacity and maximal mitochondrial capacity. Uncoupled
   oxygen consumption was measured at 5-minute intervals (35 min, 40 min, 45 min, 50 min,
20 55 min, and 60 min) to permit measuring the mitochondrial function over time.
           FCCP is a chemical uncoupling agent that abolishes the obligatory linkage between
   the respiratory chain and the phosphorylation system which is observed with intact
   mitochondria. This effect is due to the amphipathic properties of the molecule which
   dissolves in mitochondrial phospholipid bilayers. This dramatically increases ionic
25 permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and generates dramatic proton leak leading to
   increase in oxygen consumption due to the quenching by oxygen of the electrons pumped
   into the respiratory chain in parallel to the proton leak. Since this oxygen consumption is
   dissociated (uncoupled) to ATP production (oxidative phosphorylation), FCCP increases
   oxygen consumption while decreasing the generation of energy (ATP) by the mitochondria.
30 Fully uncoupled mitochondria, as achieved with FCCP, display the maximal capacity of
   their mitochondrial respiratory chain (maximal oxygen consumption) without the "brake"
   that oxidative phosphorylation and energy production represents.
                                             -231-

           The results depicted in Figure 8 (A and B) illustrate that urolithin A increases the
   maximal mitochondrial capacity of 10-day-old aged C. elegans, as depicted by a prolonged
   effect on increased uncoupled respiration in worms treated with urolithin A versus control
   (DMSO)-treated worms. Control untreated worms showed a brief increase in uncoupled
 5 respiration which quickly returned to basal levels of oxygen consumption. Urolithin A
   treated worms showed a more extended elevation in oxygen consumption. The extent of
   enhanced mitochondrial activity is shown by comparing the area under the curves (AUC)
   during the decoupling period with the average coupled respiration employed as the
   baseline. It was observed that urolithin A significantly increased uncoupled respiration in
10 aged worms as compared to control untreated worms over the 30-minute period evaluated.
   Figure 8C shows that aged, 10-day-old C. elegans have a decrease in basal respiration in
   comparison with young, 1-day-old C. elegans. Figure 8D shows that treatment of worms
   with urolithin A at 30 gM normalizes the respiration rates, and aged, 10-day-old C. elegans
   show comparable levels of oxygen consumption to young, 1-day-old C. elegans.

   Urolithin A Increases Autophagy in C. elegans
           C. elegans strains were cultured at 20'C on nematode growth media (NGM) agar
   plates seeded with OP50 bacteria and containing 50 gM urolithin A or a corresponding
   concentration of DMSO as a control. The worms were treated from eggs to the second day
20 of the adulthood. The strains used were the DA2122 (adls2122[lgg-1::GFP + rol
   6(sul006)]), which is a transgenic line expressing the LGG-1 protein (homolog of LC3 in
   human) fused with the green fluorescent protein (GFP). For picture acquisition, worms were
   immobilized with tetramisole (Sigma) and mounted on 6% agarose pads on glass slides.
   Images were acquired using Zeiss LSM 700 upright confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG,
25 Oberkochen, Germany) from the same part of C. elegans. For each condition multiple
   worms were observed and imaged with the same initial parameters. Image processing and
   quantification of autophagic events was performed with the Fiji software.
           The results depicted in Figure 9 illustrate that urolithin A increases the number of
   autophagic events, as depicted by the increased number of LGG- 1::GFP dots per focal field
30 (plan) in worms treated with urolithin A versus control (DMSO)-treated worms. This
   observation was confirmed by the fact that food deprivation, a dietary intervention that
   increases autophagy in C. elegans, shows the same profile as urolithin A-treated worms.
                                           -232-

   This result provides clear evidence that urolithin A treatment is an inducer of autophagy in
   worms and could explain the longevity phenotype associated with such a treatment, as it
   has been already described that induction of autophagy, by dietary manipulation or
   treatment with specific compounds, increases life expectancy in a number of animal
 5 species. Hansen M et al. (2008) PLoS Genetics 4:e24; Eisenberg T et al. (2009) Nat Cell

   The Autophagic Pathway Is Involved in the Longevity Phenotype Induced by
   Urolithin A in C. elegans
10         Lifespan tests were performed as described. Mouchiroud L et al. (2011) Aging Cell
   10:39-54. Briefly, worms were observed using a Nikon SMZ1500 stereomicroscope
   (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA). Briefly, 10 L4 worms were transferred on plates containing
   NGM medium with vehicle (DMSO 0.1%, final concentration) or urolithin A dissolved in
   DMSO (final concentration 50 gM) and seeded with E. coli RNAi clones as indicated. After
15 3 days (corresponding to day 0), newly developed 60-100 L4 worms were used per
   condition, scored and transferred to fresh plates every 3 days starting from day 1 (young
   adult worms). All lifespan experiments were performed at 20 'C. Animals that crawled off
   the plate or had an "exploded vulva" phenotype were censored.
            Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan Meier method and the
20 significance of differences between survival curves calculated using the log rank test.
   Differences between two groups were assessed using two-tailed t-tests. Analysis of
   variance, assessed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test, was used when comparing
   more than two groups. The statistical software used was GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad
   Software, Inc.) and all p-values <0.05 were considered significant.
25         Gene silencing was carried out as previously described by using the RNA
   interference (RNAi) process. Mouchiroud L et al. (2011) Aging Cell 10:39-54. In C.
   elegans, RNAi is made by feeding. Briefly, the nematodes were fed with bacteria modified
   with a plasmid encoding a dsRNA targeting a gene of interest. The worms eat these bacteria
   which will simply allow the inactivation of this gene. As a control, worms were fed with the
30 RNAi clones HT 115, which encodes an empty vector.
           To determine the requirement of the autophagic pathway for the lifespan phenotype
   induced by urolithin A treatment (Figure 10), two genes encoding major autophagic
                                           -233-

   proteins were inhibited by RNA interference (RNAi). These two proteins were vps-34
   (sequence   name:    B0025.1,    homolog     of VPS34       in   human),    which   encodes     a
   phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13K) that regulates multiple steps in vesicular trafficking
   and that is required for autophagy mechanism, and bec-1 (sequence name: T19E7.3,
 5 homolog of beclin in human), which encodes a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
   complex that plays a role in localizing autophagy proteins to preautophagosomal structures.
   The inhibition of their expression by RNAi has already been described to suppress the
   lifespan phenotype induced by dietary restriction, which is an experimental condition that
   promotes autophagy in C. elegans. Hansen M et al. (2008) PLoS Genetics 4:e24.

           The results depicted in Figure 10 illustrate that urolithin A increased the lifespan of
   worms through the activation of the autophagy mechanism. The fact that the lifespan
   extension observed in worms treated with urolithin A and fed with the empty vector is
15 suppressed when these worms are fed with bacteria expressing RNAi against vps-34 or bec
   1 reveals that these two proteins are each required and essential for the longevity
   phenotype. Such an observation shows that urolithin A treatment promotes the activity of
   vps-34 and bec-1, and leads to the induction of the autophagy mechanism to extend
   longevity.

   Urolithins Maintain Muscle Function in C. elegans During the Aging Process
           To examine the effect of urolithins on muscle function, pharyngeal pumping was
   examined in C. elegans worms at day 7 and day 14. Worms were observed using a Nikon
                                            -234-

   SMZ1500 stereomicroscope (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA). Ten L4 worms were transferred
   on plates containing NGM medium with vehicle (DMSO 0.1%, final concentration) or the
   compound of interest (urolithin A (UA), urolithin B (UB), urolithin C (UC), urolithin D
   (UD)) dissolved in DMSO (final concentration 50 gM) and seeded with E. coli RNAi
 5 clones as indicated. After 3 days (corresponding to day 0), newly developed 60 to 100 L4
   worms were used per condition, scored and transferred to fresh plates every 3 days starting
   from day 1 (young adult worms). Experiments were performed at 20 'C. Animals that
   crawled off the plate or had an "exploded vulva" phenotype were censored.
           The pharyngeal pumping rates at day 7 and 14 were measured for 10 worms by
10 transferring single worms to an unseeded plate and scoring for pharyngeal pumping under a
   dissecting microscope for 30 seconds. The pharyngeal pumping rates were then computed
   by extrapolating the pumping made by worms during this 30 second period.
           Pharyngeal pumping at day 7 were markedly increased for all urolithins tested
   (Figure 11), demonstrated the ability of urolithin treatment to improve muscle function in
15 young worms. This improved muscle function is maintained in aging worms and urolithin
   treatment also improves muscle function in worms at day 14. In the aged worms (day 14)
   urolithin treatment, and in particular urolithins A and B, decreases the age related decline in
   muscle activity (pharyngeal pumping).
           To examine the effect of urolithins on muscle activity during aging, C. elegans
20 mobility was examined over time. Synchronized populations of wild-type nematodes were
   prepared by standard methods and cultivated at 20'C on NGM agar containing E. Coli
   (OP50) with or without test compounds (ellagic acid (EA), urolithins A (UA), and B (UB)).
   At Day 0, five plates were prepared, each containing 10 young adult worms. Worms were
   assayed for mobility at different ages, day 1, 3, 5 and 8 of adulthood. The wild type (N2,
25 Bristol) worm strain was employed for these studies.
           For C. elegans movement tracking, 45 seconds of video were recorded using a
   Nikon DS-L2 / DS-Fil camera and controller setup, attached to both a computer and a
   standard bright field microscope, tracking an entire plate of 10 worms, with 5 plates per
   condition. The movement of worms during this time was calculated using an adapted
30 version of the freely-available software Parallel Worm Tracker for MATLAB. The total
   movement over the 45 second tracking was averaged across all worms for each condition.
   This experiment was repeated twice with between 40 and 70 worms per condition.
                                             -235-

            Ellagic acid treatment has no effect on this age related mobility decline (Figure 12).
   In contrast, urolithin treatment with 50 ptM of either urolithin A or B, demonstrate a marked
   ability to reduce muscle function decline and maintain muscle function in aging C. elegans
   worms. This demonstrates the ability of urolithin treatment to preserve muscle function
 5 during the aging process.
            To further characterize the effect of urolithins on muscle function and mobility, C.
   elegans were treated and their mobility observed under time-lapse microscopy. The effects
   of urolithin A on muscle function in C. elegans were examined. Briefly, worms were
   observed using a Nikon SMZ 1500 stereomicroscope (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA). Briefly,
10 5 worms coming from different plates were transferred on plates containing NGM medium
   with vehicle (DMSO 0.1%, final concentration) or compound of interest (ellagic acid
   (EA), urolithin A (UA), urolithin B (UB), urolithin C (UC), urolithin D (UD)) dissolved in
   DMSO (final concentration 50 gM) and seeded with E. coli RNAi clones as
   indicated. Time lapse was performed by recording 20 pictures of mobile worms with a 10
15 second interval by using a Zeiss Axioplan-2 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging,
   Thomwood, NY, USA). Worm tracking was realized using the ImageJ software.
   Experiments were repeated three times.
            Urolithin treatment resulted in a marked increase in motility that was maintained to
   varying degrees during the aging process (Figure 13). The strongest effect was observed
20 for urolithin B. The results presented here demonstrate the ability of all urolithin treatments
   to improve muscle function in C. elegans and preserve muscle function against age related
   muscle activity decline.
   Example 12
   Urolithins Induce Autophagy in Mammalian Cells
25          The ability of urolithins to induce autophagy in mammalian cells was also
   examined. ModeK cells derived from intestine, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
   including 4.5 g/L glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES,
   0.1 mM NEAA, 2-Mercaptoethanol Penicillin 100 UI/mL and Streptomycin 100 [ig/mL.
   Cells were cultured at 37'C under a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Cells were treated with increasing
30 concentrations of urolithin A (10 jiM, 20 jiM and 50 jiM). Treatment was performed for
   eight hours, after which cells were lysed and prepared for Western Blot analysis. Protein
   expression levels were examined for autophagy related proteins LC3-I and II (Cell
                                              -236-

   Signaling antibody #4108), p6 2 (Cell Signalling antibody #5114), AMPKa (Cell Signaling
   antibody #2603), and p-AMPKa (Cell Signaling antibody #2531). The housekeeping
   protein, HSP90 (BD Transduction Laboratories antibody #610418) level was measured as a
   loading control.
 5         Increasing concentrations of urolithin A resulted in increasing levels of
   phosphorylated AMPKa (Figure 14). The ratio of p-AMPKa/AMPKa increased in a dose
   dependent manner in response to treatment with urolithin A, ranging from 4-fold to over
   10-fold induction. Urolithin A treatment also resulted in significant increases in the LC3
   II/LC3-I ratio (a hallmark of autophagy), at all doses tested. The ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I
10 increased as high as 10-fold in treated cells as compared to the vehicle-treated cells at the
   doses tested. The levels of p62 decreased with the addition of urolithin A, in accordance
   with autophagy process. These results demonstrate the ability of urolithin A to induce
   autophagy.
           Induction of autophagy by urolithins was also demonstrated in mammalian primary
15 hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes were isolated by perfusion through the supra-hepatic
   inferior vena cava from 7- to 9-week-old wildtype C57BL/6J mice, as described previously
   (Ryu et al., 2011). Isolated primary hepatocytes were cultured in Medium 199 including
   4.5 g/L glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 10 mM HEPES and 50 gg/mL
   gentamicin. These cells were then treated with either 10 ptM, 20 [tM or 50 [tM of urolithin
20 A for a 16 hour period, after which cells were lysed and prepared for Western Blot analysis.
   Protein expression levels were examined for autophagy related proteins LC3-I and II (Cell
   Signaling antibody #4108), p6 2 (Cell Signalling antibody #5114), AMPKU (Cell Signaling
   antibody #2603), and p-AMPKa (Cell Signaling antibody #2531). The housekeeping
   protein, HSP90 (BD Transduction Laboratories antibody #610418) level was measured as a
25 loading control.
           Urolithin A treatment at 20 and 50 gM led to increased levels of phosphorylated
   AMPKa, with in treated cells the ratio of p-AMPKa/AMPK-a significantly rising well
   above 10-fold the ratio of p-AMPKa/AMPK-a observed in control cells. Importantly, a
   dose-dependent effect and increase in the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I was observed following
30 treatment with urolithin A, a hallmark of autophagy (Figure 15). P62 protein levels were
   observed to decrease following exposure to urolithin A. This dose effect of urolithin A on
   the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio, along with the decrease in p62, demonstrates the
   ability of urolithin A to induce autophagy in mammalian primary hepatocytes and
                                            -237-

   demonstrates a general autophagy activity of urolithins in primary cells.
   Example 13
   Urolithins Induce Autophagy Across Species in Mammalian Cells
           The ability of urolithins to induce autophagy in muscle cells across species was
 5 examined using mouse C2C12 myoblasts and human primary skeletal muscle cells.
           C2C12 myoblast were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)
   including 4.5 g/L glucose, 20% fetal calf serum, and 50 gg/mL gentamicin. Urolithin A
   was dissolved in DMSO in a stock solution of 1 mM.              Cells were treated at final
   concentrations of urolithin A of 10 gM, 20 gM, and 50 gM for a period 16 hours. Control
10 cells were treated with DMSO at an equivalent final concentration for the same period and
   served as the untreated control.
           Human primary skeletal myocytes were cultured in vitro and exposed to increasing
   concentrations of urolithin A, including 10 gM, 20 gM, and 50 gM for 16 hours. Human
   skeletal myoblasts were grown in DMEM plus 2% horse serum. Control cells were treated
15 with DMSO at an equivalent final concentration for the same period and served as the
   untreated control.
           At the end of treatment, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer and applied to SDS
   PAGE and analyzed by western blot.           Protein expression levels were examined for
   autophagy-related proteins LC3-I and LC3-II (Cell Signaling antibody #4108), p62 (Cell
20 Signaling antibody #5114), AMPKa (Cell Signaling antibody #2603), and p-AMPKa (Cell
   Signaling antibody #2531). The housekeeping protein, P-actin (Cell Signaling Antibody
   #4967) level was measured as a loading control. Representative results are shown in
   Figures 16 and 17.
           In both mouse C2C12 muscle cells (Figure 16) and human primary myoblasts
25 (Figure 17) urolithin A treatment led to a dose-dependent increase in autophagy as verified
   by an increase in the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I, accompanied by a decrease in the levels of
   p62, as observed by the change in density of the bands in the western blots.         Also,
   phosphorylated AMPKa (pAMPKa) levels increased, with the ratio of pAMPKa/AMPKa
   increasing several fold in response to exposure to urolithin A.
                                            -238-

   Example 14
   Urolithins Induce Autophagy in Primary Cells
           Human Aortic Endothelial Cells (HAOEC) are primary endothelial cells isolated
   from normal human aorta. They were sourced from Cell Applications Inc. (CAI), San
 5 Diego, USA and obtained cryopreserved at the second passage from the European
   Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC). The cells were thawed and cultured with Endothelial
   Cell Growth Medium, provided by the ECACC, catalog number 06091509 (CAI No. 211
   500), in a 37 'C, 5% CO 2 humidified incubator; media was changed 24 hours after thawing.
   Endothelial Cell Growth Medium was changed every other day until the cells reached 80%
10 confluency.    Cells were then subcultured into four 6-well dishes and after overnight
   incubation were treated with different concentrations of urolithin A, 10 gM, 20 gM, and 50
   gM, or a DMSO control for a period of 16 hours, 3 wells per treatment. Control cells were
   treated with DMSO at an equivalent final concentration for the same period and served as
   the untreated control.
15         At the end of treatment, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer and applied to SDS
   PAGE and analyzed by western blot.            Protein expression levels were examined for
   autophagy-related proteins LC3-I and LC3-II (Cell Signaling antibody #4108), and p62
   (Cell Signaling antibody #5114).      The housekeeping protein, HSP90 (BD Transduction
   Laboratories antibody #610418) level was measured as a loading control. Representative
20 results are shown in Figure 18.
           In human primary aortic endothelial cells (Figure 18) urolithin A treatment led to a
   dose-dependent increase in autophagy as verified by an increase in the ratio of LC3-II to
   LC3-I to as high as 3-fold induction at 50gM of urolithin A, which was also accompanied
   by a decrease in the levels of p62, as observed by the change in density of the bands in the
25 western blots.     These results clearly indicate that urolithins increase autophagy in
   endothelial cells.
   Example 15
   Urolithins Induce Autophagy in Mammals
           To determine the ability of urolithin A to induce autophagy in vivo, healthy 10
30 week-old C57BL/6J mice were treated with either a standard rodent diet or a diet containing
   urolithin A mixed with food to reach a dosing of 55 mg/kg/day delivered to the mice.
                                             -239-

   Following 8 weeks of treatment with urolithin A, mice were sacrificed and the liver of each
   animal was surgically isolated. The isolated livers were then placed in lysis buffer and
   prepared for western blot analysis.
           Protein expression levels were examined for autophagy related proteins LC3-I and
 5 LC3-II (Cell Signaling antibody #4108), p 6 2 (Cell Signalling antibody #5114), AMPKU
   (Cell Signaling antibody #2603), and p-AMPKa (Cell Signaling antibody #2531). The
   housekeeping protein, HSP90 (BD Transduction Laboratories antibody #610418) level was
   measured as a loading control. Each lane in the Western blot represents a protein sample for
   the liver of a single mouse, to permit observation of the effects aver a number of treated
10 animals.
           Urolithin A treatment at an oral dose of 55 mg/kg/d that was admixed into the
   animal chow diet led to increased levels of phosphorylated AMPKU (pAMPKa), as well as
   an increase in the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I, a hallmark of autophagy, in a healthy mouse
   liver following oral consumption (Figure 19). The increase in autophagy induced by the
15 oral treatment was observed to be on average approximately 400% over the control
   untreated mice based on the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I. p62 protein levels also decreased with
   utolithin A treatment. These results demonstrate the ability of urolithin A to induce
   autophagy in mammalian cells and tissues following oral consumption.
   Example 16
20 Urolithin A Improves Motor Activity in Mammals
           To examine the effect of urolithin A treatment on activity and muscle function in
   mammals, 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice were treated with either a standard rodent diet or a
   diet containing urolithin A mixed with food to reach a dosing of 55 mg/kg/day delivered to
   the mice. Following 11 weeks of treatment with urolithin A, a 23 cm in diameter running
25 wheel was placed in the cage of each mouse. Spontaneous exercise activity was measured
   over a five day period at 20 min intervals, allowing the capture of the circadian rhythm of
   the exercise activity.
           Urolithin A treatment resulted in a significant and sustained increase in the distance
   covered by the mice each day (Figure 20). During the initial 3 days the urolithin A treated
30 animals showed an increase of 25% over untreated controls in the cumulative distance
   covered. This difference increased further to 29% on the final two days tested. These
   results demonstrate the ability of urolithin A treatment to improve motor activity in
                                             - 240 -

   mammals. A clear training effect was observed in which mice administered urolithin A not
   only increased their spontaneous running activity, but there was an increase over time.
   Additionally, this demonstrated that the benefits persist over time.
   Example 17
 5 Urolithin A Improves Motor Activity in Aged Mammals
           To examine the effects of urolithin A treatment on motor activity in aged mammals
   17-month-old C57BL/6J mice were treated with either a high fat rodent diet or a high fat
   rodent diet containing urolithin A mixed with food to reach a dosing of 50 mg/kg/day
   delivered to the mice.
10       Following 30 weeks of treatment with urolithin A, mice were housed individually and
   a 23 cm diameter running wheel was placed in the cage of each mouse.            Spontaneous
   exercise activity was measured continuously over a two day period allowing the capture of
   the circadian rhythm of the exercise activity. Afterwards, mice were returned to their home
   cages.
15         Mice became habituated to the presence of the activity wheel on day 1. To measure
   the effect of urolithin A treatment on activity as well as muscle function, the cumulative
   distance that animals covered during the peak running period (dark phase) of day 2 was
   measured. As shown in Figure 21, urolithin A treatment resulted in an increase of 57%
   (p<0.05) in cumulative distance run in treated aged mice fed a high fat diet. This clearly
20 shows the positive benefits of urolithins on spontaneous activity and running during aging.
   This provides evidence that the delivery of urolithin to an aging population will improve
   locomotor activity and running ability and help prevent the natural decline observed.
   Example 18
   Urolithin A Improves Muscle Strength in Aged Mammals
25         To examine the effects of urolithin A treatment on muscle function in aged
   mammals, 17-month-old C57BL/6J mice were treated with either a high fat rodent diet or a
   high fat rodent diet containing urolithin A mixed with food to reach a dosing of 50
   mg/kg/day delivered to the mice.
           Following 26 weeks of treatment with urolithin A, mice were assessed for their
30 neuromuscular function by means of a grip test. Using the grip test, one can measure the
   forelimb grip strength of mice. Mice were placed on a grid to enable their fore paws grasp
                                            - 241 -

   the support. To measure the grip strength, mice are pulled backward in the sensor axis until
   they are no longer able to hold the grid.
           Representative results are presented in Figure 22.      Mice receiving urolithin A
   showed a greater grip strength than untreated mice.
 5 Example 19
   Urolithin A Improves Locomotor Activity in Aged Mammals
           Locomotor activity may be also assessed by measuring animal movements using
   infrared detection.   To determine the effects of urolithin A on spontaneous locomotor
   activity in aged animals, 16-month-old C57BL/6J mice were treated with either a standard
10 rodent diet or a diet containing urolithin A mixed with food to reach a dosing of 50
   mg/kg/day delivered to mice. Following 34 weeks of treatment with urolithin A, mice were
   placed in a locomotor activity monitoring system, TSE Systems. Infrared transmitters and
   receivers are placed in the x, y, and z axis. Interruption of the infrared beams in the x, y
   axis by the passage of the mouse, allows for a measurement of the horizontal movement
15 (ambulation). Interruption of the infrared beams in the z axis by the mouse, allows for the
   measurement of rearing behavior.       Each beam interruption results in one count being
   recorded. Total counts were measured for each 30 minute period over a two day period.
   The total counts observed during the 12 hour dark period, which corresponds to the time of
   highest activity in mice, were summed for each animal.
20         Figure 23 shows that aged mice treated with urolithin A showed a 14% increase in
   ambulation and a 25% increase in rearing. These results demonstrate the ability of urolithin
   A to increase mobility in aged animals.
   Example 20
   Urolithin A Increases Autophagy in Skeletal Muscle of Aged Mammals
25         Following 34 weeks of treatment, the mice from Example 19 were sacrificed and the
   organs were collected.     The gastrocnemius muscles were assessed for the presence of
   autophagy by the assessment of the change in the ratio of the autophagy markers LC3 and
   p62 using western blot analysis.      Each lane corresponds to a muscle sample from an
   individual mouse.     Representative results are shown in Figure 24.      The ratio of LC3
30 II/LC3-I increased in the muscles of urolithin A (UA)-treated mice versus untreated mice.
   This was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of p62 in the muscles of UA treated
                                             - 242 -

   versus untreated mice. These shifts in the levels of LC3 and p62 in the muscle of mice are
   consistent with an increase in the level of autophagy taking place. This demonstrates that
   the oral administration of urolithin A leads to autophagy at the organ level, including
   muscle. Mice receiving UA in their diets also displayed an increase activation of AMPK in
 5 their muscle as observed by an increase in the ratio of p-AMPKa/AMPKa.

   Urolithins Induce Autophagy in Mouse Muscle Cells
           To determine the ability of urolithin A to induce autophagy in mouse muscle cells,
   undifferentiated C2C 12 mouse myoblasts were seeded in T25 flasks and incubated
10 overnight. Cells were incubated in 5% CO 2 at 370 C. These cells were treated with one of
   the urolithins - urolithin A (UA), urolithin B (UB), urolithin C (UC) or urolithin D (UD)
   dissolved in a 0.1% solution of DMSO for 24 hours. In one experiment UA, UB, UC and
   UD were dosed at a concentration of 100 iM for C2C12 myoblast treatment. In a separate
   study, C2C12 myoblasts were incubated at increasing concentrations of UA (10 jiM, 50 jiM
15 and 100 jiM). For each experiment a control culture was treated with 0.1 % DMSO for the
   same period and served as the untreated control. In the final 30 minutes of incubation,
   lysosome degradation inhibitor was added to the culture. The cells were then washed with
   phosphate buffer solution and then treated with a 1% solution of trypsin enzyme to remove
   the adhesive cells from the cell culture dishes.     The cells were then treated with EMD
20 Millipore selective permeabilization reagent to permeabilize the cells so as to make the
   internal cellular proteins accessible to antibody treatment. Cells were then incubated with
   antibody to LC3B according to kit protocol (EMD Millipore FlowCellect         TM  Autophagy
   LC3 Antibody-based Assay Kit (Cat no. FCCH100171)). The cells were then washed and
   resuspended in the kit assay buffer.     The resulting cells were then run through a flow
25 cytometer and LC3B-FITC fluorescence was quantified to measure the level of LC3B in
   C2C12 cells for the various treatments. When cells undergo autophagy their intracellular
   levels of LC3-II increase which is detected by this method. This autophagy can be detected
   by fluorescent antibody labeling of LC3B, which can be measured quantitatively using flow
   cytometry.    An increase in cellular autophagy is reflected by an increasing signal in the
30 histogram of LC3B FITC.
           Urolithin A treatment of C2C12 cells results in an increase in LC3B expression that
   is dose dependent (Figure 25) demonstrating the ability of urolithin A to induce autophagy
                                            - 243 -

   in mouse muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner (10 jiM, 50 jiM and 100 jiM). In a
   separate study, induction of autophagy was also observed in C2C12 mouse myoblasts
   following treatment with urolithin A (UA), urolithin B (UB), urolithin C (UC) and urolithin
   D (UD) at 100 jiM after 24 hrs of treatment (Figure 26). Incubation with UA, UB, UC and
 5 UD all led to a increasing signal of LC3B as shown by the positive shift of the histogram.
   This data demonstrates the ability of the urolithins as a class of compounds to induce
   autophagy in mammalian myoblasts.

   Figure 27 as compounds 17 through 25.
           Figure 28 describes methods to synthesize the compounds 1 to 25 to enable their
   therapeutic use in the present invention. Several chemical reactions are conserved and the
15 details are provided below as Reactions A, B, C and D.
           Reaction A
           Oxalyl chloride (1 eq.) and dimethylformamide (cat.) were added to a suspension of
   the benzoic acid (1 eq.) in dichloromethane. The reaction mixture was stirred for 16 hours
   at room temperature      and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was
20 immediately solubilized in dichloromethane and cooled to 00 C. The phenol (1.1 eq.) and
   triethylamine (1.5 eq.) were successively added and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes.
   Acetonitrile was finally added and the resulting solution was stirred for 16 hours at room
   temperature. The reaction was quenched by addition of a saturated solution of ammonium
   chloride and the layers were separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with
25 dichloromethane and the combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulphate, filtered
   and concentrated     under reduced pressure.      The   crude was     purified by column
   chromatography on silica gel.
           Reaction B
            Sodium acetate (2 eq.), (S)-Phos (0.1 eq.) and palladium diacetate (0.1 eq.) were
30 successively added to a solution of the ester (1 eq.) in dimethylacetamide under an argon
   atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 130'C for 3 days. The reaction was
                                           - 244 -

   quenched by addition of water and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane. The
   combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate and
   concentrated under reduced pressure. The remaining dimethylacetamide was eliminated
   using a Hickman apparatus. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica
 5 gel.
           Reaction C
           Boron tribromide (1.25 eq. by methoxy moiety) was added to a solution of the
   protected urolithin (1 eq.) in chloroform. The mixture was then heated up to 60'C and
   stirred for 4 days. The reaction was quenched by addition of methanol and the mixture was
10 evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by column chromatography on Cis.
           Reaction D
           A mixture of the diphenol (2 eq.), the bromobenzoic acid (1 eq.) and NaOH (2.2 eq.)
   in water was heated at reflux and stirred for 2 hours. Water and CuSO4-5H20 (0.1 eq.) were
   added and the mixture was stirred under reflux for an additional 1 hour. The reaction was
15 then cooled down to room temperature and the precipitate was filtered on a glass frit
   (porosity 4). The product was then dissolved in absolute ethanol and concentrated in order
   to remove water. The residue was dissolved in hot methanol and filtered on paper.
