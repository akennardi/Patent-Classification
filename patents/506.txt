                                                                 TECHNICAL FIELD
   The present disclosure relates to novel uses and regimens for preventing or reducing risk of
10 experiencing a recurrent cardiovascular (CV) event or a cerebrovascular event in a patient
   that has suffered of a qualifying CV event, which employ an IL-1I                             binding antibody or
   functional fragments thereof, e.g., canakinumab.
                                                  BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
   Atherosclerosis is a disease characterized by chronically high inflammatory state. Arterial
15 inflammation and                         endothelial         dysfunction play key    roles at all stages   of the
   atherothrombotic process. Inflammatory mediators are intimately implicated with the
   cascade of events leading to atherosclerotic plaque initiation, progression and rupture.
   Vascular endothelial cells express a variety of adhesion molecules that recruit monocytes
   when chronically exposed to noxious stimuli or pathological conditions. Adverse
20 conditions such as hyperlipidemia are associated with enrichment of a pro-inflammatory
   subset of monocytes. These monocytes apparently enter the intima under the influence of
   chemotactic stimuli and engulf modified low density lipoprotein (LDL) and cholesterol
   crystals (Duewell et al 2010).                                 The material internalized by phagocytes    induces
   phagolysosomal damage and subsequent leakage of contents into cytosol to activate
25 inflammasomes and caspase 1, and consequently the generation of interleukin-lb (IL-ip)
   from pro-interleukin- 1P.
   Interleukins are key mediators in the chronic vascular inflammatory response in
   cardiovascular (CV) disease and have been demonstrated in animal models and in humans
   to

    WO 2013/049278                                                           PCT/US2012/057444

   be potent modulators of pro-inflammatory processes. The fact that these cytokines and their
   receptors are highly expressed and are functional in almost all cell types implicated in the
   pathogenesis of atherosclerosis including smooth muscle cells, certain subset of macrophages
   and T cells as well as endothelium support the role of interleukins in vascular disease. For
 5 example, IL-Ip is a potent smooth muscle cell mitogen, an activator of endothelial cells and
   increases extra cellular matrix and collagen deposition, which plays a role in plaque burden
   and arterial thickening. Furthermore, lack of IL-Ip or ablation of IL-I receptor has been
   shown to decrease severity of atherosclerosis in apoE deficient mice. Thus, antagonism of the
   IL-1p mediated inflammation is a primary and attractive target for ameliorating the vessel
10 wall inflammation associated with atherosclerosis.
   WO2010/138939 generally relates to a method of treating cardiovascular disorders with an
   IL-1 P antibody. However it does not disclose a method of preventing or reducing risk of
   recurrent CV events or a cerebrovascular event.
15                               SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
   Inflammation contributes to all phases of the atherothrombotic process and patients with
   elevated inflammatory biomarkers such as hsCRP have increased vascular risk. The present
   disclosure relates, in part, to the finding that direct inhibition of inflammation by
20 administration of IL-1P binding antibodies will reduce cardiovascular event rates.
   Accordingly, the present disclosure is directed to a method of preventing or reducing risk of
   experiencing a recurrent cardiovascular (CV) event or a cerebrovascular event in a patient that
   has suffered of a qualifying CV event, comprising administering about 25 mg to about 300
25 mg of an IL-1 P binding antibody or functional fragment thereof, wherein said patient has a
   level of hsCRP of about >1 mg/L before administration of said antibody or functional
   fragment thereof.
   Further features and advantages of the disclosure will become apparent from the following
30 detailed description of the invention.

                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE
   The present invention provides, inter alia, methods of preventing or reducing risk of
   experiencing a recurrent cardiovascular (CV) event or a cerebrovascular event in a patient that
   has suffered of a qualifying CV event, comprising administering about 25 mg to about 300
15 mg of an IL-Ip binding antibody or functional fragment thereof, wherein said patient has a
   CRP level of > about 1 mg/L before administration of said antibody or functional fragment
   thereof.
   Canakinumab is a fully human monoclonal anti-human IL-1P antibody of the IgG 1/k isotype,
20 being developed for the treatment of IL-1P driven inflammatory diseases. It is designed to
   bind to human IL- 1P and thus blocks the interaction of this cytokine with its receptors. The
   antagonism of the IL- 1P mediated inflammation using canakinumab in lowering high
   sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and other inflammatory marker levels has shown an
   acute phase response in patients with Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) and
25 rheumatoid arthritis. This evidence has been replicated in patients with type 2 diabetes
   mellitus (T2DM) using canakinumab and with other IL- 1P antibody therapies in development.
   Atherosclerotic vascular disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals
   with and without T2DM. The progression of atherosclerosis from endothelial dysfunction to
   vascular occlusion or to plaque rupture is the underlying mechanism responsible for many
30 debilitating and life-threatening diseases such as MI, stroke and peripheral vascular disease
   (PVD). These diseases occur at higher frequency in T2DM patients and continue to increase

    WO 2013/049278                                                                PCT/US2012/057444
                                                       5
   despite use of current optimal therapies. There is also higher mortality rate after first MI in
   patients with T2DM compared to those without T2DM. Mortality associated with impaired
   glucose tolerance is 1.96 times higher compared to normal glucose tolerance. Thus, novel
   therapies that may improve vascular function, decrease atherosclerotic burden, and translate to
 5 a decrease in cardiovascular events would fill a significant unmet medical need.
   T2DM is also a disease that is characterized by a high inflammatory state. Pre-clinical data
   suggests IL-1 P is of key importance in the progressive functional impairment and destruction
   of p-cells in type 2 diabetes. Pancreatic $ cells secrete IL-I$ in response to elevated glucose
10 exposure promoting further impairment of cellular viability via an autocrine action. IL-I$
   antagonism inhibits    P cell death, promotes    P cell proliferation, potentiates  P  cell glucose
   induced insulin secretion and improves insulin sensitivity. Blocking IL-1P activity with an IL
    1 receptor antagonist as well as a neutralizing IL-1P antibody in clinical trials reduced HbAlc.
   Neutralization of IL-1 P activity in the pancreatic islets is thus emerging as an attractive target
15 for the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes. For T2DM prevention canakinumab's
   primary direct action is expected to prevent the IL-1 P mediated destruction of pancreatic p
   cells and thus prevent or delay progression of disease, which to date is a completely unmet
   need.
   As demonstrated in a comprehensive 2010 meta-analysis of 54 prospective cohort studies, the
20 inflammatory biomarker hsCRP is an independent risk factor for future cardiovascular events
   that (a) has a magnitude of effect similar to or larger than that of blood pressure or cholesterol
   and (b) has long-term stability and reproducibility at least as good as these widely-accepted
   risk factors (Kaptoge et al 2010). Abundant clinical trial data further demonstrate that
   persistent elevations of hsCRP are a major risk factor of recurrent vascular risk following
25 myocardial infarction; for example, as demonstrated in the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 (Ridker et al
   2005) and A-to-Z (Morrow et al 2006) trials. In both trials patients with known vascular
   disease and persistent elevation of hsCRP were at roughly double the risk for recurrent events
   compared to those with normal hsCRP levels. Further, stratification by hsCRP has proven
   highly effective in determining populations in who added cardiovascular benefits are observed
30 with the use of efficacious lipid lowering agents, which also possess anti-inflammatory
   properties.   This has been proven in primary prevention studies as                  including the
   AFCAPS/TexCAPS (Ridker et al 2001) and JUPITER trials (Ridker et al 2008, Ridker et al

    WO 2013/049278                                                                 PCT/US2012/057444
                                                        6
   2009) as well as in the setting of congestive heart failure (CHF) in the CORONA trial where
   efficacy of intervention was seen only among those with hsCRP > 2 mg/L. Indeed, in this
   latter example, had stratification been done by hsCRP on an a priori basis, the trial would
   have been reported out as an overwhelming positive rather than as a null finding (McMurray
 5 et al 2009).
   A direct anti-inflammatory agent could, in theory, be effective at any stage of the
   atherothrombotic process. However, the most appropriate population for a treatment with such
   an agent is one in which (a) patients are known to be at increased risk despite current therapy,
   and (b) there is biochemical evidence of a persistent heightened inflammatory response
10 despite usual care. Recognizing these constraints, a primary prevention population would be
   infeasible due to the exceptionally large sample size required and because an extremely low
   side effect profile is typically required in that setting. In contrast, patients who have survived
   a MI are clinically stable, and who have persistently elevated hsCRP levels despite aggressive
   treatment are an optimal population in which to undertake a test of the inflammatory
15 hypothesis of atherothrombosis. This population is no longer at risk for plaque rupture due to
   altered wound healing, yet remains at high risk for recurrent vascular events despite use of all
   accepted therapies.
   Canakinumab and other IL-I beta inhibiting agents, in particular other IL-1p binding
   antibodies, will reduce the risk of future occurrence of major cardiovascular events or
20 cerebrovascular events in patients with recent past myocardial infarction (MI) by preventing
   IL-1 P mediated vascular wall inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.

   General:
           All patents, published patent applications, publications, references and other material
   referred to herein are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
   As used herein, the term "comprising" encompasses "including" as well as "consisting," e.g. a
10 composition "comprising" X may consist exclusively of X or may include something
   additional, e.g., X + Y.
   As used herein, the term "administering" in relation to a compound, e.g., an IL-1p binding
   antibody or standard of care agent, is used to refer to delivery of that compound by any route
15 of delivery.
   As used herein, the term "assaying" is used to refer to the act of detecting, identifying,
   screening, or determining, which act may be performed by any conventional means.              For
   example, a sample may be assayed for the presence of a particular marker by using an ELISA
20 assay, a Northern blot, imaging, etc. to detect whether that marker is present in the sample.
   As used herein, The term "about" in relation to a numerical value x means, for example, +/
    10%.
25 As used herein, The word "substantially" does not exclude "completely," e.g., a composition
   which is "substantially free" from Y may be completely free from Y. Where necessary, the
   word "substantially" may be omitted from the definition of the disclosure.
   As used herein, "C-reactive protein" and "CRP" refers to serum C-reactive protein, which is
30 used as an indicator of the acute phase response to inflammation. The level of CRP in plasma
   may be given in any concentration, e.g., mg/dl, mg/L, nmol/L. Levels of CRP may be
   measured by a variety of well known methods, e.g., radial immunodiffusion,

    WO 2013/049278                                                              PCT/US2012/057444
                                                       23
   electroimmunoassay, immunoturbidimetry, ELISA, turbidimetric methods, fluorescence
   polarization immunoassay, and laser nephelometry.
   Testing for CRP may employ a standard CRP test or a high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) test (i.e.,
   a high sensitivity test that is capable of measuring low levels of CRP in a sample using laser
 5 nephelometry). Kits for detecting levels of CRP may be purchased from various companies,
   e.g., Calbiotech, Inc, Cayman Chemical, Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Abazyme, DADE
   Behring, Abnova Corporation, Aniara Corporation, Bio-Quant Inc., Siemens Healthcare
   Diagnostics, etc.
   As used herein, the term "hsCRP" refers to the level of CRP in the blood as measured by high
10 sensitivity CRP testing.
   Each local laboratory will employ a cutoff value for abnormal (high) CRP based on that
   laboratory's rule for calculating normal maximum CRP. A physician generally orders a CRP
   test from a local laboratory, and the local laboratory reports normal or abnormal (low or high)
   CRP using the rule that particular laboratory employs to calculate normal CRP.
15
   By "IL-l $ binding antibody" is meant any antibody capable of binding to the IL- 1 antigen
   either alone or associated with other molecules.       The binding reaction may be shown by
   standard methods (qualitative assays) including, for example, a bioassay for determining the
   inhibition of IL-1$ binding to its receptor or any kind of binding assays, with reference to a
20 negative control test in which an antibody of unrelated specificity but of the same isotype, e.g.
   an anti-CD25 antibody, is used. Advantageously, the binding of the IL- 1$ binding antibodies
   used in the methods of the invention to IL- 1$ may be shown in a competitive binding assay.
   As used herein the term "antibody" as referred to herein includes whole antibodies and any
25 antigen binding fragment or single chains thereof (i.e., "functional fragment"). A naturally
   occurring "antibody" is a glycoprotein comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light
   (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy
   chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The
   heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CHI, CH2 and CH3. Each light
30 chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain
   constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and
   VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity

    WO 2013/049278                                                              PCT/US2012/057444
                                                      24
   determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed
   framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs arranged
   from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FRI, CDR1, FR2, CDR2,
   FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding
 5 domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the
   binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the
   immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical
   complement system.
   As used herein, the term "functional fragment" of an antibody as used herein, refers to
10 portions or fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen
   (e.g., IL-1p). It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be
   performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of binding fragments
   encompassed within the term "functional fragment" of an antibody include a Fab fragment, a
   monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CHI domains; a F(ab)2 fragment, a
15 bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge
   region; a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHI domains; a Fv fragment consisting of the
   VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; a dAb fragment (Ward et al., 1989), which
   consists of a VH domain; and an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR).
   Exemplary antigen binding sites include the CDRs of canakinumab as set forth in SEQ ID
20 NOs: 3-5 and SEQ ID NOs: 6-8. Although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH,
   are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a
   synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH
   regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see, e.g., Bird
   et al., 1988; and Huston et al., 1988). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be
25 encompassed within the term "functional fragments" of an antibody.              These antibody
   fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art, and
   the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies.
   As used herein, the terms "monoclonal antibody" or "monoclonal antibody composition" as
30 used herein refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. A
   monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a
   particular epitope.

    WO 2013/049278                                                                PCT/US2012/057444
                                                       25
   As used herein, the term "human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies
   having variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from
   sequences of human origin. Furthermore, if the antibody contains a constant region, the
   constant region also is derived from such human sequences, e.g., human germline sequences,
 5 or mutated versions of human germline sequences or antibody containing consensus
   framework sequences derived from human framework sequences analysis as described in
   Knappik, et al. A "human antibody" need not be produced by a human, human tissue or
   human cell. The human antibodies of the disclosure may include amino acid residues not
   encoded by human sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific
10 mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo). However, the term "human antibody",
   as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from
   the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human
   framework sequences.
15 As used herein, the term "KD", as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant,
   which is obtained from the ratio of Kd to Ka (i.e. Kd/Ka) and is expressed as a molar
   concentration (M).       KD  values for antibodies can be determined using methods well
   established in the art. A method for determining the KD of an antibody is by using surface
   plasmon resonance, or using a biosensor system such as a Biacore@ system.
20
   As used herein, the term "patient" includes any human or nonhuman animal. The term
   "nonhuman animal" includes all vertebrates, e.g., mammals and non-mammals, such as
   nonhuman primates, sheep, dogs, cats, horses, cows, chickens, amphibians, reptiles, etc.
25 As used herein, an antibody that "inhibits" one or more of these IL-lpfunctional properties
   (e.g., biochemical, immunochemical, cellular, physiological or other biological activities, or
   the like) as determined according to methodologies known to the art and described herein,
   will be understood to relate to a statistically significant decrease in the particular activity
   relative to that seen in the absence of the antibody (or when a control antibody of irrelevant
30 specificity is present). An antibody that inhibits IL-1P activity affects a statistically significant
   decrease, e.g., by at least 10% of the measured parameter, by at least 50%, 8 0% or 9 0%, and
   in certain embodiments an antibody of the disclosure may inhibit greater than 95%, 98% or
   99% of IL-17 functional activity.

    WO 2013/049278                                                              PCT/US2012/057444
                                                      26
   As used herein the term "polypeptide", if not otherwise specified herein, includes any peptide
   or protein comprising amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds, having an amino
   acid sequence starting at the N-terminal extremity and ending at the C-terminal extremity.
 5
   As used herein, the term "qualifying CV event" is MI, stroke, unstable angina,
   revascularization, stent thrombosis, acute coronary syndrome or any other CV event
   (excluding cardiovascular death) which precedes the start of IL-1p binding antibody or
   functional fragment thereof therapy. In particular MI is a preferred qualifying CV event.
10
   As used herein, the term "recurrent CV event" is a repeated CV event including but not
   limited to CV death, MI , or acute coronary syndrome which takes place after said qualifying
   CV event.
15 As used herein "cerebrovascular disease" is a group of brain dysfunctions related to disease of
   the blood vessels supplying the brain. This definition includes but are not limited to stroke.
   As used herein, the term "cardiovascular death" includes sudden cardiac death, death due to
   acute myocardial infarction, death due to heart failure, death due to stroke, and death due to
   other cardiovascular causes.
20 As used herein, "sudden cardiac death" is a sudden death that occurs in a previously stable
   patient who does not have a prior terminal condition, such as malignancy not in remission or
   end-stage chronic lung disease.
   Death due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI): refers to a death within 30 days after a
   myocardial infarction (MI) related to consequences seen immediately after the myocardial
25 infarction, such as progressive congestive heart failure (CHF), inadequate cardiac output, or
   recalcitrant arrhythmia. If these events occur after a "break" (e.g., a CHF and arrhythmia free
   period), they should be designated by the immediate cause. The acute myocardial infarction
   should be verified either by the diagnostic criteria outlined for acute myocardial infarction or
   by autopsy findings showing recent myocardial infarction or recent coronary thrombus, and
30 there should be no conclusive evidence of another cause of death.
   Sudden, unexpected cardiac death, involving cardiac arrest, often with symptoms suggestive
   of myocardial ischemia, and accompanied by presumably new ST elevation, or new LBBB

    WO 2013/049278                                                            PCT/US2012/057444
                                                     27
   and/or evidence of fresh thrombus by coronary angiography and/or at autopsy, but death
   occurring before blood samples could be obtained, or at a time before the appearance of
   cardiac biomarkers in the blood should be considered death due to acute myocardial
   infarction.
 5 If death occurs before biochemical confirmation of myocardial necrosis can be obtained,
   adjudication should be based on clinical presentation and ECG evidence.
   Death resulting from a procedure to treat myocardial ischemia or to treat a complication
   resulting from myocardial infarction should also be considered death due to acute MI.
   Death due to a myocardial infarction that occurs as a direct consequence of a cardiovascular
10 investigation/procedure/operation should be classified as death due to other cardiovascular
   cause.
   Death due to heart failure or cardiogenic shock refers to death occurring in the context of
   clinically worsening symptoms and/or signs of heart without evidence of another cause of
   death.
15 Death due to heart failure or cardiogenic shock should include sudden death occurring during
   an admission for worsening heart failure as well as death from progressive heart failure or
   cardiogenic shock following implantation of a mechanical assist device.
   Death due to stroke (intracranial hemorrhage or non-hemorrhagic stroke) refers to death
   occurring up to 30 days after a suspected stroke based on clinical signs and symptoms as well
20 as neuroimaging and/or autopsy, and where there is no conclusive evidence of another cause
   of death.
   As used herein, "death due to other cardiovascular causes" refers to death due to a
   cardiovascular cause not included in the above categories (e.g. dysrhythmia, pulmonary
   embolism, cardiovascular intervention, aortic aneurysm rupture, or peripheral arterial
25 disease). Mortal complications of cardiac surgery or non-surgical revascularization, even if
   "non-cardiovascular" in nature, should be classified as cardiovascular deaths.
   As used herein the term "death of undetermined cause" (presumed cardiovascular) refers to all
   deaths not attributed to the categories of cardiovascular Death or to a non-cardiovascular
   cause are considered presumed cardiovascular deaths. As used herein, "non-cardiovascular
30 death" is defined as any death not covered by cardiac death or vascular death and is

 5 the term myocardial infarction (MI) should be used when there is evidence of myocardial
   necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischemia. Under these conditions any
   one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for MI.
   The term "spontaneous MI" refers to the detection of rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers
   with at least one value above the     9 9 th percentile of the upper reference limit (URL) together
10 with evidence of myocardial ischemia with at least one of the following: symptoms of
   ischemia, ECG changes indicative of new ischemia), development of pathological                 Q waves   in
   the ECG, imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion
   abnormality.
   The term "percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) related myocardial infarct" refers to PCI
15 in patients with normal baseline troponin values elevations of cardiac biomarkers above the
   99th percentile URL within 24 hours of the procedure are indicative of peri-procedural
   myocardial necrosis. By convention increases of biomarkers greater than 3 x               9 9 th percentile
   URL are consistent with PCI related myocardial infarction. If the cardiac biomarker is
   elevated prior to PCI a > 20% increase of the value in that second cardiac biomarker within 24
20 hours of the PCI and documentation that cardiac biomarkers were decreasing (two samples at
   least 6 hours apart) prior to the suspected recurrent MI is also consistent with PCI related MI.
   Symptoms of cardiac ischemia are not required
   The term "CABG related myocardial infarct" refers to CABG in patients with normal baseline
   troponin, elevations of cardiac biomarkers above 5 times the       9 9 th percentile of the normal
25 reference range during the first 72 hours after CABG, when associated with either new
   pathological  Q waves   in at least 2 contiguous leads on the ECG that persist through 30days or
   new left bundle branch block (LBBB) or angiographically documented new graft or native
   coronary artery occlusion or imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium
30 If the cardiac biomarker is elevated prior to CABG a > 20% increase of the value in the
   second cardiac biomarker within 72 hours of CABG AND documentation that the cardiac
   biomarkers were decreasing (2 samples at least 6 hours apart) prior to the suspected recurrent

   MI plus either new pathological     Q waves     in at least 2 contiguous leads on the ECG or new
   LBBB, angiographically documented new graft or native artery occlusion or imaging
   evidence or new loss of viable myocardium is consistent with a peri-procedural myocardial
   infarct after CABG. Symptoms of cardiac ischemia are not required.
 5 Criteria for Prior Myocardial Infarction: Any of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for
   prior myocardial infarction: development of new pathological               Q  waves with or without
   symptoms, imaging evidence of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and
   fails to contract in the absence of a non-ischemic cause, pathological findings of a healed or
   healing myocardial infarction
10 ECG changes associated with prior Myocardial Infarction:
   * Any     Q wave   in leads V2-V3 > 0.02 seconds or QS complex in leads V2 and V3
   *    Q-wave > 0.03 seconds and > 0.1 mV deep or QS complex in leads I, II, aVL, aVF, or V4
        V6 in any two leads of a contiguous lead grouping (I, aVL, V6, V4-V6, II, III, and aVF)
   * R-wave > 0.04 seconds in V1-V2 and R/S > 1 with a concordant positive T-wave in the
15      absence of a conduction defect
   Criterion for Reinfarction: In patients where recurrent MI is suspected from clinical signs or
   symptoms following the initial infarction, an immediate measurement of the employed
   cardiac biomarker is recommended. A second sample should be obtained 3-6 hours later.
   Recurrent infarction is diagnosed if there is a > 20% increase of the value in the second
20 sample. This value should exceed the      9 9 th percentile URL. However if cardiac biomarkers are
   elevated prior to the suspected new MI, there must also be documentation of decreasing
   values (two samples at least 6 hours apart) prior to the suspected new MI. If the values are
   falling criteria for reinfarction by further measurement of biomarkers together with features of
   the ECG or imaging can be applied.
25 ECG diagnosis of reinfarction following the initial infarction : may be confounded by the
   initial evolutionary ECG changes. Reinfarction should be considered when the ST elevation >
   0.1 mV reoccurs in an inpatient having a lesser degree of ST elevation or new pathognomonic
   Q-waves, in at least two contiguous leads, particularly when associated with ischemic
   symptoms for 10 minutes or longer, The re-evaluation of the ST segment can, however also
30 be seen in threatening myocardial rupture and should lead to additional diagnostic work-up.

    WO 2013/049278                                                             PCT/US2012/057444
                                                       30
   ST depression or LBBB on their own should not be considered valid criteria for Myocardial
   Infarction.
   If biomarkers are increasing or peak is not reached then there is insufficient data to diagnose
   recurrent MI.
 5 Clinical Classification of different types of Myocardial Infarction : for each MI identified a
   Type of MI will be assigned using the following guidelines:
   * Type 1 - Spontaneous MI related to ischemia due to a primary coronary event such as
       plaque erosion and/or rupture, fissuring or dissection.
   * Type 2 - MI secondary to ischemia due to either increased oxygen demand or decreased
10      supply, e.g. coronary artery spasm, anemia, hypotension, coronary embolism, arrhythmias,
       hypertension or hypotension.
   * Type 3 -Sudden unexpected cardiac death including cardiac arrest, often with symptoms
        suggestive of myocardial ischemia accompanied by presumably new ST elevation, or new
       LBBB, or evidence of fresh thrombus in a coronary artery by angiography and/or at
15      autopsy, but death occurring before blood samples could be obtained or at a time before
       the appearance of cardiac biomarkers in the blood.
   * Type 4a -MI associated with PCI.
   * Type 4b -MI associated with stent thrombosis as documented by autopsy or angiography.
   * Type 5 -MI associated with CABG.

   The term "silent MI": the following criteria will be used by the central ECG reading vendor
   to define interval "silent" (no clinical symptoms or signs) MI between baseline and yearly
   ECGs:
   Criteria for MI (Surawcz, Ed : Chou's Electrocardiography in Clinical Practice, 5th Edition,
25 2001).
   Myocardial infarctions are reported only on the basis of pathologic    Q waves.   Pathologic  Q
   waves are defined as    Q wave duration > 40ms   and Q/R ratio = 1/3.
   Any   Q wave in VI    or V2 that is followed by an R wave should be considered abnormal.

    WO 2013/049278                                                                  PCT/US2012/057444
                                                          31
   When pathologic     Q waves   (i.e., myocardial infarction) are present, ST elevation or T wave
   inversion may be used to classify the infraction as New or Acute. However, ST elevation or T
   wave inversion in the absence of pathologic       Q waves    are not sufficient criteria for diagnosis
   of myocardial infarction.
 5      0 Anterolateral MI - Pathologic      Q waves in leads V3-V6.
        * Anterior MI - Pathologic      Q waves   in V3 and V4.
        * Anteroseptal MI - Pathologic      Q waves    or QS in leads V1-V4.
        * Extensive Anterior MI - Pathologic       Q waves in leads   I, aVL, and V1-V6.
        * High lateral MI - Pathologic      Q waves in leads   I and aVL.
10      0 Inferior MI - Pathologic     Q waves or   QS in at least two of the inferior leads: aVF, III,
            II.
        * Lateral MI - Pathologic      Q waves  in leads I, aVL, and V5-V6.
        *   Septal MI - Pathologic    Q waves or QS    in leads V1-V2, (V3). In the presence of
            LAHB or LVH a     Q or QS    in V3 is required.
15      e   Posterior MI - Initial R wave duration 40 ms in VI or V2, and R > S and upright T
            wave; Inferior or Lateral MI are usually also present.
   The term "new MI" These criteria for MI are more stringent than the Expert Consensus
   Document criteria, requiring   Q waves to be > 0.04 see in duration and      an R/S ratio > 1/3.
   These criteria (drawn from the cardiology literature) are designed to minimize the false
20 positive detection of MIs due to very small physiologic      Q waves in the   inferior and
   anterolateral leads.
   As used herein, the term "stroke" is defined as the rapid onset of a new persistent neurological
   deficit attributed to an obstruction in cerebral blood flow and/or cerebral hemorrhage with no
25 apparent non-vascular cause (e.g. tumor, trauma, infection). Available neuroimaging studies
   will be considered to support the clinical impression and to determine if there is a
   demonstrable lesion compatible with an acute stroke. Non-fatal strokes will be classified as
   ischemic, hemorrhagic or unknown.
30 As used herein the term "stent thrombosis" is defined as follows:

   As used herein, the term "prediabetes" is defined as the state in which some but not all of the
   diagnostic criteria for diabetes are met. It is often described as the "gray area" between normal
   blood sugar and diabetic levels. While in this range, patients are at risk for not only
   developing type 2 diabetes, but also for cardiovascular complications. Prediabetes is also
 5 referred to as borderline diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and/or impaired fasting
   glucose (IFG).

   The first, 'health state classification' consists of five questions.
   The second, 'Visual Analogue Scale Thermometer' consists of a visual analogue scale.
   This generates a self-rating of current health-related quality of life. This will be used with the
   health state classification to build a composite picture of the respondent's health status.
 5 Data capture :
   EQ-5D enables an accurate self-description of current health-related quality of life to be easily
   recorded. Self-explanatory instructions to respondents are provided within the questionnaire
   and it takes about two minutes to complete.
   Health State Classification: The first page consists of five questions. The respondent is asked
10 to indicate his/her current health state, by ticking the most appropriate of three statements
   about each of the five quality of life dimensions. Each statement represents an increasing level
   of severity (l=no problem, 2=some or moderate problem, 3= unable or extreme problem). For
   example, a respondent with 'no problem' for each of the five questions will be said to have a
   health status of 11111.
15 Visual Analogue Scale 'Thermometer': The 'Thermometer' has end points of 100 (best
   imaginable health state) at the top and 0 (worst imaginable health status) at the bottom .The
   respondent will rate his/her current health status by drawing a line from the box marked 'Your
   health status today' to the appropriate point on the 'thermometer' scale.
   The site staff should record the two digits reading on the thermometer (where the line by the
20 respondent crosses the thermometer) on the appropriate space in the CRF. Missing or
   ambiguous values will be left blank.

   Example 1: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial
   of quarterly subcutaneous canakinumab in the prevention of recurrent
   cardiovascular events among stable post-myocardial infarction patients with
 5 elevated hsCRP.
   This study is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled, double
   blind event-driven clinical trial.
   Screening will take place no earlier than:
10 *    28 days after the index MI and on stable long term medication.
   * 28 days after a PCI if it was during a different hospital admission than the qualifying MI.
        Screening can only be initiated following this procedure.
   *    3 years post a CABG procedure regardless of timing of the qualifying MI.
   Rationale of study design
15 This study has been designed as a multi-center, randomized, parallel group, placebo
   controlled, double-blind, event-driven trial to provide definitive evidence on the effects of
   canakinumab on cardiovascular adverse events in patients with recent MI and elevated
   inflammatory burden as evidenced by elevated hsCRP. This study will also measure the
   effects of canakinumab on the conversion to NOD as a secondary endpoint. This study design
20 is the most robust clinical trial design to test the hypothesis that anti-inflammatory treatment
   with canakinumab will reduce major adverse cardiovascular events.
   Rationale of dose/regimen, duration of treatment
   Canakinumab in doses starting from 25 mg to 300 mg with increments of 5 mg will be used to
   select the optimal dose regarding to the risk-benefit ratio for various subgroups of post
25 myocardial infarction patients e.g. elderly patients when necessary. Further, this dosing
   interval facilitates adjustment of doses for factors influencing pharmacokinetic parameters
   e.g. body weight to maintain blood concentrations of canakinumab at optimal level when
   necessary.

   Canakinumab 50 mg and 150 mg quarterly
   The 50 mg and 150 mg canakinumab dosing schedule has been selected on the basis of
   anticipated efficacy, safety, and biomarker modeling data. In phase II development, all
   canakinumab doses up to 300 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) every other week have been found safe,
 5 well tolerated, and free of adverse lipid effects. Canakinumab efficacy in lowering hsCRP, IL
   6 and fibrinogen was assessed based on studies CACZ885A2213 and CACZ88512202. The
   maximum efficacy of hsCRP lowering in study CACZ88512202 was at approximately 50 - 75
   mg of canakinumab monthly, with persistent lowering across a wide range of higher doses.
   Therefore, 50 mg monthly as fully efficacious dose and 15 mg monthly as submaximal dose
10 were selected for further development (see Figure 6). The optimal dosing interval was
   examined using data from CACZ885A2213                (diabetes) and from gout studies with
   canakinumab (see Figure 4). These studies indicated that canakinumab effect on lowering
   hsCRP was durable for up to approximately 3 months (see Figure 3). Further, modeling and
   simulation methods showed that 150 mg quarterly dosing had similar free IL-1P suppression
15 compared to 50 mg monthly dosing and 50 mg quarterly dosing had similar free IL-1p
   suppression compared to 15 mg monthly dosing. This conclusion was reached by comparing
   the doses and regimens based on both the time for maintenance of suppression and the
   fraction of patients below a specified suppression threshold of 'tissue free' IL-1p. Therefore,
   canakinumab 50 mg and 150 mg quarterly administration were selected for the doses in this
20 study, CACZ885M2301. The selected doses allow examination canakinumab dose response
   in preventing recurrent cardiovascular events and to determine if a lower dose than 150 mg
   would have a favorable risk benefit ratio.
   Canakinumab 300 mg quarterly
   Given evidence of safety across a wide dosing range, a 300 mg quarterly dosing schedule for
25 canakinumab has also been developed for CACZ885M2301. This allows evaluation of a
   higher canakinumab dose since the dose needed for adequate IL-1 P neutralization within the
   plaque or systemically in inflammation-based atherosclerosis is not established. Therefore, a
   higher dose may deliver greater efficacy than the other selected dose, 150 mg quarterly. This
   300 mg quarterly dosing regimen also includes an induction period over 2 weeks, dosing at
30 randomization (month 0) and at week 2 (month 0.5), in order to assure that auto-induction of
   IL-1p pathway is adequately inhibited at study initiation. The complete suppression of IL-1p
   related gene expression achieved with this early high dose administration, coupled with the

    WO 2013/049278                                                              PCT/US2012/057444
                                                      41
   continuous canakinumab treatment effect which has been proven to last the entire quarterly
   dosing period, is expected to minimize the potential for IL-1P rebound. This may be relevant
   for pathogenesis of atherosclerosis because it is theorized that IL-I auto-induction provides a
   positive feedback mechanism for vascular disease including atherosclerosis. The lower 50 mg
 5 and 150 mg quarterly doses does not include an early high, induction dose regimen to ensure
   separation of the three canakinumab dose levels included in this protocol and to allow
   assessment of the impact of the early high dose regimen included in the 300 mg arm on
   clinical cardiovascular events.
   In phase II studies in patients with gout, diabetes, and acute inflammatory conditions, safety
10 of canakinumab across a wide range of doses has not emerged as a major clinical issue. Due
   to long term suppression of inflammatory biomarkers, quarterly dosing of canakinumab is
   feasible and likely to be clinically effective. In addition, data in the setting of acute
   inflammation suggests that higher initial doses of canakinumab that can be achieved through
   induction are safe and provide an opportunity to ameliorate concern regarding potential auto
15 induction of IL-Ip and to achieve greater early suppression of IL-Ip related gene expression.
   IL-ip auto-induction has been shown in human mononuclear blood, human vascular
   endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro and in rabbits in vivo where IL-I has
   been shown to induce its own gene expression and circulating IL-1p level (Dinarello et al.
    1987, Warner et al. 1987a, and Warner et al. 1987b).        These studies suggested that IL-I
20 induced IL-I gene expression may provide a positive feedback mechanism in the
   pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and promote atherosclerosis. This consequently suggests that
   suppression of this feedback mechanism may provide benefits in the atherosclerotic lesion.
   Specifically, data supporting an induction dose of canakinumab includes the following: In
   CACZ885A2102, a CAPS mechanism of action study of patients with Muckle Wells
25 Syndrome (N=4), canakinumab treatment with 10 mg/kg i.v. (equivalent to 600 mg i.v.)
   single dose induced clinical (improved skin lesions and conjuctival injection) and biomarker
   (hsCRP and SAA) responses in 24 hrs which was durable up to 180 days. In contrast,
   canakinumab doses of 1 mg/kg i.v. without induction were only durable up to 90 days.
   Support for more sustained and higher dose canakinumab therapy was also seen in the
30 rheumatoid arthritis proof of concept study CACZ885A2101,              where higher doses of
   canakinumab were required (;> 3.0 mg/kg i.v.) to achieve a significant clinical response as
   scored by the ACR system. Furthermore, in the CACZ885A2102 study, analysis of gene

    WO 2013/049278                                                            PCT/US2012/057444
                                                       42
   expression known to be related to IL-I            P  expression, inflammasome activity, and
   autoinduction of IL-I P, showed more complete response to higher dose (10 mg/kg i.v.) than
   lower dose (1 mg/kg i.v.) canakinumab. In addition, IL-1p and inflammasome related gene
   expression modification began to decrease with the lower dose (1 mg/kg i.v.) compared to the
 5 higher dose (10 mg/kg i.v.) between 10 and 12 weeks. Similar results were obtained in a
   canakinumab rheumatoid arthritis study where IL-Ip related genes were suppressed more
   with 300 mg s.c. q2weeks dosing than 150 mg q4weeks dosing.
   The documented safety record of canakinumab up to doses of 300 mg s.c. every 2 weeks with
   and without induction dose of 600 mg i.v., in a study in rheumatoid arthritis patients up to 6
10 months, 300 mg qlmonth, in a study in gout patients up to 6 months, and 150 mg qlmonth, in
   a study in T2DM patients up to 4 months supports the use of this higher dose regimen.
   Rationale for choice of comparator
   This trial is placebo controlled to provide robust evidence on the effects of canakinumab on
15 clinical events and safety as well tolerability. No comparative anti-inflammatory treatment
   has been shown to date to benefit patients with cardiovascular disease and thus an active
   comparator arm is not available. All patients in all treatment arms will receive standard of
   care post-MI background therapy including, but not limited to, lipid lowering, anti
   hypertensive, beta blockers, and anti-platelet therapy as appropriate.
