    The present invention relates broadly to pharmaceutical agents as treatments for
    proliferative disease such as cancer and a range of degenerative diseases such as
5   osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, heart disease and inflammatory bowel disease.           In
    particular, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical agents which comprise aryl
    and/or alkyl substituted indole compounds. The invention further relates to methods for
    treating or preventing a disease or disorder, such as a proliferative disorder (preferably

  5Carer kills rnan y thousands of people ad is the second largest cause ofdeath ir te
    USA. There have been significant breakthroughs nade in treating or preventing a wide
   variety of cancers. For example patients with breast cancer have benefited from early
   screening programs as well as a variety of surgical techniques. However, these often
    prove physically and emotionally debilitating. Moreover, patients who have undergone
0  surgery and subsequent chemotherapy often experience a recurrence in their disease.
   A potential new method of specifically attacking cancer cells is through disruption of
   cancer cells' cellular skeletal system comprised predominantly of actin. The actin
   cytoskeleton is intimately involved in cell division and cell migration. However, actin
   plays a ubiquitous role as the cytoskeleton of tumour cells and the actin filaments of the
5  muscle sarcomere. The differing roles but similarity in structure make actin a hard target
   for drug development, due to unwanted off-arget side effects.

 5 The invention is based on the surprising finding that compounds of general formula (I)
   effectively inhibit tropomyosin, which results in unexpected improvement in the
   treatment of proliferative diseases, particularly cancer. The development of the actin
   cytoskeleton involves a number of ancillary control and regulatory proteins. Identification
   and specific targeting of actin regulatory proteins associated with the cytoskeleton of
 0 cancer cells offers the opportunity to develop cancer specific drugs without unwanted
   side effects.
   Action ilaens are constructed through the polymerisation             of globular atir protein
   mrnoorers. The actin monone is polar, with ore end bearing a positive charge and the
    other end    r ngaive charge     Thez actin flarnents th

   of acti    filarts. Structurally      he an      filarts are made up of         olymr       actin
   monomers with tropomyosin diners sitting in the alpha helical groove of the actin
   filament to form a homopolymer. There are more than 40 mammalian tropomyosin
 0 isoforms, each of which regulates specific actin filaments. There are specific isoforms of
   tropomyosins that regulate the cytoskeleton of cancer cells; disruption of this interaction
   offers a basis to specifically treat cancer cells.

   trasferases an other water solubilizing transferases such as sulphases, which ray be
   over-expressed on proliferative cells such as cancer cells. This may advantageously
   confer superior pharmaceutical properties, such as an enhanced pharmacokinetic
 D profile through reduced conjugation and elimination.
   Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the delivery of compounds of the present
   invention and methods for their preparation will be readily apparent to those skilled in
   the art. Such compositions and methods for their preparation may be found, for
   example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 19th Edition (Mack Publishing
 5 Company, 1995).
   The compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be
   administered orally, intravenously, intranasally, rectally, parenterally, subcutaneously,
   intramuscularly, topically or by any means which delivers an effective amount of the
   active agent to the tissue or site to be treated. It wil be appreciated that different
)0 dosages may be required o treating different          disorders. An effective amount    if an
     gent is that amount which     auses astatistical significant decrease in neolastic cell

  beta-cyclodextrin, or SBECD, commercially-available as Dexolve, or the formulation aid
  known as Captisol). The formulations may be present in unit or multi-dose containers
  such as sealed ampoules or vials.
  The amount of therapeutically effective compound that is administered and the dosage
  regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and/or pharmaceutical
5 compositions of the invention depends on a variety of factors, including the age, weight,
  sex, and medical condition of the subject, the severity of the disease, the route and
  frequency of administration, the particular compound employed, the location of the
  unwanted proliferating cells, as well as the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual
  treated, ard thus may vary widely. The dosage will generally be lower ifthe compounds

  Impact of compounds of the invention on the actin cytoskeleton
5 The ability of compounds 3504, 3507 and 3516 to disrupt the total actin cytoskeleton
  (Figure 1) and to specifically target Tpm3.1-containing actin filaments (Figure 2) was
  assessed in vitro using the microfilament disruption assay.
  Briefly, SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells were seeded at 1800 cells/well in a 384 Perkin
  Elmer High Content Imaging "View" plate and left to plate down 24 hours prior to
0 treatment. Cells were then treated with 0-40 pM of the test compounds (1:2 serial
  dilution in a 10 point dose response). 24 hours post treatment, cells were fixed with 4%
  w/v paraforrnaldehyde (PBS), permeabilized with Triton-X-00 and stained with 48
  AttoPhallodin and DAP to visualize the action filament bundles an the nucleus, or with
  y9d (sheep polycolonal, 1:100) followed by 488conjuged secondary (1:1000) and
        I to visuaze the Tprn3 1 containing flarnent bules and thr nuleus, respectively

     cell were quantitated using & linear fLure detection algorithm developed by the CSIRO
     (Vindin et a/., 2014). This algorithm detects the "ridge lines" or "peaks" in local pixel
 5   intensity in the cell image. It is these "ridge lines" that correspond to actin filament
     bundles and allow us to quantitate the number of filaments per cell.
     Data demonstrate that compounds 3504, 3507 and 3516 disrupt both the total actin
     cytoskeleton and Tpm3. 1-containing actin filaments in a dose-dependent manner.
     In order to demonstrate that the compounds of the invention impaired Tpm3.1 function,
 Dte      impact of compound 3507 on Tpm3. 1-regulated actin filamet depolymerisation was
     assessed using a wel-charcterized           pyrene-based acting filament depolymersation
     assay (Broschat, 1990; Kostyukova and Hitchcok, 20). A bIef overview and
      rationale of tie assay is as folIlows; to prornote depolyrnerisation, oyrerne-labelled acting
     filarnents vere diluted below the critcal aoncentratoino the pointd aid (0. uM, as
 5   defied by      ollard at a., 196)      dc     in   fluorscae     was reasured oyer time a
       ctin nrers        disoiate. Itis well establish thatin the presence ofTp3i          th rae
     of actin delymtl                                  ruced (Bollo          013).           ,  ay
     compound, which interacts with, and impacts Tpm3.1 function, would nullify the
     protective effect of Tpm3.1 on actin depolymerisation.
 0   For all assays the depolymerisation of F-actin alone and F-actin-coated with the human
     homologue of Tpm3.1 was used as a comparative control. Briefly, Tpm3.1 was pre
     incubated with F-actin for 20 minutes prior to diluting the filaments, to allow for proper
     assembly of the Tpm3.1 polymer. As expected, in the presence of saturating amounts of
     Tpm3.1, the initial rate (Vo) of F-actin depolyrnerisation was significantly slower for
.5   Tprn3.1-containing actin filaments (Figure 3A and C, p<0.0001).
     The depolymerisation of F-actin alone and F-actin-coated with Tpm3.1 was then
     measured in the presence of test compound and initial rates of depolymerisation were
     compared. Tpm3.1 was pre-incubated with 50 pM 3507 prior to being added to the acting
     filamrents as previously described. In the presence of compound 3507 the ability of
 0   Tprn 3.1 to polymerize and protect acting was irnpaired and the rate of depolyrnerisati
     was not significantly different to   -actin (Figure 3B ard D).    these data dernonstrata that
     cr    pound 3507 interacts wit and pairs Tpm3. function.

  TNF-a, IFN-y, IL-6, IL-21       L-17A and L-23 was evaluated in vitro (Tables4 and 5).
  Briefly, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from human
5 peripheral blood by Histopaque density gradient centrifugation. The freshly isolated
  PBMCs were seeded at 50,000 ceils/well in a 96-well half area plate. PBMCs were
  dosed with the test compounds (at 10 pM, 1 pM and 0 1 pM) and then incubated at
  371C and 5% C02 for 2 hours. To stimulate release of the cytokines IFN-y, IL-21, IL-17A
  and IL-23, the PBMCs were treated with 50 ng/mL of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
D (PMA) and 1 pg/mL of ionomycin and to stimulate the release of TNF-a and IL-6,
  PBMCs were treated with 100 ng/mL of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative
  bacteria. The PBMC were then incubated at 37              0  and   5% C02 fo  a urther 6 hours
  and    the cel     supernatant was      collected    and    a   Homogenous     Tine     Resolved
