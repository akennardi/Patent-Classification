                                     ABSTRACT
       In some examples, a merchant device may control access to features
based on an orientation of a display. For instance, the merchant device may
present a first user interface (UI) for enabling a merchant to enter transaction
information. Subsequently, the merchant device may present a second UI to
enable the buyer to interact toward completion of the transaction, and the
merchant may change the orientation of the display to face the buyer. While the
display is oriented in the buyer direction, access to the merchant UI is prevented,
thereby preventing initiation of a new transaction, cancelation of transaction, etc.
When the display is returned to the first orientation, i.e., facing the merchant,
the merchant device may enable certain UI features such as for initiating a new
transaction, canceling a transaction, or perform other functions that a buyer may
have been restricted from performing.

   DISPLAY ORIENTATION", which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
                                      BACKGROUND
   [0002]    People often conduct transactions in person with merchants for
   acquiring many different types of goods and services.          However, merchants
 0 and/or the employees of the merchants do not always speak the same language
   as their customers.       Consequently, it can sometimes be challenging for
   merchants and customers to communicate information during an in-person
   transaction.

                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0018]    Some     implementations    described   herein  include techniques and
 0 arrangements for enabling a multilingual transaction between a merchant and a
   buyer. For instance, a computing device or other merchant device at a point of
   sale (POS) location may present information to a merchant in a first language,
   and may present information to a buyer in a second, different language. In some
   cases, the merchant device may switch between the different languages in
25 response to detecting a change in the physical orientation of a display associated
   with the merchant device. For instance in a first orientation, in which the display
   is facing a direction associated with the merchant, the merchant device may
   present information in a first language that is preferred by the merchant. Upon
   detecting rotation or other change in orientation of the display of the merchant
30 device (e.g., indicating that the display is facing a different direction to be
   viewable by a buyer), the merchant device may present information in a second
   language indicated to be preferred by the buyer.
   [0019]    In some cases, in addition to, or as an alternative to switching between
   languages, the merchant device may control access to certain application or
35 device features based on the detected orientation of at least the display of the
   merchant device.     For instance, the merchant device may present a first user
                                             2

   interface (UI) on a touchscreen display. The first UI may include one or more
   virtual controls for enabling entry of information for a transaction, such as for
   enabling the merchant to select one or more items that a buyer desires to
   purchase. When the merchant has completed entry of information related to the
 5 transaction, the merchant device may present a second UI intended for
   presentation to the buyer. For instance, the second UI may include one or more
   virtual controls to enable the buyer to enter information or otherwise perform
   actions toward completion of the transaction. In some examples, the second UI
   may be presented on the display before the merchant rotates or otherwise
 0 changes the position of the display to face the buyer.      In other examples, the
   second UI may be presented on the display in response to the merchant device
   detecting rotation or other change in the position of the display. In either event,
   the merchant device receives an indication of a change in the physical orientation
   of the display, e.g., movement of the display from a first orientation, viewable
 5 by the merchant, to a second orientation, viewable by a buyer.
   [0020]     The merchant device may present the second UI on the display, and
   the buyer may interact with the second UI. As several examples, the buyer may
   enter a signature for a payment card, enter an amount for a tip, enter contact
   information for receiving a receipt, enter other types of buyer information, e.g.,
 0 in response to a question, or enter other types of information for enabling
   completion of the transaction.    Thus, the second UI may enable touch-based
   entry of information by the buyer for completing the buyer's stage of the
   transaction. When the buyer has completed interaction with the second UI, the
   display may be reoriented back to face the merchant. Based at least in part on
25 the change in orientation of the display from the second orientation back to the
   first orientation, the merchant device may enable initiation of a new transaction
   by the merchant.       In other words, when the display is facing the direction
   associated with the buyer, only the buyer UI is presented, and the buyer is unable
   to access the merchant interface, and is thereby unable to initiate a new
30 transaction, or perform other actions that are properly performed only by the
   merchant. Subsequently, when the merchant device detects that the display has
   been returned to the first orientation, i.e., facing the direction associated with
   the merchant, the merchant is able to initiate a new transaction or perform other
   functions on the merchant device that buyers may be restricted from performing.
35 [0021]     In some examples, in response to detecting the change in display
   orientation from the second orientation back to the first orientation, the merchant
                                            3

   device may automatically present another interface on the display that enables
   the merchant to begin a new transaction. Alternatively, as another example, in
   response to detecting the change in display orientation from the second
   orientation to the first orientation, the merchant device may enable certain virtual
 5 controls, such as one or more touchscreen virtual buttons or icons that were
   inactive in the second orientation, but which are able to be selectable in the first
   orientation.   For instance, a "start new transaction" button may be able to be
   selected by the merchant in the first orientation, whereas if the buyer had
   attempted to select the "start new transaction" button while the display was in
 0 the second orientation, the merchant device may ignore the attempted selection
   based on a determination that the display is in the second orientation.
   [0022]     As used herein, a merchant may include any business or other entity
   engaged in offering goods or services for acquisition by buyers in exchange for
   compensation received from the buyers. Actions attributed to a merchant herein
 5 may include actions performed by employees or other agents of the merchant
   and, thus, no distinction is made herein between merchants and their employees
   unless specifically discussed.     In addition, as used herein, a buyer may include
   any entity that acquires goods or services from a merchant, such as by
   purchasing, renting, leasing, borrowing, licensing, or the like.        Buyers may
 0 include customers and/or potential customers of a merchant. Hereinafter, goods
   and/or services offered by merchants may be referred to as items.            Thus, a
   merchant and a buyer may interact with each other to conduct a transaction in
   which the buyer acquires one or more items from a merchant, and in return, the
   buyer provides payment to the merchant.             Accordingly, as used herein, a
25 transaction, such as a POS transaction, may include a financial transaction
   between a buyer and a merchant for the acquisition of one or more items, such
   as at a POS location.
   [0023]     In  some examples,         a service   provider  may provide    language
   information about a particular buyer to a merchant.        For instance, the service
30 provider may provide a payment service to the merchant, and may provide the
   language information in association with providing the payment service.          The
   payment service provided by the service provider may include the provision of
   software, hardware and/or payment processing services to the merchant to
   enable the merchant to receive payments from buyers and to otherwise conduct
35 POS transactions with buyers.
                                                4

   [0024]     The service provider may provide the payment service to a large
   number of merchants, and as a result, the service provider may receive POS
   transaction information for a large number of POS transactions that are
   conducted between buyers and merchants at a plurality of respective POS
 5 locations for a variety of items. The service provider may organize the received
   transaction information into respective merchant profiles and buyer profiles
   associated with the respective merchants and buyers participating in the
   respective POS transactions.       Thus, the service provider may associate the
   transaction information for specific transactions with respective buyer profiles
 0 associated with respective buyers who conducted the transactions.          A buyer
   profile associated with a particular buyer may contain buyer identifying
   information that indicates information about the buyer, and item purchase
   information that indicates details of items purchased, amount paid, time and
   place of the transaction, and so forth.
 5 [0025]     In some examples, based on the information included in the buyer
   profiles, the service provider may be able to determine a preferred language of
   a particular buyer and can associate the preferred language with the buyer profile
   of that buyer.    For instance, when paying for a POS transaction, a buyer may
   provide the payment that is due to a merchant using any of cash, a check, a
 0 payment card, or an electronic payment account, such as may be accessed using
   a buyer device carried by the buyer. During the POS transaction, the merchant
   device can send, to the service provider, payment information in addition to other
   transaction information, such as a description of the items selected by the buyer,
   prices of the items selected, a time, place and date of the transaction, and so
25 forth.   In addition, the merchant device can often include buyer identifying
   information with the transaction information sent to the service provider. For
   instance, buyer identifying information may be determined from a payment card
   of the buyer, from an electronic payment account of the buyer, from a merchant
   club membership or other incentive program for which the buyer has signed up,
30 or the like. As one example, the merchant may send payment card information
   of a buyer to the service provider to obtain authorization for transactions being
   conducted using the payment card as the payment instrument.
   [0026]     Based on the buyer identifying information, the service provider may
   identify a particular buyer profile corresponding to the buyer information received
35 for the current transaction. If a particular language has already been associated
   with the particular buyer profile, the service provider may send at least an
                                              5

   indication of the particular language to the merchant device prior to completion
   of the current transaction. For example, the language information may be sent
   to the merchant device while the merchant device is waiting for credit card
   authorization or other payment authorization from the service provider.       The
 5 merchant device may then use the language information to determine the
   language to present on the display to be viewed by the particular buyer.
   [0027]     Furthermore, in some examples, merchant profiles may also indicate a
   language preferred by a particular merchant or by particular employees of a
   particular merchant. As an example, suppose that a particular merchant logs in
 0 to an associated merchant device, and has previously indicated that Spanish is a
   preferred language. Accordingly, the merchant UI may be presented in Spanish
   to the particular merchant. Next, suppose that a buyer wishes to purchase an
   item from the particular merchant and provides a payment card to the merchant
   as a payment instrument. The merchant may swipe the payment card, and the
 5 card information may thereby be sent to the service provider.       Based on the
   payment card information, the service provider may identify a buyer profile
   associated with the current buyer, and may further determine a preferred
   language of the current buyer, such as may have been previously associated with
   the buyer profile. Suppose that the preferred language associated with the buyer
 0 profile in this example is Japanese.     The service provider may send, to the
   merchant device, a communication that indicates Japanese is the preferred
   language of the current buyer. In response, the merchant device may present
   the buyer UI in Japanese when the display of the merchant device is oriented
   toward the current buyer, and may present the buyer UI in Spanish, i.e., the
25 language preferred by the merchant, when the display is oriented toward the
   merchant.
   [0028]     Various techniques may be used by the service provider for determining
   a language to associate with a buyer profile of a particular buyer.        As one
   example, the buyer may expressly specify a preferred language such as when
30 signing up for an electronic payment account with the payment service of the
   service provider. For example, as discussed additionally below, the buyer may
   be able to pay for transactions using an electronic payment account accessible
   through a buyer application installed on a buyer device, such as a smart phone,
   a wearable computing device, or other portable computing device carried by the
35 buyer. Accordingly, when the buyer signs up for an account with the payment
   service, the buyer may provide an express indication of a preferred language,
                                            6

   and the preferred language is then associated with the buyer profile of the
   particular buyer.
   [0029]     As another example, a merchant device may be configured make a
   query to the buyer, such as during a transaction.          For example, when the
 5 merchant orients the display of the merchant device to face the buyer, if language
   information has not yet been associated with the buyer profile of the particular
   buyer, the buyer interface presented to the buyer may ask the buyer to select a
   preferred language. The selected preferred language may be associated with the
   profile of the current buyer. Subsequently, during future transactions, it is not
 0 necessary to ask the buyer to again select a preferred language, as the language
   information may be obtained from the buyer profile.
   [0030]     As still another example, the service provider may determine implicitly
   a preferred language of the particular buyer, such as from actions of the buyer
   or from other information obtained about the buyer. For example, suppose that
 5 the buyer provides an email address for receiving receipts for transactions.
   Furthermore, suppose that when the buyer accesses the email receipts, the buyer
   uses a browser that is set to a particular language, such as German. For instance,
   the browser locale may have been set to Germany or the user may have
   otherwise indicated German as a preferred language to the browser. As one
 0 example, an HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) accept-language header received
   by the service provider when the buyer uses the browser to access the receipts
   may indicate the language preferred by the buyer.        Accordingly, based on the
   buyer accessing the email receipts primarily using a web browser that is set to
   the German language, this language may be implicitly associated with the buyer
25 profile as a preferred language of the particular buyer.           Numerous other
   techniques for determining a preferred language of a particular buyer will be
   apparent to those of skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.
   [0031]     In addition, various techniques may be used for determining the
   orientation of the display of the merchant device, such as whether the display is
30 currently viewable by the merchant or by the buyer. As one example, when the
   display is mounted on a stand, rotation or other repositioning of the display may
   be detected by a switch included in the stand. Additionally or alternatively, the
   merchant device may include one or more sensors such as an accelerometer,
   gyroscope, compass, or the like, that can detect when the orientation of the
35 display has been changed from a first orientation to a second orientation.
   Furthermore,      in  some    examples,    facial recognition,   body    recognition,
                                              7

   environment recognition, audio recognition, and/or biometric sensing, such as
   fingerprint scanning, may be used for determining whether the display is
   currently facing the merchant or the buyer. For example, the merchant device
   may include a camera associated with the display and the merchant device may
 5 be trained to recognize the two different orientations based on input from the
   camera.    As one example, when a wall-mounted menu is detectable in the
   background, the display may be facing the merchant, whereas when a door to
   the store is detectable in the background, the display may be facing a buyer. As
   still another example, the merchant device may include a control that the
 0 merchant may select prior to reorienting the display to switch between the
   language preferred by the merchant and the language preferred by the buyer.
   [0032]     For discussion purposes, some example implementations are described
   in the environment of a merchant device that is used in conjunction with a
   payment service for conducting POS transactions.       However, implementations
 5 herein are not limited to the particular examples provided, and may be extended
   to other environments, other system architectures, other applications, and so
   forth, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in light of the disclosure
   herein.
   [0033]     FIG. 1 illustrates an example environment 100 for a payment service
 0 and a language information service according to some implementations.           For
   instance, the environment 100 may enable a service provider 102 to provide a
   payment service in which merchants are able to conduct POS transactions with a
   plurality of buyers, such as for selling items to the buyers.         Further, the
   environment 100 may enable the service provider 102 to provide language
25 information to assist the merchants in determining a language that may be
   preferred by a customer during a POS transaction. Examples of various different
   languages that may be used in some implementations herein may include
   English, Spanish, Japanese, French, Tagalog, Mandarin, Hindi, Korean, German,
   Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Bengali, Punjabi, Vietnamese, Dutch,          Italian,
30 Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, and Hebrew, to name a few. Further, in
   some examples one dialect of a particular language may be a first language,
   while another dialect of the particular language may be a second language.
   [0034]    In the illustrated example,       a merchant device 104      is able to
   communicate      over one or more networks 106 with one or more service
35 computing devices 108 of the service provider 102. Further, the merchant device
   104 may be associated with a merchant 110. Additionally, in some examples, a
                                             8

   plurality of other merchant devices (not shown in FIG. 1) may be associated with
   a plurality of other merchants who may also participate in the payment service
   provided by the service provider 102. The merchant device 104 may include an
   instance of a merchant application 112 that executes on the merchant
 5 device 104. The merchant application 112 may provide POS functionality to the
   merchant device 104 to enable the merchant 110 to accept payments from one
   or more buyers 114 at a POS location 116. For example, the merchant 110 may
   use the merchant device 104 to accept payments from various different types of
   payment instruments, e.g., payment cards, electronic payment, cash or check,
 0 at the POS location 116 from the one or more buyers 114.
   [0035]     In some types of businesses, the POS location 116 may correspond to
   a store or other place of business of the merchant 110, and thus, may be a fixed
   location that typically does not change on a day-to-day basis. In other types of
   businesses, however, the POS location 116 may change from time to time, such
 5 as in the case that the merchant 110 operates a food truck, is a street vendor, a
   cab driver, or has an otherwise mobile business, e.g., in the case of merchants
   who sell items at buyers' homes, buyers' places of business, and so forth.
   [0036]     Further, the physical orientation of the merchant device 104 may be
   changed during a transaction.     For instance, the change in physical orientation
 0 may cause the merchant application 112 executing on the merchant device 104
   to switch between a first language that is preferred by the merchant 110, and a
   second language that has been indicated to be preferred by a particular buyer
   114 participating in the current transaction. Additionally, or alternatively, the
   physical orientation of the merchant device 104, i.e., the direction that the
25 electronic display screen of the merchant device 104 is currently facing, may be
   used to control which features of the merchant application 112 are accessible on
   the merchant device 104.
   [0037]     In some examples, the buyer 114 may have a buyer device 118 that
   can execute a buyer application 120. For instance, some buyers 114 may carry
30 buyer devices 118, such as smart phones, tablet computers, wearable computing
   devices, or the like, as further enumerated elsewhere herein, and some of these
   buyer devices 118 may have installed thereon the buyer application 120.       The
   buyer application 120 may include electronic payment capability, which enables
   the buyer 114 to make a payment to the merchant 110 using the buyer
35 application 120, rather than paying with a physical payment card, cash, check,
   etc.
                                             9

   [0038]     The buyer application 120 may further enable the buyer 114 to check
   in with the particular merchant 110, e.g., at the merchant's store or prior to
   entering the merchant's store, such as when the buyer is within a certain distance
   from the merchant device 104, the merchant's address, etc. For example, the
 5 buyer 114 may check in with the merchant 110 to place an order for an item 122.
   As one example, the buyer 114 may be able to place the order for the item 122
   through the buyer application 120, may skip waiting in a line for ordering items,
   may pay for the transaction using the buyer application 120, and may proceed
   directly to an area of the merchant's store to pick up the ordered item 122.
 0 Through communication with the service computing device 108, or through direct
   communications between the buyer device 118 and the merchant device 104,
   the buyer's order may be automatically provided to the merchant device 104.
   [0039]     Regardless of the type of payment instrument used, the merchant 110
   and the buyer 114 may conduct a transaction by which the buyer 114 acquires
 5 the item 122 from the merchant 110 at the POS location 116.         The merchant
   application 112 on the merchant device 104 may send transaction information
   124 to the service computing device 108, e.g., while the transaction is being
   conducted at the POS location 116. In other examples, such as if the merchant
   device 104 is processing transactions offline, the transaction information 124
 0 may be sent in a batch at a subsequent point in time or using other suitable
   techniques.
   [0040]     The transaction information 124 may include information regarding the
   time, place, and the amount of each respective transaction, information related
   to the item 122 acquired, a type of payment being used (e.g., cash, check,
25 payment card, electronic payment), as well as additional information, such as
   buyer identifying information.    For instance if a payment card 126, such as a
   credit card, debit card, charge card, prepaid card, or the like, is used as a
   payment instrument, the transaction information 124 can include data stored in
   the payment card, e.g., Track 1 data (cardholder name, card number and other
30 card information).   In addition, when completing the transaction, a buyer 114
   may sometimes provide an email address for receiving a receipt through email,
   a phone number for receiving a receipt via text message, or the like. Other
   examples of transaction information 124 that can be captured include item
   purchase information, such as detailed item information, e.g., an itemized listing
35 of the items being acquired, the price being paid for each item, descriptors of the
   items (size, flavor, color, etc.), geolocation data indicating a geographic POS
                                            10

   location of a particular transaction, online/offline card data, data describing the
   merchant 110 and/or the merchant device 104, e.g., a merchant identifier, a
   merchant category code (MCC), or the like. Additionally, in some examples the
   transaction information 124 may include any type of data that is received upon
 5 a buyer's authentication into a social network, if any, buyer identification
   information obtained from a merchant club card, points program, or other
   incentive programs, and various other types of information, as discussed
   additionally below.
   [0041]    The service computing device 108 may also receive transaction
 0 information from a plurality of other merchant devices (not shown in FIG. 1)
   associated with a plurality of other merchants. For example, a large number of
   other merchants may also operate their own merchant devices for conducting
   transactions via the payment service.     Accordingly, the transaction information
   from the merchant devices associated with the other merchants may also be
 5 received by the service computing device 108.
   [0042]    The service computing       device 108 may receive the transaction
   information 124 and       may associate the transaction       information 124 with
   merchant information 128 maintained by the service computing device 108. For
   example, the transaction information 124 may be associated with a particular
 0 merchant profile 130 corresponding to the merchant 110.           Thus, the service
   provider 102 may maintain a plurality of merchant profiles 130, such that each
   merchant registered with the payment service may be associated with a
   respective merchant profile 130 that includes transaction information for
   transactions conducted by that merchant with one or more associated merchant
25 devices.
   [0043]    In   addition,   the service   computing    device   may extract    buyer
   information 132 from the transaction information 124.         Based in part on the
   buyer information, the service provider may associate transaction information
   124 for a particular transaction with a respective buyer profile 134 of a plurality
30 of buyer profiles 134 maintained by the service provider 102. For example, if a
   payment card 126 is used as the payment instrument, the transaction
   information 124 for a particular transaction may include a payment card identifier
   of the payment card 126, and may further include the name of the holder of the
   payment card 126. Accordingly, a particular buyer profile 134 may be associated
35 with an identifier of the payment card 126 and/or the name corresponding to the
   holder of the payment card.         Additional transaction information from the
                                            11

   particular transaction may be related to this buyer profile, such as the POS
   location of the transaction, the amount of the transaction, the time and date of
   the transaction, the     items acquired through the transaction, descriptive
   information about the items acquired, the price paid for the items, and so forth.
 5 [0044]    In some examples, the service computing device 108 may include a
   language determination module 136 that examines the data in the buyer profiles
   134 and/or the merchant profiles 130 to determine one or more languages to be
   used by a particular merchant device 104 during a particular transaction.       For
   example, the language determination module 136 may receive transaction
 0 information 124 for a current transaction, and, in response may send language
   information 138 to the merchant device 104 while the transaction is still ongoing.
   As one example, the language information 138 may indicate a preferred language
   associated with a particular buyer profile corresponding to the buyer conducting
   the current transaction. As another example, if there is no preferred language
 5 associated with the particular buyer profile, the language information 138 may
   indicate this and, in some examples, may further include an instruction that
   causes the merchant device 104 to display a screen to the buyer that requests
   the buyer select a preferred language.        Alternatively, the language selection
   screen may be displayed to the merchant, who may verbally request the
 0 preferred language from the buyer.
   [0045]    Additionally, or alternatively, the merchant application 112 may include
   a language module 140 that may determine a language to present at various
   stages of a transaction, either independently, or based on the language
   information 138 that may have been received from the service computing device
25 108. As one example, a plurality of user interface screens or other components
   in various different languages may be provided to the merchant device 104
   preconfigured in the various different languages as part of the merchant
   application 112. As another example, the user interfaces may be translated to
   other languages as needed by the language module 140.
30 [0046]    As one example, suppose that a merchant 110 (or a particular
   employee of the merchant) prefers a first language, such as French.       However,
   suppose that the merchant 110 performs transactions at a point-of-sale location
   116 where most of the customers of the merchant prefer a second language,
   such as English. Accordingly, the merchant 110 may configure a language
35 preference in a merchant profile to indicate that the preferred language of the
   merchant is French.    At least a portion of the merchant profile may be stored
                                             12

   locally on the merchant device 104 as well as at the service computing device
   108.
   [0047]     When the merchant 110 logs in to the merchant device, the language
   module 140 may determine the preferred language of the merchant 110 as a
 5 result, user interfaces that are presented to the merchant 110 are presented in
   the first language, i.e., French, while the user interfaces that are presented to
   the buyers 114 are automatically presented in the second language, i.e., English,
   by default. For instance, when the merchant device 104 detects a change in the
   orientation of the merchant device 104, which may be indicative that an interface
 0 is being presented to the buyer 114, the interface may be presented in the default
   language.    This implementation may be employed regardless of whether the
   merchant device 104 is operating in an offline or online mode. Additionally, in
   some examples, the language determination module 136 and/or the language
   module 140 can use demographics of a particular POS location for setting a
 5 default language to be used by the merchant device 104. Furthermore, different
   employees of the merchant may have different language preferences set, such
   that when a particular employee logs in, the language preference of that
   employee may be used during the session during which the employee is logged
   in.
 o [0048]     In the example of FIG. 1, the merchant device 104 includes a display
   142 that may present information to the merchant 110 when positioned in a first
   orientation 144 and to the buyer 114 when positioned in a second orientation
   146. In some examples, the display 142 may be a touchscreen display able to
   receive touch-based user inputs, although other types of displays and input
25 devices may be used in other examples. As one example, the display 142 may
   be part of a tablet computing device or otherwise associated with a computing
   device that executes the merchant application 112 to provide the functionality of
   the merchant device 112.
   [0049]     In the illustrated example, a support 148 is configured to support the
30 display 142 in the first orientation 144, e.g., facing a first direction, and may be
   positioned to the second orientation 146, e.g., facing a second direction generally
   away from the first direction. For instance, in the first orientation 144, the display
   142 may not be easily visible to a buyer standing on a buyer side of the merchant
   device, whereas when the display 142 is repositioned to face the buyer in the
35 second orientation 146, the display 142 may not be easily visible to the merchant
   located on the merchant side of the merchant device.
                                            13

   [0050]     As one example, the support 148 may be a stand of plastic, metal or
   other suitable material that includes a swivel base 150 that allows the
   support 148 and the display 142 to be pivoted around a vertical pivot axis 152,
   as indicated by arrow 154. In some examples, the rotation of the support on the
 5 base 150 may be performed manually by the merchant 110 or the buyer 114. In
   other examples, the rotation may be automated, such as by a motor (not shown
   in FIG. 1), and controlled by the merchant application 112, or by a control
   controlled manually by the merchant.          Thus, regardless of the source of
   motivation, the merchant device 104 may rotated around the pivot axis 152 to
 0 reposition the display 142 between the first orientation 144 and the second
   orientation 146.
   [0051]     One or more of various different types of sensors may be used to
   provide orientation information 156 to the merchant application 112.            The
   orientation information 156 may indicate a change between the first orientation
 5 144 and the second orientation 146.       As one example, a switch 158 may be
   associated with the base 150 for detecting relative motion between the support
   148 and the base 150. Accordingly, rotating the merchant device 104 from the
   first orientation 144 to the second orientation 146 may actuate the switch 158.
   The switch 158 may send, as the orientation information 156, a signal to a
 0 processor (not shown in FIG. 1) of the merchant device 104 to provide an
   indication that at least the display 142 has been rotated from the first orientation
   144 to the second orientation 146.      Any suitable type of switch may be used,
   such as mechanical, electromechanical, electronic, etc.
   [0052]     As one example, information 160(1) may be presented on the display
25 142 when the display 142 is in the first orientation 144.        For instance, the
   information 160(1) may be presented in a first language. The support 148 and
   the display 142 may be rotated to the second orientation 146, which may trip or
   otherwise actuate the switch 158. In response to the orientation information 156
   from the switch 158, the merchant application 112 may present information
30 160(2) on the display 142 when the display 142 is in the second orientation 146.
   As one example, the information 160(2) may be a translated version of the
   information 160(1) in the second language. As another example, the information
   160(2) may be different information written in the second language that is
   intended for viewing and/or interaction by the buyer. When the display 142 and
35 support 148 are rotated back to the first orientation 144, the switch 158 may be
   actuated again, or may otherwise provide an indication that the display 142 has
                                            14

   returned to the first orientation 144. In response, the information 160(1) may
   be again presented in the first language, or different information presented on
   the display 142 may be presented in the first language.
   [0053]    Additionally, or alternatively, numerous other types of sensors (not
 5 shown in FIG. 1) may be used for determining a change in the orientation of the
   display 142. For example, the merchant device 104 may include onboard sensors
   such as an accelerometer, a compass, a gyroscope, a proximity sensor, or the
   like, which may detect a change in the orientation of the display 142.       As one
   particular example, the merchant device 104 may include a tablet computing
 0 device that provides the display 142 and the sensors, and which is mounted on
   the support 148.    Additionally, or alternatively, one or more sensors may be
   included in the support 148.     Accordingly, the sensors of the merchant device
   104 may detect a change in orientation of at least the display 142, and may
   provide sensor information as the orientation information 156 to the merchant
 5 application 112.   In response, the merchant application 112 may present the
   information 160(2) on the display 142 to the buyer 114 in the second language
   based on the change in the orientation of the display 142 to the second
   orientation 146.
   [0054]    As another example, the merchant device 104 may include a camera
 0 (not shown in FIG. 1) associated with the display 142. The merchant 110 may
   train the merchant device 104 to recognize the two different orientations 144 and
   146 based on input from the camera. For instance, the merchant application 112
   may include a training and recognition feature that enables the merchant 110 to
   train the merchant application 112 to recognize the merchant 110 and/or the
25 surrounding environment to enable the merchant application 112 to recognize a
   current orientation of the display 142.    For example, a current image received
   from the camera may serve at least in part as orientation information 156, to
   indicate a current direction that the display 142 is facing. Thus, the merchant
   application 112 may use facial recognition, body recognition, environment
30 recognition, or the like, to recognize the current orientation of the display 142.
   [0055]    Additionally, or alternatively, the merchant application 112 may use
   audio recognition and/or biometric sensing to distinguish the merchant 110 from
   buyers 114. For example, a microphone of the merchant device 104 may enable
   voice recognition such that the merchant 110 may provide a voice command
35 when the display is oriented for viewing by the merchant. For instance, the voice
   command may cause the merchant application 112 to initiate a new transaction.
                                            15

   [0056]     As another example, the merchant device may include a fingerprint
   sensor or other biometric sensor that the merchant is able to touch when the
   display is oriented for viewing by the merchant. For instance, the merchant may
   have previously provided authentication information for associating a fingerprint
 5 with the merchant device 104. Thus, the merchant 110 may touch the fingerprint
   sensor to initiate a new transaction, whereas if a buyer were to touch the
   fingerprint sensor, the input may be ignored, as the fingerprint is not recognized.
   [0057]     As another alternative, the merchant device 104 may include a physical
   button or other control that is not rotated with the display 142, and that the
 0 merchant 110 may select when the display 142 is rotated back to the face the
   merchant.     For instance, selection of the physical control may indicate to the
   merchant application that display 142 is oriented toward the merchant. Thus,
   the merchant application may display to interfaces in the first language of the
   merchant, and furthermore when orientation is used for access control, and
 5 access is permitted to merchant interfaces e.g., for initiating a new transaction,
   for cancelling a transaction, for changing merchant application settings, etc.
   Furthermore, while several examples have been provided, numerous other
   techniques for detecting a change in the orientation of the display 142 and/or the
   merchant device 104 will be apparent to those of skill in the art having the benefit
 0 of the disclosure herein.
   [0058]     In some instances, the merchant 110 can interact with the merchant
   device 104 to specify a language preferred by the merchant 110 when using the
   merchant device 104. For example, each employee of the merchant 110 may be
   able to specify a preferred language, and upon logging in to the merchant device
25 104, the merchant application 112 may present merchant interfaces in the
   preferred language.     Thus, the merchant application 112 may present one or
   more UIs (not shown in FIG. 1) to the merchant 110 in a preferred language.
   Additionally, in some examples, the preferred language of the merchant may be
   inferred, such as based on a language that the merchant 110 uses when signing
30 up for the payment service.        In either event, the preferred language of a
   merchant or particular merchant employee may be associated with the respective
   merchant profile 130, at least part of which, as mentioned above, may be stored
   locally on the merchant device 104 such as to enable multi-language functionality
   when the merchant device 104 is in an off-line mode.
35 [0059]     As one example, suppose that the merchant 110 prefers English and
   has previously indicated this preference to the language module 140 on the
                                             16

   merchant device 104. Accordingly, when the merchant 110 is logged in to the
   merchant device 104, the language module 140 may cause the merchant
   application 112 to present information 160(1) to the merchant 110 in English.
   Suppose that the buyer 114 has selected the item 122 for purchase and wishes
 5 to pay with an electronic payment account through the buyer application 120.
   The buyer 114 may check in with the merchant device 104 via the buyer
   application 120. The merchant device 104 and or the buyer device 118 may send
   transaction information 124 to the service computing device 108. The service
   computing device 108 may determine a particular buyer profile 134 that
 0 corresponds to the particular buyer 114 and/or buyer device 118. The language
   determination module 136 may inform the merchant device 104 of the preferred
   language associated with the particular buyer profile 134 by sending the
   language information 136 to the merchant device 104.           For example, the
   language information 136 may include at least the name or other identifier of the
 5 preferred language.
   [0060]     The language module 140 of the merchant application 112 may use the
   language information 136 to determine the language of the UIs to be presented
   to the buyer 114.    For example, the merchant 110 may rotate the merchant
   device 104 so that the display 142 is in the second orientation 146, such as to
 0 enable the buyer 114 to sign or otherwise authorize the transaction for the item
   122.     Based on the language information 138 received from the service
   computing device 108, the merchant application 112 may present the information
   160(2) in the language indicated in the buyer profile 134 to be preferred by the
   particular buyer. Following completion of the buyer stage of the transaction, the
25 merchant device may be rotated back so that the display 142 again faces the
   merchant 110.     Based on the language previously indicated to be preferred by
   the merchant 110, the merchant device 104 may present the information 160(1)
   in the language preferred by the merchant 110, which may be an indication that
   the transaction has been successfully completed.
30 [0061]     As another example, if the buyer 114 instead chooses to pay with a
   payment card 126, the merchant 110 may enter the buyer's selection of item
   122 into the merchant device 104 using a merchant UI as discussed additionally
   below. The merchant 110 may enter information for the transaction and request
   the payment card 126 from the buyer 114. The merchant 110 may swipe the
35 payment card 126 in a card reader 162, which may be included with or associated
   with the merchant device 104, such as located in the stand 148.     Payment card
                                          17

   information, such as card number, card holder name, and other information
   about the transaction may be sent to the service computing device 108 as the
   transaction information 124. The service computing device 108 may match the
   card information with one of the buyer profiles 134, and may determine a
 5 preferred language associated with the identified buyer profile 134.           The
   language determination module 136 may send the preferred language as the
   language information 138 to the merchant device 104, which may use the
   preferred language when presenting the information 160(2) to the buyer 114 as
   discussed above. Alternatively, if there is no preferred language associated with
 0 the particular buyer profile 134, the language determination module 136 may
   send, as the language information 138, a communication indicating that there is
   no preferred language and an instruction for the merchant device to request a
   preferred language from the particular buyer.
   [0062]     FIG. 2 illustrates an example of the merchant device 104 including an
 5 example merchant user interface for enabling a POS transaction between a
   merchant and a buyer according to some implementations. In this example, the
   merchant device 104 includes the stand 148, which supports the display 142 on
   the swivel base 150 to enable the display 142 to be rotated between a first
   orientation viewable by the merchant (not shown in FIG. 2) and a second
 0 orientation viewable by the buyer 114, as discussed above. The merchant device
   104 further includes a frame 202 for holding the display 142 on the support 148
   and a camera 204 that may be used for orientation recognition in some examples,
   as discussed above.
   [0063]    In this example, the merchant device 104 may present a first UI 206
25 to the merchant in a language preferred by the merchant. The first UI 206 may
   enable the merchant to enter one or more selections of the buyer 114 and
   determine an amount of payment due for the one or more selected items.          For
   instance, the first UI 206 may include a plurality of icons other representations
   208 of items that are offered by the merchant. In the case that the display 142
30 is a touchscreen, the merchant may enter selections such as by tapping on a
   representation 208 of a particular item selected by the buyer 114. The UI 206
   may further include a selected items area 210 that indicates the items selected
   by the buyer 114 and a total amount of payment due for the transaction. Various
   portions of the UI 206 may include text 212, such as for descriptions of the items
35 or for providing other information to the merchant.        This text 212 may be
   presented in the language determined to be preferred by the merchant. When
                                           18

   all the items selected by the buyer have been entered into the UI 206, the
   merchant may request a payment instrument from the buyer 114.
   [0064]     As mentioned above, the buyer 114 may use any of a variety of
   different payment instruments when participating in a POS transaction.         For
 5 example, the buyer 114 may typically have a plurality of payment cards 126,
   such as credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cards, and so forth, which the buyer
   114 may use for making payment. Furthermore, in addition to payment cards,
   a buyer 114 may carry a buyer device 118, as discussed above, which may
   include the buyer application 120. For example, the buyer application 120 may
 0 include an electronic payment module 214 that uses an electronic payment
   account of the buyer 114 for making electronic payments for transactions.       In
   some cases, the electronic payment account of the buyer 114 may be linked to
   one of the buyer's payment cards, such as a credit card. Accordingly, the buyer
   application 120 may enable the buyer 114 to pay for a transaction with the linked
 5 credit card without having to produce the credit card, thereby enabling a card
   less payment to the merchant with the credit card.       As mentioned above, the
   buyer application 120 and the corresponding electronic payment account may be
   associated with a particular buyer profile that may include various buyer
   information including, for example, the buyer's name, information describing the
 0 payment card linked to the electronic payment account, and an email address
   linked to the electronic payment account to which receipts can be sent for
   electronic payment transactions that are conducted by the buyer 114 using the
   buyer application 120.       Further, the particular buyer profile may indicate a
   preferred language of the particular buyer.     For instance, the buyer may have
25 indicated the preferred language when signing up for the electronic payment
   account, or when updating preferences for the electronic payment account, or
   the preferred language may have been determined by any of the other techniques
   described herein.
   [0065]     In addition to the above-discussed payment instruments, the buyer 114
30 may also optionally pay with a check 216 or cash 218. For example, if the buyer
   114 pays with check 216 or cash 218, the merchant may sometimes also receive
   an identifier that provides additional identification information about the buyer
   114. For instance, a merchant may have a club card, a points program, or other
   incentive program that enables identification of the buyer 114 to the merchant
35 and thereby to the merchant application 112.        As an example, as part of the
   merchant's incentive program, the buyer 114 may provide a telephone number,
                                             19

   email address, club card, etc., and this buyer identifying information may be
   cross-referenced to associate a particular transaction with a particular buyer
   profile for determining a preferred language of the buyer if a preferred language
   has been associated with the buyer profile. Alternatively, if the buyer 114 pays
 5 with a check, the buyer 114 may be required by the merchant to provide buyer
   information in association with the check, which may include checking account
   number, telephone       number,   residential address,   and  other identification
   information.    Accordingly, this information may also be associated with the
   particular transaction, and may thereby enable the transaction to be associated
 0 with a buyer profile. Thus, despite the different possible payment instruments
   that may be used, the service provider may often be able to associate a particular
   buyer with a buyer profile for that buyer and thereby determine whether a
   preferred language has been associated with the particular buyer.
   [0066]     FIGS. 3A-3C illustrate several alternative examples of configurations of
 5 the merchant device according to some implementations. In FIG. 3A, the portion
   of the merchant device including the display 142 is mounted on a support 302
   that includes a first card reader 162(1) and a second card reader 162(2).
   Furthermore, in this example, the support 302 includes a pivot axis 304 that
   enables the display 142 to be rotated about a horizontal pivot axis, as indicated
 0 by the arrow 306, rather than a vertical pivot axis as in the example of FIG. 1.
   Accordingly, the display 142 may be flipped about the horizontal pivot axis 304
   between the first orientation 144 in which the display is facing a first direction
   i.e., toward the merchant, and the second orientation 146 in which the display is
   facing a second direction, i.e., away from the merchant and toward the buyer.
25 [0067]     FIG. 3B illustrates another example of the merchant device 104 that
   does not include a support. In this example, the merchant device 104 is self
   contained in a tablet computing device, smart phone, or other portable computing
   device that includes the display 142. A card reader 308 may be attached to the
   merchant device 104 such as by plugging into one or more ports of the merchant
30 device 104.    As one particular example, the card reader 308 may plug in to a
   microphone jack of the merchant device 104, and payment card information may
   be delivered by the card reader 308 to the merchant device 104 through the
   microphone jack. In the example of FIG. 3B, the merchant 110 may complete
   the merchant stage of the transaction such as by entering item information, and
35 swiping the payment card of the buyer.
                                            20

   [0068]    When the merchant application presents a buyer interface on the
   display 142, such as to enable the buyer to enter a signature for the payment
   card, the merchant may hand the merchant device 104 to the buyer to enable
   the buyer to entered the quest of information such as signature, receipt
 5 information etc. In response to the merchant handing the merchant device 104
   to the buyer, the merchant device may detect a change in orientation based on
   orientation information receive one or more sensors on board the merchant
   device as discussed above, and make determine that the merchant device is now
   in the second orientation 146. For example, because the transaction has reached
 0 a point at which the buyer will be expected to make input, the merchant device
   104 may be configured to determine that a handoff will soon occur, and may use
   one or more recognition algorithms for detecting input from one or more sensors
   that indicate the merchant device 104 has been handed to the buyer 114, and
   therefore the display is viewable from a different direction.
 5 [0069]     In response, to the handing of the merchant device 104 to the buyer
   114, the merchant device 104 may present the buyer user interface in the
   language preferred by the buyer 114. When the buyer 114 has completed the
   buyer stage of the transaction, the buyer 114 may hand the merchant device 104
   back to the merchant 110. In response to detecting that the orientation of the
 0 display 142 has returned to the first orientation 144, i.e., is facing a direction
   that is associated with the merchant, the merchant device 104 may present
   information in the language preferred by the merchant 110.
   [0070]     FIG. 3C illustrates another example of the merchant device 104 in
   which there is a first display 142(1) that is oriented facing in a direction
25 associated with the merchant 110, and a second display 142(2) that is oriented
   facing in a direction associated with the buyer 114. In this example, rather than
   detecting a change in orientation the display, the merchant device 104 presents
   the information on the first display 142(1) in the language preferred by the
   merchant, and presents the information on the second display 142(2) in the
30 language preferred by the particular buyer 114.         For example, during the
   merchant stage of the transaction the buyer may be presented with an indication
   of the items selected and price, but may otherwise not be able to view the
   merchant interface presented on the first display 142(1). Thus, the information
   presented to the buyer may be in the buyer's preferred language, if known at
35 this stage, such as if the buyer has checked in with the merchant, while the
   information presented to the merchant is presented in the merchant's preferred
                                            21

   language.       Subsequently,    in  response to receiving language information
   indicating the preferred language of the buyer, the interfaces presented to the
   buyer during the buyer stage of the transaction may be presented on the second
   display 142(2) in the preferred language of the buyer, while the interfaces
 5 presented to the buyer may be presented to the merchant on the first display
   142(1) in the preferred language of the merchant.         Furthermore, while several
   example configurations of merchant devices 104 have been described for
   discussion purposes, numerous other configurations will be apparent to those of
   skill in the art having the benefit of the disclosure herein.
 0 [0071]      FIG. 4 illustrates an enlarged view of the example user interface 206
   discussed above with respect to FIG. 2 according to some implementations. For
   example, some types of transactions may include a merchant stage and a buyer
   stage. During the merchant stage, the merchant may be presented with the UI
   206 or other suitable interface to enable the merchant to enter item information
 5 for one or more item selected for purchase by the buyer. In addition, in some
   examples, during the merchant stage, the merchant may receive a payment card
   of the buyer and may swipe the payment card in a card reader as described
   above.     Alternatively, in some examples, the merchant may receive other
   identifying information of the buyer during the merchant stage. Subsequently,
 0 during the buyer stage of a transaction the buyer interacts with one or more
   interfaces, such as to provide a signature, to provide information for receiving a
   receipt, and/or to provide other buyer information. Thus in some examples, the
   buyer stage of the transaction serves to complete the transaction, and the
   merchant may subsequently proceed with a new transaction for the next buyer.
25 [0072]      In the example of FIG. 4, the example UI 206 includes a plurality of
   item representations 208, as discussed above.         In some examples, each item
   representation 208 may include an image (not shown) of a respective item and/or
   a text description of the respective item. Thus, in the illustrated example, item
   representations 208 are presented in the interface for a plurality of items A-O.
30 Accordingly, in the case that the display 142 is a touchscreen display, the
   merchant may tap on one of the item representations 208 to select the
   corresponding item.       Selected items are listed in the selected items area 210,
   which may include the text description of the selected item, an image of the
   selected item and a price of the selected item, as indicated at 402 and 404. The
35 selected items area 210 may further include a transaction tax as indicated at 406
   and a transaction total as indicated at 408. The interface 206 may include various
                                              22

   other virtual controls 410, 412, and 414 for performing various other functions,
   such as changing settings of the merchant application, sending or receiving
   communications to and from the service provider, adding or removing items from
   the UI 206, and so forth.
 5 [0073]      As discussed above, in response to an indication of a preference from
   the merchant or a particular employee of the merchant, the UI 206 may be
   presented in a selected first language indicated to be preferred by the particular
   current user of the merchant device. Accordingly, the descriptions of each item
   in the item representations 208 and in the selected items area 210 may be
 0 presented in the first language. Further, if the merchant accesses other features
   of the merchant application such as through the virtual controls 410-414, those
   UIs may also be presented in the first language.
   [0074]      FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate example UIs that may be presented to the
   buyer to enable the buyer to complete the buyer stage of the transaction
 5 according to some implementations. In the example of FIG. 5A, a buyer UI 502
   may be presented on the display 142, and may include a transaction total 504,
   indicating a total amount to be paid for the transaction; a signature block 506,
   which may enable the buyer to sign or otherwise authorize the transaction; a
   "clear signature" virtual control 508, which may enable the buyer to reset the
 0 signature block 506; and a "done signing" virtual control 510 which may enable
   the buyer to accept a signature entered            into the signature block 506.
   Additionally, in some cases, the UI 502 may include other features, such as for
   enabling the user to enter a tip amount, determine a total with the tip, view a
   listing of items being purchased and corresponding prices, and so forth.
25 [0075]      In some examples, the UI 502 may be presented on the display 142 in
   the second language, such as prior to repositioning of the display 142 from the
   first orientation facing in the direction of the merchant to the second orientation
   facing in the direction of the buyer.      In other examples, the UI 502 may be
   presented initially on the display 142 in the first language associated with the
30 merchant, and in response to determining that the display 142 has been
   repositioned to the second orientation, the merchant device may then present
   the UI 502 in the second language. Thus, by changing the orientation of the
   display 142 from the first orientation to the second orientation the text in the UI
   may change from the first language to the second language. If the display 142
35 were to be repositioned back to the first orientation, the text in the UI 502 may
   be changed back to the first language.
                                             23

   [0076]     FIG. 5B illustrates another example of a UI 512 that may be presented
   on the display 142, such as in response to the buyer selecting the done signing
   virtual control 510. The UI 512 includes an inquiry 514 asking how on the buyer
   would like to receive a receipt for the transaction. The UI 512 further includes a
 5 plurality of virtual controls 516, 518, 520 and 522 that provide the option for the
   buyer to receive the receipt via e.g., text message, email, printed receipt, or no
   receipt, respectively. For example, if the buyer has previously provided an email
   address for receiving a receipt in a past transaction, the email address may be
   presented in the virtual control 518 and the buyer may select a "send receipt"
 0 virtual control 524 to have the receipt sent to the selected email address.
   Alternatively, if the buyer has not previously provided an email address or if the
   buyer would like to receive the receipt at a different email address, the buyer
   may select the virtual control 518 and a virtual keyboard (not shown in FIG. 5B)
   may be displayed to enable the buyer to enter an email address. Similarly, if the
 5 buyer would like to receive the receipt by text message, and the buyer's
   telephone number, if previously provided, is presented in the virtual control 516,
   the buyer may select a "send receipt" virtual control 526 to have the receipt sent.
   As discussed above, while the UI 512 is presented on the display 142, and the
   display 142 is oriented in the direction of the buyer, the UI 512 may be presented
 0 in the second language indicated to be preferred by the buyer.
   [0077]     FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate example UIs that may be presented to the
   buyer    during    the  buyer   stage   of the   transaction   according   to some
   implementations. In the example of FIG. 6A, following the reception selection of
   a method of receiving and receipt as discussed above, the buyer may be
25 presented with a UI 602 that provides the buyer with a thank you message 604.
   The thank you message 6044 may be presented in the second language indicated
   to be preferred by the buyer. Additionally, in some examples, one or more virtual
   controls 606 and 608 may be presented in the UI 602 as well.           For example,
   when the display is reoriented back to facing the merchant, the merchant may
30 use these virtual controls such as for canceling the transaction as indicated by
   virtual control 606 or start a new transaction as indicated by virtual control 608.
   As discussed below with respect to FIG. 7, in some examples, based on the
   current orientation of the display, the virtual control 606 and 608 may be
   disabled, or may not be presented until after the display has been repositioned
35 back to the first orientation.
                                             24

   [0078]     FIG. 6B illustrates an example UI 610 that may be presented to the
   buyer according to some implementations.        For example, the UI 610 may be
   presented by the merchant application 112 in response to receiving language
   information from the service computing device indicating that a preferred
 5 language for the particular buyer has not yet been determined. For instance, as
   mentioned above, the merchant device may send buyer identification information
   to the service computing device which attempts to determine a preferred
   language for the particular buyer participating in the current transaction by
   referring to a buyer profile for that buyer.    If a preferred language not been
 0 associated with the buyer profile, the service computing device may send back
   language information indicating that there is no preferred language associated
   with the particular buyer. In response to receiving this information, the merchant
   device may present the UI 610 to the buyer prior to presenting any other UIs to
   the buyer, such as UIs 502 or 512 discussed above.         Additionally, as another
 5 example, the UI 610 may be presented to the merchant, and the merchant may
   ask the buyer if the buyer would like to select a preferred language.
   [0079]    In the illustrated example, the UI 610 includes an inquiry 612 asking
   the buyer if the buyer would like to select a preferred language.      Furthermore,
   the UI 610 may present a plurality of virtual controls 614-620 that provide
 0 various languages that the buyer may select as a preferred                language.
   Furthermore, the buyer may be able to swipe the UI 610 upward to view
   additional possible selections for preferred languages.     Accordingly, the buyer
   may tap on one of the virtual controls to select a desired preferred language.
   Furthermore, if the buyer does not desire to select a preferred language, the
25 buyer may tap on or otherwise select a "no" virtual control 622.
   [0080]    If the buyer does select a preferred language, the language module
   140 on the merchant device may use this information for determining the
   appropriate UIs to present to the merchant. Furthermore, the buyer's preferred
   language may be communicated to the service computing device 108.               The
30 service computing device 108 may receive the preferred language and associate
   the preferred language with the corresponding particular buyer profile.
   [0081]     FIG. 7 illustrates an example environment 700 in which the orientation
   of at least the display 142 of the merchant device 104 may be used to control
   access to certain UIs or other features, such as settings of the merchant
35 application 112 and/or the merchant device 104.           In the example UI 602
   discussed above with respect to FIG. 6A, following completion of the transaction
                                            25

   by the buyer, the virtual control 606 for canceling a transaction and the virtual
   control 608 for starting a new transaction may be presented on the display 142.
   For example, in order to provide a speedy transition to the next transaction, it is
   desirable for the merchant to be able to quickly start a new transaction.
 5 However, typically it is not desirable for the buyer to be able to select the virtual
   control 608 for starting a new transaction, or the virtual control 606 for canceling
   transaction. For example, it would be undesirable for the buyer to have access
   to the item selection interface 206 discussed above with respect to FIGS. 2 and 4,
   and/or other features of the merchant application and/or the merchant device,
 0 such as access to device settings, access to application settings, access to
   communications, access to stored information, and so forth.
   [0082]     Accordingly, in some implementations herein, while the display 142 is
   oriented facing toward the buyer, the virtual control 606 and the virtual control
   608 may be disabled such that if the buyer attempts to select either of these
 5 virtual controls, the attempt to select these controls may be ignored by the
   merchant device 104.        When the display 142 is repositioned to facing the
   merchant direction, the virtual controls 606 and 608 may be enabled, e.g., such
   that a touch input to the virtual control 606 results in presentation of another UI
   for canceling a transaction (not shown), and a touch input to the virtual control
 0 608 results in presentation of the UI 206 for entering information for a new
   transaction. Alternatively, as another example, the virtual controls 606 and 608
   may not be presented until the merchant device 104 detects that the display 142
   has been repositioned back to the first orientation facing the direction associated
   with the merchant.
25 [0083]     In the example of FIG. 7, when the display 142 is positioned in the first
   orientation 144, user interfaces 702 for both the merchant and/or buyer may be
   presented and interacted with on the display 142. In other words, the merchant
   is presumed to be able to make inputs to the both types of UIs, and may have
   full access to the UIs and other features accessible on the merchant device.
30 When the display 142 is repositioned to the second orientation 146, user
   interfaces 704 configured for the buyer only may be presented or interacted with
   on the display 142, and access is disabled to other UIs, such as those configured
   to be accessed by the merchant. Accordingly, the merchant application 112 may
   control the information presented on the display 142 and/or the level of
35 interactivity with the information presented on the display 142 based on the
   detected orientation of the display 142.

   [0084]     As one example, the merchant device 104 may present the item
   selection UI 206 discussed above on the display 142 for enabling the merchant
   to enter information for a transaction, such as to select items that the buyer 114
   wants to purchase.      When the merchant has completed entry of information
 5 related to the transaction, and has, e.g., swiped the payment card 126 of the
   buyer, the merchant device 104 may present a buyer UI, such as the UIs 502
   and/or 512 discussed above with respect to FIGS. 5A and 5B, respectively. For
   instance, the buyer UIs may include one or more virtual controls configured for
   the buyer to enter information, make selections, or otherwise perform actions
 0 toward completion of the transaction. The buyer 114 may interact with the one
   or more buyer UI, as discussed above.
   [0085]     When the buyer 114 has completed interaction with the buyer UIs, the
   merchant device may present the UI 602 discussed above.           However, as the
   display 142 is still facing the buyer direction i.e., is positioned in the second
 5 orientation 146, the virtual controls 606 and 608 are either not selectable, or are
   not presented at all.      The display 142 may be reoriented back to the first
   orientation 144 to face the merchant 110. Based at least in part on the change
   in orientation of the display 142 from the second orientation 146 back to the first
   orientation 144, the merchant device 104 may enable initiation of a new
 0 transaction by the merchant 110. Accordingly, when the display 142 is accessible
   to the buyer, only the buyer UIs are presented, and the buyer is unable to interact
   with or otherwise access the merchant UIs, and is thereby unable to initiate a
   new transaction, or perform other actions that are properly performed only by
   the merchant. Subsequently, when the merchant application 112 detects that
25 the display 142 has been returned to the first orientation 144, i.e., facing in the
   merchant direction, the merchant 110 is able to initiate a new transaction or
   perform other functions on the merchant device 104 that buyers may be
   restricted from performing.     Furthermore, while the example merchant device
   configuration of FIG. 7 has been used to discuss this aspect, the other merchant
30 device configurations, such as those discussed above with respect to FIGS. 3A
   3C, and/or other merchant device configurations may also be used.
   [0086]     FIGS. 8-10 are flow diagrams illustrating example processes according
   to some implementations. The processes of FIGS. 8-10 below are illustrated as
   collections of blocks in logical flow diagrams, which represent a sequence of
35 operations, some or all of which can be implemented in hardware, software or a
   combination thereof.      In the context of software, the blocks may represent
                                            27

   computer-executable instructions stored on one or more computer-readable
   media that, when executed by one or more processors, program the processors
   to perform the recited operations. Generally, computer-executable instructions
   include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures and the like
 5 that perform particular functions or implement particular data types. The order
   in which the blocks are described should not be construed as a limitation. Any
   number of the described blocks can be combined in any order and/or in parallel
   to implement the process, or alternative processes, and not all of the blocks need
   be executed.       For discussion purposes, the processes are described with
 0 reference to the environments, architectures and systems described in the
   examples herein, although the processes may be implemented in a wide variety
   of other environments, architectures and systems.
   [0087]     FIG. 8 is a flow diagram of an example process 800 for determining a
   language to associate with a buyer profile according to some implementations.
 5 In some examples, the example process 800 of FIG. 8 may be executed by the
   service computing device 108, or by other suitable computing devices.
   [0088]     At 802, the computing device may receive POS transaction information
   from a merchant device associated with a merchant. For example, as discussed
   above with respect to FIG. 1, the merchant device may send transaction
 0 information for a current transaction to the service computing device.          The
   transaction information may include buyer identifying information and item
   information.
   [0089]     At 804, the computing device may compare the buyer identifying
   information across multiple buyer profiles to determine a matching buyer profile.
25 For example,      the   buyer identifying    information, such as payment card
   information, electronic payment account information, a buyer phone number, or
   other buyer identifying information, may be compared with buyer identifying
   information contained in a plurality of buyer profiles to locate a particular buyer
   profile that corresponds to buyer information from the current transaction.
30 [0090]     At 806, the computing device may determine whether a preferred
   language has been associated with the particular buyer profile associated with
   the buyer participating in the current transaction.
   [0091]     At 808, if a preferred language has been associated with the particular
   buyer profile, the computing device may send language information to the
35 merchant device that indicates the preferred language of the buyer participating
   in the current transaction.     For example, the language information sent to the
                                             28

   merchant device may at least identify the language that has been associated with
   the particular buyer profile that corresponds to the buyer identifying information
   obtained for the current transaction.
   [0092]     At 810, on the other hand, if the particular buyer profile does not have
 5 a preferred language associated with it, the computing device may send a
   communication to the merchant device indicating that a preferred language has
   not been determined for the buyer corresponding to the particular buyer profile.
   [0093]     At 812, in some examples, the language information sent by the
   computing device may include an instruction that causes the merchant device to
 0 present a user interface to the buyer that requests that the buyer indicate a
   preferred language. For example, as discussed above with respect to FIG. 6B,
   the merchant device may present, e.g., prior to presenting other buyer
   interfaces, a user interface that enables the buyer to select a preferred language
   from a list of potential preferred languages.
 5 [0094]     At 814, the computing device may determine whether an indication of
   a preferred language for the particular buyer profile has been received from the
   merchant device.
   [0095]     At 816, when the buyer selects a preferred language from the buyer
   interface, the computing device may receive the indication of the preferred
 0 language of the buyer from the merchant device.
   [0096]     At 818, the computing device may associate the preferred language
   with the corresponding particular buyer profile.      For example, the computing
   device may relate (e.g., in the case of a relational database) or otherwise
   associate the preferred language with the particular buyer profile.
25 [0097]     At 820, on the other hand, if the buyer does not provide a preferred
   language, then the computing device may attempt to determine implicitly a
   preferred language of the buyer. As one example, if the buyer elects to receive
   receipts through an email address, when the buyer accesses a receipt using a
   browser, the language setting of the browser may indicate a preferred language
30 of the buyer. As another example, the buyer profile associated with the buyer
   may include social network information or other information that may be used to
   implicitly determine a preferred language of the buyer.
   [0098]     At 822, if a preferred language of the buyer is determined within a
   threshold confidence level, the process may proceed to block 818 to associate
35 the preferred language with the particular buyer profile. On the other hand, if
   the preferred language cannot be determined within the threshold confidence
                                            29

   level, then a preferred language is not associated with the particular buyer
   profile.
   [0099]      FIG. 9 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process 900 for
   presenting      information    in   multiple   languages    according     to   some
 5 implementations. In some examples, the process 900 may be executed by the
   merchant device 104, or by another suitable computing device.
   [00100] At 902, the merchant device may present a first user interface in a first
   language on a display associated with the merchant device.
   [01011      At 904, the merchant device may receive, via the first UI, a merchant
 0 input for a selection of at least one item for a POS transaction.
   [01021      At 906, the merchant device may send, to a service computing device,
   during    the POS transaction,     buyer identifying   information    of the buyer
   participating in the POS transaction.      For example, the merchant device may
   obtain the buyer identifying information from at least one of a payment card
 5 presented by the buyer, an electronic payment account associated with the
   buyer, a merchant incentive program that the buyer participates in, or other
   buyer identifying information, such as a phone number, email address, or the
   like, provided by the buyer.
   [0103]      At 908, the merchant device may receive, from the service computing
 0 device, an indication of a second language associated with the current buyer. For
   example, the second language may be different from the first language, and may
   have been previously associated with the buyer profile corresponding to the
   buyer currently participating in the POS transaction.
   [0104]      At 910, the merchant device may detect positioning of the display from
25 a first orientation to a second orientation.   For example, in the first orientation,
   the screen of the display may face in the direction associated with the merchant,
   such that the display may be viewable by the merchant, but not easily viewable
   by the buyer.       In the second orientation, the screen of the display may be
   positioned to face in a direction that is associated with the buyer, such that the
30 display may be viewable by the buyer. In some examples, the merchant device
   may include one or more sensors able to detect the orientation of the display.
   Examples of the sensors may include a switch that is able to detect movement
   from the first orientation to the second orientation,         an accelerometer, a
   gyroscope, a compass, a proximity sensor, a switch, a camera, a microphone, a
35 biometric sensor, or various other suitable sensors.
                                             30

   [0105]     At 912, in response to detecting the display has been positioned in the
   second orientation, the merchant device may present a second UI on the display
   in the second language. In some examples, the text of the second UI may have
   been presented on the display in the first language prior to movement of the
 5 display to the second orientation, which results in the text of the UI being
   presented in the second language. In other examples, the second UI may not be
   presented on the display until after the display is moved to the second
   orientation.
   [01061     At 914, in response to detecting the display has been positioned back
 0 to the first orientation, the merchant device may present at least one of the
   second UI or a third UI in the first language. Accordingly, the display may be
   flipped or otherwise repositioned between a first orientation and a second
   orientation such that in the first orientation information is presented in the first
   language and in the second orientation, information is presented in the second
 5 language during the transaction with the particular buyer. When a subsequent
   transaction is conducted with a next buyer, a third language preferred by the
   next buyer, which may be different from the second language or the first
   language, may be used to present the information on the display when the display
   is in the second orientation.
 0 [0107]     FIG. 10 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process 1000 for
   controlling   access    based   on    display   orientation   according     to  some
   implementations.      In some examples, the process may be executed by the
   merchant device or by another suitable computing device.
   [0108]     At 1002, the merchant device may present a first UI on a display of a
25 merchant device. For example, the first UI may enable the merchant to select
   one or more items that the buyer desires to purchase from the merchant.
   [0109]     At 1004, the merchant device may receive, via the first UI, a merchant
   input for selection of at least one item for a POS transaction during a merchant
   stage of the POS transaction.
30 [01101     At 1006, based at least in part on the selection of the at least one item,
   the merchant device may present, on the display, a second UI configured to
   receive at least one buyer input.       For example, following entry of the item
   selection information by the merchant, the merchant may swipe the payment
   card or may otherwise receive a payment instrument from the buyer.                 In
35 response, the merchant device may present a buyer UI configured to receive
                                             31

   buyer interaction to enable the buyer to complete the buyer stage of the
   transaction.
   [0111]     At 1008, the merchant device may detect that the display has been
   positioned from a first orientation to a second orientation. For example, in the
 5 first orientation, the display may face in the direction associated with the
   merchant such that the display may be viewable by the merchant, but not easily
   viewable by the buyer. In the second orientation, the display may be positioned
   to face in a direction that is associated with the buyer, such that the display may
   be viewable by the buyer. In some examples, the merchant device may include
 0 one or more sensors able to detect the orientation of the display. Examples of
   the sensors may include a switch that is able to detect movement from the first
   orientation to the second orientation, the accelerometer, gyroscope, a compass,
   a proximity sensor, a switch, a camera, a microphone, a biometric sensor, or
   various other suitable sensors. Furthermore, in some examples, the second UI
 5 may be presented on the display before the display is positioned in the second
   orientation, while in other examples, the second UI may be presented on the
   display in response to detecting that the display has been positioned in the
   second orientation.
   [0112]     At 1010, the merchant device may receive at least one buyer touch
 0 input to the second UI.      For example, the buyer may provide a signature, may
   provide input for how to receive a receipt, may provide input to agree to payment
   of an amount of the transaction, may enter an amount for a gratuity, or may
   provide various other inputs during a buyer stage of the POS transaction.
   [0113]     At 1012, the merchant device may detect positioning of the display
25 from the second orientation back to the first orientation.     As discussed above,
   one or more sensors may provide orientation information to the merchant device
   to enable the merchant device to determine that the display is in the first
   orientation e.g., facing a direction associated with the merchant.
   [0114]     At 1014, in response to determining that the display has been
30 positioned back to the first orientation, the merchant device may enable touch
   based initiation of a new transaction. For example, while the display is positioned
   in the second orientation, initiation of a new transaction may be prevented or
   otherwise disabled so as to prevent the buyer from initiating a new transaction
   and/or from initiating cancellation of the current transaction. As one example,
35 virtual controls for initiating a new transaction and/or for canceling the current
   transaction may be disabled so long as the display is positioned in the second
                                             32

   orientation.     As another example, the virtual controls for initiating a new
   transaction and for canceling the current transaction may not be presented on
   the display until the merchant device determines that the display has been moved
   back to the first orientation.
 5 [0115]      At 1016, while the display is positioned in the first orientation, the
   merchant device may receive, via a third UI, a touch input to initiate a new
   transaction.     For example, the third UI may comprise the virtual control for
   initiating a new transaction that is in disabled when the display is in the second
   orientation, but which is enabled when the display is positioned in the first
 0 orientation. Alternatively, as mentioned above, in some examples, the third UI
   may not be presented until the merchant device has determined that the display
   is in the first orientation. In either alternative, in response to receiving the touch
   input to initiate the new transaction, the merchant device may present the first
   UI on the display to enable the merchant to enter item information for the new
 5 transaction.     As another example, upon detecting that the display has been
   reoriented to the first orientation, the merchant application may automatically
   present the first UI, e.g., UI 206, to enable the merchant to begin entering
   information for a new transaction.
   [0116]      The example processes described           herein are only examples of
 0 processes provided for discussion purposes. Numerous other variations will be
   apparent to those of skill in the art in light of the disclosure herein.       Further,
   while the disclosure herein sets forth several examples of suitable frameworks,
   architectures and environments for executing the processes, implementations
   herein are not limited to the particular examples shown and discussed.
25 Furthermore, this disclosure provides various example implementations, as
   described and as illustrated in the drawings.         However, this disclosure is not
   limited to the implementations described and illustrated herein, but can extend
   to other implementations, as would be known or as would become known to those
   skilled in the art.
30 [01171      FIG. 11 illustrates an example architecture of a payment and language
   information system 1100 able to provide a payment and language information
   service according to some implementations.           In the example of FIG. 11, the
   service computing device 108 of the service provider 102 includes a payment
   processing module 1102, which may be executed to provide the payment and
35 transaction functionality. The payment processing module 1102 may receive at
   least transaction information 124 for processing payments made through the
                                               33

   buyer application 120 and/or the merchant application 112.        For example, the
   payment processing module 1102 may receive transaction information 124, such
   as an amount of a POS transaction 1104, and may verify that the linked payment
   card can be used to pay for the transaction, such as by contacting a card
 5 clearinghouse computing device or other bank computing device, as discussed
   additionally below.    Furthermore, in some examples, the payment processing
   module 1102 may redirect payment information for transactions to be made
   using a payment card to a bank computing device 1106, while in other examples,
   the merchant devices 104 may communicate directly with an appropriate bank
 0 computing device 1106 or card payment network computing device 1108 for
   approving or denying a transaction using a particular payment card for a
   particular POS transaction 1104.     The payment processing module 1102 and
   corresponding payment functionality may be implemented as one or more
   computer programs, or other executable instructions, on the service computing
 5 device 108 in one or more locations, such as for providing the payment systems,
   components, and techniques described herein.
   [01181    The example of FIG. 11 illustrates that one or more buyers 114 may
   have one or more respective buyer devices 118 in some examples, which are
   able to communicate with at least one merchant device 104 and/or the service
 0 computing device 108 over the one or more networks 106.          The buyer device
   118 may include the buyer application 120, as previously discussed herein, which
   may include an electronic payment module 214 that provides functionality for
   enabling the buyer 114 to make electronic payments using the buyer device 118.
   In some examples, the buyer application 120 may include various other
25 applications or modules, such as for a buyer dashboard to enable the buyer to
   control information in the buyer's profile, set buyer preferences, and so forth.
   [0119]     Further, the merchant device 104 may be associated with a merchant
   110 that participates in the payment service provided by the service provider
   102, and the merchant device 104 may include the merchant application 112.
30 As discussed elsewhere herein, the buyer device 118 and the merchant device
   104 can each be a computing device able to communicate with each other, with
   the service computing device 108, and with various other computing devices,
   through   any suitable communication        protocols, interfaces, and   networks,
   including the one or more communication networks 106.
35 [01201    The buyer device 118 and the merchant device 104 can each include
   one or more components, e.g., software or hardware, that are configured to
                                            34

   respectively determine a geographic location of the buyer device 118 and/or the
   merchant device 104, using, for example, various geolocation techniques, e.g.,
   a global positioning system (GPS), cell tower location, wireless access point
   location, wireless beacon location, and so forth. Further, the buyer device 118
 5 and the merchant device 104 can each be any appropriate device operable to
   send and receive requests, messages, or other types of information over the one
   or more networks 106 or directly to each other.         Some examples of buyer
   devices 118 and merchant devices 104 are enumerated below.            Additionally,
   while only a single buyer device 118 and a single merchant device 104 are
 0 illustrated in the example of FIG. 11, in some implementations, there may be
   thousands, hundreds of thousands, or more, of the buyer devices 118 and the
   merchant devices 104.
   [01211     The one or more networks 106 can include any appropriate network,
   including a wide area network, such as the Internet; a local area network, such
 5 an intranet; a wireless network, such as a cellular network, a local wireless
   network, such as Wi-Fi and/or close-range wireless communications, such as
   Bluetooth@ and Bluetooth@ low energy; a wired network; or any other such
   network, or any combination thereof. Accordingly, the one or more networks
   106 may include both wired and/or wireless communication technologies,
 0 including Bluetooth@, Bluetooth@ low energy, Wi-Fi and cellular communication
   technologies, as well as wired or fiber optic technologies. Components used for
   such communications can depend at least in part upon the type of network, the
   environment selected, or both. Protocols for communicating over such networks
   are well known and will not be discussed herein in detail. Accordingly, the service
25 computing device 108, the merchant devices 104, the buyer devices 118, and
   the other computing devices discussed herein are able to communicate over the
   one or more networks 106 using wired or wireless connections, and combinations
   thereof.
   [0122]     Additionally, in some examples, transaction information may also be
30 obtained with respect to buyers 114 that do not have a buyer device 118, the
   buyer application 120, and/or an account with the payment service provided
   through the service computing device 108. The transaction information collected
   with respect to these buyers 114 may be sent to the service computing device
   108, and buyer profiles may be created for the buyers 114. Should one or more
35 of these buyers later sign up for the electronic payment service, the transaction
                                           35

   information of an existing buyer profile for that buyer may be merged with the
   newly created profile.
   [0123]     In some implementations, the payment service enables card-less
   payments, i.e., electronic payments, for transactions between the buyers 114
 5 and the merchants 110 based on interaction of the buyer 114 with the buyer
   application 120 and interaction of the merchant 110 with the merchant
   application 112. Accordingly, in some examples, a card-less payment transaction
   may include a transaction conducted between a buyer 114 and a merchant 110
   at a POS location during which an electronic payment account of the buyer 114
 0 is charged without the buyer 114 having to physically present a payment card to
   the merchant 110 at the POS location.       Consequently, the merchant 110 need
   not receive any details about the financial account of the buyer 114 for the
   transaction to be processed.     As one example, the electronic payment may be
   charged to a credit card issuer or credit card number that the buyer 114 provided
 5 when signing up with the service provider for the electronic payment account.
   As another example, the buyer 114 may have a quantity of money pre-paid in
   an account maintained for use in making the electronic payments.            Other
   variations will also be apparent to those of skill in the art having the benefit of
   the disclosure herein.
 0 [0124]     Before conducting an electronic payment transaction, the buyer 114
   typically creates a user account with service provider of the payment service.
   The buyer 114 can create the user account, for example, by interacting with the
   buyer application 120 that is configured to perform electronic payment
   transactions and that may execute on the buyer device 118. When creating a
25 buyer electronic payment account with the payment service, the buyer 114 may
   provide an image including the face of the buyer, data describing a financial
   account of the buyer 114, e.g., a credit card number, expiration date, and a
   billing address.   This user information can be securely stored by the payment
   service, such as in a secure database. Further, the buyer profiles 134 may be
30 created for each buyer 114, which may include information about the buyer and
   transactions conducted by the buyer.
   [01251     The service computing device 108 may further include an analysis
   module 1110.        For example, the analysis module 1110 may receive the
   transaction information 124 and associate the transaction information 124 with
35 appropriate merchant profiles 130 and appropriate buyer profiles 134. Thus, the
   analysis module 1110 may compare received transaction information 124, such
                                            36

   as an identifier of the merchant device 104 or an identifier of an instance of a
   merchant application 112 from which the transaction information 124 is received
   for associating the transaction information 124 with a particular merchant profile
   130. Furthermore, the analysis module 1110 may extract buyer information such
 5 as a credit card identifier, buyer name, buyer email address, and various other
   pieces of buyer identifying information from the transaction information 124, and
   may match this information with an existing buyer profile 134 or, if no match is
   found, then a new buyer profile 134 may be created.
   [01261     The buyer profiles 134 and/or merchant profiles 130 described herein
 0 may be created and maintained using any suitable types of data structures, and
   using any suitable data storage or database techniques. In some examples, the
   transaction information and other profile information may be maintained in a
   relational database in which pieces of information for individual buyer profiles
   may be stored distinctly from one another, but are related to or otherwise
 5 associated with each other in the relational database. For instance, a particular
   buyer profile 134 may be obtained by generating a view of a portion the data
   related in the database to the particular buyer profile, or by otherwise extracting
   the data from the database.      Alternatively, of course, other types of storage
   techniques may be used for generating and maintaining the buyer profiles 134
 0 and/or the merchant profiles 130. Furthermore, in some examples a probabilistic
   model may be used to determine within a threshold level of confidence that
   transaction information 124 from a particular transaction should be associated
   with a particular buyer profile 134. The analysis module 1110 may be configured
   to harmonize the transaction information that is received from various merchant
25 devices so that orphan or otherwise disconnected sets of transaction information
   that correspond to different financial payment accounts, e.g., different payment
   cards or electronic payment accounts, etc., can be matched to or otherwise
   associated with particular buyer profiles. The analysis module 1110 can generate
   the probabilistic model, for example, by utilizing one or more of a weighted graph
30 model, a probabilistic data store and/or a trained statistical model.
   [01271     To accept be able to electronic payments for POS transactions 1104,
   the merchant 110 typically creates a merchant account with the payment service
   by providing information describing the merchant including, for example, a
   merchant name, contact information, e.g., telephone numbers, the merchant's
35 geographic location address, and one or more financial accounts to which funds
   collected from buyers will be deposited.       This merchant information can be
                                            37

   securely stored by the payment service, for example, in the merchant information
   128, such as in a secure database.      Further, a merchant profile 130 may be
   created for each merchant, which may include information about the merchant
   and transactions conducted by the merchant.
 5 [0128]    The payment service can include one or more servers that are
   configured to perform securely electronic financial transactions, e.g., electronic
   payments for transactions between a buyer and a merchant, for example,
   through data communicated between the buyer device 118 and the merchant
   device 104.    Generally, when a buyer and a merchant enter into an electronic
 0 payment transaction, the transaction is processed by electronically transferring
   funds from a financial account associated with the buyer account to a financial
   account associated with the merchant account.
   [01291     Determining whether the buyer device 118 is within a threshold
   geographic distance of the merchant device 104 can be accomplished in different
 5 ways including, for example, determining whether the buyer device 118 is within
   a threshold geographic radius of the merchant device 104, determining whether
   the buyer device 118 is within a particular geofence, or determining whether the
   buyer device 118 can communicate with the merchant device 104 using a
   specified wireless technology, e.g., Bluetooth@ or Bluetooth@ low energy (BLE).
 0 In some examples, the payment service restricts electronic payment transactions
   between the buyer 114 and the merchant 110 to situations where the geographic
   location of the buyer device 118 is within a threshold geographic distance from a
   geographic location of the merchant device 104.
   [0130]    The payment service can also be configured to communicate with the
25 one or more computing devices 1008 of a card payment network (e.g.,
   MasterCard@, VISA@) over the one or more networks 106 to conduct financial
   transactions electronically. The payment service can also communicate with one
   or more bank computing devices 1106 of one or more banks over the one or
   more networks 106. For example, the payment service may communicate with
30 an acquiring bank, and/or an issuing bank, and/or a bank maintaining buyer
   accounts for electronic payments.
   [01311    The buyer 114 operating the buyer device 118 that is within a threshold
   geographic distance of the merchant device 104 can interact with the buyer
   application 120 executed on the buyer device 118 to conduct an electronic
35 payment transaction with the merchant 110.       While interacting with the buyer
   application 120, the buyer 114 can select the merchant 110, from a listing of
                                           38

   merchants 110, with whom the buyer 114 wants to enter into an electronic
   payment transaction. The buyer 114 can select the merchant 110, for example,
   by selecting a "check in" option associated with the merchant 110.      The buyer
   device 118 can communicate data to the payment service indicating that the
 5 buyer 114 has checked in with the merchant 110.        In response, the payment
   service can communicate data to notify the merchant device 104 that the buyer
   has checked in. The merchant application 112 executing on the merchant device
   104 can notify the merchant 110 that the buyer has electronically checked in with
   the merchant 110 through a display screen of the merchant device 104.
 0 [01321     After checking in, the buyer 114 can obtain, or request, items that are
   available to be acquired from the merchant 110. When the buyer 114 is ready
   to enter into the card-less payment transaction, the buyer 114 can, for example,
   approach a point of sale for the merchant 110 and identify him or herself. For
   example, the buyer 114 can verbally notify the merchant 110 that the buyer 114
 5 wants to enter into a card-less payment transaction and can provide the
   merchant 110 with the buyer's name. The merchant 110 can then interact with
   the merchant application 112 to select the buyer 114, from a listing of buyers
   that have checked in with the merchant 110, to initiate an electronic payment
   transaction for the item(s) being acquired by the buyer 114.
 0 [0133]     The payment service can then communicate with the computing device
   1108 of a card payment network to complete an electronic payment transaction
   for the total amount to be charged to the buyer's electronic payment account.
   When the electronic payment transaction is complete, the payment service can
   communicate data describing the electronic payment for the transaction to the
25 buyer device 118, e.g., as an electronic receipt 1112, which can, for example,
   notify the buyer 114 of the total amount charged to the buyer for the electronic
   payment for the transaction with the particular merchant. At least a portion of a
   receipt 1112, such as an image accessible through an image tag, may be stored
   by the service computing device 108. As discussed above, the service computing
30 device 108 may detect a language associated with a buyer browser that accesses
   the receipts 1112, such as for determining implicitly a language preferred by the
   particular buyer. Further, while a mobile buyer device 118 is described in this
   example for purposes of explanation, additional or alternative types of devices
   may be used in other examples.
35 [01341     In addition, in some examples, the service provider 102 may make
   available one or more service provider websites 1114 that enable merchants 110
                                           39

   to advertise items on the service provider website(s). For example, merchants
   110 may offer 114 on the website. The buyers may purchase the items using a
   web browser, or other application on a computing device, such as the buyer
   device 118 or other computing device. The transaction information from these
 5 transactions may be provided to the service computing device 108 to add further
   to the transaction information in the buyer profiles 134 and the merchant profiles
   130.
   [01351     In   addition,   the   analysis  module  1110   and/or    the   language
   determination module 136 may access other websites 1116 when determining
 0 information about buyers, respectively. For example, demographic information
   and other buyer information may be obtained from the US Census Bureau
   website, social network sites, a microblog site, or other online presences of the
   various different buyers. Similarly, geographic information may be obtained from
   websites that provide maps and other geographic or demographic information,
 5 or the like.
   [01361     FIG. 12 illustrates select example components of an example merchant
   device 104 according to some implementations. The merchant device 104 may
   be any suitable type of computing device, e.g., portable, semi-portable, semi
   stationary, or stationary.      Some examples of the merchant device 104 may
 0 include tablet computing devices; smart phones and mobile communication
   devices; laptops, netbooks and other portable computers or semi-portable
   computers; desktop computing devices, terminal computing devices and other
   semi-stationary or stationary computing devices; dedicated register devices;
   wearable computing devices,         or other body-mounted     computing      devices;
25 augmented reality devices; or other computing devices capable of sending
   communications and performing the functions according to the techniques
   described herein.
   [01371     In the illustrated example, the merchant device 104 includes at least
   one processor 1202, one or more computer-readable media 1204, one or more
30 communication interfaces 1206, and one or more input/output (I/O) devices
   1208.    Each processor 1202 may itself comprise one or more processors or
   processing cores. For example, the processor 1202 can be implemented as one
   or more      microprocessors, microcomputers,      microcontrollers,  digital signal
   processors, central processing units, state machines, logic circuitries, and/or any
35 devices that manipulate signals based on operational instructions.          In some
   cases, the processor 1202 may be one or more hardware processors and/or logic
                                              40

   circuits of any suitable type specifically programmed or configured to execute the
   algorithms and processes described herein.            The processor 1202 can be
   configured    to fetch    and   execute computer-readable      processor-executable
   instructions stored in the computer-readable media 1204.
 5 [0138]     Depending on the configuration of the merchant device 104, the
   computer-readable media 1204 may be an example of tangible non-transitory
   computer storage media and may include volatile and nonvolatile memory and/or
   removable and non-removable media implemented in any type of technology for
   storage    of information     such  as    computer-readable    processor-executable
 0 instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. The computer
   readable media 1204 may include, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM,
   flash memory, solid-state storage, magnetic disk storage, optical storage, and/or
   other computer-readable media technology.             Further, in some cases, the
   merchant device 104 may access external storage, such as RAID storage
 5 systems, storage arrays, network attached storage, storage area networks, cloud
   storage, or any other medium that can be used to store information and that can
   be accessed by the processor 1202 directly or through another computing device
   or network. Accordingly, the computer-readable media 1204 may be computer
   storage media able to store instructions, modules or components that may be
 0 executed by the processor 1202.          Further, when mentioned, non-transitory
   computer-readable media exclude media such as energy, carrier signals,
   electromagnetic waves, and signals per se.
   [0139]     The computer-readable media 1204 may be used to store and maintain
   any number of functional components that are executable by the processor 1202.
25 In some implementations, these functional components comprise instructions or
   programs that are executable by the processor 1202 and that, when executed,
   implement operational logic for performing the actions and services attributed
   above to the merchant device 104.          Functional components of the merchant
   device 104 stored in the computer-readable media 1204 may include the
30 merchant application 112.        In this example, the merchant application 112
   includes the language module 140, discussed above, a transaction module 1210
   and a dashboard module 1212. For example, the transaction module 1210 may
   present various user interfaces, as discussed above, to enable the merchant to
   conduct transactions,      receive  payments,     and   so forth,  as well  as for
35 communicating with the service computing device 108 for processing payments
   and sending transaction information. Further, the dashboard module 1212 may
                                              41

   enable the merchant to manage the merchant's account, the merchant profile,
   merchant preferences, view item pricing information, and the like. Additional
   functional components may include an operating system 1214 for controlling and
   managing various functions of the merchant device 104 and for enabling basic
 5 user interactions with the merchant device 104.
   [01401     In addition, the computer-readable media 1204 may also store data,
   data structures and the like, that are used by the functional components. For
   example, data stored by the computer-readable media 1204 may include item
   information 1216 that includes information about the items offered by the
 0 merchant, which may include a list of items currently available from the
   merchant, images of the items, descriptions of the items, prices of the items, and
   so forth.    For instance, when the merchant 110 is setting up the merchant
   application 112 to accept payments for particular items offered by the merchant
   110, the merchant may enter the item information 1216 for the particular items.
 5 Depending on the type of the merchant device 104, the computer-readable media
   1204 may also optionally include other functional components and data, such as
   other modules and data 1218, which may include programs, drivers, etc., and
   the data used or generated by the functional components. Further, the merchant
   device   104 may include many other logical,         programmatic and physical
 0 components, of which those described are merely examples that are related to
   the discussion herein.
   [0141]    The communication interface(s)        1206 may include one or more
   interfaces and hardware components for enabling communication with various
   other devices, such as over the network(s) 106 or directly.          For example,

   connected to, or able to connect to, various external devices 1234 such as other
   computing devices and or external storage devices.
   [0147]     FIG. 13 illustrates select components of the service computing device
   108 that may be used to implement some functionality of the payment service
 5 described herein.     The service computing device 108 may be operated by a
   service provider that provides the payment service, and may include one or more
   servers or other types of computing devices that may be embodied in any number
   of ways.    For instance, in the case of a server, the modules, other functional
   components, and data may be implemented on a single server, a cluster of
 0 servers, a server farm or data center, a cloud-hosted computing service, a cloud
   hosted storage service, and so forth, although other computer architectures may
   additionally or alternatively be used.
   [01481     Further, while the figures illustrate the components and data of the
   service computing device 108 as being present in a single location, these
 5 components and data may alternatively be distributed across different computing
   devices and different locations in any manner. Consequently, the functions may
   be implemented by one or more service computing devices, with the various
   functionality described above distributed in various ways across the different
   computing devices.      Multiple service computing devices 108 may be located
 0 together or separately, and organized, for example, as virtual servers, server
   banks and/or server farms. The described functionality may be provided by the
   servers of a single entity or enterprise, or may be provided by the servers and/or
   services of multiple different buyers or enterprises.
   [0149]     In the illustrated example, each service computing device 108 may
25 include one or more processors 1302, one or more computer-readable media
   1304, and one or more communication interfaces 1306.         Each processor 1302
   may be a single processing unit or a number of processing units, and may include
   single or multiple computing units or multiple processing cores. The processor(s)
   1302 can be implemented as one or more microprocessors, microcomputers,
30 microcontrollers, digital signal processors, central processing units, state
   machines, logic circuitries, and/or any devices that manipulate signals based on
   operational instructions. For instance, the processor(s) 1302 may be one or more
   hardware processors and/or logic circuits of any suitable type specifically
   programmed or configured to execute the algorithms and processes described
35 herein. The processor(s) 1302 can be configured to fetch and execute computer
                                             44

   readable instructions stored in the computer-readable media 1304, which can
   program the processor(s) 1302 to perform the functions described herein.
   [0150]     The  computer-readable      media  1304   may    include volatile   and
   nonvolatile memory and/or removable and non-removable media implemented
 5 in any type of technology for storage of information, such as computer-readable

   readable media 1304 may include, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM,
   flash memory or other memory technology, optical storage, solid state storage,
   magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage, RAID storage systems, storage arrays,
 0 network attached storage, storage area networks, cloud storage, or any other
   medium that can be used to store the desired information and that can be
   accessed by a computing device. Depending on the configuration of the service
   computing device 108, the computer-readable media 1304 may be a type of
   computer-readable storage media and/or may be a tangible non-transitory media
 5 to the extent that when mentioned, non-transitory computer-readable media
   exclude media such as energy, carrier signals, electromagnetic waves, and
   signals per se.
   [0151]     The computer-readable media 1304 may be used to store any number
   of functional components that are executable by the processors 1302. In many
 0 implementations,     these  functional   components   comprise    instructions   or
   programs that are executable by the processors 1302 and that, when executed,
   specifically configure the one or more processors 1302 to perform the actions
   attributed above to the service computing device 108.     Functional components
   stored in the computer-readable media         1304 may include the       language
25 determination module 136, the analysis module          1110, and the payment
   processing module 1102.        Additional functional components stored in the
   computer-readable media 1304 may include an operating system 1308 for
   controlling and managing various functions of the service computing device 108.
   [0152]     In addition, the computer-readable media 1304 may store data used
30 for performing the operations described herein.     Thus, the computer-readable
   media may store the merchant information 128, including the merchant profiles
   130, and the buyer information 132, including the buyer profiles 134. The service
   computing device 108 may also include or maintain other functional components
   and data, such as other modules and data 1310, which may include programs,
35 drivers, etc., and the data used or generated by the functional components.
   Further, the service computing device 108 may include many other logical,
                                            45

   programmatic and physical components, of which those described above are
   merely examples that are related to the discussion herein.
   [0153]    The communication interface(s)         1306 may include one or more
   interfaces and hardware components for enabling communication with various
 5 other devices, such as over the network(s) 106.        For example, communication
   interface(s) 1306 may enable communication through one or more of the
   Internet, cable networks, cellular networks, wireless networks (e.g., Wi-Fi) and
   wired networks, as well as close-range communications such as Bluetooth@,
