            BANKNOTE STORING DEVICE AND BANKNOTE HANDLING MACHINE
                                        TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0001]
 5 The present invention relates to a banknote storing device that can store banknotes and
   feed the stored banknotes, and to a banknote handling machine including such a banknote
   storing device.
                                       BACKGROUND ART
10 [0002]
   Various types of banknote storing devices that can store banknotes and feed the stored
   banknotes are known in the art.     A tape-reel style banknote storing device is available in
   which banknotes are wound on a drum along with tapes, and the banknotes are fed by
   unwinding the tapes from the drum.      Published U.S. Patent Application No. 2015/021385
15 (US 2015/021385A) discloses a banknote storing device in which two combination
   members each including a drum and a reel are arranged in one casing, and in which
   banknotes can be stored in each of the combination members.
   [0003]
   In the banknote storing device disclosed in Published U.S. Patent Application No.
20 2015/021385, at least a part of the reels and the drums overlaps in an up-down direction.
   In this configuration, because the length of the casing in the up-down direction is previously
   fixed, and because a diameter of an outer peripheral edge of the outermost tape wound on
   the drum when the banknotes of the maximum storable number are stored in the
   combination member needs to be kept small, there is a problem that the maximum number
25 of the banknotes that could be wound on each of the drums (i.e., a maximum storable
   banknote number) is relatively small.
                                    SUMMARY OF INVENTION

   [0024]
15 The money handling system according to the present embodiment is arranged in a shop
   such as a supermarket or a convenience store, and performs a money deposition process
   of banknotes and coins as proceeds of sales.        In addition, the money handling system
   performs the money dispensing process of banknotes and coins as money change. As
   shown in FIG. 1, the money handling system according to the present embodiment
20 includes a banknote handling machine 1 and a coin handling machine 101.         The banknote
   handling machine 1 and the coin handling machine 101 are arranged side by side.             A
   not-shown POS register is communicably connected to the banknote handling machine 1
   via a LAN and the like.   A check-out counter (a table and / or a counter) that separates a
   clerk from a customer is arranged in a check-out place in the shop.       The clerk waits on
25 one side of the check-out counter. The POS register is often placed on the side of the
   check-out counter on which side the clerk is waiting so that the clerk can operate the POS
   register. The customer stands on the other side of the check-out counter and places a
   product that he / she wants to purchase on the check-out counter. The clerk registers the
   number and the price of the product placed on the check-out counter in the POS register.
30 The clerk receives money from the customer and inserts that money in the money handling

                                                   8
   system.    The money handling system is explained in detail below.
   [0025]
   A configuration of the banknote handling machine 1 is explained in detail below by using
   FIG. 2.   A right side surface of a later-explained housing 1a shown in FIG. 2 is a front
 5 surface side of the banknote handling machine 1 (that is, a front surface side when the
   banknote handling machine 1 is seen from a front side shown in FIG. 1).        Moreover, a left
   direction in FIG. 2 is a depth direction of the housing 1a.
   [0026]
   As shown in FIG. 2, the banknote handling machine 1 includes the housing la of a
10 substantially rectangular parallelepiped shape.         The banknote handling machine 1
   includes an upper unit 2 and a lower unit 3.          The upper unit 2 includes a banknote
   inserting unit 10 for inserting a banknote inside the housing 1a from the outside thereof, a
   transport unit 12 for transporting the banknote inserted inside the housing la by the
   banknote inserting unit 10, a recognition unit 14 arranged in the transport unit 12 for
15 recognizing the banknote transported by the transport unit 12, and a banknote ejecting unit
   16 for ejecting the banknote outside the housing 1a from the inside thereof.
   [0027]
   The banknote inserting unit 10 includes a plurality of rollers such as feed rollers, kicker
   rollers, and the like.   A bottom-most banknote of the banknotes put by an operator in a
20 stacked manner in the banknote inserting unit 10 is kicked one by one by the kicker roller
   toward the feed roller. The kicked banknote is fed one by one inside the housing 1a by
   the feed roller.  The banknote fed inside the housing 1a by the banknote inserting unit 10
   is transported one by one by the transport unit 12.       The recognition unit 14 recognizes
   denomination, authenticity, fitness, version, face side up / back side up, transportation state,
25 and the like of the banknote transported by the transport unit 12.              The banknote
   recognized by the recognition unit 14 is sent by the transport unit 12 to one among a
   plurality of later-explained storing and feeding units 20 based on, for example, the
   denomination of the banknote.
   [0028]
30 At diversion point in the transport unit 12 is arranged a diverter 12e (see FIG. 5) such as a

                                                  9
   diverting claw. A transportation destination of the banknote at a given diversion point is
   decided by the corresponding diverter 12e.        As shown in FIG. 2, banknote detecting
   sensors 12a are arranged at various locations in the transport unit 12 for detecting the
   banknote transported by the transport unit 12.     Each of the banknote detecting sensors
 5 12a is constituted by an optical sensor and the like including a light emitting element and a
   light receiving element.    The banknote is detected by the banknote detecting sensor 12a
   when a light emitted by the light emitting element is not received by the light receiving
   element as the light is blocked by the banknote transported by the transport unit 12.
   Detection information of the banknote detected by each of the banknote detecting sensors
10 12a is sent to a later-explained controlling unit 50.   Based on the detection result of the
   banknote obtained in each of the banknote detecting sensors 12a, the controlling unit 50
   determines whether a distance between the adjacent banknotes transported by the
   transport unit 12 is equal to a predetermined value.          When the controlling unit 50
   determines that the distance between adjacent banknotes transported by the transport unit
15 12 is considerably different from the predetermined value, it is decided that a transportation
   abnormality such as skew, multifeed, and chaining, has occurred in the banknote
   transported by the transport unit 12.
   [0029]
   In the upper unit 2, two banknote storing units (capture bins) 18 and 19 are connected to
20 the transport unit 12.    The banknote transported by the transport unit 12 can be sent to
   and stored in any of the banknote storing units 18 and 19; however, the banknote stored in
   the banknote storing unit 18 or 19 cannot be fed to the transport unit 12 from the banknote
   storing unit 18 or 19.    The positions of the banknote storing units 18 and 19 are decided
   such that it is possible to send the banknote to any of the banknote storing units 18 and 19
25 from the transport unit 12 when performing any of a money deposition process and a
   money dispensing process of the banknote.         In the present embodiment, at least one
   between a counterfeit banknote and a suspicious banknote about the authentication is
   stored in one of the two banknote storing units 18 and 19 (for example, the banknote
   storing unit 19 that is closer to the banknote ejecting unit 16).      In the other banknote
30 storing unit (for example, the banknote storing unit 18 that is away from the banknote

                                                    10
   ejecting unit 16) is stored a banknote (specifically, for example, a banknote in which a
   transportation abnormality has occurred) that is fed from any of the later-explained storing
   and feeding units 20 to the transport unit 12 but that cannot be ejected by the banknote
   ejecting unit 16 outside of the housing 1a when performing the money dispensing process
 5 of the banknote.
   [0030]
   As shown in FIG. 2, the transport unit 12 spans in both the upper unit 2 and the lower unit 3.
   In the lower unit 3, a plurality of the storing and feeding units 20 (four in the example shown
   in the FIG. 2) are connected to the transport unit 12.     The storing and feeding units 20 are
10 arranged one above the other along a height direction of the banknote handling machine 1.
   In the present embodiment, as explained below, each of the storing and feeding units 20
   can be removed from the lower unit 3 of the banknote handling machine 1. Each of the
   storing and feeding units 20 can store therein the banknote sent thereto by the transport
   unit 12 and each of the storing and feeding units 20 can feed the banknotes one by one
15 stored therein to the transport unit 12.        More particularly, among the four storing and
   feeding units 20, each of the uppermost storing and feeding unit 20 and the bottommost
   storing and feeding unit 20 includes a banknote storing mechanism 22 having one drum
   22a.    A pair of tapes between which the banknotes sent by the transport unit 12 are
   sandwiched one after the other is wound on the drum 22a along with the banknotes.
20 When the drum 22a is rotated in an opposite direction of a winding direction of the tapes,
   the banknotes sandwiched between the tapes can be fed one by one to the transport unit
   12 as the tapes are unwound from the drum 22a.           A maximum number of banknotes that
   can be stored in the banknote storing mechanism 22 is, for example, 300.             Among the
   four storing and feeding units 20, each of the second storing and feeding unit 20 from the
25 top and the third storing and feeding unit 20 from the top includes two banknote storing
   mechanisms 24 and 26 having mutually different maximum storing capacities of the
   banknotes.     The banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 respectively includes drums
   24a and 26a.     More particularly, in the banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26, a pair of
   tapes between which the banknotes sent by the transport unit 12 are sandwiched one after
30 the other is wound on the drums 24a and 26a along with the banknotes.             When the drum

                                                    11
   24a or 26a is rotated in an opposite direction of a winding direction of the tapes, the
   banknotes sandwiched between the tapes can be fed one by one to the transport unit 12
   as the tapes are unwound from the drum 24a or 26a.         A length of the tapes that are wound
   on the drum 26a is longer than a length of the tapes wound on the drum 24a.          Accordingly,
 5 a maximum number of banknotes that can be stored on the drum 26a is greater than a
   maximum number of banknotes that can be stored on the drum 24a.              Specifically, while a
   maximum number of banknotes that can be stored in the banknote storing mechanism 24
   is 100, and a maximum number of banknotes that can be stored in the banknote storing
   mechanism 26 is 200.       The total of the maximum number of banknotes that can be stored
10 in the banknote storing mechanism 24 and the maximum number of banknotes that can be
   stored in the banknote storing mechanism 26 is 300.         This total is equal to the maximum
   number of banknotes that can be stored in the banknote storing mechanism 22.                     A
   configuration of the storing and feeding unit 20 that includes the two banknote storing
   mechanisms 24 and 26 is explained in detail later.

   A collecting unit 40 is arranged in the lower unit 3, and the collecting unit 40 is connected to
   the transport unit 12.    This collecting unit 40 is used to collect the banknotes stored in the
   storing and feeding units 20.       More specifically, a not-shown banknote storage bag for
   storing the banknotes is detachably attached in the collecting unit 40.      The banknote sent
20 from each of the storing and feeding units 20 to the collecting unit 40 via the transport unit
   12 is stored in the banknote storage bag.       Moreover, the banknote of a denomination that
   is not allocated to any of the storing and feeding units 20, or an overflow banknote, which is
   a banknote that cannot be stored because the storing and feeding unit 20 of a
   corresponding denomination is full, is stored in the banknote storage bag mounted in the
25 collecting unit 40.   The banknotes can be collected together with the banknote storage
   bag from the banknote handling machine 1 by removing the banknote storage bag from the
   collecting unit 40.      Note that, in the collecting unit 40, the detachably attachable
   not-shown banknote storage bag for storing the banknotes can be replaced with a
   detachably attachable banknote collecting cassette for storing the banknotes.         In this case,
30 the banknotes sent from the transport unit 12 to the collecting unit 40 are stored in this

                                                  12
   banknote collecting cassette. Moreover, after the banknotes are stored in the banknote
   collecting cassette, the banknotes can be collected together with the banknote collecting
   cassette from the banknote handling machine 1 by removing the banknote collecting
   cassette from the collecting unit 40.

   In the banknote handling machine 1 according to the present embodiment, the lower unit 3
   constitutes a safe housing to which only an operator having the predetermined powers and
   authorities can access.     A secure transportation company has the management authority
   of the banknotes stored in the storing and feeding units 20 and the collecting unit 40 of the
10 lower unit 3.   Only a guard of the secure transportation company can open a not-shown
   door of the lower unit 3 and can access to the inside of the lower unit 3.       Specifically, a
   not-shown locking mechanism is provided that locks the door of the lower unit 3 after the
   door is closed, and only an operator (for example, the guard of the secure transportation
   company) who is allowed to access the inside of the lower unit 3 has a key and / or a
15 password to release the lock of the door by the locking mechanism.        Accordingly, only the
   guard of the secure transportation company can collect the banknote storage bag present
   in the collecting unit 40 from the inside of the lower unit 3.   That is, a salesclerk and the
   like of the shop cannot access to the inside of the lower unit 3 and remove the banknotes
   stored in any of the storing and feeding units 20 and the collecting unit 40. With this
20 configuration, antithefting of the banknote stored in the storing and feeding units 20 and the
   collecting unit 40 can be enhanced.

   As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the banknote ejecting unit 16 is provided with a shutter
   mechanism 17 for opening / closing a banknote ejection opening provided in the banknote
25 ejecting unit 16.    As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, when the banknote ejection opening
   provided in the banknote ejecting unit 16 is closed by closing the shutter mechanism 17,
   the operator cannot remove the banknotes, which are sent to the banknote ejecting unit 16
   by the transport unit 12 when the money dispensing process of the banknotes is performed,
   from the banknote ejecting unit 16 outside of the housing 1a.       On the other hand, when
30 the banknote ejection opening provided in the banknote ejecting unit 16 is opened by

                                                   13
   opening the shutter mechanism 17, the operator can remove the banknotes sent to the
   banknote ejecting unit 16 by the transport unit 12 from the banknote ejecting unit 16
   outside of the housing la. Note that, when the banknote handling machine 1 is in a
   standby state, the shutter mechanism 17 is in the closed state thereby closing the
 5 banknote ejection opening provided in the banknote ejecting unit 16.
   [0034]
   Next, a detailed configuration of the coin handling machine 101 is briefly explained below.
   The coin handling machine 101 includes a housing 101a of a substantially rectangular
   parallelepiped shape, a coin inserting unit 110 for inserting a coin inside the housing 101a
10 from the outside thereof, and a coin ejecting unit 172 for ejecting the coin outside of the
   housing 101a from the inside thereof.       Moreover, inside the housing 101a are arranged a
   not-shown recognition unit for recognizing the coin inserted in the housing 101a by the coin
   inserting unit 110 and a plurality of not-shown storing and feeding units each of which
   stores therein the coin recognized by the recognition unit per denomination.       The coin fed
15 from any of the storing and feeding units is ejected by the coin ejecting unit 172 outside of
   the housing 101a from the inside thereof.      Moreover, inside the housing 101a is arranged
   a not-shown collecting box used as an overflow coin storage section.         The collecting box
   can be pulled horizontally and toward the front side out of a not-shown collecting box
   accommodating unit provided in a lower part of the housing 101a.             An overflow coin,
20 which is a coin that could not be stored in any of the storing and feeding units, or a coin that
   is fed from the storing and feeding unit but that needs to be collected, is stored in the
   collecting box.   After the coins are stored in the collecting box, the guard and the like of
   the secure transportation company can collect the coins together with the collecting box by
   pulling the collecting box toward the front side from the collecting box accommodating unit.

   A configuration of a control system of the money handling system according to the present
   embodiment is explained below by using FIG. 3.        As shown in FIG. 3, the controlling unit
   50 is arranged inside the housing la of the banknote handling machine 1.                Various
   structural components of the banknote handling machine 1 are controlled by this
30 controlling unit 50.   More particularly, the banknote inserting unit 10, the transport unit 12,

                                                 14
   the banknote detecting sensors 12a, the recognition unit 14, the shutter mechanism 17, the
   storing and feeding units 20, and the like are connected to the controlling unit 50. A signal
   representing a recognition result of the banknote by the recognition unit 14 and a signal
   representing a detection result of the banknote by each of the banknote detecting sensors
 5 12a are sent to the controlling unit 50.   The controlling unit 50 controls various structural
   components, such as the banknote inserting unit 10, the transport unit 12, the shutter
   mechanism 17, and the storing and feeding units 20, by sending a command signal to the
   respective structural component.     Moreover, inside the housing 101 a of the coin handling
   machine 101       is arranged a controlling unit 180 for controlling various structural
10 components of the coin handling machine 101.        The controlling unit 50 arranged inside
   the housing 1a of the banknote handling machine 1 and the controlling unit 180 arranged
   inside the housing 101a of the coin handling machine 101 are connected to each other with
   a signal line allowing transmission and reception of signals between the controlling unit 50
   and the controlling unit 180.
15 [0036]
   As shown in FIG. 3, an operation/display unit 54, a memory 56, and a communication
   interface unit 58 are connected to the controlling unit 50.  The operation/display unit 54 is
   constituted by, for example, a touch screen and the like arranged on a front surface or a top
   surface of the housing 1a.    On the operation/display unit 54 are displayed a handling state
20 of the banknotes in the banknote handling machine 1 and / or the coins in the coin handling
   machine 101, and information and the like about an inventory amount per denomination of
   the banknotes stored in each of the storing and feeding units 20 of the banknote handling
   machine 1 and / or the coins stored in each of the storing and feeding units of the coin
   handling machine 101, and the like.      The operator can input various commands into the
25 controlling unit 50 of the banknote handling machine 1 and the controlling unit 180 of the
   coin handling machine 101 by operating the operation/display unit 54.       In the memory 56
   are stored a handling history of the banknotes handled by the banknote handling machine
   1 and / or the coins handled by the coin handling machine 101, and information and the like
   about an inventory amount per denomination of the banknotes stored in each of the storing
30 and feeding units 20 of the banknote handling machine 1 and / or the coins stored in each

                                                     15
   of the storing and feeding units of the coin handling machine 101, and the like.         The
   controlling unit 50 can transmit and receive signals via the communication interface unit 58
   to and from an external device (specifically, for example, a POS register) provided
   separately from the banknote handling machine 1 and the coin handling machine 101.
 5 Moreover, in the money handling system according to the present embodiment, if it is
   possible to use a not-shown mobile device such as a mobile telephone, smartphone, and
    Pad (Registered Trademark), the controlling unit 50 transmits and receives signals via the
   communication interface unit 58 to this mobile device.
   [0037]
10 A detailed configuration of the storing and feeding unit 20 that includes the two banknote
   storing mechanisms 24 and 26 (that is, the second storing and feeding unit 20 from the top
   and the third storing and feeding unit 20 from the top among the four storing and feeding
   units 20 shown in FIG. 2) is explained below by using FIG. 4 to FIG. 8D.
   [0038]
15 The second storing and feeding unit 20 from the top and the third storing and feeding unit
   20 from the top among the four storing and feeding units 20 of the banknote handling
   machine 1 shown in FIG. 2 has a casing 20a of a substantially rectangular parallelepiped
   shape and the two banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 arranged inside the casing
   20a.    The banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 are aligned along a depth direction
20 (specifically, the right direction in FIG. 4) of the casing 20a. Each of the banknote storing
   mechanisms 24 and 26 can store therein the banknote sent inside the casing 20a from the
   outside thereof (specifically, the banknote sent by the transport unit 12), and each of the
   banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 can feed the banknote stored therein to the
   transport unit 12.     When a surface of the casing 20a of the substantially rectangular
25 parallelepiped shape having the largest surface area is assumed as a rectangle, the depth
   direction of the casing 20a can be defined as a direction parallel to the long sides of the
   rectangle.    Alternatively, when a surface on which an insertion inlet 24b for sending the
   banknote inside the casing 20a from the outside thereof has been formed is assumed as a
   front surface and a surface opposite to this front surface is assumed as a back surface, the
30 depth direction of the casing 20a can be defined as a direction from the front surface to the

                                                     16
   back surface.     Alternatively, when the casing 20a is assumed to have a laterally-extending
   substantially rectangular parallelepiped shape as shown in FIG. 4, the depth direction of
   the casing 20a can be defined as the lateral direction.         Alternatively, the further inside in
   the depth direction of the casing 20a can be defined as a downstream side of a direction in
 5 which the banknote is sent inside the casing 20a.           A banknote transport mechanism 32
   that sends the banknote from an insertion inlet 26b to the banknote storing mechanism 26
   is arranged inside the casing 20a but below the banknote storing mechanism 24.                In this
   structure, it can be defined that, the front side in the depth direction is a side in which the
   insertion inlet 26b has been arranged, and the further inside in the depth direction is a
10 downstream side toward which the banknote sent in from the insertion inlet 26b is
   transported by the banknote transport mechanism 32.            More specifically, it can be defined
   that, the front side in the depth direction is the left side in FIG. 4 and the further inside in the
   depth direction is the right side in FIG. 4.      Note that, the casing 20a is not limited to an
   integrated housing structure.       That is, the casing 20a can be constituted by assembling a
15 plurality of parts.    Moreover, the casing 20a can have a cubic shape.            The storing and
   feeding unit 20 can be constituted by assembling a plurality of separate units.              In this
   structure, it is sufficient that the overall external appearance of the storing and feeding unit
   20 has a substantially rectangular parallelepiped shape.           In brief, the casing 20a is an
   outer cover of the storing and feeding unit 20, and it can be one structural component itself,
20 can be combined with other structural component, or can be constituted as an assembly of
   a plurality of structural components.
   [0039]
   The banknote storing mechanism 24 present in the front side in the depth direction of the
   casing 20a, as shown in FIG. 4 and the like, includes the drum 24a (rotating member) that
25 rotates around an axis arranged orthogonal to the depth direction of the casing 20a, a pair
   of belt-shaped tapes 30a and 30b (winding member) with one end thereof connected to a
   predetermined place (for example, an outer peripheral surface or the axis) of the drum 24a,
   a reel 25a (winding member accommodating unit) to which the other end of one of the
   tapes 30a is connected and that can accommodate the tape 30a, and a reel 25b (winding
30 member accommodating unit) to which the other end of the other tape 30b is connected

                                                   17
   and that can accommodate the tape 30b.              The banknote storing mechanism 24 is
   provided with a motor 28 (driving unit) for rotationally driving at least one of the drum 24a
   and the reels 25a and 25b.     Specifically, the motor 28 can cause a not-shown endless belt
   to perform a circulating movement in a forward direction and a reverse direction.      A pulley
 5 is arranged on each of the axis of the drum 24a and axes of the reels 25a and 25b, and the
   endless belt is looped over these pulleys. Accordingly, the drum 24a and the reels 25a
   and 25b can be rotated in a winding direction of the banknotes on the drum 24a and an
   unwinding direction of the banknotes from the drum 24a.       Moreover, the insertion inlet 24b
   is provided in a side surface (specifically, a side surface on the left side in FIG. 4) in the
10 front side in the depth direction of the casing 20a.     The banknotes sent to the banknote
   storing mechanism 24 by the transport unit 12 and the banknotes fed from the banknote
   storing mechanism 24 and sent to the transport unit 12 pass through this insertion inlet 24b.
   As shown in FIG. 5, the banknote storing mechanism 24 is provided with a pressing
   member 24c for pressing down the banknotes wound on the drum 24a between the tapes
15 30a and 30b.     The pressing member 24c is pivotable around an axis 24d provided at an
   end portion thereof.   Moreover, the axis 24d is provided with a torsion spring for pushing
   the pressing member 24c toward the drum 24a.                Because of this torsion spring,
   irrespective of whether the number of the banknotes wound on the drum 24a is large or
   small, the pressing member 24c always pushes the banknotes wound on the drum 24a
20 towards a center of the drum 24a.
   [0040]
   In the banknote storing mechanism 24 having the above configuration, banknotes can be
   stored one after the other on the drum 24a when the tapes 30a and 30b are wound on the
   drum 24a while the banknotes have been sandwiched between the tapes 30a and 30b,
25 and the banknotes can be fed one after the other from the drum 24a by unwinding the
   tapes 30a and 30b from the drum 24a.             In the present embodiment, the banknotes
   inserted by the transport unit 12 inside the casing 20a through the insertion inlet 24b are
   sandwiched between the tapes 30a and 30b, and the tapes 30a and 30b with the
   banknotes sandwiched therebetween are wound on the drum 24a.                     Moreover, by
30 unwinding the tapes 30a and 30b from the drum 24a, the banknotes fed from the drum 24a

                                                   18
   can be sent to the transport unit 12 through the insertion inlet 24b.
   [0041]
   The banknote storing mechanism 26 present further inside in the depth direction of the
   casing 20a, as shown in FIG. 4 and the like, includes the drum 26a (rotating member) that
 5 rotates around an axis arranged orthogonal to the depth direction of the casing 20a, a pair
   of belt-shaped tapes 31a and 31b (winding member) with one end thereof connected to a
   predetermined place (for example, an outer peripheral surface or the axis) of the drum 26a,
   a reel 27a (winding member accommodating unit) to which the other end of one of the
   tapes 31 a is connected and that can accommodate the tape 31 a, and a reel 27b (winding
10 member accommodating unit) to which the other end of the other tape 31b is connected
   and that can accommodate the tape 31b.              The banknote storing mechanism 26 is
   provided with a motor 29 (driving unit) for rotationally driving at least one of the drum 26a
   and the reels 27a and 27b.     Specifically, the motor 29 can cause a not-shown endless belt
   to perform a circulating movement in a forward direction and a reverse direction.        A pulley
15 is arranged on each of the axis of the drum 26a and axes of the reels 27a and 27b, and the
   endless belt is looped over these pulleys. Accordingly, the drum 26a and the reels 27a
   and 27b can be rotated in a winding direction of the banknote on the drum 26a and an
   unwinding direction of the banknotes from the drum 26a.        Moreover, the insertion inlet 26b
   is provided in the side surface (specifically, the side surface on the left side in FIG. 4) in the
20 front side in the depth direction of the casing 20a.     The banknotes sent to the banknote
   storing mechanism 26 by the transport unit 12 and the banknotes fed from the banknote
   storing mechanism 26 and sent to the transport unit 12 pass through this insertion inlet 26b.
   The insertion inlet 26b is provided below the insertion inlet 24b in a height direction of the
   casing 20a.     As shown in FIG. 5, the banknote storing mechanism 26 is provided with a
25 pressing member 26c for pressing down the banknotes wound on the drum 26a between
   the tapes 31a and 31b. The pressing member 26c is pivotable around an axis 26d
   provided at an end portion thereof.       Moreover, the axis 26d is provided with a torsion
   spring for pushing the pressing member 26c toward the drum 26a.                 Because of this
   torsion spring, irrespective of whether the number of the banknotes wound on the drum
30 26a is large or small, the pressing member 26c always pushes the banknotes wound on

                                                  19
   the drum 26a towards a center of the drum 26a.
   [0042]
   As shown in FIG. 4 and the like, the banknote transport mechanism 32 for sending the
   banknotes from the insertion inlet 26b to the banknote storing mechanism 26 and for
 5 sending the banknotes fed by the banknote storing mechanism 26 to the insertion inlet 26b
   is arranged in a region below the banknote storing mechanism 24 in the casing 20a.          In
   the present embodiment, the banknotes inserted by the transport unit 12 inside the casing
   20a through the insertion inlet 26b are sent to the banknote storing mechanism 26 by the
   banknote transport mechanism 32, the banknotes sent to the banknote storing mechanism
10 26 are sandwiched between the tapes 31a and 31b, and the tapes 31a and 31b with the
   banknotes sandwiched therebetween are wound on the drum 26a.                    Moreover, by
   unwinding the tapes 31a and 31b from the drum 26a, the banknotes fed from the drum 26a
   are sent by the banknote transport mechanism 32 to the insertion inlet 26b, and the
   banknotes are sent to the transport unit 12 through the insertion inlet 26b.
15 [0043]
   In the present embodiment, as shown in FIG. 4, the banknote transport mechanism 32
   includes a pair of top and bottom endless belts 32a, and each of the endless belts 32a is
   looped over a plurality of pulleys 32b.    In the banknote transport mechanism 32 having
   such a configuration, the banknotes are transported between the insertion inlet 26b and the
20 banknote storing mechanism 26 when the endless belts 32a are caused to make a
   circulating movement with the banknotes sandwiched between the endless belts 32a.
   Moreover, as shown in FIG. 7, a gear 32c is coaxially fixed to one of the pulleys 32b
   (specifically, the pulley 32b located in the most front side in the depth direction of the
   storing and feeding unit 20) among the pulleys 32b on which the endless belts 32a are
25 looped.    The pulley 32b and the gear 32c rotate synchronously around one shaft as a
   center.   As shown in FIG. 7, the transport unit 12 includes an endless belt 12b for
   transporting the banknote in the vertical direction inside the lower unit 3. This endless belt
   12b is looped over a plurality of pulleys 12c.     Moreover, a gear 12d is coaxially fixed to
   one of the pulleys 12c, which opposes the pulley 32b in the banknote transport mechanism
30 32 of the storing and feeding unit 20, among the pulleys 12c on which the endless belt 12b

                                                    20
   is looped.     The pulley 12c and the gear 12d rotate synchronously around one shaft as a
   center. As shown in FIG. 7, the gear 32c and the gear 12d are engaged with each other
   so that the gear 32c rotates when the gear 12d rotates.       With such a configuration, even if
   a driving source of the endless belts 32a in the banknote transport mechanism 32 is not
 5 arranged inside the storing and feeding unit 20, because a driving force of the endless belt
   12b in the transport unit 12 can be conveyed to the banknote transport mechanism 32 via
   the gears 12d and 32c, each of the endless belts 32a can be caused to perform the
   circulating movement.        Moreover, even if the driving source of the endless belts 32a is not
   arranged inside the casing 20a of the storing and feeding unit 20, a driving force of the
10 endless belts 32a can be obtained from the outside of the storing and feeding unit 20.
   [0044]
   A unit configuration of the storing and feeding unit 20 including the two banknote storing
   mechanisms 24 and 26 is explained below by using FIG. 6.               As shown in FIG. 6, the
   storing and feeding unit 20 can have a structure that can be divided into a plurality of units.
15 More particularly, the storing and feeding unit 20 has a first side wall 33 that is arranged on
   a side of the banknote storing mechanism 24, and a second side wall 34 that is arranged
   on sides of both the banknote storing mechanism 26 and the banknote transport
   mechanism 32.         The first side wall 33 and the second side wall 34 are separable from
   each other.      Moreover, the drum 24a, the reels 25a and 25b, and the motor 28 of the
20 banknote storing mechanism 24 are fixed to the first side wall 33 and constitute a first unit,
   and the banknote transport mechanism 32 and the drum 26a, the reels 27a and 27b, and
   the motor 29 of the banknote storing mechanism 26 are fixed to the second side wall 34
   and constitute a second unit.        Because the banknote storing mechanism 24 included in
   the first unit is driven by the motor 28 and the banknote storing mechanism 26 included in
25 the second unit is driven by the motor 29, the first unit and the second unit are driven
   independently from each other.          Moreover, the first unit and the second unit always
   receive or deliver the banknote via the transport unit 12.            Accordingly, the first unit
   including the banknote storing mechanism 24 and the second unit including the banknote
   storing mechanism 26 can be separated from each other. Moreover, when one between
30 the first unit and the second unit fails or becomes needless, only one between them can be

                                                   21
   connected to the transport unit 12 to continue the use.       Note that, as another embodiment
   of the storing and feeding unit 20, a structure is allowable in which the second unit is further
   divided into a third unit including the banknote storing mechanism 26 and a fourth unit
   including the banknote transport mechanism 32.                 Because the banknote storing
 5 mechanism 24 included in the third unit is driven by the motor 29 and the banknote
   transport mechanism 32 included in the fourth unit is driven by the driving force of the
   transport unit 12, the third unit and the fourth unit are driven independently from each other.
   Accordingly, for example, another unit varying in the maximum storable banknote number
   can be used as the third unit.      Moreover, an opening 34a is arranged on a side of the
10 banknote transport mechanism 32 in the second side wall 34.           The operator can see the
   endless belts 32a of the banknote transport mechanism 32 through this opening 34a.
   Accordingly, when a trouble such as jamming of the banknote occurs in the endless belts
   32a of the banknote transport mechanism 32, the operator can immediately check the
   banknote jammed in the endless belts 32a through the opening 34a.                Moreover, in a
15 structure in which the storing and feeding unit 20 can be divided in a plurality of units, an
   outer cover of the storing and feeding unit 20 with the assembled units constitutes the
   casing 20a.
   [0045]
   As shown in FIG. 6, an opening and shutting guide 36 is arranged in a bottom part of the
20 banknote storing mechanism 26 side in the banknote transport mechanism 32.                  The
   opening and shutting guide 36 is rotatable around an axis 36a in a direction shown with an
   arrow in FIG. 6.    Ordinarily, the opening and shutting guide 36 is positioned at a position
   shown with a solid line in FIG. 6.       However, when a trouble such as jamming of the
   banknote occurs at an entrance point where the tapes 31 a and 31 b overlap in the banknote
25 storing mechanism 26, the opening and shutting guide 36 is moved to a position shown
   with a two-dot chain line in FIG. 6 thereby opening the bottom part of the banknote
   transport mechanism 32.        By providing such an opening and shutting guide 36, even
   when jamming of the banknote occurs at the entrance point of the banknote storing
   mechanism 26 as the banknote sent to the banknote storing mechanism 26 by the
30 banknote transport mechanism 32 is not sandwiched between the tapes 31 a and 31 b when

                                                 22
   storing the banknote in the banknote storing mechanism 26, or jamming of the banknote
   occurs between the banknote storing mechanism 26 and the banknote transport
   mechanism 32 as the banknote released from between the tapes 31a and 31b is not
   sandwiched between the endless belts 32a of the banknote transport mechanism 32 when
 5 feeding the banknote from the banknote storing mechanism 26 and sending the banknote
   to the banknote transport mechanism 32, the operator can remove the jammed banknote
   after opening the opening and shutting guide 36.          Note that, in the banknote storing
   mechanism 24, because the point where the banknote is sandwiched between the tapes
   30a and 30b is close to the insertion inlet 24b, when a trouble such as the jamming of the
10 banknote occurs at the point where the tapes 30a and 30b overlap at the time of storing the
   banknote in the banknote storing mechanism 24 and / or feeding the banknote from the
   banknote storing mechanism 24, the operator can remove the jammed banknote through
   the insertion inlet 24b.
   [0046]
15 In the present embodiment, as shown with a two-dot chain line in FIG. 8A, at least one of
   the drums 24a and 26a is arranged at a position at which the drum does not overlap with
   any of the reels 25a, 25b, 27a, and 27b when viewed in a predetermined direction.         The
   predetermined direction (that is, the up-down direction in FIG. 4 and FIG. 8A) is orthogonal
   to the depth direction of the casing 20a and also orthogonal to an axis direction of the
20 drums 24a and 26a. The casing 20a has a substantially rectangular parallelepiped shape,
   and a side surface of the substantially rectangular parallelepiped shape having the largest
   surface area is a rectangle. The direction of the long sides of the rectangle is the depth
   direction of the casing, and the drums 24a and 26a are arranged side by side along the
   depth direction of the casing.      In this configuration, the predetermined direction is a
25 direction along a surface that is orthogonal to the axis direction of the drums 24a and 26a
   (that is, the surface of the paper sheet on which FIG. 4 has been printed), and is a direction
   along a surface that is orthogonal to the long sides of the side surface of the substantially
   rectangular parallelepiped shaped casing 20a having the largest surface area.       Note that,
   in the storing and feeding unit 20 having the configuration shown in FIG. 4, both the drums
30 24a and 26a are arranged at the positions at which the drums do not overlap with any of

                                                   23
   the reels 25a, 25b, 27a, and 27b in the predetermined direction.     Moreover, in the present
   embodiment, at least one of the drums 24a and 26a is arranged at a position at which the
   drum does not overlap with any of the motors 28 and 29 in the predetermined direction.
   Note that, in the storing and feeding unit 20 having the configuration shown in FIG. 4, both
 5 the drums 24a and 26a are arranged at the positions at which the drums do not overlap
   with any of the motors 28 and 29 in the predetermined direction.      Because the drums 24a
   and 26a are arranged at the positions at which the drums do not overlap with any of the
   reels 25a, 25b, 27a, and 27b and any of the motors 28 and 29 in the predetermined
   direction, even if the length of the casing 20a in the predetermined direction is previously
10 fixed, a diameter of an outer peripheral edge of the outermost tapes 30a, 30b, 31a, and
   31b wound on the drums 24a and 26a when the banknotes of the maximum storable
   number are stored therein can be made relatively large.           Therefore, in the present
   embodiment, in comparison to a case in which each of the drums 24a and 26a overlaps at
   least partially with at least one of the reels 25a, 25b, 27a, and 27b and the motors 28 and
15 29 in the predetermined direction, the maximum storable banknote number in each of the
   banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 can be increased.                 Note that, the outer
   peripheral edge of any of the tapes 30a, 30b, 31 a, and 31 b wound on any of the drums 24a
   and 26a when the banknotes of the maximum storable number are stored therein is an
   outer peripheral edge of a circle defined by the outermost turn of any of the tapes 30a, 30b,
20 31a, and 31b when the banknotes of the maximum storable number are wound on any of
   the drums 24a and 26a in a substantially concentric manner.
   [0047]
   In the present embodiment, as shown with a two-dot chain line in FIG. 8B, the outer
   peripheral edge of any of the tapes 30a and 30b wound on the drum 24a when the
25 banknotes of the maximum storable number are stored in the banknote storing mechanism
   24 does not overlap with any of the reels 25a and 25b and the motor 28 in the
   predetermined direction.      Moreover, the outer peripheral edge of any of the tapes 31a and
   31b wound on the drum 26a when the banknotes of the maximum storable number are
   stored in the banknote storing mechanism 26 does not overlap with any of the reels 27a
30 and 27b and the motor 29 in the predetermined direction.          With this configuration, the

                                                  24
   maximum storable banknote number in the banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 can
   be increased.     In the storing and feeding unit 20 having the configuration shown in FIG. 4,
   the outer peripheral edge of any of the tapes 31a and 31b wound on the drum 26a when
   the banknotes of the maximum storable number are stored in the banknote storing
 5 mechanism 26 is overlapping with the motor 28 of the banknote storing mechanism 24 in
   the predetermined direction; however, the configuration is not limited to this configuration.
   In a storing and feeding unit according to a variation, it is possible to adopt a configuration
   such that in all banknote storing mechanism an outer peripheral edge of a tape wound on a
   drum when banknotes of the maximum storable number are stored therein does not
10 overlap with any of reels and motors in a predetermined direction.
   [0048]
   In the present embodiment, as shown with a two-dot chain line in FIG. 8C, the outer
   peripheral edge of any of the tapes 30a, 30b, 31 a, and 31 b wound on any of the drums 24a
   and 26a when the banknotes of the maximum storable number are stored in any of the
15 banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 overlaps at least partially with at least one of the
   reels 25a, 25b, 27a, and 27b and the motors 28 and 29 in the depth direction of the casing
   20a (that is, the left-right direction in FIG. 4 and FIG. 8C).     In this configuration, in the
   banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26, because the drums 24a and 26a, the reels 25a,
   25b, 27a, and 27b, and the motors 28 and 29 are arranged side by side along the depth
20 direction of the casing 20a, a dead space inside the casing 20a is reduced, the space
   inside the casing 20a can be used effectively, and the length in the predetermined direction
   of the casing 20a can be reduced.
   [0049]
   In the present embodiment, in at least one of the banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26,
25 any of the reels 25a and 25b, and the reels 27a and 27b are arranged further inside in the
   depth direction of the casing 20a than the corresponding drum 24a and 26a.         Note that, in
   the storing and feeding unit 20 having the configuration shown in FIG. 4, in both the
   banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26, the reels 25a, 25b, 27a, and 27b are arranged
   further inside in the depth direction of the casing 20a than the corresponding drums 24a
30 and 26a.     Moreover, in the present embodiment, in at least one of the banknote storing

                                                 25
   mechanisms 24 and 26, any of the motors 28 and 29 is arranged further inside in the depth
   direction of the casing 20a than the corresponding drum 24a and 26a.         Note that, in the
   storing and feeding unit 20 having the configuration shown in FIG. 4, in both the banknote
   storing mechanisms 24 and 26, the motors 28 and 29 are arranged further inside in the
 5 depth direction of the casing 20a than the corresponding drums 24a and 26a.             In this
   arrangement, in at least the banknote storing mechanism 24 on the front side in the depth
   direction of the casing 20a, a distance between the drum 24a and the insertion inlet 24b
   can be reduced. Accordingly, occurrence of the trouble such as jamming of the banknote
   before the banknote is wound on the drum 24a and / or jamming of the banknote fed by the
10 drum 24a can be prevented.
   [0050]
   In the present embodiment, as shown with a two-dot chain line in FIG. 8D, all the reels 25a,
   25b, 27a, and 27b are arranged around the drum 26a located further inside in the depth
   direction of the casing 20a among the drums 24a and 26a.       Moreover, both the motors 28
15 and 29 are arranged around the drum 26a located further inside in the depth direction of
   the casing 20a among the drums 24a and 26a.        Accordingly, because the reels 25a, 25b,
   27a, and 27b and the motors 28 and 29 are arranged further inside in the depth direction of
   the casing 20a, a center of gravity of the storing and feeding unit 20 having the two
   banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 will be located further inside in the depth direction
20 of the casing 20a.    When carrying the storing and feeding unit 20, the operator grips with
   his hand a handle 20b provided on a side surface that is further inside in the depth direction
   of the casing 20a (specifically, the side surface on the right side in FIG. 4) to remove the
   storing and feeding unit 20 from the lower unit 3 of the banknote handling machine 1 or
   accommodate the storing and feeding unit 20 in the lower unit 3.       Because the center of
25 gravity of the storing and feeding unit 20 having the two banknote storing mechanisms 24
   and 26 is near the handle 20b, the work load on the operator in carrying the storing and
   feeding unit 20 by gripping the handle 20b can be reduced.       Moreover, the work load on
   the operator when removing the storing and feeding unit 20 from the lower unit 3 of the
   banknote handling machine 1 or accommodating the storing and feeding unit 20 in the
30 lower unit 3 can be reduced.

                                                 26
   [0051]
   In the present embodiment, when two banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 are
   arranged inside the casing 20a, a ratio of a length "n" of a long side to a length "m"of a
   short side of a side surface of the casing 20a along the surface that is orthogonal to the
 5 axis direction of the drums 24a and 26a (that is, the surface of the paper sheet on which
   FIG. 4 has been printed), is between 2 and 3.     When the length of the casing 20a in the
   predetermined direction (that is, the up-down direction in FIG. 4 and FIG. 8A) is previously
   fixed, the diameter of the outer peripheral edge of the outermost turn of the tapes 30a, 30b,
   31a, and 31b wound on the drums 24a and 26a when the banknotes of the maximum
10 storable number are stored therein can be made relatively large.         Moreover, it can be
   prevented that the length in the depth direction of the casing 20a becomes too long to
   accommodate the drums 24a and 26a, the reels 25a, 25b, 27a, and 27b, and the motors
   28 and 29 inside the casing 20a.
   [0052]
15 In the present embodiment, the storing and feeding unit 20 having the two banknote storing
   mechanisms 24 and 26 constitutes a banknote storing device that can store the banknotes
   and feed the stored banknotes.
   [0053]
   An operation of the money handling system according to the present embodiment is
20 explained below. Specifically, operations relating to the money deposition process, the
   money dispensing process, and a collection process of the banknote in the banknote
   handling machine 1 are explained below.          Note that, the operation of the banknote
   handling machine 1 explained below is performed by the controlling unit 50 by controlling
   the various structural components of the banknote handling machine 1.
25 [0054]
   At first, the operation relating to the money deposition process of the banknote in the
   banknote handling machine 1 is explained below.       When the operator inputs a command
   to start the money deposition process of the banknote by operating the operation/display
   unit 54 and inserts the banknotes in the banknote inserting unit 10, the banknotes inserted
30 in the banknote inserting unit 10 are fed one by one inside the housing 1a by the plurality of

                                                 27
   rollers such as the feed rollers and the kicker rollers arranged in the banknote inserting unit
   10, and the fed banknotes are transported by the transport unit 12.            Moreover, the
   recognition unit 14 performs various recognition such as denomination, authenticity, fitness,
   version, face side up / back side up, and transportation state of the banknotes transported
 5 by the transport unit 12.      A banknote judged to be a normal banknote based on a
   recognition result obtained in the recognition unit 14 is delivered from the upper unit 2 to
   the lower unit 3 by the transport unit 12, and such banknotes are stored in the storing and
   feeding units 20 provided inside the lower unit 3 depending on the denominations of the
   banknotes.     On the other hand, a banknote whose denomination could not be recognized
10 by the recognition unit 14 is sent to the banknote ejecting unit 16, and such banknotes are
   stacked in the banknote ejecting unit 16.     Moreover, a banknote whose denomination is
   recognized by the recognition unit 14 but the banknote is recognized as being a counterfeit
   banknote or a suspicious banknote about the authentication by the recognition unit 14 is
   sent to the banknote storing unit 19 by the transport unit 12, and such banknotes are
15 stored in the banknote storing unit 19.      Thus, both the banknote that is recognized as
   being the counterfeit banknote by the recognition unit 14 and the banknote that is
   recognized as being the suspicious banknote about the authentication by the recognition
   unit 14 are stored in the banknote storing unit 19.             Moreover, a banknote of a
   denomination that is not allocated to any one of the storing and feeding units 20, and / or
20 an overflow banknote, which is a banknote that cannot be stored because the storing and
   feeding unit 20 of a corresponding denomination is full, is sent to the collecting unit 40 by
   the transport unit 12, and such banknotes are stored in the banknote storage bag mounted
   in the collecting unit 40.  Then, when all the banknotes are fed from the banknote inserting
   unit 10 to the inside of the housing 1a and sent to any one of the storing and feeding units
25 20, the banknote storing unit 19, and the collecting unit 40, the money deposition process
   of the banknote in the banknote handling machine 1 is completed.
   [0055]
   Then, the operation relating to the money dispensing process of the banknote in the
   banknote handling machine 1 is explained below.         When the operator inputs the number
30 per denomination of the banknotes to be dispensed, the total amount to be dispensed, and

                                                  28
   the like and inputs a command to start the money dispensing process of the banknote by
   operating the operation/display unit 54, the banknotes to be dispensed are fed one by one
   from the corresponding storing and feeding unit 20 to the transport unit 12, and the
   banknotes are delivered from the lower unit 3 to the upper unit 2 by the transport unit 12.
 5 Then, a banknote judged not to have the transportation abnormality based on detection
   results obtained in the banknote detecting sensors 12a is sent to the banknote ejecting unit
   16, and such banknotes are stacked in the banknote ejecting unit 16.       A banknote judged
   to have the transportation abnormality based on the detection results obtained in the
   banknote detecting sensors 12a (that is, dispensing reject banknote) is sent to the
10 banknote storing unit 18, and such banknotes are stored in the banknote storing unit 18.
   Then, when all the banknotes that should be dispensed are sent to the banknote ejecting
   unit 16 and stacked in the banknote ejecting unit 16, the operator opens the banknote
   ejection opening of the banknote ejecting unit 16 by opening the shutter mechanism 17
   and removes the banknotes from the banknote ejecting unit 16 outside of the housing 1a.
15 Then, when the banknotes are removed from the banknote ejecting unit 16 outside of the
   housing 1a, the banknote ejection opening in the banknote ejecting unit 16 is closed again
   by closing the shutter mechanism 17.       In this manner, the money dispensing process of
   the banknote in the banknote handling machine 1 is completed.
   [0056]
20 Then, the operation relating to the collection process of the banknote in the banknote
   handling machine 1 is explained below.         When the guard and the like of the secure
   transportation company inputs a command to start the collection process of the banknote
   by operating the operation/display unit 54, all the banknotes stored in the storing and
   feeding units 20 are fed one by one from the storing and feeding unit 20 to the transport
25 unit 12, and the banknotes are sent to the collecting unit 40 by the transport unit 12.
   Specifically, a not-shown banknote storage bag for storing the banknotes is detachably
   attached in the collecting unit 40, and the banknotes sent by the transport unit 12 from the
   storing and feeding units 20 to the collecting unit 40 are stored in the banknote storage bag.
   Then, when all the banknotes are sent from the storing and feeding unit 20 to the collecting
30 unit 40 and stored in the banknote storage bag mounted in the collecting unit 40, the guard

                                                  29
   and the like of the secure transportation company opens the door of the lower unit 3 and
   removes the banknote storage bag from the collecting unit 40 thereby collecting the
   banknotes together with the banknote storage bag from the banknote handling machine 1.
   In this manner, when the banknote storage bag in which the banknotes have been stored is
 5 removed from the banknote handling machine 1, the collection process of the banknote in
   the banknote handling machine 1 is completed.       Note that, it is not necessary to collect all
   the banknotes stored in all the storing and feeding units 20 in the collection process.     That
   is, it is allowable to collect only a predetermined number of banknotes or banknotes of a
   predetermined amount input from the operation/display unit 54.
10 [0057]
   In the banknote handling machine 1 according to the present embodiment, one
   denomination can be assigned to each of the banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26
   (specifically, each of the drums 22a, 24a, and 26a) in the four storing and feeding units 20.
   When doing so, mutually different denominations can be assigned to each of the banknote
15 storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26, or the same denomination can be assigned to at least
   two of the banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26.            Furthermore, in a banknote
   handling machine 1 having a device configuration in which the number of the banknote
   storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 is maximum, a setting to previously assign a
   denomination to each of the banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 can be made.
20 When one or more of the banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 fails, or the number
   of units of the banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 changes, the denomination set
   previously is continued.      Such an embodiment is explained by using FIGS. 9A to 9D.
   The banknote handling machine 1 shown in FIG. 9A, having a device configuration in which
   the number of the banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 is maximum, has the
25 device configuration in which the first storing and feeding unit 20 from the top includes one
   banknote storing mechanism 22, the second storing and feeding unit 20 from the top
   includes two banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26, the third storing and feeding unit 20
   from the top includes two banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26, and the fourth storing
   and feeding unit 20 from the top includes one banknote storing mechanism 22 thus
30 including six banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24 and 26 in total.          In this configuration,

                                                 30
   the controlling unit 50 assigns each of denominations a, b, c, d, e, and f to each of the six
   banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 having the maximum configuration, and this
   relation among the banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 and the denominations is
   stored in the memory 56.      For example, 10 Euro is assigned as the denomination "a" to
 5 the banknote storing mechanism 22 of the first storing and feeding unit 20 from the top
   among the four storing and feeding units 20, 5 Euro is assigned as the denomination "b"to
   the banknote storing mechanism 24 and 50 Euro is assigned as the denomination "c" to
   the banknote storing mechanism 26 of the second storing and feeding unit 20 from the top,
   100 Euro is assigned as the denomination "d"to the banknote storing mechanism 24 and
10 200 Euro is assigned as the denomination "e" to the banknote storing mechanism 26 of the
   third storing and feeding unit 20 from the top, and 20 Euro is assigned as the denomination
   "f" to the banknote storing mechanism 22 of the fourth storing and feeding unit 20 from the
   top.
   [0058]
15 As shown in FIG. 9A, when one denomination is assigned to each of the banknote storing
   mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 in the four storing and feeding units 20, and, for example,
   when a trouble such as jamming of the banknote occurs in the banknote storing
   mechanism 26 of the second storing and feeding unit 20 from the top whereby this
   banknote storing mechanism 26 cannot be used, storing of the banknotes in and feeding of
20 the banknotes from cannot be performed in this banknote storing mechanism 26 of the
   second storing and feeding unit 20 from the top.      When this happens, the denomination
   assigned to each of the banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 of the other storing
   and feeding unit 20 are continued with the previously assigned denomination, and the
   operation of storing and feeding of the banknotes is continued (see FIG. 9B).    In this case,
25 for example, when a denomination of the banknote recognized by the recognition unit 14
   while the money deposition process of the banknote is being performed is the
   denomination assigned to the banknote storing mechanism 26 that is out of service (that is,
   50 Euro), such a banknote is sent to the collecting unit 40 and stored in the banknote
   storage bag.    In this manner, it is possible to realize limited operation in the banknote
30 handling machine 1 according to the present embodiment in which use of the banknote

                                                 31
   storing mechanism other than the banknote storing mechanism that is out of service
   among the banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 in the storing and feeding units 20
   can be continued.
   [0059]
 5 In the banknote handling machine 1 according to the present embodiment, the storing and
   feeding unit 20 including the two banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 can be replaced
   with a storing and feeding unit 20 including the one banknote storing mechanism 22.      As
   shown in FIG. 9C, when the second storing and feeding unit 20 from the top is replaced
   with the storing and feeding unit 20 including the one banknote storing mechanism 22, the
10 denomination "c" previously assigned to the banknote storing mechanism 26 of the
   previous storing and feeding unit 20 is assigned to this banknote storing mechanism 22.
   More particularly, a denomination corresponding to the banknote storing mechanism 26
   having a larger maximum storable banknote number among the banknote storing
   mechanism 24 and the banknote storing mechanism 26 in the original storing and feeding
15 unit 20 is assigned to the banknote storing mechanism 22 of the storing and feeding unit 20
   after the replacement.    Accordingly, for example, when the denomination of the banknote
   recognized by the recognition unit 14 while the money deposition process of the banknote
   is being performed is the denomination "c" assigned to the original storing and feeding unit
   20 (that is, 50 Euro), such a banknote is sent to the banknote storing mechanism 22 of the
20 storing and feeding unit 20 after the replacement and stored in this banknote storing
   mechanism 22.      On the other hand, when the denomination of the banknote recognized
   by the recognition unit 14 while the money deposition process of the banknote is being
   performed is the denomination "b"assigned to the original storing and feeding unit 20 (that
   is, 5 Euro), because no banknote storing mechanism exists that corresponds to the
25 denomination "b" after the replacement of the storing and feeding unit 20 is performed,
   such a banknote is sent to the collecting unit 40 and stored in the banknote storage bag.
   As other example of the present embodiment, when the storing and feeding unit 20
   including the two banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 is replaced with the storing and
   feeding unit 20 including the one banknote storing mechanism 22, setting about the
30 denomination of each of the banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 when such

                                                 32
   replacement of the storing and feeding unit 20 is performed can be previously performed in
   the controlling unit 50 so that a denomination corresponding to the banknote storing
   mechanism 24 having a smaller maximum storable banknote number among the banknote
   storing mechanism 24 and the banknote storing mechanism 26 in the original storing and
 5 feeding unit 20 is assigned to the banknote storing mechanism 22 of the storing and
   feeding unit 20 after the replacement.
   [0060]
   In the banknote handling machine 1 according to the present embodiment, it is not
   necessary to assign each of the denominations a, b, c, d, e, and f to each of the banknote
10 storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 in the four storing and feeding units 20.         Instead of
   assigning each of the denominations a, b, c, d, e, and f to each of the banknote storing
   mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 in the four storing and feeding units 20, the denominations a, b,
   c, d, e, f can be assigned to the diversion points from the transport unit 12 to the banknote
   storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 of each of the storing and feeding units 20. The
15 number of the diversion points from the transport unit 12 to the banknote storing
   mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 of each of the storing and feeding units 20 is equal to the
   maximum number of the banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 that can be
   arranged in the banknote handling machine 1. Therefore, the act of performing the
   setting of assigning the denomination to each of the diversion point is analogues to, in the
20 banknote handling machine 1 having a device configuration in which the number of the
   banknote storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 is maximum, the act of previously performing
   the setting of assigning the denomination to each of the banknote storing mechanisms 22,
   24, and 26.     Such an embodiment is explained by using FIG. 9D.      As mentioned above,
   at every diversion point in the transport unit 12 is arranged the diverter 12e such as the
25 diverting claw.    Each of the denominations a, b, c, d, e, and f is assigned to the
   corresponding diversion point at which the transport unit 12 is diverted to the banknote
   storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 in the storing and feeding units 20.              When the
   denomination of the banknote transported by the transport unit 12 matches with the
   denomination assigned to a certain diversion point, this banknote is diverted from the
30 transport unit 12 by the corresponding diverter 12e and sent to the corresponding banknote

                                                33
   storing mechanisms 22, 24, and 26 of the corresponding storing and feeding unit 20.
   Moreover, in this banknote handling machine 1, an insertion inlet 22b (see FIG. 5) of the
   banknote in the storing and feeding unit 20 including the one banknote storing mechanism
   22 and the insertion inlet 26b of the banknote corresponding to the banknote storing
 5 mechanism 26 in the storing and feeding unit 20 including the two banknote storing
   mechanisms 24 and 26 are located at substantially the same height in the corresponding
   storing and feeding unit 20.     When the storing and feeding unit 20 including the two
   banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 is replaced with the storing and feeding unit 20
   including the one banknote storing mechanism 22, the insertion inlet 26b of the banknote
10 corresponding to the banknote storing mechanism 26 in the storing and feeding unit 20
   including the two banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 and the insertion inlet 22b of the
   banknote in the storing and feeding unit 20 including the one banknote storing mechanism
   22 are connected to the same diversion point. Therefore, even if the storing and feeding
   unit 20 including the two banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 is replaced with the
15 storing and feeding unit 20 including the one banknote storing mechanism 22, the
   denomination corresponding to the banknote storing mechanism 22 of the storing and
   feeding unit 20 after the replacement is assigned as is to the denomination set previously
   for the diversion point to which the banknote storing mechanism 22 is connected.          A
   diversion point that was connected to the insertion inlet 24b of the banknote corresponding
20 to the banknote storing mechanism 24 in the storing and feeding unit 20 that included the
   two banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 before such replacement has no insertion
   inlet to connect after the replacement.  Therefore, the banknote of the denomination set
   previously corresponding to such a diversion point is sent to the collecting unit 40 and
   stored in the banknote storage bag.
25 [0061]
   The storing and feeding unit 20 (banknote storing device) and the banknote handling
   machine 1 including such a storing and feeding unit 20 according to the present
   embodiment are not limited to the embodiments mentioned above and can be changed as
   desired in various manner.
30 [0062]

                                                   34
   For example, the banknote handling machine 1 shown in FIG. 1 and the like is an example
   of a configuration in which the motors 28 and 29 are provided corresponding to the
   banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 in the storing and feeding unit 20 including the
   two banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26; however, the configuration is not limited to
 5 this example.    As another example, the motors 28 and 29 can be omitted from the storing
   and feeding unit 20.     In this configuration, a power transmitted to the storing and feeding
   unit 20 from a body (for example, the transport unit 12) of the banknote handling machine 1
   can be used to rotate the drums 24a and 26a and the reels 25a, 25b, 27a, and 27b of the
   banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26.
10 [0063]
   Moreover, the banknote handling machine 1 shown in FIG. 1 and the like is an example of a
   configuration in which the plurality of (specifically two) banknote storing mechanisms 24
   and 26 is provided in the second storing and feeding unit 20 from the top and the third
   storing and feeding unit 20 from the top among the four storing and feeding units 20;
15 however, the configuration is not limited to this example.   As another example, a banknote
   handling machine in which each of the storing and feeding units 20 includes the plurality of
   the banknote storing mechanisms 24 and 26 can be used.               Moreover, a storing and
   feeding unit (banknote storing device) including three or more banknote storing mechanism
   can be used.
20 [0064]
   Moreover, in the storing and feeding unit 20 (banknote storing device) shown in FIGS. 1 to
   9D, when viewed in the predetermined direction, which is the direction orthogonal to the
   depth direction of the casing 20a and also orthogonal to the axis direction of the drums 24a
   and 26a (rotating members), is taken as the height direction of the banknote handling
25 machine 1; however, the configuration is not limited to this example.               In another
   exemplary configuration of the storing and feeding unit (banknote storing device), an axis
   of a drum on which the banknotes are wound between tapes extends in a vertical direction
   so that the banknotes are stored on the drum vertically with respect to a horizontal plane.
   In this configuration, the predetermined direction in the storing and feeding unit (banknote
30 storing device) extends horizontally (specifically, along the width direction of the banknote

                                                  35
   handling machine).
   [0065]
   The banknote handling machine including the banknote storing device to which the
   principle according to the present invention is applied is not limited to the one having the
 5 configuration shown in FIG. 1 and the like.      As the banknote handling machine including
   the banknote storing device to which the principle according to the present invention is
   applied, a machine dedicated for depositing banknotes, a machine dedicated for
   dispensing banknotes, an automatic teller machine (ATM), a money changer, and the like
   can be used.
10 [0066]
   Moreover, the principle of the storing and feeding unit 20 (banknote storing device)
   according to the present embodiment can be applied to a paper sheet storing device
   including a plurality of tape-reel style paper sheet storing mechanism each of which
   capable of storing paper sheets (for example, checks, gift certificates, and the like) other
15 than the banknotes, and feeding the stored paper sheets. That is, in a paper sheet storing
   device that can store the paper sheets and feed the stored paper sheets, at least one of
   drums (rotating members) is arranged such that the drum does not overlap with any of
   reels (winding member accommodating unit) when viewed in a predetermined direction
   that is a direction orthogonal to a depth direction of a casing and also orthogonal to an axis
20 direction of the drums.
