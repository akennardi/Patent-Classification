        COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR THE DEPLETION OF CD117+ CELLS
                                    Abstract of the Invention
           The invention provides compositions and methods useful for the depletion of
 5 CD117+ cells and for the treatment of various hematopoietic diseases, metabolic
   disorders, cancers, and autoimmune diseases, among others. Described herein are
   antibodies, antigen-binding fragments, ligands, and conjugates thereof that can be
   applied to effect the treatment of these conditions, for instance, by depleting a population
   of CD117+ cells in a patient, such as a human. The compositions and methods
10 described herein can be used to treat a disorder directly, for instance, by depleting a
   population of CD117+ cancer cells or autoimmune cells. The compositions and methods
   described herein can also be used to prepare a patient for hematopoietic stem cell
   transplant therapy and to improve the engraftment of hematopoietic stem cell transplants
   by selectively depleting endogenous hematopoietic stem cells prior to the transplant
15 procedure.

         COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR THE DEPLETION OF CD117+ CELLS
 5
                                       Field of the Invention
            The invention relates to the treatment of patients suffering from various
    pathologies, such as blood diseases, metabolic disorders, cancers, and autoimmune
   diseases, among others, by administration of an antibody, antigen-binding fragment
10 thereof, or ligand capable of binding an antigen expressed by a hematopoietic cell, such
   as a hematopoietic stem cell.
                                   Background of the Invention
                      Despite advances in the medicinal arts, there remains a demand for
15 treating pathologies of the hematopoietic system, such as diseases of a particular blood
   cell, metabolic disorders, cancers, and autoimmune conditions, among others. While
   hematopoietic stem cells have significant therapeutic potential, a limitation that has
   hindered their use in the clinic has been the difficulty associated with ensuring
   engraftment of hematopoietic stem cell transplants in a host. There is currently a need
20 for compositions and methods for promoting the engraftment of exogenous hematopoietic
   stem cell grafts such that the multi-potency and hematopoietic functionality of these cells
   is preserved following transplantation.
                                    Summary of the Invention
25          The present invention provides compositions and methods for the direct
   treatment of various disorders of the hematopoietic system, metabolic disorders, cancers,
   and autoimmune diseases, among others. The invention additionally features methods
   for conditioning a patient, such as a human patient, prior to receiving hematopoietic stem
   cell transplant therapy so as to promote the engraftment of hematopoietic stem cell
30 grafts. The patient may be one that is suffering from one or more blood disorders, such
   as a hemoglobinopathy or other hematopoietic pathology, and is thus in need of
   hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. As described herein, hematopoietic stem cells
   are capable of differentiating into a multitude of cell types in the hematopoietic lineage,
                                                  1

   and can be administered to a patient in order to populate or re-populate a cell type that is
   deficient in the patient. The invention features methods of treating a patient with
   antibodies and drug-antibody conjugates capable of binding proteins expressed by
   hematopoietic cells, such as CD117 (including, for example, GNNK+ CD117), so as to (i)
 5 directly treat a disease such as a blood disorder, metabolic disease, cancer, or
   autoimmune disease, among others described herein, by selectively depleting a
   population of cells that express CD117, such as an aberrant blood cell, cancer cell, or
   autoimmune cell, and/or (ii) deplete a population of endogenous hematopoietic stem
   cells within the patient. The former activity enables the direct treatment of a wide range
10 of disorders associated with a cell of the hematopoietic lineage, as CD117 may be
   expressed by a cancerous cell, such as a leukemic cell, an autoimmune lymphocyte,
   such as a T-cell that expresses a T-cell receptor that cross-reacts with a self antigen,
   among other cell types. The latter activity, the selective depletion of hematopoietic stem
   cells, in turn creates a vacancy that can subsequently be filled by transplantation of an
15 exogenous (for instance, an autologous, allogeneic, or syngeneic) hematopoietic stem
   cell graft. The invention thus provides methods of treating a variety of hematopoietic
   conditions, such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, Fanconi anemia, Wiskott-Aldrich
   syndrome, adenosine deaminase deficiency-severe combined immunodeficiency,
   metachromatic leukodystrophy, Diamond-Blackfan anemia and Schwachman-Diamond
20 syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and acquired immune deficiency
   syndrome, as well as cancers and autoimmune diseases, among others.
             In a first aspect, the invention provides a method of depleting a population of
   CD117+ cells in a human patient by administering an effective amount of an antibody or
   antigen-binding fragment thereof capable of binding CD117 conjugated to a cytotoxin.
25           In another aspect, the invention provides a method of depleting a population of
   CD117+ cells in a human patient in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant by
   administering, prior to the patient receiving a transplant including hematopoietic stem
   cells, an effective amount of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof capable of
   binding CD117 conjugated to a cytotoxin.
30           In another aspect, the invention features a method, for example, of treating a
   human patient in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, including administering to
   a human patient a transplant including hematopoietic stem cells, wherein the patient has
   been previously administered an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof capable of
                                                    2

   binding CD117 conjugated to a cytotoxin in an amount sufficient to deplete a population
   of CD117+ cells in the patient.
            In an additional aspect, the invention features a method, for example, of treating
   a human patient in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, including: administering
 5 to a human patient an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof capable of binding
   CD117 conjugated to a cytotoxin in an amount sufficient to deplete a population of
   CD117+ cells in the patient, and subsequently administering to the patient a transplant
   including hematopoietic stem cells.
            In some embodiments of any of the foregoing aspects of the invention, the
10 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof is conjugated to a cytotoxin.
            In any of the above aspects, the cytotoxin may be, for example, pseudomonas
   exotoxin A, deBouganin, diphtheria toxin, an amatoxin, such as a-amanitin, saporin,
   maytansine, a maytansinoid, an auristatin, an anthracycline, a calicheamicin, irinotecan,
   SN-38, a duocarmycin, a pyrrolobenzodiazepine, a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer, an
15 indolinobenzodiazepine, or an indolinobenzodiazepine dimer, or a variant thereof.
            In some embodiments of any of the above aspects, the CD117 is GNNK+
   CD117.
            In another aspect, the invention provides a method of depleting a population of
   CD117+ cells in a human patient by administering an effective amount of a ligand or
20 fragment thereof capable of binding CD117.
            In another aspect, the invention provides a method of depleting a population of
   CD117+ cells in a human patient in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant by
   administering, prior to the patient receiving a transplant including hematopoietic stem
   cells, an effective amount of a ligand or fragment thereof capable of binding CD117.
25          In another aspect, the invention features a method, for example, of treating a
   human patient in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, including administering to
   a human patient a transplant including hematopoietic stem cells, wherein the patient has
   been previously administered a ligand or fragment thereof capable of binding CD117 in
   an amount sufficient to deplete a population of CD117+ cells in the patient.
30          In an additional aspect, the invention features a method, for example, of treating
   a human patient in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, including: administering
   to a human patient a ligand or fragment thereof capable of binding CD117 in an amount
                                                  3

   sufficient to deplete a population of CD117+ cells in the patient, and subsequently
   administering to the patient a transplant including hematopoietic stem cells.
             In some embodiments of any of the preceding four aspects, the ligand or
   fragment thereof that binds CD117 (e.g., GNNK+ CD117) is covalently bound to an Fc
 5 domain, such as a dimeric Fc domain isolated from a human antibody (for example,
   isolated from an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 isotype human antibody). In some
   embodiments, the Fc domain is a monomeric Fc domain containing a single polypeptide
   strand. In some embodiments, the N-terminus of the ligand or fragment thereof is bound
   to the Fc domain. In some embodiments, the C-terminus of the ligand or fragment
10 thereof is bound to the Fc domain. The Fc domain may be conjugated to one or more
   copies of the ligand or fragment thereof. For instance, conjugates that may be used with
   the methods described herein include dimeric Fc domains in which each polypeptide
   strand of the Fc domain is conjugated to the ligand or fragment thereof. The Fc domain
   may in turn be conjugated to a cytotoxin, such as a cytotoxin described herein (for
15 example, pseudomonas exotoxin A, deBouganin, diphtheria toxin, an amatoxin, such as
   a-amanitin, saporin, maytansine, a maytansinoid, an auristatin, an anthracycline, a
   calicheamicin, irinotecan, SN-38, a duocarmycin, a pyrrolobenzodiazepine, a
   pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer, an indolinobenzodiazepine, and an indolinobenzodiazepine
   dimer, or a variant thereof).
20           In some embodiments of the preceding four aspects, the ligand or fragment
   thereof is covalently bound to a cytotoxin, such as a cytotoxin described herein (for
   example, pseudomonas exotoxin A, deBouganin, diphtheria toxin, an amatoxin, such as
   a-amanitin, saporin, maytansine, a maytansinoid, an auristatin, an anthracycline, a
   calicheamicin, irinotecan, SN-38, a duocarmycin, a pyrrolobenzodiazepine, a
25 pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer, an indolinobenzodiazepine, and an indolinobenzodiazepine
   dimer, or a variant thereof). In some embodiments, the N-terminus of the ligand or
   fragment thereof is bound to the cytotoxin. In some embodiments, the C-terminus of the
   ligand or fragment thereof is bound to the cytotoxin. The cytotoxin may in turn be
   conjugated to an Fc domain.
30           In some embodiments, the ligand or fragment thereof is covalently bound to the
   cytotoxin at one site on the ligand or fragment thereof (for example, the N- or C-terminus
   of the ligand or fragment thereof) and is covalently bound to an Fc domain at another site
                                                 4

   on the ligand or fragment thereof (for example, the opposite terminus of the ligand or
   fragment thereof).
            In some embodiments, the Fc domain is a human IgG1 isotype Fc domain. In
   some embodiments, the Fc domain is a human IgG2 isotype Fc domain. In some
 5 embodiments, the Fc domain is a human IgG3 isotype Fc domain. In some
   embodiments, the Fc domain is a human IgG4 isotype Fc domain.
            In some embodiments of any of the above aspects, the cytotoxin is an amatoxin
   or derivative thereof, such as a-amanitin,   p-amanitin, y-amanitin, E-amanitin, amanin,
   amaninamide, amanullin, amanullinic acid, and proamanullin. In some embodiments of
10 any of the above aspects, the cytotoxin is an amatoxin, and the antibody, antigen-binding
   fragment thereof, or ligand conjugated to the cytotoxin is represented by the formula Ab
   Am, wherein Ab is the antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or ligand, and Am is
   the amatoxin. In some embodiments, Am is represented by formula (1)

            In another aspect, the invention features a method of depleting a population of
10 CD117+ cells in a human patient by administering an effective amount of an antibody or
   antigen-binding fragment thereof capable of binding GNNK+ CD117.
            In an additional, the invention features a method of depleting a population of
   CD117+ cells in a human patient in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant by
   administering, prior to the patient receiving a transplant containing hematopoietic stem
15 cells, an effective amount of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof capable of
   binding GNNK+ CD117.
            In another aspect, the invention features a method, for example, of treating a
   human patient in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, including administering to
   a human patient a transplant containing hematopoietic stem cells, wherein the patient
20 has been previously administered an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof
   capable of binding GNNK+ CD117 in an amount sufficient to deplete a population of
   CD117+ cells in the patient.
            In an additional aspect, the invention features a method, for example, of treating
   a human patient in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, including: administering
25 to a human patient an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof capable of binding
   GNNK+ CD117 in an amount sufficient to deplete a population of CD117+ cells in the
   patient, and subsequently administering to the patient a transplant including
   hematopoietic stem cells.
            In some embodiments of any of the above aspects, the antibody or antigen
30 binding fragment thereof is selected from the group consisting of a monoclonal antibody
   or antigen-binding fragment thereof, a polyclonal antibody or antigen-binding fragment
   thereof, a humanized antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, a bispecific antibody
   or antigen-binding fragment thereof, a dual-variable immunoglobulin domain, a single
                                                  12

   some embodiments, the antibody has an isotype selected from the group consisting of
   IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE.
 5           In some embodiments of any of the above aspects, the antibody, antigen-binding
   fragment thereof, or ligand is internalized by a hematopoietic cell, such as a
   hematopoietic stem cell, cancer cell, or autoimmune cell following administration to the
   patient. For instance, the antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or ligand may be
   internalized by hematopoietic stem cells, cancer cells, or autoimmune cells by receptor
10 mediated endocytosis (e.g., upon binding to cell-surface CD117, such as GNNK+
   CD117). In some embodiments, a cytotoxin covalently bound to the antibody or antigen
   binding fragment thereof may be released intracellularly by chemical cleavage (for
   instance, by enzymatic or non-specific cleavage of a linker described herein). The
   cytotoxin may then access its intracellular target (such as the mitotic spindle apparatus,
15 nuclear DNA, ribosomal RNA, or topoisomerases, among others) so as to promote the
   death of an endogenous hematopoietic cell, such as an endogenous hematopoietic stem
   cell prior to transplantation therapy, an endogenous cancer cell, or an endogenous
   autoimmune cell, among others.
             In some embodiments of any of the above aspects, the antibody, antigen-binding
20 fragment thereof, or ligand is capable of promoting necrosis of a hematopoietic cell, such
   as a hematopoietic stem cell, cancer cell, or autoimmune cell, among others. In some
   embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may promote the death of
   an endogenous hematopoietic stem cell prior to transplantation therapy, an endogenous
   cancer cell, or an endogenous autoimmune cell, among others, by recruiting one or more
25 complement proteins, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and/or
   eosinophils to the cell, such as a hematopoietic stem cell upon administration to the
   patient.
             In some embodiments of any of the above aspects, the transplant containing
   hematopoietic stem cells is administered to the patient after the concentration of the
30 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof has substantially cleared from the blood of
   the patient.
             In some embodiments of any of the above aspects, the hematopoietic stem cells
   or progeny thereof maintain hematopoietic stem cell functional potential after two or more
                                                 13

   days (for example, from about 2 to about 5 days, from about 2 to about 7 days, from
   about 2 to about 20 days, from about 2 to about 30 days, such as 2 days, 3 days, 4 days,
   5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 8 days, 9 days, 10 days, 11 days, 12 days, 13 days, 14 days, 15
   days, 16 days, 17 days, 18 days, 19 days, 20 days, 21 days, 22 days, 23 days, 24 days,
 5 25 days, 26 days, 27 days, 28 days, 29 days, 30 days, or more) following transplantation
   of the hematopoietic stem cells into the patient.
             In some embodiments of any of the above aspects, the hematopoietic stem cells
   or progeny thereof are capable of localizing to hematopoietic tissue, such as the bone
   marrow, and/or reestablishing hematopoiesis following transplantation of the
10 hematopoietic stem cells into the patient.
             In some embodiments of any of the above aspects, upon transplantation into the
   patient, the hematopoietic stem cells give rise to recovery of a population of cells
   selected from the group consisting of megakaryocytes, thrombocytes, platelets,
   erythrocytes, mast cells, myeoblasts, basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils, microglia,
15 granulocytes, monocytes, osteoclasts, antigen-presenting cells, macrophages, dendritic
   cells, natural killer cells, T-lymphocytes, and B-lymphocytes.
             In some embodiments of any of the above aspects, the method is used to treat
   one or more disorders, such as by depleting a population of hematopoietic stem cells in a
   patient prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy so as to provide a niche to
20 which the transplanted hematopoietic stem cells may home. Following transplantation,
   the hematopoietic stem cells may establish productive hematopoiesis, so as to replenish
   a deficient cell type in the patient or a cell type that is being actively killed or has been
   killed, for instance, by chemotherapeutic methods. For instance, the patient may be one
   that is suffering from a stem cell disorder. In some embodiments, the patient is suffering

   characterized by CD117+ cells), by administration of an antibody, antigen-binding
15 fragment thereof, or ligand that depletes a population of CD117+ cancer cells in the
   patient and/or by administration of an antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or
   ligand so as to deplete a population of endogenous hematopoietic stem cells prior to
   hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the latter case, the transplantation may in turn
   re-constitute, for example, a population of cells depleted during the process of eradicating
20 cancer cells. The cancer may be a hematological cancer, such as acute myeloid
   leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymohoid
   leukemia, multiple meloma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
            In some embodiments of any of the above aspects, the method is used to treat

   and/or by administration of an antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or ligand so as
   to deplete a population of endogenous hematopoietic stem cells prior to hematopoietic
   stem cell transplantation. In the latter case, the transplantation may in turn re-constitute,

                                         Detailed Description
             The invention provides methods of treating a variety of disorders, such as
   diseases of a cell type in the hematopoietic lineage, cancers, autoimmune diseases,
25 metabolic disorders, and stem cell disorders, among others. The compositions and
   methods described herein may (i) directly deplete a population of cells that give rise to a
   pathology, such as a population of cancer cells (e.g., leukemia cells) and autoimmune
   cells (e.g., autoreactive T-cells), and/or (ii) deplete a population of endogenous
   hematopoietic stem cells so as to promote the engraftment of transplanted hematopoietic
30 stem cells by providing a niche to which the transplanted cells may home. The foregoing
   activities can be achieved by administration of an antibody, antigen-binding fragment
   thereof, or ligand capable of binding an antigen expressed by an endogenous disease
   causing cell or a hematopoietic stem cell. In the case of direct treatment of a disease,
                                                    26

   this administration can cause a reduction in the quantity of the cells that give rise to the
   pathology of interest. In the case of preparing a patient for hematopoietic stem cell
   transplant therapy, this administration can cause the selective depletion of a population of
   endogenous hematopoietic stem cells, thereby creating a vacancy in the hematopoietic
 5 tissue, such as the bone marrow, that can subsequently be filled by transplanted,
   exogenous hematopoietic stem cells. The invention is based in part on the discovery that
   antibodies, antigen-binding fragments thereof, and ligands capable of binding CD117
   (such as GNNK+ D117) can be administered to a patient to effect both of the above
   activities. Antibodies, antigen-binding fragments thereof, and ligands that bind CD117
10 can be administered to a patient suffering from a cancer or autoimmune disease to
   directly deplete a population of cancerous cells or autoimmune cells, and can also be
   administered to a patient in need of hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy in order to
   promote the survival and engraftment potential of transplanted hematopoietic stem cells.
             Engraftment of hematopoietic stem cell transplants due to the administration of
15 anti-CD117 antibodies, antigen-binding fragments thereof, or ligands can manifest in a
   variety of empirical measurements. For instance, engraftment of transplanted
   hematopoietic stem cells can be evaluated by assessing the quantity of competitive
   repopulating units (CRU) present within the bone marrow of a patient following
   administration of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof capable of binding
20 CD117 and subsequent administration of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
   Additionally, one can observe engraftment of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant by
   incorporating a reporter gene, such as an enzyme that catalyzes a chemical reaction
   yielding a fluorescent, chromophoric, or luminescent product, into a vector with which the
   donor hematopoietic stem cells have been transfected and subsequently monitoring the
25 corresponding signal in a tissue into which the hematopoietic stem cells have homed,
   such as the bone marrow. One can also observe hematopoietic stem cell engraftment by
   evaluation of the quantity and survival of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, for
   instance, as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis methods
   known in the art. Engraftment can also be determined by measuring white blood cell
30 counts in peripheral blood during a post-transplant period, and/or by measuring recovery
   of marrow cells by donor cells in a bone marrow aspirate sample.
             The sections that follow provide a description of antibodies, antigen-binding
   fragments thereof, and ligands that can be administered to a patient, such as a patient
                                                 27

   suffering from a cancer or autoimmune disease, or a patient in need of hematopoietic
   stem cell transplant therapy in order to promote engraftment of hematopoietic stem cell
   grafts, as well as methods of administering such therapeutics to a patient (e.g., prior to
   hematopoietic stem cell transplantation).

            As described herein, amatoxins may be conjugated to an antibody, antigen
10 binding fragment thereof, or ligand, for instance, by way of a linker moiety. Exemplary
   methods of amatoxin conjugation and linkers useful for such processes are described in
   the section entitled "Linkers for chemical conjugation," as well as in Table 1, below.
   Exemplary linker-containing amatoxins useful for conjugation to an antibody, antigen
   binding fragment, or ligand in accordance with the compositions and methods described
15 herein are shown in structural formulas (1), (IA), (IB), and (11), recited herein.
            As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to an immunoglobulin molecule that
   specifically binds to, or is immunologically reactive with, a particular antigen, and includes
   polyclonal, monoclonal, genetically engineered, and otherwise modified forms of
   antibodies, including but not limited to chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies,
20 heteroconjugate antibodies (e.g., bi- tri- and quad-specific antibodies, diabodies,
   triabodies, and tetrabodies), and antigen binding fragments of antibodies, including, for
   example, Fab', F(ab')2, Fab, Fv, rlgG, and scFv fragments. Unless otherwise indicated,
   the term "monoclonal antibody" (mAb) is meant to include both intact molecules, as well
   as antibody fragments (including, for example, Fab and F(ab')2 fragments) that are
25 capable of specifically binding to a target protein. As used herein, the Fab and F(ab')2
   fragments refer to antibody fragments that lack the Fc fragment of an intact antibody.
   Examples of these antibody fragments are described herein.
            The term "antigen-binding fragment," as used herein, refers to one or more
   fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to a target antigen. The
30 antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length
   antibody. The antibody fragments can be, for example, a Fab, F(ab')2, scFv, diabody, a
   triabody, an affibody, a nanobody, an aptamer, or a domain antibody. Examples of
   binding fragments encompassed of the term "antigen-binding fragment" of an antibody
                                                   31

   include, but are not limited to: (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the
   VL, VH, CL,   and  CH1  domains; (ii) a F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment containing two
   Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment
   consisting of the    VH and  CH1  domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and     VH
 5 domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb including        VH  and VL domains; (vi) a dAb
   fragment that consists of a     VH domain (see, e.g., Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546, 1989);
   (vii) a dAb which consists of a     VH or a VL domain; (viii) an isolated complementarity
   determining region (CDR); and (ix) a combination of two or more (e.g., two, three, four,
   five, or six) isolated CDRs which may optionally be joined by a synthetic linker.
10 Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and            VH, are coded for by
   separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a linker that enables
   them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and          VH regions pair to form
   monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see, for example, Bird et al.,
   Science 242:423-426, 1988 and Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883,
15 1988). These antibody fragments can be obtained using conventional techniques known
   to those of skill in the art, and the fragments can be screened for utility in the same
   manner as intact antibodies. Antigen-binding fragments can be produced by recombinant
   DNA techniques, enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact immunoglobulins, or, in certain
   cases, by chemical peptide synthesis procedures known in the art.
20            As used herein, the term "anti-CD1 17 antibody" refers to a protein or peptide
   containing molecule that includes at least a portion of an immunoglobulin molecule, such
   as but not limited to at least one complementarity determining region (CDR) of a heavy or
   light chain or a ligand binding portion thereof, a heavy chain or light chain variable region,
   a heavy chain or light chain constant region, a framework region, or any portion thereof,
25 that is capable of specifically binding to CD117 (for example, GNNK+ CD117). Anti
   CD117 antibodies also include antibody-like protein scaffolds, such as the tenth
   fibronectin type III domain (10Fn3), which contains BC, DE, and FG structural loops
   similar in structure and solvent accessibility to antibody CDRs. The tertiary structure of
         10
   the     Fn3 domain resembles that of the variable region of the IgG heavy chain, and one
30 of skill in the art can graft, for example, the CDRs of an anti-CD1 17 monoclonal antibody
                                                                                               10
   onto the fibronectin scaffold by replacing residues of the BC, DE, and FG loops of             Fn3
   with residues from the CDRH-1, CDRH-2, or CDRH-3 regions of an anti-CD1 17
   monoclonal antibody.
                                                     32

             As used herein, the term "bispecific antibody" refers to, for example, a
   monoclonal, often a human or humanized antibody that is capable of binding at least two
   different antigens. For instance, one of the binding specificities can be directed towards
   a hematopoietic stem cell surface antigen, CD117 (e.g., GNNK+ CD117), and the other
 5 can specifically bind a different hematopoietic stem cell surface antigen or another cell
   surface protein, such as a receptor or receptor subunit involved in a signal transduction
   pathway that potentiates cell growth, among others.
             As used herein, the term "complementarity determining region" (CDR) refers to a
   hypervariable region found both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains
10 of an antibody. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are referred to
   as framework regions (FRs). The amino acid positions that delineate a hypervariable
   region of an antibody can vary, depending on the context and the various definitions
   known in the art. Some positions within a variable domain may be viewed as hybrid
   hypervariable positions in that these positions can be deemed to be within a
15 hypervariable region under one set of criteria while being deemed to be outside a
   hypervariable region under a different set of criteria. One or more of these positions can
   also be found in extended hypervariable regions. The antibodies described herein may
   contain modifications in these hybrid hypervariable positions. The variable domains of
   native heavy and light chains each contain four framework regions that primarily adopt a
20 p-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops that connect, and in
   some cases form part of, the p-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held
   together in close proximity by the framework regions in the order FR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2
   FR3-CDR3-FR4 and, with the CDRs from the other antibody chains, contribute to the
   formation of the target binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins
25 of Immunological Interest, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD., 1987). As used
   herein, numbering of immunoglobulin amino acid residues is performed according to the
   immunoglobulin amino acid residue numbering system of Kabat et al., unless otherwise
   indicated.
             As used herein, the terms "condition" and "conditioning" refer to processes by
30 which a patient is prepared for receipt of a transplant containing hematopoietic stem
   cells. Such procedures promote the engraftment of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant
   (for instance, as inferred from a sustained increase in the quantity of viable hematopoietic
   stem cells within a blood sample isolated from a patient following a conditioning
                                                 33

   procedure and subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. According to the
   methods described herein, a patient may be conditioned for hematopoietic stem cell
   transplant therapy by administration to the patient of an antibody or antigen-binding
   fragment thereof capable of binding an antigen expressed by hematopoietic stem cells,
 5 such as CD117 (e.g., GNNK+ CD117). As described herein, the antibody may be
   covalently conjugated to a cytotoxin so as to form a drug-antibody conjugate.
   Administration of an antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or drug-antibody
   conjugate capable of binding one or more of the foregoing antigens to a patient in need of
   hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy can promote the engraftment of a
10 hematopoietic stem cell graft, for example, by selectively depleting endogenous
   hematopoietic stem cells, thereby creating a vacancy filled by an exogenous
   hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
            As used herein, the term "conjugate" refers to a compound formed by the chemical
   bonding of a reactive functional group of one molecule, such as an antibody or antigen
15 binding fragment thereof, with an appropriately reactive functional group of another molecule,
   such as a cytotoxin described herein. Conjugates may include a linker between the two
   molecules bound to one another. Examples of linkers that can be used for the formation of a
   conjugate include peptide-containing linkers, such as those that contain naturally occurring or
   non-naturally occurring amino acids, such as D-amino acids. Linkers can be prepared using a
20 variety of strategies described herein and known in the art. Depending on the reactive
   components therein, a linker may be cleaved, for example, by enzymatic hydrolysis,
   photolysis, hydrolysis under acidic conditions, hydrolysis under basic conditions, oxidation,
   disulfide reduction, nucleophilic cleavage, or organometallic cleavage (see, for example,
   Leriche et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem., 20:571-582, 2012).
25          As used herein, the term "coupling reaction" refers to a chemical reaction in which
   two or more substituents suitable for reaction with one another react so as to form a chemical
   moiety that joins (e.g., covalently) the molecular fragments bound to each substituent.
   Coupling reactions include those in which a reactive substituent bound to a fragment that is a
   cytotoxin, such as a cytotoxin known in the art or described herein, reacts with a suitably
30 reactive substituent bound to a fragment that is an antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof,
   or ligand, such as an antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or ligand specific for CD1 17
   (such as GNNK+ CD1 17) known in the art or described herein. Examples of suitably reactive
   substituents include a nucleophile/electrophile pair (e.g., a thiol/haloalkyl pair, an
                                                 34

   amine/carbonyl pair, or a thiol/a, p-unsaturated carbonyl pair, among others), a
   diene/dienophile pair (e.g., an azide/alkyne pair, among others), and the like. Coupling
   reactions include, without limitation, thiol alkylation, hydroxyl alkylation, amine alkylation,
   amine condensation, amidation, esterification, disulfide formation, cycloaddition (e.g., [4+2]
 5 Diels-Alder cycloaddition, [3+2] Huisgen cycloaddition, among others), nucleophilic aromatic
   substitution, electrophilic aromatic substitution, and other reactive modalities known in the art
   or described herein.
            As used herein, "CRU (competitive repopulating unit)" refers to a unit of measure
   of long-term engrafting stem cells, which can be detected after in-vivo transplantation.
10          As used herein, the term "donor" refers to a human or animal from which one or
   more cells are isolated prior to administration of the cells, or progeny thereof, into a
   recipient. The one or more cells may be, for example, a population of hematopoietic
   stem cells.
            As used herein, the term "diabody" refers to a bivalent antibody containing two
15 polypeptide chains, in which each polypeptide chain includes       VH and VL domains joined by a
   linker that is too short (e.g., a linker composed of five amino acids) to allow for intramolecular
   association of VH and VL domains on the same peptide chain. This configuration forces each
   domain to pair with a complementary domain on another polypeptide chain so as to form a
   homodimeric structure. Accordingly, the term "triabody" refers to trivalent antibodies
20 containing three peptide chains, each of which contains one       VH domain and one VL domain
   joined by a linker that is exceedingly short (e.g., a linker composed of 1-2 amino acids) to
   permit intramolecular association of VH and VL domains within the same peptide chain. In
   order to fold into their native structures, peptides configured in this way typically trimerize so
   as to position the VH and VL domains of neighboring peptide chains spatially proximal to one
25 another (see, for example, Holliger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-48, 1993).
            As used herein, a "dual variable domain immunoglobulin" ("DVD-Ig") refers to an
   antibody that combines the target-binding variable domains of two monoclonal antibodies
   via linkers to create a tetravalent, dual-targeting single agent (see, for example, Gu et al.,
   Meth. Enzymol., 502:25-41, 2012).
30          As used herein, the term "endogenous" describes a substance, such as a
   molecule, cell, tissue, or organ (e.g., a hematopoietic stem cell or a cell of hematopoietic
   lineage, such as a megakaryocyte, thrombocyte, platelet, erythrocyte, mast cell,
   myeoblast, basophil, neutrophil, eosinophil, microglial cell, granulocyte, monocyte,
                                                   35

   osteoclast, antigen-presenting cell, macrophage, dendritic cell, natural killer cell, T
   lymphocyte, or B-lymphocyte) that is found naturally in a particular organism, such as a
   human patient.
              As used herein, the term "engraftment potential" is used to refer to the ability of
 5 hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to repopulate a tissue, whether such cells are
   naturally circulating or are provided by transplantation. The term encompasses all events
   surrounding or leading up to engraftment, such as tissue homing of cells and colonization
   of cells within the tissue of interest. The engraftment efficiency or rate of engraftment can
   be evaluated or quantified using any clinically acceptable parameter as known to those of
10 skill in the art and can include, for example, assessment of competitive repopulating units
   (CRU); incorporation or expression of a marker in tissue(s) into which stem cells have
   homed, colonized, or become engrafted; or by evaluation of the progress of a subject
   through disease progression, survival of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, or
   survival of a recipient. Engraftment can also be determined by measuring white blood
15 cell counts in peripheral blood during a post-transplant period. Engraftment can also be
   assessed by measuring recovery of marrow cells by donor cells in a bone marrow
   aspirate sample.
              As used herein, the term "exogenous" describes a substance, such as a
   molecule, cell, tissue, or organ (e.g., a hematopoietic stem cell or a cell of hematopoietic
20 lineage, such as a megakaryocyte, thrombocyte, platelet, erythrocyte, mast cell,
   myeoblast, basophil, neutrophil, eosinophil, microglial cell, granulocyte, monocyte,
   osteoclast, antigen-presenting cell, macrophage, dendritic cell, natural killer cell, T
   lymphocyte, or B-lymphocyte) that is not found naturally in a particular organism, such as
   a human patient. Exogenous substances include those that are provided from an
25 external source to an organism or to cultured matter extracted therefrom.
              As used herein, the term "framework region" or "FW region" includes amino acid
   residues that are adjacent to the CDRs of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment
   thereof. FW region residues may be present in, for example, human antibodies,
   humanized antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, Fab fragments, single
30 chain antibody fragments, scFv fragments, antibody domains, and bispecific antibodies,
   among others.
              As used herein, the term "hematopoietic stem cells" ("HSCs") refers to immature
   blood cells having the capacity to self-renew and to differentiate into mature blood cells
                                                  36

   containing diverse lineages including but not limited to granulocytes (e.g., promyelocytes,
   neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils), erythrocytes (e.g., reticulocytes, erythrocytes),
   thrombocytes (e.g., megakaryoblasts, platelet producing megakaryocytes, platelets),
   monocytes (e.g., monocytes, macrophages), dendritic cells, microglia, osteoclasts, and
 5 lymphocytes (e.g., NK cells, B-cells and T-cells). Such cells may include CD34* cells.
   CD34* cells are immature cells that express the CD34 cell surface marker. In humans,
   CD34+ cells are believed to include a subpopulation of cells with the stem cell properties
   defined above, whereas in mice, HSCs are CD34-. In addition, HSCs also refer to long
   term repopulating HSCs (LT-HSC) and short term repopulating HSCs (ST-HSC). LT
10 HSCs and ST-HSCs are differentiated, based on functional potential and on cell surface
   marker expression. For example, human HSCs are CD34+, CD38-, CD45RA-, CD90+,
   CD49F+, and lin- (negative for mature lineage markers including CD2, CD3, CD4, CD7,
   CD8, CD10, CD11B, CD19, CD20, CD56, CD235A). In mice, bone marrow LT-HSCs are
   CD34-, SCA-1+, C-kit+, CD135-, Slamfl/CD150+, CD48-, and lin- (negative for mature
15 lineage markers including Ter 19, CD11 b, Gr1, CD3, CD4, CD8, B220, IL7ra), whereas
   ST-HSCs are CD34+, SCA-1+, C-kit+, CD135-, Slamfl/CD150+, and lin- (negative for
   mature lineage markers including Ter119, CD11b, Gr1, CD3, CD4, CD8, B220, IL7ra). In
   addition, ST-HSCs are less quiescent and more proliferative than LT-HSCs under
   homeostatic conditions. However, LT-HSC have greater self renewal potential (i.e., they
20 survive throughout adulthood, and can be serially transplanted through successive
   recipients), whereas ST-HSCs have limited self renewal (i.e., they survive for only a
   limited period of time, and do not possess serial transplantation potential). Any of these
   HSCs can be used in the methods described herein. ST-HSCs are particularly useful
   because they are highly proliferative and thus, can more quickly give rise to differentiated
25 progeny.
            As used herein, the term "hematopoietic stem cell functional potential" refers to
   the functional properties of hematopoietic stem cells which include 1) multi-potency
   (which refers to the ability to differentiate into multiple different blood lineages including,
   but not limited to, granulocytes (e.g., promyelocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils),
30 erythrocytes (e.g., reticulocytes, erythrocytes), thrombocytes (e.g., megakaryoblasts,
   platelet producing megakaryocytes, platelets), monocytes (e.g., monocytes,
   macrophages), dendritic cells, microglia, osteoclasts, and lymphocytes (e.g., NK cells, B
   cells and T-cells), 2) self-renewal (which refers to the ability of hematopoietic stem cells
                                                    37

   to give rise to daughter cells that have equivalent potential as the mother cell, and further
   that this ability can repeatedly occur throughout the lifetime of an individual without
   exhaustion), and 3) the ability of hematopoietic stem cells or progeny thereof to be
   reintroduced into a transplant recipient whereupon they home to the hematopoietic stem
 5 cell niche and re-establish productive and sustained hematopoiesis.
             As used herein, the term "human antibody" refers to an antibody in which
   substantially every part of the protein (for example, all CDRs, framework regions,    CL, CH
                            2    3
   domains (e.g.,    CH1, CH , CH ), hinge, and VL and VH   domains) is substantially non
   immunogenic in humans, with only minor sequence changes or variations. A human
10 antibody can be produced in a human cell (for example, by recombinant expression) or
   by a non-human animal or a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell that is capable of expressing
   functionally rearranged human immunoglobulin (such as heavy chain and/or light chain)
   genes. When a human antibody is a single chain antibody, it can include a linker peptide
   that is not found in native human antibodies. For example, an Fv can contain a linker
15 peptide, such as two to about eight glycine or other amino acid residues, which connects
   the variable region of the heavy chain and the variable region of the light chain. Such
   linker peptides are considered to be of human origin. Human antibodies can be made by
   a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods using antibody
   libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. Human antibodies can also be
20 produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing functional endogenous
   immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes (see, for
   example, PCT Publication Nos. WO 1998/24893; WO 1992/01047; WO 1996/34096;
   WO 1996/33735; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,413,923; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,569,825;
   5,661,016; 5,545,806; 5,814,318; 5,885,793; 5,916,771; and 5,939,598).
25           As used herein, the term "humanized" antibody refers to a non-human antibody
   that contains minimal sequences derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In general, a
   humanized antibody contains substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable
   domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non
   human immunoglobulin. All or substantially all of the FW regions may also be those of a
30 human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody can also contain at least a
   portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human
   immunoglobulin consensus sequence. Methods of antibody humanization are known in
                                                  38

   the art and have been described, for example, in Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-7,
   1988; U.S. Patent Nos: 5,530,101; 5,585,089; 5,693,761; 5,693,762; and 6,180,370.
             As used herein, patients that are "in need of" a hematopoietic stem cell transplant
   include patients that exhibit a defect or deficiency in one or more blood cell types, as well
 5 as patients having a stem cell disorder, autoimmune disease, cancer, or other pathology
   described herein. Hematopoietic stem cells generally exhibit 1) multi-potency, and can
   thus differentiate into multiple different blood lineages including, but not limited to,
   granulocytes (e.g., promyelocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils), erythrocytes
   (e.g., reticulocytes, erythrocytes), thrombocytes (e.g., megakaryoblasts, platelet
10 producing megakaryocytes, platelets), monocytes (e.g., monocytes, macrophages),
   dendritic cells, microglia, osteoclasts, and lymphocytes (e.g., NK cells, B-cells and T
   cells), 2) self-renewal, and can thus give rise to daughter cells that have equivalent
   potential as the mother cell, and 3) the ability to be reintroduced into a transplant
   recipient whereupon they home to the hematopoietic stem cell niche and re-establish
15 productive and sustained hematopoiesis. Hematopoietic stem cells can thus be
   administered to a patient defective or deficient in one or more cell types of the
   hematopoietic lineage in order to re-constitute the defective or deficient population of
   cells in vivo. For example, the patient may be suffering from cancer, and the deficiency
   may be caused by administration of a chemotherapeutic agent or other medicament that
20 depletes, either selectively or non-specifically, the cancerous cell population. Additionally
   or alternatively, the patient may be suffering from a hemoglobinopathy (e.g., a non
   malignant hemoglobinopathy), such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, Fanconi anemia,
   aplastic anemia, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. The subject may be one that is suffering
   from adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA SCID), HIV/AIDS,
25 metachromatic leukodystrophy, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and Schwachman-Diamond
   syndrome. The subject may have or be affected by an inherited blood disorder (e.g.,
   sickle cell anemia) or an autoimmune disorder. Additionally or alternatively, the subject
   may have or be affected by a malignancy, such as neuroblastoma or a hematologic
   cancer. For instance, the subject may have a leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma. In
30 some embodiments, the subject has acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia,
   chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia, multiple myeloma, diffuse large B
   cell lymphoma, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In some embodiments, the subject has
   myelodysplastic syndrome. In some embodiments, the subject has an autoimmune
                                                   39

   disease, such as scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, Type
   1 diabetes, or another autoimmune pathology described herein. In some embodiments,
   the subject is in need of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy. In some
   embodiments, the subject has or is otherwise affected by a metabolic storage disorder.
 5 The subject may suffer or otherwise be affected by a metabolic disorder selected from
   the group consisting of glycogen storage diseases, mucopolysaccharidoses, Gaucher's
   Disease, Hurlers Disease, sphingolipidoses, metachromatic leukodystrophy, or any other
   diseases or disorders which may benefit from the treatments and therapies disclosed
   herein and including, without limitation, severe combined immunodeficiency, Wiscott
10 Aldrich syndrome, hyper immunoglobulin M (IgM) syndrome, Chediak-Higashi disease,
   hereditary lymphohistiocytosis, osteopetrosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, storage
   diseases, thalassemia major, sickle cell disease, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus
   erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and those diseases, or
   disorders described in "Bone Marrow Transplantation for Non-Malignant Disease," ASH
15 Education Book, 1:319-338 (2000), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
   reference in its entirety as it pertains to pathologies that may be treated by administration
   of hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy. Additionally or alternatively, a patient "in
   need of" a hematopoietic stem cell transplant may one that is or is not suffering from one
   of the foregoing pathologies, but nonetheless exhibits a reduced level (e.g., as compared
20 to that of an otherwise healthy subject) of one or more endogenous cell types within the
   hematopoietic lineage, such as megakaryocytes, thrombocytes, platelets, erythrocytes,
   mast cells, myeoblasts, basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils, microglia, granulocytes,
   monocytes, osteoclasts, antigen-presenting cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural
   killer cells, T-lymphocytes, and B-lymphocytes. One of skill in the art can readily
25 determine whether one's level of one or more of the foregoing cell types, or other blood
   cell type, is reduced with respect to an otherwise healthy subject, for instance, by way of
   flow cytometry and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) methods, among other
   procedures, known in the art.
             As used herein, the term "monoclonal antibody" refers to an antibody that is
30 derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and
   not the method by which it is produced.
             As used herein, the term "recipient" refers to a patient that receives a transplant,
   such as a transplant containing a population of hematopoietic stem cells. The
                                                   40

   transplanted cells administered to a recipient may be, e.g., autologous, syngeneic, or
   allogeneic cells.
            As used herein, the term "sample" refers to a specimen (e.g., blood, blood
   component (e.g., serum or plasma), urine, saliva, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid,
 5 tissue (e.g., placental or dermal), pancreatic fluid, chorionic villus sample, and cells)
   taken from a subject.
            As used herein, the term "scFv" refers to a single chain Fv antibody in which the
   variable domains of the heavy chain and the light chain from an antibody have been
   joined to form one chain. scFv fragments contain a single polypeptide chain that includes
10 the variable region of an antibody light chain (VL) (e.g., CDR-L1, CDR-L2, and/or CDR
   L3) and the variable region of an antibody heavy chain     (VH) (e.g., CDR-H1, CDR-H2,
   and/or CDR-H3) separated by a linker. The linker that joins the VL and     VH  regions of a
   scFv fragment can be a peptide linker composed of proteinogenic amino acids.
   Alternative linkers can be used to so as to increase the resistance of the scFv fragment to
15 proteolytic degradation (for example, linkers containing D-amino acids), in order to
   enhance the solubility of the scFv fragment (for example, hydrophilic linkers such as
   polyethylene glycol-containing linkers or polypeptides containing repeating glycine and
   serine residues), to improve the biophysical stability of the molecule (for example, a linker
   containing cysteine residues that form intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide bonds),
20 or to attenuate the immunogenicity of the scFv fragment (for example, linkers containing
   glycosylation sites). It will also be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the
   variable regions of the scFv molecules described herein can be modified such that they
   vary in amino acid sequence from the antibody molecule from which they were derived.
   For example, nucleotide or amino acid substitutions leading to conservative substitutions
25 or changes at amino acid residues can be made (e.g., in CDR and/or framework
   residues) so as to preserve or enhance the ability of the scFv to bind to the antigen
   recognized by the corresponding antibody.
            As used herein, the terms "subject" and "patient" refer to an organism, such as a
   human, that receives treatment for a particular disease or condition as described herein.
30 For instance, a patient, such as a human patient, may receive treatment prior to
   hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy in order to promote the engraftment of
   exogenous hematopoietic stem cells.
                                                 41

            As used herein, the phrase "substantially cleared from the blood" refers to a point
   in time following administration of a therapeutic agent (such as an anti-CD1 17 antibody,
   antigen-binding fragment thereof, or ligand) to a patient when the concentration of the
   therapeutic agent in a blood sample isolated from the patient is such that the therapeutic
 5 agent is not detectable by conventional means (for instance, such that the therapeutic
   agent is not detectable above the noise threshold of the device or assay used to detect
   the therapeutic agent). A variety of techniques known in the art can be used to detect
   antibodies, antibody fragments, and protein ligands, such as ELISA-based detection
   assays known in the art or described herein. Additional assays that can be used to
10 detect antibodies, antibody fragments, and protein ligands include immunoprecipitation
   techniques and immunoblot assays, among others known in the art.
            As used herein, the phrase "stem cell disorder" broadly refers to any disease,
   disorder, or condition that may be treated or cured by conditioning a subject's target
   tissues, and/or by ablating an endogenous stem cell population in a target tissue (e.g.,
15 ablating an endogenous hematopoietic stem or progenitor cell population from a subject's
   bone marrow tissue) and/or by engrafting or transplanting stem cells in a subject's target
   tissues. For example, Type I diabetes has been shown to be cured by hematopoietic
   stem cell transplant and may benefit from conditioning in accordance with the
   compositions and methods described herein. Additional disorders that can be treated
20 using the compositions and methods described herein include, without limitation, sickle
   cell anemia, thalassemias, Fanconi anemia, aplastic anemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome,
   ADA SCID, HIV/AIDS, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and
   Schwachman-Diamond syndrome. Additional diseases that may be treated using the
   patient conditioning and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplant methods described herein
25 influde inherited blood disorders (e.g., sickle cell anemia) and autoimmune disorders,
   such as scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, and Chrohn's disease.
   Additional diseases that may be treated using the conditioning and/or transplantation
   methods described herein include a malignancy, such as a neuroblastoma or a
   hematologic cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. For instance, the
30 cancer may be acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, chronic myeloid
   leukemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia, multiple myeloma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,
   or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Additional diseases treatable using the conditioning and/or
   transplantation methods described herein include myelodysplastic syndrome. In some
                                                  42

   embodiments, the subject has or is otherwise affected by a metabolic storage disorder.
   For example, the subject may suffer or otherwise be affected by a metabolic disorder
   selected from the group consisting of glycogen storage diseases,
   mucopolysaccharidoses, Gaucher's Disease, Hurlers Disease, sphingolipidoses,
 5 metachromatic leukodystrophy, or any other diseases or disorders which may benefit
   from the treatments and therapies disclosed herein and including, without limitation,
   severe combined immunodeficiency, Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome, hyper immunoglobulin M
   (IgM) syndrome, Chediak-Higashi disease, hereditary lymphohistiocytosis, osteopetrosis,
   osteogenesis imperfecta, storage diseases, thalassemia major, sickle cell disease,
10 systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, juvenile rheumatoid
   arthritis and those diseases, or disorders described in "Bone Marrow Transplantation for
   Non-Malignant Disease," ASH Education Book, 1:319-338 (2000), the disclosure of which
   is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as it pertains to pathologies that may be
   treated by administration of hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy.
15           As used herein, the term "transfection" refers to any of a wide variety of
   techniques commonly used for the introduction of exogenous DNA into a prokaryotic or
   eukaryotic host cell, such as electroporation, lipofection, calcium- phosphate
   precipitation, DEAE- dextran transfection and the like.
             As used herein, the terms "treat" or "treatment" refer to therapeutic treatment, in
20 which the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change
   or disorder or to promote a beneficial phenotype in the patient being treated. Beneficial
   or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, promoting the engraftment of
   exogenous hematopoietic cells in a patient following antibody conditioning therapy as
   described herein and subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy. Additional
25 beneficial results include an increase in the cell count or relative concentration of
   hematopoietic stem cells in a patient in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant
   following conditioning therapy and subsequent administration of an exogenous
   hematopoietic stem cell graft to the patient. Beneficial results of therapy described herein
   may also include an increase in the cell count or relative concentration of one or more
30 cells of hematopoietic lineage, such as a megakaryocyte, thrombocyte, platelet,
   erythrocyte, mast cell, myeoblast, basophil, neutrophil, eosinophil, microglial cell,
   granulocyte, monocyte, osteoclast, antigen-presenting cell, macrophage, dendritic cell,
   natural killer cell, T-lymphocyte, or B-lymphocyte, following conditioning therapy and
                                                  43

   subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy. Additional beneficial results may
   include the reduction in quantity of a disease-causing cell population, such as a
   population of cancer cells (e.g., CD117+ leukemic cells) or autoimmune cells (e.g.,
   CD117+ autoimmune lymphocytes, such as a CD117+ T-cell that expresses a T-cell
 5 receptor that cross-reacts with a self antigen).

   of the invention include plasmids that contain regulatory sequences, such as promoter
   and enhancer regions, which direct gene transcription. Other useful vectors for
   expression of antibodies and antibody fragments contain polynucleotide sequences that
20 enhance the rate of translation of these genes or improve the stability or nuclear export of
   the mRNA that results from gene transcription. These sequence elements may include,
   for example, 5' and 3' untranslated regions and a polyadenylation signal site in order to
   direct efficient transcription of the gene carried on the expression vector. The expression
   vectors described herein may also contain a polynucleotide encoding a marker for
25 selection of cells that contain such a vector. Examples of a suitable marker include

   Anti-CD117 Antibodies and Ligands
25           The present invention is based in part on the discovery that antibodies, antigen
   binding fragments thereof, and ligands capable of binding CD117, such as GNNK+
   CD117, can be used as therapeutic agents to (i) directly treat cancers and autoimmune
   diseases characterized by CD117+ cells and (ii) promote the engraftment of transplanted
   hematopoietic stem cells in a patient in need of transplant therapy. These therapeutic
30 activities can be caused, for instance, by the binding of anti-CD1 17 antibodies, antigen
   binding fragments thereof, and/or ligands to CD117 (e.g., GNNK+ CD117) expressed on
   the surface of a cell, such as a cancer cell, autoimmune cell, or hematopoietic stem cell
   and subsequently inducing cell death. The depletion of endogenous hematopoietic stem
                                                  47

   cells can provide a niche toward which transplanted hematopoietic stem cells can home,
   and subsequently establish productive hematopoiesis. In this way, transplanted
   hematopoietic stem cells may successfully engraft in a patient, such as human patient
   suffering from a stem cell disorder described herein.
 5           Antibodies and antigen-binding fragments capable of binding human CD117
    (also referred to as c-Kit, mRNA NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_000222.2, Protein
   NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_000213.1), including those capable of binding GNNK+
   CD117, can be used in conjunction with the compositions and methods described herein
   in order to condition a patient for hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy.
10 Polymorphisms affecting the coding region or extracellular domain of CD117 in a
   significant percentage of the population are not currently well-known in non-oncology
   indications. There are at least four isoforms of CD117 that have been identified, with the
   potential of additional isoforms expressed in tumor cells. Two of the CD117 isoforms are
   located on the intracellular domain of the protein, and two are present in the external
15 juxtamembrane region. The two extracellular isoforms, GNNK+ and GNNK-, differ in the
   presence (GNNK+) or absence (GNNK-) of a 4 amino acid sequence. These isoforms
   are reported to have the same affinity for the ligand (SCF), but ligand binding to the
   GNNK- isoform was reported to increase internalization and degradation. The GNNK+
   isoform can be used as an immunogen in order to generate antibodies capable of binding
20 CD117, as antibodies generated against this isoform will be inclusive of the GNNK+ and
   GNNK- proteins.
             Anti-CD1 17 antibodies that can be used in conjunction with the patient
   conditioning methods described herein include, for instance, antibodies produced and
   released from ATCC Accession No. 10716 (deposited as BA7.3C.9), such as the SR-1
25 antibody, which is described, for example, in US Patent No. 5,489,516, the disclosure of
   which is incorporated herein by reference as it pertains to anti-CD1 17 antibodies.
             Additional anti-CD1 17 antibodies that can be used in conjunction with the patient
   conditioning methods described herein include those described in US Patent No.
   7,915,391, which describes, e.g., humanized SR-1 antibodies; US Patent No. 5,808,002,
30 which describes, e.g., the anti-CD1 17 A3C6E2 antibody, as well as those described in,
   for example, WO 2015/050959, which describes anti-CD1 17 antibodies that bind
   epitopes containing Pro317, Asn320, Glu329, Val331, Asp332, Lus358, Glue360,
   Glue376, His378, and/or Thr380 of human CD117; and US 2012/0288506 (also
                                                 48

   published as US Patent No. 8,552,157), which describes, e.g., the anti-CD117 antibody
   CK6, having the CDR sequences of:
        a.  a CDR-H1 having the amino acid sequence SYWIG (SEQ ID NO: 1);
        b. a CDR-H2 having the amino acid sequence IIYPGDSDTRYSPSFQG (SEQ ID

        e.  a CDR-L2 having the amino acid sequence DASSLES (SEQ ID NO: 5); and
10      f.  a CDR-L3 having the amino acid sequence CQQFNSYPLT (SEQ ID NO: 6).
            Additional anti-CD1 17 antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof that may
   be used in conjunction with the compositions and methods described herein include
   those described in US 2015/0320880, such as the clones 9P3, NEG024, NEG027,
   NEG085, NEG086, and 20376.
15          The disclosures of each of the foregoing publications are incorporated herein by
   reference as they pertain to anti-CD1 17 antibodies. Antibodies and antigen-binding
   fragments that may be used in conjunction with the compositions and methods described
   herein include the above-described antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, as
   well as humanized variants of those non-human antibodies and antigen-binding
20 fragments described above and antibodies or antigen-binding fragments that bind the
   same epitope as those described above, as assessed, for instance, by way of a
   competitive CD117 binding assay.
   Additional antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof
25          Antibodies and ligands for use in conjunction with the methods described herein
   include variants of those antibodies described above, such as antibody fragments that
   contain or lack an Fc domain, as well as humanized variants of non-human antibodies
                                                               10
   described herein and antibody-like protein scaffolds (e.g.,    Fn3 domains) containing one
   or more, or all, of the CDRs or equivalent regions thereof of an antibody, antibody
30 fragment, or ligand described herein. Exemplary antigen-binding fragments of the
   foregoing antibodies include a dual-variable immunoglobulin domain, a single-chain Fv
   molecule (scFv), a diabody, a triabody, a nanobody, an antibody-like protein scaffold, a
   Fv fragment, a Fab fragment, a F(ab')2 molecule, and a tandem di-scFv, among others.

   Methods of Identifying Antibodies and Ligands
             Methods for high throughput screening of antibody, antibody fragment, and
   ligand libraries for molecules capable of binding CD117 (e.g., GNNK+ CD117) can be
   used to identify and affinity mature antibodies useful for treating cancers, autoimmune
 5 diseases, and conditioning a patient (e.g., a human patient) in need of hematopoietic
   stem cell therapy as described herein. Such methods include in vitro display techniques
   known in the art, such as phage display, bacterial display, yeast display, mammalian cell
   display, ribosome display, mRNA display, and cDNA display, among others. The use of
   phage display to isolate ligands that bind biologically relevant molecules has been
10 reviewed, for example, in Felici et al., Biotechnol. Annual Rev. 1:149-183, 1995; Katz,
   Annual Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 26:27-45, 1997; and Hoogenboom et al.,
   Immunotechnology 4:1-20, 1998, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated
   herein by reference as they pertain to in vitro display techniques. Randomized
   combinatorial peptide libraries have been constructed to select for polypeptides that bind
15 cell surface antigens as described in Kay, Perspect. Drug Discovery Des. 2:251-268,
   1995 and Kay et al., Mol. Divers. 1:139-140, 1996, the disclosures of each of which are
   incorporated herein by reference as they pertain to the discovery of antigen-binding
   molecules. Proteins, such as multimeric proteins, have been successfully phage
   displayed as functional molecules (see, for example, EP 0349578; EP 4527839; and EP
20 0589877, as well as Chiswell and McCafferty, Trends Biotechnol. 10:80-84 1992, the
   disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference as they pertain to the
   use of in vitro display techniques for the discovery of antigen-binding molecules). In
   addition, functional antibody fragments, such as Fab and scFv fragments, have been
   expressed in in vitro display formats (see, for example, McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552
25 554, 1990; Barbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:7978-7982, 1991; and Clackson
   et al., Nature 352:624-628, 1991, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated
   herein by reference as they pertain to in vitro display platforms for the discovery of
   antigen-binding molecules). These techniques, among others, can be used to identify
   and improve the affinity of antibodies that bind CD1 17 (e.g., GNNK+ CD1 17) that can in
30 turn be used to deplete endogenous hematopoietic stem cells in a patient (e.g., a human
   patient) in need of hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy.
             In addition to in vitro display techniques, computational modeling techniques can
   be used to design and identify antibodies, antibody fragments, and ligands in silico that
                                                    50

   bind CD117 (e.g., GNNK+ CD117). For example, using computational modeling
   techniques, one of skill in the art can screen libraries of antibodies, antibody fragments,
   and ligands in silico for molecules capable of binding specific epitopes, such as
   extracellular epitopes of this antigen. The antibodies, antigen-binding fragments thereof,
 5 and ligands identified by these computational techniques can be used in conjunction with
   the therapeutic methods described herein, such as the cancer and autoimmune disease
   treatment methods described herein and the patient conditioning procedures described
   herein.
             Additional techniques can be used to identify antibodies, antigen-binding
10 fragments thereof, and ligands that bind CD117 (e.g., GNNK+ CD117) on the surface of
   a cell (e.g., a cancer cell, autoimmune cell, or hematopoietic stem cell) and that are
   internalized by the cell, for instance, by receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the
   in vitro display techniques described above can be adapted to screen for antibodies,
   antigen-binding fragments thereof, and ligands that bind CD117 (e.g., GNNK+ CD117) on
15 the surface of a cancer cell, autoimmune cell, or hematopoietic stem cell and that are
   subsequently internalized. Phage display represents one such technique that can be
   used in conjunction with this screening paradigm. To identify antibodies, fragments
   thereof, and ligands that bind CD117 (e.g., GNNK+ CD117) and are subsequently
   internalized by cancer cells, autoimmune cells, or hematopoietic stem cells, one of skill in
20 the art can adapt the phage display techniques described, for example, in Williams et al.,
   Leukemia 19:1432-1438, 2005, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
   reference in its entirety. For example, using mutagenesis methods known in the art,
   recombinant phage libraries can be produced that encode antibodies, antibody
                                                                                       10
   fragments, such as scFv fragments, Fab fragments, diabodies, triabodies, and          Fn3
25 domains, among others, or ligands that contain randomized amino acid cassettes (e.g., in
   one or more, or all, of the CDRs or equivalent regions thereof or an antibody or antibody
   fragment). The framework regions, hinge, Fc domain, and other regions of the antibodies
   or antibody fragments may be designed such that they are non-immunogenic in humans,
   for instance, by virtue of having human germline antibody sequences or sequences that
30 exhibit only minor variations relative to human germline antibodies.
             Using phage display techniques described herein or known in the art, phage
   libraries containing randomized antibodies, antibody fragments, or ligands covalently
   bound to the phage particles can be incubated with CD117 (e.g., GNNK+ CD117)
                                                  51

   antigen, for instance, by first incubating the phage library with blocking agents (such as,
   for instance, milk protein, bovine serum albumin, and/or IgG so as to remove phage
   encoding antibodies, fragments thereof, or ligands that exhibit non-specific protein
   binding and phage that encode antibodies or fragments thereof that bind Fc domains,
 5 and then incubating the phage library with a population of hematopoietic stem cells. The
   phage library can be incubated with the target cells, such as cancer cells, autoimmune
   cells, or hematopoietic stem cells for a time sufficient to allow CD117-specific antibodies,
   antigen-binding fragments thereof, or ligands (e.g., GNNK+ CD117-specific antibodies,
   antigen-binding fragments thereof, or ligands) to bind cell-surface CD117 (e.g., sell
10 surface GNNK+ CD117) antigen and to subsequently be internalized by the cancer cells,
   autoimmune cells, or hematopoietic stem cells (e.g., from 30 minutes to 6 hours at 40 C,
   such as 1 hour at 40 C). Phage containing antibodies, fragments thereof, or ligands that

   to, and internalization by, cancer cells, autoimmune cells, or hematopoietic stem cells can
15 subsequently be removed by washing the cells, for instance, with cold (40 C) 0.1 M
   glycine buffer at pH 2.8. Phage bound to antibodies, fragments thereof, or ligands that
   have been internalized by the cancer cells, autoimmune cells, or hematopoietic stem
   cells can be identified, for instance, by lysing the cells and recovering internalized phage
   from the cell culture medium. The phage can then be amplified in bacterial cells, for
20 example, by incubating bacterial cells with recovered phage in 2xYT medium using
   methods known in the art. Phage recovered from this medium can then be
   characterized, for instance, by determining the nucleic acid sequence of the gene(s)
   encoding the antibodies, fragments thereof, or ligands inserted within the phage genome.

        Methods of Treatment
                 As described herein, hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy can be
        administered to a subject in need of treatment so as to populate or re-populate one or
 5      more blood cell types. Hematopoietic stem cells generally exhibit multi-potency, and can
        thus differentiate into multiple different blood lineages including, but not limited to,
        granulocytes (e.g., promyelocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils), erythrocytes
        (e.g., reticulocytes, erythrocytes), thrombocytes (e.g., megakaryoblasts, platelet
        producing megakaryocytes, platelets), monocytes (e.g., monocytes, macrophages),
10      dendritic cells, microglia, osteoclasts, and lymphocytes (e.g., NK cells, B-cells and T
        cells). Hematopoietic stem cells are additionally capable of self-renewal, and can thus
        give rise to daughter cells that have equivalent potential as the mother cell, and also
        feature the capacity to be reintroduced into a transplant recipient whereupon they home
        to the hematopoietic stem cell niche and re-establish productive and sustained
15      hematopoiesis.
                  Hematopoietic stem cells can thus be administered to a patient defective or
        deficient in one or more cell types of the hematopoietic lineage in order to re-constitute
        the defective or deficient population of cells in vivo, thereby treating the pathology
        associated with the defect or depletion in the endogenous blood cell population. The
20      compositions and methods described herein can thus be used to treat a non-malignant
        hemoglobinopathy (e.g., a hemoglobinopathy selected from the group consisting of sickle
        cell anemia, thalassemia, Fanconi anemia, aplastic anemia, and Wiskott-Aldrich
                                                        74

   syndrome). Additionally or alternatively, the compositions and methods described herein
   can be used to treat an immunodeficiency, such as a congenital immunodeficiency.
   Additionally or alternatively, the compositions and methods described herein can be used
   to treat an acquired immunodeficiency (e.g., an acquired immunodeficiency selected from
 5 the group consisting of HIV and AIDS). The compositions and methods described herein
   can be used to treat a metabolic disorder (e.g., a metabolic disorder selected from the
   group consisting of glycogen storage diseases, mucopolysaccharidoses, Gaucher's
   Disease, Hurlers Disease, sphingolipidoses, and metachromatic leukodystrophy).
            Additionally or alternatively, the compositions and methods described herein can
10 be used to treat a malignancy or proliferative disorder, such as a hematologic cancer,
   myeloproliferative disease. In the case of cancer treatment, the compositions and
   methods described herein may be administered to a patient so as to deplete a population
   of endogenous hematopoietic stem cells prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
   therapy, in which case the transplanted cells can home to a niche created by the
15 endogenous cell depletion step and establish productive hematopoiesis. This, in turn,
   can re-constitute a population of cells depleted during cancer cell eradication, such as
   during systemic chemotherapy. Exemplary hematological cancers that can be treated
   using the compositions and methods described heein include, without limitation, acute
   myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphoid
20 leukemia, multiple myeloma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin's
   lymphoma, as well as other cancerous conditions, including neuroblastoma.
            Additional diseases that can be treated with the compositions and methods
   described herein include, without limitation, adenosine deaminase deficiency and severe
   combined immunodeficiency, hyper immunoglobulin M syndrome, Chediak-Higashi
25 disease, hereditary lymphohistiocytosis, osteopetrosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, storage
   diseases, thalassemia major, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple
   sclerosis, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
            The antibodies, antigen-binding fragments thereof, ligands, and conjugates
   described herein may be used to induce solid organ transplant tolerance. For instance,
30 the compositions and methods described herein may be used to deplete or ablate a
   population of cells from a target tissue (e.g., to deplete hematopoietic stem cells from the
   bone marrow stem cell niche). Following such depletion of cells from the target tissues, a
   population of stem or progenitor cells from an organ donor (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells
                                                  75

   from the organ donor) may be administered to the transplant recipient, and following the
   engraftment of such stem or progenitor cells, a temporary or stable mixed chimerism may
   be achieved, thereby enabling long-term transplant organ tolerance without the need for
   further immunosuppressive agents. For example, the compositions and methods
 5 described herein may be used to induce transplant tolerance in a solid organ transplant
   recipient (e.g., a kidney transplant, lung transplant, liver transplant, and heart transplant,
   among others). The compositions and methods described herein are well-suited for use
   in connection the induction of solid organ transplant tolerance, for instance, because a
   low percentage temporary or stable donor engraftment is sufficient to induce long-term
10 tolerance of the transplanted organ.
             In addition, the compositions and methods described herein can be used to treat
   cancers directly, such as cancers characterized by cells that are CD117+. For instance,
   the compositions and methods described herein can be used to treat leukemia,
   particularly in patients that exhibit CD117+ leukemic cells. By depleting CD117+
15 cancerous cells, such as leukemic cells, the compositions and methods described herein
   can be used to treat various cancers directly. Exemplary cancers that may be treated in
   this fashion include hematological cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia, acute
   lymphoid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia, multiple
   myeloma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
20           In addition, the compositions and methods described herein can be used to treat
   autoimmune disorders. For instance, an antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or
   ligand can be administered to a subject, such as a human patient suffering from an
   autoimmune disorder, so as to kill a CD117+ immune cell. The CD117+ immune cell
   may be an autoreactive lymphocyte, such as a T-cell that expresses a T-cell receptor that
25 specifically binds, and mounts an immune response against, a self antigen. By depleting
   self-reactive, CD117+ cells, the compositions and methods described herein can be used
   to treat autoimmune pathologies, such as those described below. Additionally or
   alternatively, the compositions and methods described herein can be used to treat an
   autoimmune disease by depleting a population of endogenous hematopoietic stem cells
30 prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy, in which case the transplanted
   cells can home to a niche created by the endogenous cell depletion step and establish
   productive hematopoiesis. This, in turn, can re-constitute a population of cells depleted
   during autoimmune cell eradication.

   Routes of Administration and Dosing
             Antibodies, antigen-binding fragments thereof, and ligands described herein can
30 be administered to a patient (e.g., a human patient suffering from cancer, an autoimmune
   disease, or in need of hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy) in a variety of dosage
   forms. For instance, antibodies, antigen-binding fragments thereof, and ligands
   described herein can be administered to a patient suffering from cancer, an autoimmune
                                                     77

   disease, or in need of hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy in the form of an
   aqueous solution, such as an aqueous solution containing one or more pharmaceutically
   acceptable excipients. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients for use with the
   compositions and methods described herein include viscosity-modifying agents. The
 5 aqueous solution may be sterilized using techniques known in the art.
           The antibodies, antigen-binding fragments, and ligands described herein may be
   administered by a variety of routes, such as orally, transdermally, subcutaneously,
   intranasally, intravenously, intramuscularly, intraocularly, or parenterally. The most
   suitable route for administration in any given case will depend on the particular antibody,
10 antigen-binding fragment, or ligand administered, the patient, pharmaceutical formulation
   methods, administration methods (e.g., administration time and administration route), the
   patient's age, body weight, sex, severity of the diseases being treated, the patient's diet,
   and the patient's excretion rate.
            The effective dose of an antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or ligand
15 described herein can range, for example from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg of body
   weight per single (e.g., bolus) administration, multiple administrations, or continuous
   administration, or to achieve an optimal serum concentration (e.g., a serum concentration
   of 0.0001-5000 pg/mL) of the antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or ligand. The
   dose may be administered one or more times (e.g., 2-10 times) per day, week, or month
20 to a subject (e.g., a human) suffering from cancer, an autoimmune disease, or
   undergoing conditioning therapy in preparation for receipt of a hematopoietic stem cell
   transplant. In the case of a conditioning procedure prior to hematopoietic stem cell
   transplantation, the antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or ligand can be
   administered to the patient at a time that optimally promotes engraftment of the
25 exogenous hematopoietic stem cells, for instance, from 1 hour to 1 week (e.g., 1 hour, 2

                                                 78

            The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the
   art with a description of how the compositions and methods described herein may be
    used, made, and evaluated, and are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention and
   are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention.

    Example 1. Administration of an anti-CD1 17 antibody to a human patient in
    preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy
             Using the methods disclosed herein, a physician of skill in the art can administer
   to a human patient in need of hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy an antibody or
10 antigen-binding fragment thereof capable of binding an antigen expressed by
   hematopoietic stem cells, such as an antibody or antigen-biding fragment thereof that
   binds CD117 (for example, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds
   GNNK+ CD117). In this fashion, a population of endogenous hematopoietic stem cells
   can be depleted prior to administration of an exogenous hematopoietic stem cell graft so
15 as to promote engraftment of the hematopoietic stem cell graft. The antibody may be
   covalently conjugated to a toxin, such as a cytotoxic molecule described herein or known
   in the art. For instance, an anti-CD1 17 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof
   (such as an anti-GNNK+ CD117 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof) can be
   covalently conjugated to a cytotoxin, such as pseudomonas exotoxin A, deBouganin,
20 diphtheria toxin, an amatoxin, such as a-amanitin, saporin, maytansine, a maytansinoid,
   an auristatin, an anthracycline, a calicheamicin, irinotecan, SN-38, a duocarmycin, a
   pyrrolobenzodiazepine, a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer, an indolinobenzodiazepine, an
   indolinobenzodiazepine dimer, or a variant thereof. This conjugation can be performed
   using covalent bond-forming techniques described herein or known in the art. The
25 antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or drug-antibody conjugate can subsequently
   be administered to the patient, for example, by intravenous administration, prior to
   transplantation of exogenous hematopoietic stem cells (such as autologous, syngeneic,
   or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells) to the patient.
            The anti-CD1 17 (e.g., anti-GNNK+ CD117) antibody, antigen-binding fragment
30 thereof, or drug-antibody conjugate can be administered in an amount sufficient to reduce
   the quantity of endogenous hematopoietic stem cells, for example, by 10%, 20%, 30%,
   40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or more prior to hematopoietic stem cell
   transplant therapy. The reduction in hematopoietic stem cell count can be monitored
                                                79

   using conventional techniques known in the art, such as by FACS analysis of cells
   expressing characteristic hematopoietic stem cell surface antigens in a blood sample
   withdrawn from the patient at varying intervals during conditioning therapy. For instance,
   a physician of skill in the art can withdraw a blood sample from the patient at various time
 5 points during conditioning therapy and determine the extent of endogenous
   hematopoietic stem cell reduction by conducting a FACS analysis to elucidate the relative
   concentrations of hematopoietic stem cells in the sample using antibodies that bind to
   hematopoietic stem cell marker antigens. According to some embodiments, when the
   concentration of hematopoietic stem cells has reached a minimum value in response to
10 conditioning therapy with an anti-CD1 17 (e.g., anti-GNNK+ CD117) antibody, antigen
   binding fragment thereof, or drug-antibody conjugate, the physician may conclude the
   conditioning therapy, and may begin preparing the patient for hematopoietic stem cell
   transplant therapy.
            The anti-CD1 17 (e.g., anti-GNNK+ CD117) antibody, antigen-binding fragment
15 thereof, or drug-antibody conjugate can be administered to the patient in an aqueous
   solution containing one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as a
   viscosity-modifying agent. The aqueous solution may be sterilized using techniques
   described herein or known in the art. The antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or
   drug-antibody conjugate can be administered to the patient at a dosage of, for example,
20 from 0.001 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg prior to administration of a hematopoietic stem cell graft
   to the patient. The antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or drug-antibody
   conjugate can be administered to the patient at a time that optimally promotes
   engraftment of the exogenous hematopoietic stem cells, for instance, from 1 hour to 1
   week (e.g., 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours,
25 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 13 hours, 14 hours, 15 hours, 16 hours, 17 hours, 18
   hours, 19 hours, 20 hours, 21 hours, 22 hours, 23 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 3 days, 4
   days, 5 days, 6 days, or 7 days) or more prior to administration of the exogenous
   hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
             Following the conclusion of conditioning therapy, the patient may then receive
30 an infusion (e.g., an intravenous infusion) of exogenous hematopoietic stem cells, such
   as from the same physician that performed the conditioning therapy or from a different
   physician. The physician may administer the patient an infusion of autologous,
   syngeneic, or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells, for instance, at a dosage of from 1 x
                                                  80

   103 to 1 x 109 hematopoietic stem cells/kg. The physician may monitor the engraftment
   of the hematopoietic stem cell transplant, for example, by withdrawing a blood sample
   from the patient and determining the increase in concentration of hematopoietic stem
   cells or cells of the hematopoietic lineage (such as megakaryocytes, thrombocytes,
 5 platelets, erythrocytes, mast cells, myeoblasts, basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils,
   microglia, granulocytes, monocytes, osteoclasts, antigen-presenting cells, macrophages,
   dendritic cells, natural killer cells, T-lymphocytes, and B-lymphocytes) following
   administration of the transplant. This analysis may be conducted, for example, from 1
   hour to 6 months, or more, following hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy (e.g., 1
10 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 11
   hours, 12 hours, 13 hours, 14 hours, 15 hours, 16 hours, 17 hours, 18 hours, 19 hours,
   20 hours, 21 hours, 22 hours, 23 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days,
   7 days, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 9 weeks, 10
   weeks, 11 weeks, 12 weeks, 13 weeks, 14 weeks, 15 weeks, 16 weeks, 17 weeks, 18
15 weeks, 19 weeks, 20 weeks, 21 weeks, 22 weeks, 23 weeks, 24 weeks, or more). A
   finding that the concentration of hematopoietic stem cells or cells of the hematopoietic
   lineage has increased (e.g., by 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 20%, 30%,
   40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 200%, 500%, or more) following the transplant
   therapy relative to the concentration of the corresponding cell type prior to transplant
20 therapy provides one indication that treatment with the anti-CD1 17 (e.g., anti-GNNK+
   CD117) antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof, or drug-antibody conjugate has
   successfully promoted engraftment of the transplanted hematopoietic stem cell graft.
   Example 2. Generating antibodies capable of binding hematopoietic stem cells by
25 phage display
            An exemplary method for in vitro evolution of anti-CD1 17 (e.g., anti-GNNK+
   CD117) antibodies for use with the compositions and methods described herein is phage
   display. Phage display libraries can be created by making a designed series of mutations
   or variations within a coding sequence for the CDRs of an antibody or the analogous
                                                                             10
30 regions of an antibody-like scaffold (e.g., the BC, CD, and DE loops of     Fn3 domains).
   The template antibody-encoding sequence into which these mutations are introduced
   may be, for example, a naive human germline sequence. These mutations can be
   performed using standard mutagenesis techniques known in the art. Each mutant
                                                   81

   sequence thus encodes an antibody corresponding to the template save for one or more
   amino acid variations. Retroviral and phage display vectors can be engineered using
   standard vector construction techniques known in the art. P3 phage display vectors
   along with compatible protein expression vectors can be used to generate phage display
 5 vectors for antibody diversification.
            The mutated DNA provides sequence diversity, and each transformant phage
   displays one variant of the initial template amino acid sequence encoded by the DNA,
   leading to a phage population (library) displaying a vast number of different but
   structurally related amino acid sequences. Due to the well-defined structure of antibody
10 hypervariable regions, the amino acid variations introduced in a phage display screen are
   expected to alter the binding properties of the binding peptide or domain without
   significantly altering its overall molecular structure.
            In a typical screen, a phage library may be contacted with and allowed to bind
   one of the foregoing antigens or an epitope thereof. To facilitate separation of binders
15 and non-binders, it is convenient to immobilize the target on a solid support. Phage
   bearing a CD1 17-binding moiety can form a complex with the target on the solid support,
   whereas non-binding phage remain in solution and can be washed away with excess
   buffer. Bound phage can then liberated from the target by changing the buffer to an
   extreme pH (pH 2 or pH 10), changing the ionic strength of the buffer, adding
20 denaturants, or other known means.
            The recovered phage can then be amplified through infection of bacterial cells,
   and the screening process can be repeated with the new pool that is now depleted in
   non-binding antibodies and enriched for antibodies that bind CD1 17 (e.g., GNNK+
   CD1 17). The recovery of even a few binding phage is sufficient to amplify the phage for
25 a subsequent iteration of screening. After a few rounds of selection, the gene sequences
   encoding the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof derived from selected
   phage clones in the binding pool are determined by conventional methods, thus revealing
   the peptide sequence that imparts binding affinity of the phage to the target. During the
   panning process, the sequence diversity of the population diminishes with each round of
30 selection until desirable peptide-binding antibodies remain. The sequences may
   converge on a small number of related antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof.
   An increase in the number of phage recovered at each round of selection is an indication
   that convergence of the library has occurred in a screen.
                                                   82

   Example 3. Producing humanized antibodies that bind a hematopoietic stem cell
   antigen
             Non-human antibodies that bind CD117 (e.g., GNNK+ CD117) can be
 5 humanized, for instance, according to the following procedure. Consensus human
   antibody heavy chain and light chain sequences are known in the art (see e.g., the
   "VBASE" human germline sequence database; Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of
   Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
   NIH Publication No. 91 -3242, 1991; Tomlinson et al., J. Mol. Biol. 227:776-798, 1992;
10 and Cox et al.. Eur. J. Immunol. 24:827- 836, 1994, the disclosures of each of which are
   incorporated herein by reference as they pertain to consensus human antibody heavy
   chain and light chain sequences. Using established procedures, one of skill in the art can
   identify the variable domain framework residues and CDRs of a consensus antibody
   sequence (e.g., by sequence alignment). One can substitute one or more CDRs of the
15 heavy chain and/or light chain variable domains of consensus human antibody with one
   or more corresponding CDRs of a non-human antibody that binds CD117 (e.g., GNNK+
   CD117) as described herein in order to produce a humanized antibody. This CDR
   exchange can be performed using gene editing techniques described herein or known in
   the art.

   by reference as it pertains to human antibody consensus sequences. The CDRs in the
   above sequences are shown in bold.
30           To produce humanized antibodies, one can recombinantly express a
   polynucleotide encoding the above consensus sequence in which one or more variable
   region CDRs have been replaced with one or more variable region CDR sequences of a
   non-human antibody that binds CD117 (e.g., GNNK+ CD117). As the affinity of the
                                                83

   antibody for the hematopoietic stem cell antigen is determined primarily by the CDR
   sequences, the resulting humanized antibody is expected to exhibit an affinity for the
   hematopoietic stem cell antigen that is about the same as that of the non-human antibody
   from which the humanized antibody was derived. Methods of determining the affinity of
 5 an antibody for a target antigen include, for instance, ELISA-based techniques described
   herein and known in the art, as well as surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence
   anisotropy, and isothermal titration calorimetry, among others.
   Example 4. Ability of anti-CD117 antibody-drug conjugates to deplete populations
10 of CD117+ cells
             To investigate the ability of anti-CD1 17 antibody-drug conjugates to kill CD117+
   cells, a series of experiments was conducted in which a series of monoclonal antibodies
   that bind CD117 were conjugated to one of a variety of cytotoxic agents and were
   subsequently incubated with distinct CD117+ cell lines. Following a defined incubation
15 period, the viability of the cells was assessed by either (i) determining the proportion of
   cells that cross-react with Annexin V, a phospholipid-binding protein that recognizes
   phosphatidyl serine so as to identify apoptotic cells, (ii) using the CellTiter-GloTM assay
   (Promega, Madison, WI), which produces a luminescent signal due to the adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP)-mediated, luciferase-catalyzed conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin,
20 thereby detecting the relative concentration of ATP produced by viable cells in culture, or
   (iii) using flow cytometry. A monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate of the same isotype but
   that does not bind CD117 was used as a negative control.
             To generate the antibody-drug conjugates used in these experiments,
   monoclonal anti-CD1 17 antibodies or isotype controls were either bound to Fab
25 fragments conjugated to saporin or were directly conjugated to saporin, monomethyl
   auristatin E (MMAE), monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), or a-amanitin.
             The effects of monoclonal antibody-drug conjugates were first assessed on
   CD117+ Kasumi-1 cells. In one experiment, the cells were incubated with an anti-CD1 17
   antibody or isotype control, bound to saporin-conjugated Fab fragments as described
30 above, for three days, following which time the viability of the cells was assessed by
   determining Annexin V reactivity. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 1. To
   assess the cell-killing abilities of other anti-CD117 monoclonal antibody-saporin
   conjugates, a series of monoclonal anti-CD1 17 antibodies, Ab A, Ab B, and Ab C, were
                                                    84

   bound to saporin-conjugated Fab fragments in the same fashion and were similarly
   incubated with Kasumi-1 cells for three days. Following this incubation period, cell
   viability was determined using the CellTiter-GloTM assay. The results of this experiment
   are shown in Fig. 2. To assess the effects of anti-CD1 17 antibodies conjugated to other
 5 cytotoxic agents, the anti-CD1 17 monoclonal antibody or isotype control directly
   conjugated to MMAE, MMAF, or a-amanitin was incubated with Kasumi-1 cells for a four
   day period, followed which time cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-GloTM
   assay. These results are reported in Fig. 3. Surprisingly, anti-CD1 17 antibodies
   conjugated to a-amanitin were found to exhibit a superior ability to kill CD117+ Kasumi-1
10 cells relative to the various other toxins tested, as anti-CD1 17 antibody-a-amanitin
   conjugates depleted Kasumi-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner and with an
   unexpectedly higher potency than the auristatins and saporin cytotoxins.
             To assess the effects of monoclonal antibody-drug conjugates on CD117+
   CD34+ cells, an anti-CD1 17 antibody was directly conjugated to saporin or a-amanitin
15 and was subsequently incubated with CD117+ CD34+ cells at increasing concentrations.
   As negative controls, isotype-matched monoclonal antibodies were bound to saporin
   conjugated Fab fragments or were directly conjugated to a-amanitin. Following a five-day
   incubation period with CD117+ CD34+ cells, the viability of the cells was assessed using
   flow cytometry for those cells treated with saporin conjugates or using the CellTiter-GloTM
20 assay for cells treated with a-amanitin conjugates. As shown in Figs. 4A and 4B, anti
   CD1 17 antibodies conjugated to a-amanitin exhibited a surprisingly superior ability to
   deplete CD117+ CD34+ cells, exerting this cell-killing effect in a dose-dependent manner
   and with a substantially higher potency to a greater extent than monoclonal antibodies
   bound to saporin. A similar series of experiments was conducted using an anti-CD1 17
25 monoclonal antibody or isotype-matched antibody directly conjugated to MMAE and
   MMAF, which were incubated with CD117+ CD34+ cells for six days, following which
   time cell death was assessed by flow cytometry. As shown in Figs. 5A and 5B, the anti
   CD117 monoclonal antibody-MMAE and -MMAF conjugates did not deplete the test cell
   population to a greater extent or with a greater potency relative to the isotype-matched
30 control.
             The results of the foregoing experiments demonstrate that not all toxins bound to
   an anti-CD1 17 antibody are capable of killing CD117+ cells, and that anti-CD1 17
   antibodies conjugated to a-amanitin exhibit a surprisingly superior capacity for depleting
                                                  85

   CD117+ cells across distinct cell lines. To investigate the ability of anti-CD1 17 antibody
   a-amanitin conjugates to deplete human cells in vivo that express the hematopoietic stem
   cell marker CD34, NSG mice engrafted with human CD34+ cells were treated with either
   PBS buffer, monoclonal anti-CD1 17 antibody alone, monoclonal anti-CD1 17 antbiody-a
 5 amanitin conjugate, or isotype-matched negative control a-amanitin conjugate by a single
   intravenous administration. The mice were subsequently observed, and 22 days
   following the administration, bone marrow was harvested and analyzed to identify human
   cells, including CD45+ and CD34+ cells. As shown in Fig. 6, anti-CD1 17 antibodies
   conjugated to a-amanitin were capable of substantially depleting populations of human
10 CD34+ cells in NSG mice in a dose-dependent manner, while anti-CD1 17 monoclonal
   antibody alone and isotype-matched a-amanitin conjugate did not exhibit this phenotype.
   These results demonstrate that anti-CD1 17 antibodies conjugated to an amatoxin can be
   used to deplete a population of hematopoietic stem cells in a subject, for instance, in
   preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy, so as to provide a niche for to
15 which the hematopoietic stem cells may home.
