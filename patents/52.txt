DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0043] A detailed description of illustrative embodiments will now be described with reference
to the various Figures. Although this description provides a detailed example of possible
implementations, it should be noted that the details are intended to be exemplary and in no way
limit the scope of the application.
[0044] FIG. 1A is a diagram of an example communications system 100 in which one or more
disclosed embodiments may be implemented. The communications system 100 may be a
multiple access system that provides content, such as voice, data, video, messaging, broadcast,
etc., to multiple wireless users. The communications system 100 may enable multiple wireless
users to access such content through the sharing of system resources, including wireless
bandwidth. For example, the communications system 100 may employ one or more channel
access methods, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access
(TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), single
carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), and the like.
[0045] As shown in FIG. 1A, the communications system 100 may include wireless
transmit/receive units (WTRUs) 102a, 102b, 102c, and/or 102d (which generally or collectively
may be referred to as WTRU 102), a radio access network (RAN) 103/104/105, a core network
106/107/109, a public switched telephone network (PSTN) 108, the Internet 110, and other
networks 112, though it will be appreciated that the disclosed embodiments contemplate any
number of WTRUs, base stations, networks, and/or network elements. Each of the WTRUs 102a,
102b, 102c, 102d may be any type of device configured to operate and/or communicate in a
wireless environment. By way of example, the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d may be
configured to transmit and/or receive wireless signals and may include user equipment (UE), a
mobile station, a fixed or mobile subscriber unit, a pager, a cellular telephone, a personal digital
assistant (PDA), a smartphone, a laptop, a netbook, a personal computer, a wireless sensor,
consumer electronics, and the like.
14723013_1

[0046] The communications system 100 may also include a base station 114a and a base station
114b. Each of the base stations 114a, 114b may be any type of device configured to wirelessly
interface with at least one of the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d to facilitate access to one or
more communication networks, such as the core network 106/107/109, the Internet 110, and/or
the networks 112. By way of example, the base stations 114a, 114b may be a base transceiver
station (BTS), a Node-B, an eNode B, a Home Node B, a Home eNode B, a site controller, an
access point (AP), a wireless router, and the like. While the base stations 1 14a, 1 14b are each
depicted as a single element, it will be appreciated that the base stations 1 14a, 1 14b may include
any number of interconnected base stations and/or network elements.
[0047] The base station 114a may be part of the RAN 103/104/105, which may also include
other base stations and/or network elements (not shown), such as a base station controller (BSC),
a radio network controller (RNC), relay nodes, etc. The base station 1 14a and/or the base station
1 14b may be configured to transmit and/or receive wireless signals within a particular
geographic region, which may be referred to as a cell (not shown). The cell may further be
divided into cell sectors. For example, the cell associated with the base station 114a may be
divided into three sectors. Thus, in one embodiment, the base station 114a may include three
transceivers, e.g., one for each sector of the cell. In another embodiment, the base station 1 14a
may employ multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) technology and, therefore, may utilize
multiple transceivers for each sector of the cell.
[0048] The base stations 114a, 114b may communicate with one or more of the WTRUs 102a,
102b, 102c, 102d over an air interface 115/116/117, which may be any suitable wireless
communication link (e.g., radio frequency (RF), microwave, infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV),
visible light, etc.). The air interface 115/116/117 may be established using any suitable radio
access technology (RAT).
[0049] More specifically, as noted above, the communications system 100 may be a multiple
access system and may employ one or more channel access schemes, such as CDMA, TDMA,
FDMA, OFDMA, SC-FDMA, and the like. For example, the base station 114a in the RAN
103/104/105 and the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c may implement a radio technology such as
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA),
which may establish the air interface 115/116/117 using wideband CDMA (WCDMA).
WCDMA may include communication protocols such as High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA)
14723013_1

                                                - IV
and/or Evolved HSPA (HSPA+). HSPA may include High-Speed Downlink Packet Access
(HSDPA) and/or High-Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA).
[0050] In another embodiment, the base station 114a and the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c may
implement a radio technology such as Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA),
which may establish the air interface 115/116/117 using Long Term Evolution (LTE) and/or
LTE-Advanced (LTE-A).
[0051] In other embodiments, the base station 1 14a and the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c may
implement radio technologies such as IEEE 802.16 (e.g., Worldwide Interoperability for
Microwave Access (WiMAX)), CDMA2000, CDMA2000 1X, CDMA2000 EV-DO, Interim
Standard 2000 (IS-2000), Interim Standard 95 (IS-95), Interim Standard 856 (IS-856), Global
System for Mobile communications (GSM), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE),
GSM EDGE (GERAN), and the like.
[0052] The base station 114b in FIG. 1A may be a wireless router, Home Node B, Home eNode
B, or access point, for example, and may utilize any suitable RAT for facilitating wireless
connectivity in a localized area, such as a place of business, a home, a vehicle, a campus, and the
like. In one embodiment, the base station 114b and the WTRUs 102c, 102d may implement a
radio technology such as IEEE 802.11 to establish a wireless local area network (WLAN). In
another embodiment, the base station 114b and the WTRUs 102c, 102d may implement a radio
technology such as IEEE 802.15 to establish a wireless personal area network (WPAN). In yet
another embodiment, the base station 1 14b and the WTRUs 102c, 102d may utilize a cellular
based RAT (e.g., WCDMA, CDMA2000, GSM, LTE, LTE-A, etc.) to establish a picocell or
femtocell. As shown in FIG. 1A, the base station 1 14b may have a direct connection to the
Internet 110. Thus, the base station 1 14b may not be required to access the Internet 110 via the
core network 106/107/109.
[0053] The RAN 103/104/105 may be in communication with the core network 106/107/109,
which may be any type of network configured to provide voice, data, applications, and/or voice
over internet protocol (VoIP) services to one or more of the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d. For
example, the core network 106/107/109 may provide call control, billing services, mobile
location-based services, pre-paid calling, Internet connectivity, video distribution, etc., and/or
perform high-level security functions, such as user authentication. Although not shown in FIG.
14723013_1

1A, it will be appreciated that the RAN 103/104/105 and/or the core network 106/107/109 may
be in direct or indirect communication with other RANs that employ the same RAT as the RAN
103/104/105 or a different RAT. For example, in addition to being connected to the RAN
103/104/105, which may be utilizing an E-UTRA radio technology, the core network
106/107/109 may also be in communication with another RAN (not shown) employing a GSM
radio technology.
[0054] The core network 106/107/109 may also serve as a gateway for the WTRUs 102a, 102b,
102c, 102d to access the PSTN 108, the Internet 110, and/or other networks 112. The PSTN 108
may include circuit-switched telephone networks that provide plain old telephone service
(POTS). The Internet 110 may include a global system of interconnected computer networks and
devices that use common communication protocols, such as the transmission control protocol
(TCP), user datagram protocol (UDP) and the internet protocol (IP) in the TCP/IP internet
protocol suite. The networks 112 may include wired or wireless communications networks
owned and/or operated by other service providers. For example, the networks 112 may include
another core network connected to one or more RANs, which may employ the same RAT as the
RAN 103/104/105 or a different RAT.
[0055] Some or all of the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d in the communications system 100
may include multi-mode capabilities, e.g., the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c and 102d may include
multiple transceivers for communicating with different wireless networks over different wireless
links. For example, the WTRU 102c shown in FIG. 1A may be configured to communicate with
the base station 114a, which may employ a cellular-based radio technology, and with the base
station 114b, which may employ an IEEE 802 radio technology.
[0056] FIG. lB is a system diagram of an example WTRU 102. As shown in FIG. 1B, the
WTRU 102 may include a processor 118, a transceiver 120, a transmit/receive element 122, a
speaker/microphone 124, a keypad 126, a display/touchpad 128, non-removable memory 130,
removable memory 132, a power source 134, a global positioning system (GPS) chipset 136, and
other peripherals 138. It will be appreciated that the WTRU 102 may include any sub
combination of the foregoing elements while remaining consistent with an embodiment. Also,
embodiments contemplate that the base stations 1 14a and 1 14b, and/or the nodes that base
stations 1 14a and 1 14b may represent, such as but not limited to transceiver station (BTS), a
Node-B, a site controller, an access point (AP), a home node-B, an evolved home node-B
14723013_1

                                                  - I/-
(eNodeB), a home evolved node-B (HeNB or HeNodeB), a home evolved node-B gateway, and
proxy nodes, among others, may include some or all of the elements depicted in FIG. 1B and
described herein.
[0057] The processor 118 may be a general purpose processor, a special purpose processor, a
conventional processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), a plurality of microprocessors, one or
more microprocessors in association with a DSP core, a controller, a microcontroller,
Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGAs)
circuits, any other type of integrated circuit (IC), a state machine, and the like. The processor 118
may perform signal coding, data processing, power control, input/output processing, and/or any
other functionality that enables the WTRU 102 to operate in a wireless environment. The
processor 118 may be coupled to the transceiver 120, which may be coupled to the
transmit/receive element 122. While FIG. lB depicts the processor 118 and the transceiver 120
as separate components, it will be appreciated that the processor 118 and the transceiver 120 may
be integrated together in an electronic package or chip.
[0058] The transmit/receive element 122 may be configured to transmit signals to, or receive
signals from, a base station (e.g., the base station 1 14a) over the air interface 115/116/117. For
example, in one embodiment, the transmit/receive element 122 may be an antenna configured to
transmit and/or receive RF signals. In another embodiment, the transmit/receive element 122
may be an emitter/detector configured to transmit and/or receive IR, UV, or visible light signals,
for example. In yet another embodiment, the transmit/receive element 122 may be configured to
transmit and receive both RF and light signals. It will be appreciated that the transmit/receive
element 122 may be configured to transmit and/or receive any combination of wireless signals.
[0059] In addition, although the transmit/receive element 122 is depicted in FIG. lB as a single
element, the WTRU 102 may include any number of transmit/receive elements 122. More
specifically, the WTRU 102 may employ MIMO technology. Thus, in one embodiment, the
WTRU 102 may include two or more transmit/receive elements 122 (e.g., multiple antennas) for
transmitting and receiving wireless signals over the air interface 115/116/117.
[0060] The transceiver 120 may be configured to modulate the signals that are to be transmitted
by the transmit/receive element 122 and to demodulate the signals that are received by the
transmit/receive element 122. As noted above, the WTRU 102 may have multi-mode
14723013_1

capabilities. Thus, the transceiver 120 may include multiple transceivers for enabling the WTRU
102 to communicate via multiple RATs, such as UTRA and IEEE 802.11, for example.
[0061] The processor 118 of the WTRU 102 may be coupled to, and may receive user input data
from, the speaker/microphone 124, the keypad 126, and/or the display/touchpad 128 (e.g., a
liquid crystal display (LCD) display unit or organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display unit).
The processor 118 may also output user data to the speaker/microphone 124, the keypad 126,
and/or the display/touchpad 128. In addition, the processor 118 may access information from,
and store data in, any type of suitable memory, such as the non-removable memory 130 and/or
the removable memory 132. The non-removable memory 130 may include random-access
memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), a hard disk, or any other type of memory storage
device. The removable memory 132 may include a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, a
memory stick, a secure digital (SD) memory card, and the like. In other embodiments, the
processor 118 may access information from, and store data in, memory that is not physically
located on the WTRU 102, such as on a server or a home computer (not shown).
[0062] The processor 118 may receive power from the power source 134, and may be configured
to distribute and/or control the power to the other components in the WTRU 102. The power
source 134 may be any suitable device for powering the WTRU 102. For example, the power
source 134 may include one or more dry cell batteries (e.g., nickel-cadmium (NiCd), nickel-zinc
(NiZn), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), lithium-ion (Li-ion), etc.), solar cells, fuel cells, and the
like.
[0063] The processor 118 may also be coupled to the GPS chipset 136, which may be configured
to provide location information (e.g., longitude and latitude) regarding the current location of the
WTRU 102. In addition to, or in lieu of, the information from the GPS chipset 136, the WTRU
102 may receive location information over the air interface 115/116/117 from a base station
(e.g., base stations 1 14a, 114b) and/or determine its location based on the timing of the signals
being received from two or more nearby base stations. It will be appreciated that the WTRU 102
may acquire location information by way of any suitable location-determination implementation
while remaining consistent with an embodiment.
[0064] The processor 118 may further be coupled to other peripherals 138, which may include
one or more software and/or hardware modules that provide additional features, functionality

[0065] FIG. IC is a system diagram of the RAN 103 and the core network 106 according to an
embodiment. As noted above, the RAN 103 may employ a UTRA radio technology to
communicate with the WTRUs 102a, 102b, and 102c over the air interface 115. The RAN 103
may also be in communication with the core network 106. As shown in FIG. IC, the RAN 103
may include Node-Bs 140a, 140b, 140c, which may each include one or more transceivers for

interface. The RNCs 142a, 142b may be in communication with one another via an Iur interface.
Each of the RNCs 142a, 142b may be configured to control the respective Node-Bs 140a, 140b,
140c to which it is connected. In addition, each of the RNCs 142a, 142b may be configured to
carry out or support other functionality, such as outer loop power control, load control,
admission control, packet scheduling, handover control, macrodiversity, security functions, data
encryption, and the like.
[0067] The core network 106 shown in FIG. IC may include a media gateway (MGW) 144, a
mobile switching center (MSC) 146, a serving GPRS support node (SGSN) 148, and/or a
gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) 150. While each of the foregoing elements are depicted as
part of the core network 106, it will be appreciated that any one of these elements may be owned
and/or operated by an entity other than the core network operator.
[0068] The RNC 142a in the RAN 103 may be connected to the MSC 146 in the core network
106 via an IuCS interface. The MSC 146 may be connected to the MGW 144. The MSC 146 and

the MGW 144 may provide the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c with access to circuit-switched
networks, such as the PSTN 108, to facilitate communications between the WTRUs 102a, 102b,
102c and traditional land-line communications devices.
[0069] The RNC 142a in the RAN 103 may also be connected to the SGSN 148 in the core
network 106 via an IuPS interface. The SGSN 148 may be connected to the GGSN 150. The
SGSN 148 and the GGSN 150 may provide the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c with access to packet
switched networks, such as the Internet 110, to facilitate communications between and the
WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c and IP-enabled devices.
[0070] As noted above, the core network 106 may also be connected to the networks 112, which
may include other wired or wireless networks that are owned and/or operated by other service
providers.
[0071] FIG. ID is a system diagram of the RAN 104 and the core network 107 according to an
embodiment. As noted above, the RAN 104 may employ an E-UTRA radio technology to
communicate with the WTRUs 102a, 102b, and 102c over the air interface 116. The RAN 104
may also be in communication with the core network 107.
[0072] The RAN 104 may include eNode-Bs 160a, 160b, 160c, though it will be appreciated that
the RAN 104 may include any number of eNode-Bs while remaining consistent with an
embodiment. The eNode-Bs 160a, 160b, 160c may each include one or more transceivers for
communicating with the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c over the air interface 116. In one
embodiment, the eNode-Bs 160a, 160b, 160c may implement MIMO technology. Thus, the
eNode-B 160a, for example, may use multiple antennas to transmit wireless signals to, and
receive wireless signals from, the WTRU 102a.
[0073] Each of the eNode-Bs 160a, 160b, and 160c may be associated with a particular cell (not
shown) and may be configured to handle radio resource management decisions, handover
decisions, scheduling of users in the uplink and/or downlink, and the like. As shown in FIG. ID,
the eNode-Bs 160a, 160b, 160c may communicate with one another over an X2 interface.
[0074] The core network 107 shown in FIG. ID may include a mobility management gateway
(MME) 162, a serving gateway 164, and a packet data network (PDN) gateway 166. While each

of the foregoing elements are depicted as part of the core network 107, it will be appreciated that
any one of these elements may be owned and/or operated by an entity other than the core
network operator.
[0075] The MME 162 may be connected to each of the eNode-Bs 160a, 160b, and 160c in the
RAN 104 via an SI interface and may serve as a control node. For example, the MME 162 may
be responsible for authenticating users of the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, bearer
activation/deactivation, selecting a particular serving gateway during an initial attach of the
WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, and the like. The MME 162 may also provide a control plane function
for switching between the RAN 104 and other RANs (not shown) that employ other radio
technologies, such as GSM or WCDMA.
[0076] The serving gateway 164 may be connected to each of the eNode-Bs 160a, 160b, and
160c in the RAN 104 via the SI interface. The serving gateway 164 may generally route and
forward user data packets to/from the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c. The serving gateway 164 may
also perform other functions, such as anchoring user planes during inter-eNode B handovers,
triggering paging when downlink data is available for the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, managing
and storing contexts of the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, and the like.
[0077] The serving gateway 164 may also be connected to the PDN gateway 166, which may
provide the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c with access to packet-switched networks, such as the
Internet 110, to facilitate communications between the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c and IP-enabled
devices.
[0078] The core network 107 may facilitate communications with other networks. For example,
the core network 107 may provide the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c with access to circuit-switched
networks, such as the PSTN 108, to facilitate communications between the WTRUs 102a, 102b,
102c and traditional land-line communications devices. For example, the core network 107 may
include, or may communicate with, an IP gateway (e.g., an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS)
server) that serves as an interface between the core network 107 and the PSTN 108. In addition,
the core network 107 may provide the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c with access to the networks
112, which may include other wired or wireless networks that are owned and/or operated by
other service providers.

[0079] FIG. 1E is a system diagram of the RAN 105 and the core network 109 according to an
embodiment. The RAN 105 may be an access service network (ASN) that employs IEEE 802.16
radio technology to communicate with the WTRUs 102a, 102b, and 102c over the air interface
117. As will be further discussed below, the communication links between the different
functional entities of the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, the RAN 105, and the core network 109 may
be defined as reference points.
[0080] As shown in FIG. 1E, the RAN 105 may include base stations 180a, 180b, 180c, and an
ASN gateway 182, though it will be appreciated that the RAN 105 may include any number of
base stations and ASN gateways while remaining consistent with an embodiment. The base
stations 180a, 180b, 180c may each be associated with a particular cell (not shown) in the RAN
105 and may each include one or more transceivers for communicating with the WTRUs 102a,
102b, 102c over the air interface 117. In one embodiment, the base stations 180a, 180b, 180c
may implement MIMO technology. Thus, the base station 180a, for example, may use multiple
antennas to transmit wireless signals to, and receive wireless signals from, the WTRU 102a. The
base stations 180a, 180b, 180c may also provide mobility management functions, such as
handoff triggering, tunnel establishment, radio resource management, traffic classification,
quality of service (QoS) policy enforcement, and the like. The ASN gateway 182 may serve as a
traffic aggregation point and may be responsible for paging, caching of subscriber profiles,
routing to the core network 109, and the like.
[0081] The air interface 117 between the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c and the RAN 105 may be
defined as an RI reference point that implements the IEEE 802.16 specification. In addition,
each of the WTRUs 102a, 102b, and 102c may establish a logical interface (not shown) with the
core network 109. The logical interface between the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c and the core
network 109 may be defined as an R2 reference point, which may be used for authentication,
authorization, IP host configuration management, and/or mobility management.
[0082] The communication link between each of the base stations 180a, 180b, and 180c may be
defined as an R8 reference point that includes protocols for facilitating WTRU handovers and the
transfer of data between base stations. The communication link between the base stations 180a,
180b, 180c and the ASN gateway 182 may be defined as an R6 reference point. The R6
reference point may include protocols for facilitating mobility management based on mobility
events associated with each of the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c.

[0083] As shown in FIG. 1E, the RAN 105 may be connected to the core network 109. The
communication link between the RAN 105 and the core network 109 may defined as an R3
reference point that includes protocols for facilitating data transfer and mobility management
capabilities, for example. The core network 109 may include a mobile IP home agent (MIP-HA)
184, an authentication, authorization, accounting (AAA) server 186, and a gateway 188. While
each of the foregoing elements are depicted as part of the core network 109, it will be
appreciated that any one of these elements may be owned and/or operated by an entity other than
the core network operator.
[0084] The MIP-HA may be responsible for IP address management, and may enable the
WTRUs 102a, 102b, and 102c to roam between different ASNs and/or different core networks.
The MIP-HA 184 may provide the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c with access to packet-switched
networks, such as the Internet 110, to facilitate communications between the WTRUs 102a,
102b, 102c and IP-enabled devices. The AAA server 186 may be responsible for user
authentication and for supporting user services. The gateway 188 may facilitate interworking
with other networks. For example, the gateway 188 may provide the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c
with access to circuit-switched networks, such as the PSTN 108, to facilitate communications
between the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c and traditional land-line communications devices. In
addition, the gateway 188 may provide the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c with access to the
networks 112, which may include other wired or wireless networks that are owned and/or
operated by other service providers.
[0085] Although not shown in FIG. 1E, it will be appreciated that the RAN 105 may be
connected to other ASNs and the core network 109 may be connected to other core networks.
The communication link between the RAN 105 the other ASNs may be defined as an R4
reference point, which may include protocols for coordinating the mobility of the WTRUs 102a,
102b, 102c between the RAN 105 and the other ASNs. The communication link between the
core network 109 and the other core networks may be defined as an R5 reference, which may
include protocols for facilitating interworking between home core networks and visited core
networks.
[0086] The subject matter disclosed herein may be used in multimedia delivery systems for
mobile devices (e.g., smart phones, tablets, laptops) and home devices such as set-top boxes,
streaming devices, gaming consoles, consumer/commercial TVs and SmartTVs, and personal
14723013_1

computers. Multimedia delivery frameworks including, but not limited to, cable, IPTV,
progressive download, streaming technologies, and bandwidth adaptive streaming may be
supported.
[0087] A system for multimedia delivery system may use information about a user's viewing
conditions to adapt an encoding and delivery process to reduce or minimize usage of network
bandwidth, power, and other system resources. The system may use sensors (e.g., front-faced
camera, ambient light sensor, accelerometer, etc.) of a device (e.g., smart phone or tablet) to
detect the presence of the viewer. An adaptation system may use this information to determine
parameters of visual content that a viewer may be able to see and may adjust encoding and
delivery options accordingly. This adaptation mechanism may allow the delivery system to
achieve a satisfactory user experience, while saving network bandwidth and other system
resources. A system may detect and adapt to user presence using sensors such as an IR remote
control, range finder, TV camera; smart phone or tablets used as remote controls and second
screens; and capabilities that may be available at home.
[0088] FIG. 2 illustrates an example multimedia system 200 that may be used for delivering
media content. The system 200 may be bandwidth-adaptive. The multimedia system 200 may
include a content provider 210, a client 250 and a communication network 260. The content
provider 210 may send media content (e.g., multimedia content) to the client 250 over the
communication network 260.
[0089] The content provider 210 may store media content 212. The media content 212 may
comprise an advertisement 212a and/or non-advertising media content 212b. The non
advertising media content 212b may be, for example, a movie, a show, etc. The media content
212 may include a media content identifier 214 that may identify the media content 212. The
media content identifier 214 may include an advertisement identifier 214a that may identify an
advertisement 212a. The media content identifier 214 may include a media content identifier
214b that may identify the non-advertising media content 212b.
[0090] The content provider 210 may store the media content 212 in a data store 216. The data
store 216 may include an advertisement data store that may store advertisement(s) 212a. The
data store 216 may include a non-advertising media content data store that may store the non
advertising media content 212b. The content provider 210 may include a computing device 220.
14723013_1

The computing device 220 may include one or more servers. The computing device 220 may
include a processor 222. The processor 222 may be configured to do one or more of the
following. The processor 222 may access the data store 216. The processor 222 may retrieve
media content 212 from the data store 216 and provide the media content 212 to the client 250.
[0091] A user 252 may control the client 250. An example of the client 250 may be a WTRU
(e.g., WTRU 102). The user 252 may, for example, request a particular media content 212 from
the content provider 210. The user 252 may purchase the media content 212 from the content
provider 210. The user 252 may provide payment information, for example, credit card
information, to the content provider 210 via the client 250. The communication network 260 may
include the Internet 262. The communication network 260 may include a cellular communication
network. The cellular communication network may include a gateway 264. The cellular
communication network may include a base station, for example an eNodeB 266. The cellular
communication network may include a wireless link 268. The communication network 260 may
include a Wi-Fi network 270. The communication network 260 may include a home gateway
272. The communication network 260 may include a streaming device 274.
[0092] The system 200 may include a content distribution network 280. The content provider
210 may receive the media content 212 via the content distribution network 280. A content
source 282 (e.g., a video source, for example a camera) may capture media content (e.g., video,
audio, or both). An encoder 284 may encode the media content captured by the content source
282. The encoder 284 may send the encoded media content to the content provider 210 through
the content distribution network 280. The content provider 210 may receive media content from
the content source 282 via the content distribution network 280. The content provider 210 may
store the received media content in the data store 216.
[0093] User presence, proximity to screen, and attention to video content may be established, for
example, using built-in sensors (e.g., a camera accelerometer) in mobile devices or built-in
sensors in a TV, a set-top box, a remote control, or other TV-attached devices (e.g., game
consoles, Kinect, and the like) in a home environment. Information about user presence and
proximity may be used to optimize multimedia delivery. For example, information regarding the
presence of the user 252 and/or proximity of the user 252 to the client 250 may be used (e.g., by
the client 250 or by the content provider 210) to optimize the delivery of the media content 212
on the client 250.

[0094] Content distributors (e.g., content provider 210) may distribute content (e.g., media
content 212) to local affiliates and cable television providers nationwide. Content may be
distributed as video streams that may be rendered, for example, by a digital television system
(e.g., client 250) or a video on demand (VOD) system. The video streams may carry
advertisements (e.g., advertisements 212a) that may be shown at the national level, but that may
also allow for regional and/or local advertisements to be inserted in a media stream (e.g., in
between non-advertising media content 212b). In analog television, in-band dual-tone multi
frequency (DTMF) subcarrier audio cue tones may be used to trigger a cutover from a show or
national advertisement to a regional or local advertisement. Cue messages may be embedded in
MPEG-2 TS.
[0095] One or more advertisement splicers may scan incoming content for messages (e.g., cue
messages). The advertisement splicer may query an advertising decision server for an
advertisement or advertisements that may be displayed. The advertisement splicer may insert the
advertisement(s) into the media content that reaches the viewer. FIG. 3 illustrates an example
system 300 that may be used for inserting or splicing advertisements in a media stream. The
system 300 may include an advertisement splicer 310. The advertisement splicer 310 may
receive a network feed 320. The network feed 320 may include a media stream. For example, the
network feed 320 may include non-advertising media content(s) 212b. The network feed 320
may include one or more cue messages. A cue message may indicate a position 322 (e.g., an
insertion point) within the network feed 320 where an advertisement may be inserted. The cue
message may indicate a type of the advertisement. The cue message may indicate a particular
advertisement that may be inserted in the network feed 320, e.g., the cue message may specify a
particular advertisement identifier 214a.
[0096] The system 300 may include an advertisement server 340 (e.g., data store 216). The
advertisement server 340 may include one or more advertisements 342 (e.g., advertisements
212a). The advertisement splicer 310 may be configured for one or more of the following. The
advertisement splicer 310 may be configured to receive the network feed 320. The advertisement
splicer 310 may scan the network feed 320 for one or more cue messages. The advertisement
splicer 310 may identify a position 322 within the network feed 320 where the advertisement
splicer 310 may insert an advertisement 342. The advertisement splicer 310 may access the
advertisement server 340. The advertisement splicer 310 may retrieve the advertisement 342
from the advertisement server 340. The advertisement splicer 310 may insert the advertisement
14723013_1

342 in the network feed 320 at the position 322 that is indicated by the cue message. The
advertisement splicer 310 may output a modified network feed 350. The modified network feed
350 may include a first portion 320a of the network feed 320, the inserted advertisement 342 and
a second portion 320b of the network feed 320. The advertisement splicer 310 may send the
modified network feed 350 to another network entity, for example to the client 250 and/or to the
content provider 210, etc.
[0097] The system 300 may be implemented, either entirely or partially, by the content provider
210. The system 300 may be implemented by different network entities. For example, the
advertisement server 340 may be implemented by the content provider 210. The advertisement
342 may include the advertisement 212a. The network feed 320 may include non-advertising
media content(s) 212b. The system 300 and/or the advertisement splicer 310 may be
implemented by a computing device (e.g., computing device 220). The computing device may
have a processor (e.g., processor 222) that may be configured to implement the advertisement
splicer 310.
[0098] Web sites hosting media content (e.g., YouTube, Hulu, Facebook, CBS, Yahoo, etc.) may
obtain revenue by showing advertisements to users during a multimedia delivery session (e.g.,
progressive download or streaming). Ads may be shown at the beginning (pre-roll), end (post
roll), and/or during (mid-roll) of the delivery session. When a video advertisement is rendered,
rules may be inserted to alter the user's control of the playback. For example, users may be
prevented from skipping or fast-forwarding through the ad.
[0099] Advertisers may compensate web publishers for inserting ads in their content. In a Cost
Per Mille (CPM) model, for example, advertisers may pay for every thousand displays of their
message to potential customers. Each instance when an advertisement is displayed may be
referred to as an impression. Accuracy of counting and/or verifying impressions may be
performed. If an impression is verified as one that was watched by the viewer it may be worth
more than an impression that is not verifiable as having reached a viewer's attention. Other
compensation models include Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Action (CPA) models.
[0100] Advertisement verification techniques may relate to techniques related to image ads, such
as but not limited to determining whether an advertisement has been served (e.g., using cookies
or invisible or transparent images), whether the page with advertisements may have been
14723013_1

requested by a human (e.g., to prevent fraud by inflating the number of impressions), and/or by
determining the location of an advertisement within a web page (e.g., visible by the user on page
load, referred to as "above the fold").
[0101] An IAB Video Ad Serving Template (VAST) may be used for advertisement tracking.
Beyond tracking the fact that the first frame of the advertisement was displayed (e.g., an
impression), a richer set of tracking events may be provided (e.g., percentage of the
advertisement reached, mute/unmute, and the like). These events may trigger requests, such as
HTTP GET requests, to URLs specified in the advertisement server response expressed in
VAST. SCTE 35 may be used for advertisement insertion in adaptive streaming, for example, in
a binary format or in an XML format.
[0102] Advertisement impressions may not be verified directly if there may be no built-in
feedback mechanism in the content delivery system, for example, as may be the case in
broadcast and cable TV. Ads may be served when a user is active and a user's presence may be
determined by using the mouse or the keyboard, for example, as may be the case in video
streaming for laptops and PCs with an Internet connection.
[0103] Targeted advertising may involve placing advertisements so as to reach consumers based
on various traits such as, for example, demographics, psychographics, behavioral variables (e.g.,
product purchase history), and/or other second-order activities that may serve as a proxy for
these consumer traits.
[0104] Targeted media advertising may use second-order proxies for targeting. For example,
targeted advertising may track online or mobile web activities of consumers, associate historical
webpage consumer demographics with new consumer web page access, and/or use a search word
as the basis for implied interest or contextual advertising.
[0105] Addressable advertising systems may serve ads (e.g., directly serve ads) based on
demographic, psychographic, and/or behavioral attributes associated with the consumer(s)
exposed to the advertisement. These systems may be digital and may be addressable in that the
end point that serves the advertisement (e.g., set-top box, website, or digital sign) may render an
advertisement independently of any other end points based on consumer attributes specific to
14723013_1

that end point at the time the advertisement may be served. Addressable advertising systems may
use consumer traits associated with the end points as the basis for selecting and serving ads.
[0106] Targeted advertisements may be more valuable than network wide ads, and the
specificity with which the targeting is performed may be important. Age may be estimated from
facial still images. Other anthropometric parameters, such as race, ethnicity, etc., may be
estimated. These techniques may rely on image data as an input in order to estimate
demographic/anthropometric parameters.
[0107] Other sensor inputs, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, IR cameras, etc., may be used to
estimate age and/or other demographic information. Accelerometers, e.g., in a smart phone, may
be used to monitor a user's essential physiological kinetic tremor, which may have
characteristics that may correlate to age. Other sensors (e.g., gyroscope) may also be used to
obtain or complement this information. For additional demographic data, the accelerometer data
may be mined for gender, height, and weight.
[0108] Advertising may be inserted in a video stream using, for example, an application-driven
architecture or a server-driven architecture. A server-driven architecture may use a client (e.g., a
DASH client), and communication with advertising decision services may be performed at the
server side. Communication may be triggered by a client request for a segment, a remote
element, or an media presentation description (MPD). An application-driven architecture may
use an application running on a wireless transmit/receive unit (WTRU) that may control one or
more DASH clients.
[0109] A server-driven architecture may assume DASH functionality. An application-driven
architecture may use an application that controls multiple DASH clients. For example, multiple
client instances may execute on a client device for context switching, e.g., between main content
and advertising or for another purpose.
[0110] FIG. 4 illustrates an example presentation sequence 400 of media content (e.g., media
content 212). A descriptor element 402 may enable the presentation of multi-period assets (e.g.,
multi-period media content). An example of the descriptor element may be an AssetIdentifier.
The descriptor element 402 may be included in a media presentation description (MPD) file 404.
The descriptor element 402 may include a content identifier 414 that may identify the media
14723013_1

content. An example of the media content may be the non-advertising media content 212b of
FIG. 2. The content identifier 414 may identify the media content. An example of the content
identifier may be the non-advertising media content identifier 214b. The descriptor element 402
may establish a media content specific (e.g., an asset-specific) timeline. Multi-period media
content may be media content that may be split into several periods. For example, a 45-min
movie may be separated into three 15-minute periods, M1, M2, and M3. Two 1-min ads, Al and
A2, may be inserted between the movie periods. The presentation may be the sequence 400 of
five periods, M1, Al, M2, A2, and M3, as illustrated in FIG. 4.
[0111] A period (e.g., each period) may be associated with a descriptor element 402 that may
identify the media content to which the period belongs. Using an equivalent descriptor element
for M1, M2, and M3 may establish that these three periods belong to the same media content
(e.g., a particular media content 212b that may include a 45 minute movie object). This
description structure may be used to inform a media playback client (e.g., a DASH client or
client 250) that a single content object may flow across periods Ml, M2, and M3. M2 may be a
continuation of M1, and M3 may be a continuation of M2.
[0112] The mapping of periods (e.g., periods Ml, M2 and M3) to descriptor elements (e.g.,
descriptor element 402) may be used by a media playback client (e.g., client 250) to switch
contexts appropriately between different media content at the proper times. The mapping of
periods to descriptor elements may be used by a media playback client to properly display the
playback progress bar (e.g., scrub bar), which may show the current playback position. The
mapping of periods to descriptor elements may enable the media playback client to properly
handle trick modes, such as seeking forward or backward within a media content.
[0113] The MPD 404 may be delivered to the media playback client (e.g., client 250). The MPD
404 may comprise a description of the periods Ml, M2 and M3. The MPD 404 may specify an
associated descriptor element for each period. For example, the MPD 404 may specify that the
descriptor element 402 is associated with periods Ml, M2 and M3. A media playback client may
compare descriptor elements using an equivalence rule in order to determine whether the
descriptor elements specified for different periods may be equivalent and may map to the same
media content (e.g., media content 212, for example the 45 minute movie object). For example,
two descriptor elements may be considered equivalent if the fields and/or payload associated
with a first descriptor element matches the corresponding fields and/or payload of a second
14723013_1

descriptor element. Whitespace characters may be ignored. The specific definition of
equivalence may vary.
[0114] HTTP may be stateless and client-driven. Push-style events may be emulated using
frequent polls. In cable/IPTV systems, upcoming advertisement breaks may be signaled, for
example, three to eight seconds before their start. A straightforward poll-based implementation
may be inefficient. Events may address such use cases.
[0115] Events may be blobs with explicit time and duration information and may include
application-specific payloads. An application may subscribe to events of a certain type and
handle them. This may be a sink, for example, the event processing model of the application may
be completely opaque to the DASH client, and it may not expect any feedback regarding the
event.
[0116] In-band events may refer to small message boxes that may appear at the beginning of
media segments. MPD events may refer to a period-level list of timed elements. DASH may
define MPD Validity Expiration and MPD Patch events. MPD Validity Expiration events may
notify the client when a newly published MPD may become valid (and may be fetched). MPD
Patch events may apply a patch to the current MPD. A DASH client may handle these events
rather than pass them to an application.
[0117] DASH may define several template parameters. The template parameters may have pre
defined names and/or semantics. The template parameters may be used for URL creation.
DASH may define generalized parameters. The generalized parameters may be used by the
author to declare a variable in the MPD. The declared variable may be instantiated at MPD fetch
time or in real time. An application may provide a value of the declared variable. The declared
variable may be used to create the URL when templates are used. For example, one may declare
a variable named '$UserID$', instantiate '$UserID$' at the beginning of a period and append a
value of '$UserID$' to a segment request.
[0118] Advertisement insertion primitives may be mapped to DASH functionality. An
advertisement may be a period element (e.g., period Al or A2). An advertisement cue may be a
remote period element. Main content (e.g., periods Ml, M2 and M3, for example non-advertising
media content 212b) may be distinguished from inserted content (e.g., periods Al and A2, for
14723013_1

example advertisements 212a) using descriptor elements. MPD updates may be used to notify a
client of new periods, for example, using client-side polling (e.g., at a given frequency) or
asynchronously using an 1seg brand and/or in-band events.
[0119] A hybrid approach may be provided. A hybrid approach may involve using generic
DASH functionality for server-side advertisement insertion and using VAST embedded within
DASH MPD events to provide integration with an advertising infrastructure for tracking,
reporting, and companion advertising functionality.
[0120] HTTP GET requests may be logged. This approach may have issues, for example, related
to establishing a notion of sessions and/or to the complexity of data aggregation across content
delivery networks (CDNs).
[0121] Descriptor elements may be used to distinguish main content (e.g., non-advertising media
content 212b, for example a movie) from inserted advertising content (e.g., advertisements
212a), for example, in MPEG DASH and/or 3GPP DASH systems. The descriptor element 404
may comprise a content identifier 414 (e.g., an identifier component, for example a string, etc.).
The content identifier 414 may identify the media content. The content identifier 414 may
include an advertisement identifier that may specify an advertisement, for example when the
descriptor element includes the advertisement. For example, the descriptor element for a given
video advertisement object may comprise an advertisement identifier. The advertisement
identifier may include an Ad-ID that may be provided by a system, for example, at www.ad
id.org. The advertisement identifier may include a MovieLabs Content ID URN, or another
identifier. This may enable the media playback client to identify an advertisement object, for
example for functions such as retrieval, playback, and/or reporting. For example, the client 250
may use a value of the content identifier 414 (e.g., advertisement identifier 214a) to retrieve a
corresponding advertisement 212a.
[0122] For example, the AssetIdentifier descriptor element may be as follows:
        <AssetIdentifier schemeldUri="um:org:dashif:ad-id:2013"
        value="md:cid:EIDR:10.5240%2fF592-58D1-A4D9-E968-5435-L"/>
[0123] The value attribute may include the content identifier 414 (e.g., a MovieLabs Content ID)
that may identify the advertising content object (e.g., advertisement 212a).
14723013_1

[0124] The media content identifiers (e.g., media content identifiers 214 or identifier strings) that
may be available for use in descriptor elements may identify a media content object (e.g., media
content 212). The media content identifiers may not change with subsequent insertions or
placements of the media content object. For example, an advertisement provider may produce an
advertisement. The advertisement provider may use the Ad-ID system to generate an
advertisement identifier (e.g., advertisement identifier 214a or Ad-ID) for the advertisement
(e.g., advertisement 212a). Placement of the advertisement may be referenced using the
advertisement identifier. The advertiser may omit generating a new advertisement identifier for
each individual insertion/placement of that advertisement. Ad-ID and/or other identification
registry organizations may charge a fee to generate advertisement identifiers, so generating more
than one advertisement identifier per advertisement to identify each advertisement placement
may be cost prohibitive. For example, an advertisement identifier for Al and A2 may be the
same.
[0125] Multiple advertisements having the same advertisement identifier may cause problems
for a media playback client (e.g., client 250). For example, if the same advertisement is placed
more than once in a presentation, then the multiple placements of the same advertisement may
result in multiple periods that may have the same or equivalent descriptor elements. Upon
determining that the multiple periods have the same or equivalent descriptor elements, a media
playback client may interpret that the multiple placements of the same advertisement may be
continuations of a single advertisement. The media playback client may not be capable of
correctly switching context between the main video content (e.g., periods M1, M2 and M3) and
the multiple placements of the same advertisement (e.g., periods Al and A2). A media playback
client may not be capable of correctly displaying the playback progress (e.g., scrub bar) when
playing the various placements of the same advertisement (e.g., when playing A2). A media
playback client may not be capable of correctly processing trick mode operations (e.g., fast
forward, reverse playback, or seek) when playing the various placements of the same
advertisement (e.g., when playing A2).
[0126] FIG. 5 illustrates an example media stream 500. The media stream 500 may include
periods M1, M2 and M3. The periods M1, M2 and M3 may belong to a non-advertising media
content (e.g., media content 212b, for example a movie). The media stream 500 may include
advertisement periods Al and A2. The advertisement periods Al and A2 may be representative
of an advertisement (e.g., advertisement 212a). The advertisement period A2 may be a repetition
14723013_1

of the advertisement period Al (e.g., the advertisement period Al and the advertisement period
A2 may be for the same advertisement). Descriptor elements 502 (e.g., AssetIdentifier descriptor
elements) may be included in one or more of the periods Ml, M2, M3, Al and A2. For example,
a period (e.g., each period) may include one or more descriptor elements. One or more
descriptor elements may be included in a media presentation description (MPD), a period, an
AdaptationSet, and/or a Representation element. A descriptor element may include a uniform
resource identifier (URI) that may identify a scheme of the descriptor element (e.g., what the
descriptor element does). A descriptor element may comprise a single string value, an XML
element, and/or the like. For example, the MPD 504 may comprise one or more descriptor
elements 502.
[0127] A first descriptor element 502a may be used for a first occurrence of an advertisement,
for example, Al. A second descriptor elements 502b may be used for a second (e.g., repeat)
occurrence of the advertisement, for example, A2. The descriptor elements 502a and 502b may
be included in the same MPD, for example, MPD 504. The descriptor elements 502a and 502b
may be included in different versions of a MPD. For example, the first descriptor element 502a
may be included in a first version 504a of the MPD 504. The second descriptor element 502b
may be included in a second version 504b of the MPD 504.
[0128] The descriptor elements 502 and 502b may include an advertisement identifier 514. The
first descriptor element 502a may include a first advertisement identifier 514a that may identify
the advertisement Al. The second descriptor element 502b may include a second advertisement
identifier 514b that may identify the advertisement A2. The first advertisement identifier 514a
and the second advertisement identifier 514b may refer to the same advertisement. The first
advertisement identifier 514a and the second advertisement identifier 514b may the same or
equivalent. As illustrated, the first advertisement identifier 514a and the second advertisement
identifier 514b refer to an advertisement with an Ad-ID of '01'.
[0129] A media playback client may erroneously determine that descriptor elements
corresponding with Al and A2 are equivalent, for example because the descriptor elements
include the same advertisement identifiers. The media playback client may erroneously
determine A2 to be a continuation of Al, for example because it may have determined that their
corresponding descriptor elements are equivalent. The media playback client may play A2
midway through and not from a beginning of the advertisement to which A2 refers. The media
14723013_1

                                                 - -)VJ
playback client may not display the progress bar correctly, for example, because it may have
erroneously determined that A2 is a continuation of Al. The media playback client may not
allow trick mode operations (e.g., fast forward, rewind, etc.) during the presentation of A2, for
example, because it may have erroneously determined that A2 is a continuation of Al.
[0130] A descriptor element 502 may indicate an occurrence(s) (e.g., a repeat occurrence) of
corresponding media content (e.g., advertisements). Indicating a repeat occurrence of a media
content may enable a media playback client to present the repeat occurrence of the media content
from a beginning of the media content. Indicating the repeat occurrence may prevent the media
playback client from erroneously playing the media content from midway. Indicating the repeat
occurrence may enable the media playback client to correctly display the progress bar. Indicating
the repeat occurrence may enable the media playback client to allow trick mode operations
during the presentation of the repeat occurrence. The media playback client may determine that
the repeat occurrence is not a continuation of a previous occurrence, for example, because of a
repeat occurrence indication in a descriptor element corresponding with the repeat occurrence.
[0131] A descriptor element 502 may comprise an occurrence identifier 516. The occurrence
identifier 516 may specify an occurrence of the advertisement. The occurrence identifier 516
may be included in a field or a subfield of a descriptor elements 502, for example an id field or a
value field. For example, a first occurrence identifier 516a may specify that Al is a first
occurrence of an advertisement (e.g., Ad-ID: 01) in the media stream 500. A second occurrence
identifier 516b may specify that A2 is a second (e.g., repeat) occurrence of the same
advertisement (e.g., Ad-ID: 01) in the media stream 500. As illustrated in the example of FIG. 5,
the first occurrence identifier 516a refers to an Occurrence-ID of '0 1', for example to specify
that Al is the first occurrence of an advertisement in the media stream 500. The second
occurrence identifier 516b refers to an Occurrence-ID of '02', for example to specify that A2 is a
second occurrence of the same advertisement in the media stream 500.
[0132] A media playback client (e.g., DASH client, client 250, and/or the like) may receive one
or more descriptor elements 502. The media playback client may determine that the first
descriptor element 502a and the second descriptor element 502 are different (e.g., not
equivalent), for example because the occurrence identifiers 516a and 516b are different. The
media playback client may determine that A2 is not a continuation of Al. The media playback
client may determine that A2 is a repeat occurrence of Al. The media playback client may
14723013_1

present (e.g., play) the repeat occurrence of the advertisement (e.g., A2) from a beginning of the
advertisement. The media playback client may correctly display the playback progress bar (e.g.,
scrub bar) during the playback of A2, for example because it has determined to play A2 from its
beginning. The media playback client may correctly process trick mode operations (e.g., fast
forward, reverse playback, or seek), for example because it has determined that A2 is not a
continuation of Al.
[0133] A network entity may modify one of the descriptor elements 502a and 502b, for example,
to ensure that a media playback client determines that the descriptor elements 502a and 502b are
different. The network entity may include a repetition indicia in the descriptor element that
corresponds with a repeat occurrence of an advertisement. The network entity may not include
the occurrence identifier 516a in the first descriptor element 502a, for example if the network
entity includes the repetition indicia in the second descriptor element 502b. The media playback
client may determine that A2 is not a continuation of Al, for example if the second descriptor
element 502b includes the repetition indicia even if the first descriptor element 502a may not
include the first occurrence identifier 516a. For example, the second descriptor element 502b
may include 'r' in an id field to indicate that A2 is a repeat occurrence and not a continuation of
Al. An example of the repetition indicia is the second content identifier 516b.
[0134] Tracking ad impressions may require reporting of playback of 25%, 50% and/or 75% of
the ad. In other words, tracking ad impressions may require callbacks synchronized to media
timeline. Ad impressions may be tracked by logging HTTP GET requests or through VAST.
[0135] While HTTP GET tracking may be efficient, HTTP GET tracking does not ensure that a
downloaded segment was ever scheduled to be played. Aggregating request logs from different
Content Delivery Nodes (CDN) and associating the request logs with a specific session may be
computationally expensive. Use of generic URL parameters may simplify the aggregation by
allowing a unique session identifier in the segment request. The session identifier may be
assigned when the MPD is fetched or at the beginning of a period.
[0136] Tracking ad impressions through VAST may be simpler than HTTP GET. However,
VAST may require a relatively complex non-DASH entity. VAST tracking may use the same
URLs included in the MPD and identifying sessions may require unique MPDs for each session.
14723013_1

[0137] While HTTP GET and VAST may enable the tracking of ad impressions to some extent,
it may not be possible to report information generated on the client side. Client-side reporting
may not be possible because HTTP GET and VAST may not allow sending information such as
client location (e.g., GPS coordinates), playout state (e.g., fast forward, rewind, etc.), face
detection results, social network information, etc.
[0138] An element may be added to a descriptor element (e.g., descriptor element 502), for
example, to report correct advertisement identifiers and/or have correct playback function under
media content repetition (e.g., under multiple occurrences of the same advertisement in a media
presentation, for example Al and A2 in media stream 500). The underlying media content
identifier (e.g., media content identifier 514, advertisement identifier 214a, etc.) may be the same
for identical media content (e.g., Al and A2). An occurrence identifier 516 (e.g., advertisement
placement string) may be included in one of the attributes of the descriptor element 502 and/or in
the payload of the descriptor element 502.
[0139] The occurrence identifier 516 may allow multiple occurrences of the same advertisement
to have different or non-equivalent descriptor elements 502a and 502b. The occurrence identifier
516 may be generated by a back-end device or network component (e.g., content provider 210).
The network component may provide or generate the descriptor elements 502a and 502b for
advertisement content Al and A2. For example, the descriptor elements 502a and 502b including
the occurrence identifiers 516 may be generated or provided by a content encoder, a content
packager, an HTTP server, an HTTP proxy, an origin server, a CDN node, or a similar
component. The descriptor elements 502a and 502b, which may include the occurrence
identifiers 516, may be returned by an XLink resolver in the process of returning advertisement
period elements to a video playback client.
[0140] The occurrence identifier 516 may be carried in an attribute of the descriptor elements
502a and 502b. For example, the occurrence identifier 516 may be carried in an id attribute, as
follows:
     <AssetIdentifier schemeldUri="um:org:dashif:ad-id:2013"
         value="md:cid:EIDR:10.5240%2fF592-58D1-A4D9-E968-5435-L"
         id="2905e3a2-deel-46a2-ac0b-98526e45a27b" />
14723013_1

[0141] A media stream may have multiple occurrences of an advertisement that may have the
same advertisement identifier (e.g., content identifier 514 or advertisement identifier 214a). Each
occurrence of an advertisement may have a different advertisement occurrence identifier (e.g.,
occurrence identifier 516) that may be stored in an id attribute. For example, the descriptor
elements 502a and 502b for the multiple occurrences of the same advertisement may not be
equivalent due to the different advertisement occurrence identifiers (e.g., occurrence identifiers
516a and 516b).
[0142] An advertisement occurrence identifier (e.g., occurrence identifier 516) may be carried in
a payload or a content area of the descriptor element. For example, it may be the string
"2905e3a2-deel-46a2-ac0b-98526e45a27b" (e.g., which may be a UUID), for example, as
shown in the following example:
    <AssetIdentifier schemeldUri="um:org:dashif:ad-id:2013"
        value="md:cid:EIDR:10.5240%2fF592-58D1-A4D9-E968-5435-L">
        2905e3a2-deel-46a2-ac0b-98526e45a27b
        </Assetldentifier>
[0143] An advertisement occurrence identifier (e.g., occurrence identifier 516) may be in the
form of a date and/or time field. For example, the date and/or time of the generation of the
descriptor elements 502a and 502b may be used. The expected playout date and/or time of the
advertisement may be used. The date and/or time may be carried in an attribute (e.g., date) of the
descriptor elements 502a and 502b. As shown in the following example, the date and/or time
may be carried in the payload or content of the descriptor element 502a and 502b.
    AssetIdentifier schemeldUri="urn:org:dashif: ad-id:2013"

[0144] A media stream (e.g., media stream 500) may have multiple occurrences of an
advertisement that may have the same advertisement identifier (e.g., media content identifier
514) for the advertisement. Each advertisement occurrence may have a different date and/or time
field (e.g., as carried in an attribute, or in the payload or content). The descriptor elements 502a
and 502b for the multiple occurrences of the same advertisement may not be equivalent due to
the different advertisement occurrence identifiers (e.g., occurrence identifiers 516a and 516b).
[0145] A system for inserting advertisements may include a first network component that may
generate a MPD for delivery to a media playback client (e.g., client 250). A second network
component may generate descriptor elements (e.g., descriptor elements 502a and 502b) that may
be inserted in the MPD (e.g., MPD 504). The second network component may take any of a
variety of forms, such as, for example, a packager, an encoder, an HTTP Server, an HTTP Proxy,
and/or the like. The second network component may insert the descriptor elements 502a and
502b in the MPD 504 before the MPD 504 may be delivered to the media playback client (e.g.,
client 250). The descriptor elements may be inserted in the MPD in response to a request, for
example to resolve the descriptor elements. The request may be made by the media playback
client (e.g., client 250), for example to an Xlink Resolver component.
[0146] A media playback client (e.g., client 250) may experience problems when presenting
dynamic or live content (e.g., a live sports broadcast). When dynamic content is presented the
MPD may be updated during the presentation. For example, the MPD may be updated
periodically. Updating the MPD during the presentation may lead to different versions of the
same MPD being valid at different times. Consequently, period elements that are present in a
particular MPD version may not be present in later MPD versions. For example, period elements
that are in version 1 of the MPD may not be in version 2.
[0147] As illustrated in FIG. 6, a MPD file 604 may include one or more versions. For example,
the MPD file 604 may include a first version 604a, a second version 604b, a third version 604c, a
fourth version 604d and a fifth version 604e. The MPD file 604 may be updated (e.g.,
periodically). A newer version of the MPD that is valid after the 30th minute mark may not
include period M1. For example, the third version 604c may not include period M1. A media
playback client may not be able to display that period M2 starts at the 15th minute mark. As
illustrated, period M4 may start at the 48th minute mark. The fifth version 604e of the MPD 604
may be valid when the period M4 is presented and all previous versions 604a, 604b, 604c and
14723013_1

604d of the MPD 604 may be invalid. Since the fifth version 604e of the MPD 604 may not
include periods M1 and M2, the playback progress bar may display incorrect information. For
example, the playback progress bar may show that period M4 started at the 2nd minute mark of
the content, whereas period M4 may actually have started at the 48th minute mark.
[0148] A media content time (e.g., an asset time) may be indicated, for example, as described
herein. The media content time may indicate a time at which the media content started. The
media content time may indicate a time at which the media content is expected to end. The media
content time may indicate a time duration of the media content. The media content time may be
indicated in a MPD, for example the MPD file 604. The media content time may be indicated in
a first version of the MPD, for example the first version 604a. The media content time may be
indicated by a last version of a MPD, for example fifth version 604e. The media content time
may be indicated by each version of a MPD, for example versions 604a-604e. The media content
time may be included in a descriptor element, for example an AssetIdentifier descriptor element,
a SupplementalProperty descriptor element, etc.
[0149] A media playback client may receive a MPD. The MPD may indicate a media content
time, for example a time at which the media content started. The media playback client may
determine a playback position of the media content based on the media content time. For
example, the media playback client may correctly determine that period M4 starts at the 48th
minute mark based on a media content start time included in the fifth version 604e. The media
playback client may correctly display that period M4 starts at the 48th minute mark even though
the current version of the MPD may not include previous periods.
[0150] A media playback client may preserve resources for a media content (e.g., each media
content). Media playback clients may be prone to excessive resource consumption. For example,
a 24/7 broadcast channel that shows drama may show different media content throughout the
day. Media playback clients may stay tuned and may maintain states for a media content even
after the media content has been presented. The amount of resources consumed by the media
playback client may continue increasing. Example states that a media playback client may
maintain include playout buffers, decoder memory, state variables, etc.
[0151] Indicating the last period of a media content may prevent, or at least reduce, excessive
resource consumption by a media playback client. At least one period (e.g., each period) of a
14723013_1

                                                    - -)V
media content may include indicia indicating the last period of the media content. As illustrated
in FIG. 7A, each period may indicated whether it is the last period of the media content. For
example, periods M1 and M2 may include a continuation indicia 704 that may indicate that the
media content continues with a subsequent period(s). Period M3 may include a last period
indicia 708 that may indicate that it is the last period. As shown in FIG. 7B, the last period M3
may include the last period indicia 708 that may indicate that it is the last period of the media
content. Other periods M1 and M2 may not include an indicia. As shown in FIG. 7C, the first
period M1 may include a period count indicia 712 that may indicate the total number of periods
in the media content. Other periods (e.g., each period) may include a counter 716 that may
indicate the number of periods remaining or the number of periods already presented. The indicia
704 or 708 may be inserted in a MPD (e.g., MPD 404, 504 or 604) by a network entity (e.g.,
content provider 210).
[0152] As illustrated in FIG. 8, a media playback client (e.g., client 250) may be configured for
one or more of the following. At 810, a media playback client may receive periods (e.g., periods
M1, M2 and M3). The media playback client may receive periods from a network entity, for
example the content provider 210. At 820, the media playback client may determine whether a
current period is the last period of a media content. The media playback client may determine
whether the current period is the last period by scanning the current period, for example for
indicia that indicates that the current period is the last period. For example, the media playback
client may scan for the last period indicia 708. The media playback client may determine that the
current period is the last period, e.g., if it finds the last period indicia 708 in the current period.
The media playback client may determine that a period is not the last period, for example by
identifying a continuation indicia 704 in the current period or by not finding the last period
indicia 708. The media playback client may determine the last period by counting the number of
periods received and identifying the last period, for example based on the period count indicia
712.
[0153] At 830, the media playback client may manage a playback resource (e.g., playback
buffer(s), decoder memory, state variable(s), etc.) based on the determination. Managing a
playback resource may include one or more of the following. At 832, the media playback client
may determine whether a current period is the last period of the media content. This
determination may be made as described above. At 834, the media playback client may stay
tuned and/or maintain a playback resource, e.g., if the current period is not the last period. For
14723013_1

example, the media playback client may continue maintaining a playback buffer(s) associated
with the media content, a portion of the decoder memory associated with the media content,
and/or a state variable(s) associated with the media content. The media playback client may
receive another period, at 836.
[0154] At 838, the media playback client may switch playback states, for example after playing
the last period of the media content. The media playback client may cease maintaining a
playback resource (e.g., playback buffer(s), decoder memory, or state variable(s), etc.). The
media playback client may purge a playback resource, for example after (e.g., immediately after)
playing the last period of the media content. The media playback client may purge a playback
buffer(s) associated with the media content. The media playback client may purge a memory
(e.g., a portion of the decoder memory) associated with the media content, for example after
(e.g., immediately after) the last period has been played. The media playback client may
determine the last period of the media content based on an indicia included in at least one of the
periods, for example the continuation indicia 704, the last period indicia 708 and/or the period
count indicia 712.
[0155] EIDR may be used as an identification for the media content. Ad-ID may be used for
cross-platform identification of advertising assets. A simpler, but less versatile, method of
integration, may involve defining two different asset (e.g., media content) identifier schemes.
One asset (e.g., media content) identifier scheme may be used for advertising content, e.g., Ad
ID. Another asset (e.g., media content) identifier scheme may be used for main content, e.g.,
EIDR. EIDR may be used for tracking and reporting, for example.
[0156] MPD events may be used to provide per-period annotation that may be used by the
application layer. VAST may be supported by multiple vendors' servers. A tracking module that
may use VAST tracking elements may allow easy integration. A VAST response, or part of a
VAST response, may be included in an MPD event.
[0157] In a server-based workflow, the XLink resolver may receive a response from the
advertising decision server that may include VAST tracking elements. These tracking elements
may include a URL for a resource that may be accessed using an HTTP GET request given a
specific event (e.g., the advertisement started playing, 25% of the advertisement was played out,
etc.). This resource may be, for example, a lxI transparent pixel image. The elements may be
14723013_1

wrapped into an MPD event within a period element in the XLink resolver response. When
dereferencing is finished, the DASH client may pass the tracking elements to an external VAST
processing module.
[0158] VAST may be integrated and used for tracking and reporting impressions. Certified
events may be more valuable to an advertiser relative to uncertified events. In order to
distinguish between certified and uncertified events, additional VAST events may be defined.
Fragment or query parameters may be appended to the tracking URLs.
[0159] In some cases, an uplink may be significantly more expensive than a downlink (e.g.,
DASH over electronic Mulimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS)). Multiple impression
reports may be aggregated. The same HTTP GET requests may be issued when they become
available. A combined report may be sent when uplink use is feasible. There may be an
interoperable way of sending a combined report.
[0160] The content of a descriptor element (e.g., AssetIdentifier descriptor element) may be used
for tracking and reporting purposes. Identification schemes such as Ad-ID may be used. The
content of the descriptor element may be used to provide information regarding the advertising
server response. The content of a descriptor element may be an Ad element that may be defined
in the VAST specification.
[0161] One or more generic descriptor elements at the period level or AdaptationSet level may
be used to indicate a position of a specific period (e.g., the last period) within a media content
(e.g., asset). The descriptor element(s) may indicate whether saving resources for the media
content is possible and/or useful. A descriptor element (e.g., supplemental property descriptor
element, for example SupplementalProperty) may indicate a time within the media content
corresponding to an earliest playout time of this period. The descriptor element may indicate an
expected length of the media content. The descriptor element may indicate whether more periods
from the media content are expected, for example, as shown in the following example.

           </Period>
[0162] A descriptor element (e.g., SupplementalProperty) may be used to indicate the last period
of a media content, for example, as described herein. A descriptor element (e.g.,
"um:org:example") may indicate that a current period is not the last period of a given media
content, e.g., "urn:org:example:to-be-continued". The descriptor element may indicate that other
periods may be expected. The descriptor element may indicate that the current period is the last
period of a given media content, for example by including "urn:org:example:end-of-asset". The
descriptor element may indicate that other periods are not expected for the media content.
[0163] The media playback client (e.g., MPEG-DASH client or client 250) may determine
whether the current period is the last period, e.g., by determining whether the current period
includes a SupplementalProperty descriptor element. For example, the media playback client
14723013_1

may determine that the current period is the last period by identifying an "end-of-asset"
descriptor in the current period. The media playback client may determine that the current period
is not the last period, e.g., when the current period does not include an "end-of-asset" descriptor.
[0164] A descriptor element may store one or more values that may indicate a time within a
media content at which the new period starts and/or the total expected length of the media
content. In the above example, the third period may include a SupplementaryProperty descriptor
("urn:org:example:asset-time") with a value field that indicates that the third period starts at time
00:20:00 (twenty minutes) within the media content. The value field may further indicate that
the total expected length of the media content is 00:42:42 (forty-two minutes and forty-two
seconds).
[0165] As shown in FIG. 9A, a media playback client may receive periods Ml, M2 and M3
associated with a media content (e.g., a movie). The media playback client may receive
advertisements Al and A2. The advertisements Al and A2 may include an advertisement
identifier 914 that may identify the advertisement. Advertisement identifiers 914a and 914b may
be the same, e.g., when advertisements Al and A2 are the same (e.g., identical). The
advertisements Al and A2 may include occurrence identifiers 916 that may indicate the
occurrence of the advertisement. The occurrence identifiers 916 may be included in a descriptor
element (e.g., SupplementalProperty). Advertisement Al may include a first occurrence
identifier 916a that may indicate that Al is the first occurrence of an advertisement that may be
referred to by ID#01. Advertisement A2 may include a second occurrence identifier 916b that
may indicate that A2 is the second occurrence of the advertisement that may be referred to by
ID#01.
[0166] A media playback client (e.g., client 250) may be configured for one or more of the
following. The media playback client may determine that A2 is a repeat of Al and not a
continuation of Al, for example, based on the occurrence identifiers 916a and 916b being
different. The media playback client may present (e.g., play) A2 from a beginning and not
midway. A repeat occurrence (e.g., only a repeat occurrence) of an advertisement may include an
occurrence identifier and an initial occurrence of the advertisement may not include the
occurrence identifier. For example, A2 (e.g., only A2) may include the occurrence identifier 916
and Al may not include the occurrence identifier 916.
14723013_1

                                                 - It I
[0167] As shown in FIG. 9B, the advertisements Al and A2 may include a playback pointer 918
that may indicate a time within the advertisements from where the media playback client may
play the advertisement. For example, '?t=Os' may indicate that the media playback client may
present the advertisement A2 from the beginning. The playback pointer 918 may be included in
a descriptor element (e.g., SupplementalProperty). The media playback client may receive the
advertisement A2. The media playback client may identify a playback pointer within the
advertisement A2 and/or play the advertisement A2 from the playback pointer 918. By including
a playback pointer 918 that points to the beginning of advertisement A2, the media playback
client may be enabled to play the advertisement A2 from the beginning and not midway. A
repeat occurrence (e.g., only a repeat occurrence) of an advertisement may include a playback
pointer and an initial occurrence of the advertisement may not include the playback pointer. For
example, A2 (e.g., only A2) may include the playback pointer 918 and Al may not include the
playback pointer 918.
[0168] The mechanism of MPD events may be used in conjunction with generalized URL
parameters to provide an extended native reporting framework. For example, a new event
scheme may be registered. In the event scheme, the payload may include a URL template. The
timing may indicate a time at which the video playback client may construct the URL and issue
an HTTP GET to the constructed URL. The video playback client may disregard the HTTP
response to the HTTP GET request. In addition to the default HTTP GET, it may be possible to
use HTTP PUT or HTTP POST, for example when the event carries the HTTP method that the
video playback client may use.
[0169] Use of generalized URL parameter may enable the use of new parameters computed at
the client side or assigned in real-time by the server. The client-side parameters may include
GPS coordinates, social network ID, information about the human viewers (e.g., number of
viewers, whether device is in a person's hand or at rest, emotional response, etc.). The client
side parameters may also include information about the device and connection (e.g., device
model). The server-assigned parameters may include user and session identification.
[0170] DASH events may be tied to a media timeline. However, the same model may be applied
for Quality of Service (QoS) or Quality of Experience (QoE) information when an extended
event model is defined for events happening in real-time during the playout. Event framework
may be extended to report data associated with recurring events, for example events that occur at
14723013_1

a certain frequency. For example, an event header or a payload may include a field describing
the frequency of the event and a limit on how many times the event may be invoked or the latest
time at which the event may be invoked.
[0171] The processes and instrumentalities described herein may apply in any combination, may
apply to other wireless technologies, and/or for other services.
[0172] A WTRU may refer to an identity of the physical device, or to the user's identity such as
subscription related identities, e.g., MSISDN, SIP URI, etc. WTRU may refer to application
based identities, e.g., user names that may be used per application.
[0173] The processes described above may be implemented in a computer program, software,
and/or firmware incorporated in a computer-readable medium for execution by a computer
and/or processor. Examples of computer-readable media include, but are not limited to,
electronic signals (transmitted over wired and/or wireless connections) and/or computer-readable
storage media. Examples of computer-readable storage media include, but are not limited to, a
read only memory (ROM), a random access memory (RAM), a register, cache memory,
semiconductor memory devices, magnetic media such as, but not limited to, internal hard disks
and removable disks, magneto-optical media, and/or optical media such as CD-ROM disks,
and/or digital versatile disks (DVDs). A processor in association with software may be used to
implement a radio frequency transceiver for use in a WTRU, UE, terminal, base station, RNC,
and/or any host computer.
