         Adipic acid is a raw material for pharmaceuticals, yeast purification, insecticides,
10 adhesives, synthesis leathers, synthesis dyes and fragrances. It is also used in the
   manufacture of plasticizers and lubricants, organic synthesis, fluxes, resins, plastics. It
   can be used for the production of various ester products, but also for the polyurethane
