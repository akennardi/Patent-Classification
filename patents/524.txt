                                                BACKGROUND
[0005]               Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune
condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which presents clinically as either ulcerative
                                                        -1

colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). CD is a chronic transmural inflammatory disease with
the potential to affect any part of the entire GI tract, and UC is a mucosal inflammation of the
colon. Both conditions are characterized clinically by frequent bowel motions, malnutrition,
and dehydration, with disruption in the activities of daily living. CD is frequently
complicated by the development of malabsorption, strictures, and fistulae and may require
repeated surgery. UC, less frequently, may be complicated by severe bloody diarrhea and
toxic megacolon, also requiring surgery. Both IBD conditions are associated with an
increased risk for malignancy of the GI tract. The etiology of IBD is complex, and many
aspects of the pathogenesis remain unclear.
[0006]              The treatment of moderate to severe IBD poses significant challenges to treating
physicians, because conventional therapy with corticosteroids and immunomodulator therapy
(e.g., azathioprine, 6 mercaptopurine, and methotrexate) is associated with side effects and
intolerance and has not shown proven benefit in maintenance therapy (steroids). Monoclonal
antibodies targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-c), such as infliximab (a chimeric
antibody) and adalimumab (a fully human antibody), are currently used in the management of
CD. Infliximab has also shown efficacy and has been approved for use in UC. However,
approximately 10%-20% of patients with CD are primary nonresponders to anti TNF therapy,
and another ~20%-30% of CD patients lose response over time (Schnitzler et al., Gut
58:492-500 (2009)). Other adverse events (AEs) associated with anti TNFs include elevated
rates of bacterial infection, including tuberculosis, and, more rarely, lymphoma and
demyelination (Chang et al., Nat Clin Pract Gastroenterol Hepatology 3:220 (2006);
Hoentjen et al., World J. Gastroenterol. 15(17):2067 (2009)). No currently available therapy
achieves sustained remission in more than 20%-30% of IBD patients with chronic disease
(Hanauer et al., Lancet 359:1541-49 (2002); Sandbom et al., N Engl J Med 353:1912-25
(2005)). In addition, most patients do not achieve sustained steroid-free remission and
mucosal healing, clinical outcomes that correlate with true disease modification. Therefore,
there is a need to develop more targeted therapy in IBD that is optimized for chronic use: an
improved safety profile with sustained remission, particularly steroid-free remission and
prevention of long-term complications in a greater proportion of patients, including those
patients who either never respond to an anti TNF therapeutic agent or lose response over
time.

[0007]              The integrins are alpha/beta heterodimeric cell surface glycoprotein receptors that
play a role in numerous cellular processes including leukocyte adhesion, signaling,
proliferation, and migration, as well as in gene regulation (Hynes, R. 0., Cell, 1992, 69:11
25; and Hemler, M. E., Annu. Rev. Immunol., 1990, 8:365-368). They are composed of two
heterodimeric, non-covalently interacting a and           P transmembrane    subunits that bind
specifically to distinct cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on endothelia, epithelia, and
extracellular matrix proteins. In this manner, integrins can function as tissue-specific cell
adhesion receptors aiding in the recruitment of leukocytes from blood into nearly all tissue
sites in a highly regulated manner, playing a role in the homing of leukocytes to normal
tissue and to sites of inflammation (von Andrian et al., N Engl J Med 343:1020-34 (2000)).
In the immune system, integrins are involved in leukocyte trafficking, adhesion and
infiltration during inflammatory processes (Nakajima, H. et al., J. Exp. Med., 1994,
 179:1145-1154). Differential expression of integrins regulates the adhesive properties of
cells and different integrins are involved in different inflammatory responses. (Butcher, E. C.
et al., Science, 1996, 272:60-66). The beta7 containing integrins (i.e., alpha4beta7 and
alphaEbeta7) are expressed primarily on monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils,
and macrophages but not on neutrophils (Elices, M. J. et al., Cell, 1990, 60:577-584).
 [0008]             The a4p 7 integrin is a leukocyte-homing receptor that is important in the
migration of cells to the intestinal mucosa and associated lymphoid tissues, such as Peyer's
patches in the small intestine, lymphoid follicles in the large intestine, and mesenteric lymph
nodes. In the gut, leukocyte rolling and firm adhesion to the mucosal endothelium is initiated
by signals from chemokines and is mediated via mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule
(MAdCAM)-l-associated sialyl Lewis X. Chemokine signaling induces the a4p7 integrin to
undergo a change from low to high MAdCAM-1 binding affinity. The leukocyte then arrests
and begins the process of extravasation through the vascular endothelium to underlying
tissue. This extravasation process is believed to occur in both the normal immune cell
recirculation state and in inflammatory conditions (von Andrian et al., supra). The numbers
of a4p7' cells in infiltrates and the expression of the ligand MAdCAM-1 are higher at sites
of chronic inflammation such as in the intestinal tract of patients with UC or CD
(Briskin et al., Am J Pathol 151:97-110 (1997); Souza et al., Gut 45:856-63 (1999)). a4p7
binds preferentially to high endothelial venules expressing MAdCAM-1 and vascular cell
adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, as well as to the extracellular matrix molecule fibronectin
                                                       -3

fragment CS-1 (Chan et al., J Biol Chem 267:8366-70 (1992); Ruegg et al., J Cell Biol
 17:179-89 (1992); Berlin et al., Cell 74:185-95 (1993)). Together with constitutively
expressed MAdCAM- 1 in gut mucosal vessels, the a4p 7 integrin plays a selective role in
leukocyte gut tropism but does not seem to contribute to homing of leukocytes to the
peripheral tissue or the CNS. Instead, peripheral lymphoid trafficking has been associated
with a4p 1 interaction with VCAM-1 (Yednock et al., Nature 356:63-6 (1992); Rice et al.,
Neurology 64:1336-42 (2005)).
[0009]              Another member of the P7 integrin family, expressed exclusively on
T lymphocytes and associated with mucosal tissues, is the cEf7 integrin, otherwise known as
CD 103. The cEf 7 integrin binds selectively to E-cadherin on epithelial cells and has been
proposed to play a role in the retention of T cells in the mucosal tissue in the intraepithelial
lymphocyte compartment (Cepek et al., J Immunol 150:3459-70 (1993); Karecla et al. Eur J
Immunol 25:852-6 (1995)). The cEf7* cells in the lamina propria have been reported to
exhibit cytotoxicity against stressed or infected epithelial cells (Hadley et al., J Immunol
 159:3748-56 (1997); Buri et al., J Pathol 206:178-85 (2005)). The expression of CE7 is
increased in CD (Elewaut et al., Acta Gastroenterol Belg 61:288-94 (1998); Oshitani et al.,
Int J Mol Med 12:715-9 (2003)), and anti-cEf7 antibody treatment has been reported to
attenuate experimental colitis in mice, implicating a role for CE 7 lymphocytes in
experimental models of IBD (Ludviksson et al., J Immunol 162:4975-82 (1999)).
[0010]              Administration of monoclonal antibodies against alphaE beta7 reportedly prevents
and ameliorates immunization induced colitis in IL-2 -- mice, suggesting that the onset and
maintenance of inflammatory bowel disease depends on colonic localization of lamina
propria CD4* lymphocytes expressing alphaEbeta7 (Ludviksson et al., J Immunol. 1999,
 162(8):4975-82). An anti-o4 antibody (natalizumab) reportedly has efficacy in treatment of
patients with CD (Sandbom et al., N Engl J Med 2005;353:1912-25) and an anti-c47
antibody (MLN-02, MLN0002, vedolizumab) reportedly is effective in patients with UC
(Feagan et al., N Engl J Med 2005;352:2499-507). These findings validate a4pf7 as a
therapeutic target and support the idea that the interaction between a4p 7 and MAdCAM- 1
mediates the pathogenesis of IBD. Thus, antagonists of beta7 integrin are of great potential
as a therapeutic agent in treating IBD.
[0011]              Humanized monoclonal antibodies targeted against the P7 integrin subunit have
been described previously. See, e.g., Intn'l Patent Pub. No. W02006/026759. One such
                                                     -4

antibody, rhuMAb Beta7 (etrolizumab) is derived from the rat anti-mouse/human
monoclonal antibody FIB504 (Andrew et al. 1994). It was engineered to include human
IgG1-heavy chain and KI-light chain frameworks. Intn'l Patent Pub. No. W02006/026759.
 [0012]             RhuMAb Beta7 binds a4f7 (Holzmann et al., Cell 56:37-46 (1989); Hu et al.,
Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89:8254-8 (1992)) and aEf7 (Cepek et al., J Immunol 150:3459
70 (1993)), which regulate trafficking and retention of lymphocyte subsets, respectively, in
the intestinal mucosa. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of an anti-a4 antibody
(natalizumab) for the treatment of CD (Sandborn et al., N Engl J Med 353:1912-25 (2005)),
and encouraging results have been reported for anti a4p7 antibody
(LDP02/MLN02/MLN0002/vedolizumab) in the treatment of UC (Feagan et al., N Engl J
Med 352:2499-507 (2005)). These findings help to validate a14P7 as a potential therapeutic
target and support the hypothesis that the interaction between a14P7 and mucosal addressin
cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM 1) contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD).
 [0013]             Unlike natalizumab, which binds a 4 and thus binds both a4p 1 and a4p7,
rhuMAb Beta7 binds specifically to the P37 subunit of a4p 7 and aE 7 and does not bind to
a 4 or P 1 integrin individual subunits. This was demonstrated by the inability of the antibody
to inhibit adhesion of a4p 1+ax4p7- Ramos cells to vascular cell adhesion molecule 1
(VCAM 1) at concentrations as high as 100 nM. Importantly, this characteristic of rhuMAb
Beta7 indicates selectivity: T cell subsets expressing a4 1 but not P7 should not be directly
affected by rhuMAb Beta7.
 [0014]             Support for the gut-specific effects of rhuMAb Beta7 on leukocyte homing comes
from several in vivo nonclinical studies. In severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice
reconstituted with CD45RBhighCD4+ T cells (an animal model of colitis), rhuMAb Beta7
blocked radiolabeled lymphocyte homing to the inflamed colon but did not block homing to
the spleen, a peripheral lymphoid organ. See, e.g., Intn'l Patent Pub. No. W02006/026759.
In addition, the rat-mouse chimeric anti-murine P7 (anti P 7, muFIB504) was unable to
reduce the histologic degree of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation or improve
disease survival in myelin basic protein T cell receptor (MBP-TCR) transgenic mice with
experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Id.
Furthermore, in two safety studies in cynomolgus monkeys, rhuMAb Beta7 induced a
moderate increase in peripheral blood lymphocyte numbers that was largely due to a marked
                                                        -5

(approximately three- to six-fold) increase in CD45RA               p7 high peripheral blood T cells, a
subset that is phenotypically similar to gut-homing memory/effector T cells in humans. See,
e.g., Intn'l Patent Pub. No. W02009/140684; Stefanich et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 162:1855
 1870 (2011). In contrast, rhuMAb Beta7 had minimal to no effect on the number of
CD45RA+p7intermediate peripheral blood T cells, a subset that is phenotypically similar to
naive T cells in humans, and no effect on the number of CD45RA p71' peripheral blood T
cells, a subset that is phenotypically similar to peripheral homing memory/effector T cells in
humans, confirming the specificity of rhuMAb Beta7 for the gut homing lymphocyte
subpopulation. Intn'l Patent Pub. No. W02009/140684; Stefanich et al., Br. J. Pharmacol.
 162:1855-1870 (2011).
 [0015]             To design therapies with a desired effect and/or efficacy, it is important to assess a
patient's responsiveness to treatment with a therapeutic agent, such as a beta7 integrin
antagonist. It is also important to determine optimal doses and dosing regimens of beta7
integrin antagonists that will provide or are likely to provide efficacy. Therefore, it is
desirable to develop a biomarker that can be used to accurately track or monitor the
responsiveness of a patient to treatment with a therapeutic agent. Such a biomarker would be
particularly useful for designing effective treatment and dosing regimens for human patients
in clinical trial studies and for disease treatment.
[0016]              The invention described herein meets certain of the above-described needs and
provides other benefits.
[0017]              All references cited herein, including patent applications and publications, are

[0018]              It is to be understood that if any prior art publication is referred to herein, such

                                                    SUMMARY
[0019]              The methods of the invention are based, at least in part, on the discovery that
receptor occupancy and cell surface expression of integrin beta7-subunit containing
receptors, including cE 7, on lymphocytes obtained from colon tissue of integrin beta7
antagonist (e.g., anti-beta7 antibody)-treated patients are capable of being assessed by flow
cytometry methods. In addition, surprisingly, anti-beta7 antibody serum concentrations that
were capable of saturating lymphocyte beta7 receptors in the periphery of treated patients
                                                         -6

were essentially the same as the anti-beta7 antibody serum concentrations that were capable
of saturating lymphocyte beta7 receptors at the site of disease (in the colon). Accordingly,
beta7 receptor occupancy in the peripheral blood is a surrogate indicator of beta7 receptor
occupancy in colonic tissue. Additionally, the methods of the invention are based, at least in
part, on the discovery that levels of gene expression of integrin receptor ligands, lymphocyte
genes, and cytokine genes, as well as the numbers of alphaE-positive cells in intestinal crypt
epithelium change after treatment with an integrin beta7 antagonist.
[0020]              In one aspect, methods of determining or monitoring the efficacy or of aiding in
determining or monitoring the efficacy of an integrin beta7 antagonist for treatment of a
gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder in a patient are provided. In certain embodiments, the
methods comprise comparing the amount of a biomarker in a sample obtained from the
patient after or during treatment with the antagonist, to an amount of the biomarker in a
sample obtained from the patient before the treatment, where a change in the amount of the
biomarker after or during the treatment, as compared to before the treatment, is indicative of
the efficacy of the antagonist for treatment of the gastrointestinal disorder in the patient, and
where the biomarker is integrin beta7 subunit-containing receptor occupancy by the
antagonist on colonic lymphocytes. In certain embodiments, the biomarker is selected from
gene expression levels of one or more integrin receptor ligands, gene expression levels of one
or more lymphocyte genes, gene expression levels of one or more cytokines, and the number
of alphaE-positive cells in intestinal crypt epithelium. In certain embodiments, combinations
of the above biomarkers are assessed. In certain embodiments, the afore-mentioned methods
using one or more of the biomarkers selected from integrin beta7 subunit-containing receptor
occupancy by the antagonist on colonic lymphocytes, gene expression levels of one or more
integrin receptor ligands, gene expression levels of one or more lymphocyte genes, gene
expression levels of one or more cytokines, and the number of alphaE-positive cells in
intestinal crypt epithelium are combined with one or more additional biomarkers of efficacy.
In certain embodiments, the one or more additional biomarkers of efficacy are one or more
clinical biomarkers selected from clinical remission at week 6, clinical remission at week 10,
clinical response at week 6, clinical response at week 10, endoscopy score and rectal bleeding
score of 0 at week 6, endoscopy and rectal bleeding score of 0 at week 10, and time to flare
of UC after achieving response or remission. In certain embodiments, the integrin beta7
subunit-containing receptor is aE 7 receptor or a4 7 receptor. In one embodiment, the
integrin beta7 subunit-containing receptor occupancy on colonic lymphocytes is determined

by measuring integrin beta7 subunit-containing receptor occupancy on peripheral blood
lymphocytes, where the integrin beta7 subunit-containing receptor occupancy on peripheral
blood lymphocytes was previously determined to be essentially the same as the integrin beta7
subunit-containing receptor occupancy on colonic lymphocytes. In certain embodiments, the
occupancy of the integrin beta7 subunit-containing receptor is determined by a method
comprising incubating the lymphocytes with labeled anti-beta7 antibody, where the labeled
anti-beta7 antibody binds to the same epitope as the integrin beta7 antagonist, washing the
lymphocytes, and measuring the percentage of labeled lymphocytes by flow cytometry. In
certain embodiments, the label is selected from fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC),
rhodamine, phycoerythrin (PE), allophycocyanin (APC), peridinin chlorophyll protein
(PerCP), PE-Cy7, APC-Cy7 and APC-H7. In one embodiment, the integrin beta7 antagonist
is etrolizumab and the labeled anti-beta7 antibody is etrolizumab or FIB504. In some
embodiments, the gene expression level of the integrin receptor ligand, MadCAM-1, is
measured. In some embodiments, the level of the integrin receptor ligand, E-Cadherin, is
measured. In some embodiments, the level of gene expression of one or more lymphocyte
genes selected from CD19, CD8, and CD3epsilon is measured. In some embodiments, the
level of gene expression of one or more cytokines selected from IL- 1, IL-6, IL-12-p4O, IL
17A, IL-17-F, IL-23A, IFNy and TNFc is measured. In certain embodiments, the level of
gene expression is measured in colonic biopsy tissue. In certain embodiments, the level of
gene expression is measured by qPCR. In certain embodiments, the change in the biomarker
is an increase or a decrease. In certain embodiments, the biomarker is measured within 100
days after receiving a first dose of the antagonist. In certain embodiments, the biomarker is
measured at day 43 and at day 71 after receiving a first dose of the antagonist or the
biomarker is measured at week 6 and at week 10 after receiving a first dose of the antagonist.
In one embodiment, the gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder is an inflammatory bowel
disease. Exemplary inflammatory bowel diseases include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
disease. In certain embodiments, the patient is human.
[0021]              In another aspect, methods of determining or monitoring the responsiveness or of
aiding in determining or monitoring the responsiveness of a patient having a gastrointestinal
inflammatory disorder to treatment with an integrin beta7 antagonist are provided. In certain
embodiments, the methods comprise comparing the amount of a biomarker in a sample
obtained from the patient after or during treatment with the antagonist, to the amount of the
biomarker in a sample obtained from the patient before the treatment, where a change in the

intestinal crypt epithelium are combined with one or more additional biomarkers of efficacy.
In certain embodiments, the one or more additional biomarkers of efficacy are one or more
clinical biomarkers selected from clinical remission at week 6, clinical remission at week 10,
clinical response at week 6, clinical response at week 10, endoscopy score and rectal bleeding
score of 0 at week 6, endoscopy and rectal bleeding score of 0 at week 10, and time to flare
of UC after achieving response or remission. In certain embodiments, the integrin beta7
subunit-containing receptor is aEf 7 receptor or A4P 7 receptor. In one embodiment, the

                                            DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0048]              Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same
meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention
belongs. Singleton et al., Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology 2nd ed., J.
Wiley & Sons (New York, N.Y. 1994), and March, Advanced Organic Chemistry Reactions,
Mechanisms and Structure 4th ed., John Wiley & Sons (New York, N.Y. 1992), provide one
skilled in the art with a general guide to many of the terms used in the present application.
             I.             Certain Definitions
[0049]              As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a,"
"an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus,
for example, reference to "a protein" includes a plurality of proteins; reference to "a cell"
includes mixtures of cells, and the like.
[0050]              In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where
the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word
''comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition
of further features in various embodiments of the invention.
[0051]              Ranges provided in the specification and appended claims include both end points
and all points between the end points. Thus, for example, a range of 2.0 to 3.0 includes 2.0,
3.0, and all points between 2.0 and 3.0.
[0052]              "Treatment" refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course
of the individual or cell being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during
the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing
occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or
indirect pathological consequences of the disease, decreasing the rate of disease progression,
amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis.
[0053]              "Treatment regimen" refers to a combination of dosage, frequency of
administration, or duration of treatment, with or without addition of a second medication.
[0054]              "Effective treatment regimen" refers to a treatment regimen that will offer
beneficial response to a patient receiving the treatment.
                                                       -22
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

[0055]              "Modifying a treatment" refers to changing the treatment regimen including,
changing dosage, frequency of administration, or duration of treatment, and/or addition of a
second medication.
[0056]              "Patient response" or "patient responsiveness" can be assessed using any endpoint
indicating a benefit to the patient, including, without limitation, (1) inhibition, to some extent,
of disease progression, including slowing down and complete arrest; (2) reduction in the
number of disease episodes and/or symptoms; (3) reduction in lesional size; (4) inhibition
(i.e., reduction, slowing down or complete stopping) of disease cell infiltration into adjacent
peripheral organs and/or tissues; (5) inhibition (i.e., reduction, slowing down or complete
stopping) of disease spread; (6) decrease of auto-immune, immune, or inflammatory
response, which may, but does not have to, result in the regression or ablation of the disease
lesion; (7) relief, to some extent, of one or more symptoms associated with the disorder; (8)
increase in the length of disease-free presentation following treatment; and/or (9) decreased
mortality at a given point of time following treatment. The term "responsiveness" refers to a
measurable response, including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR).
[0057]              By "complete response" or "CR" is intended the disappearance of all signs of
inflammation or remission in response to treatment. This does not always mean the disease
has been cured.
[0058]              "Partial response" or "PR" refers to a decrease of at least 50% in the severity of
inflammation, in response to treatment.
[0059]              A "beneficial response" of a patient to treatment with an integrin beta7 antagonist
and similar wording refers to the clinical or therapeutic benefit imparted to a patient at risk
for or suffering from a gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder from or as a result of the
treatment with the antagonist, such as an anti-beta7 integrin antibody. Such benefit includes
cellular or biological responses, a complete response, a partial response, a stable disease
(without progression or relapse), or a response with a later relapse of the patient from or as a
result of the treatment with the antagonist.
[0060]              "A patient maintains responsiveness to a treatment" when the patient'
responsiveness does not decrease with time during the course of a treatment.
[0061]              As used herein, "non-response" or "lack of response" or similar wording means
an absence of a complete response, a partial response, or a beneficial response to treatment
with an integrin beta7 antagonist.
                                                      -23
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

[0062]              The term "monitoring the efficacy of an integrin beta7 antagonist therapy" is used
to indicate that a sample is obtained at least once, including serially, from a patient before,
during, and/or after therapy with an integrin beta7 antagonist and that a biomarker selected
from integrin beta7 subunit-containing receptor occupancy by the antagonist on colonic
lymphocytes, gene expression levels of one or more integrin receptor ligands, gene
expression levels of one or more lymphocyte genes, gene expression levels of one or more
cytokines, and the number of alphaE-positive cells in intestinal crypt epithelium is measured
in such samples, and the results of before therapy, during therapy, and/or after therapy are
compared, to obtain an indication whether the therapy is efficacious or not. In the monitoring
of the efficacy of a therapy the level of a biomarker selected from integrin beta7 subunit
containing receptor occupancy by the antagonist on colonic lymphocytes, gene expression
levels of one or more integrin receptor ligands, gene expression levels of one or more
lymphocyte genes, gene expression levels of one or more cytokines, and the number of
alphaE-positive cells in intestinal crypt epithelium is measured and in one embodiment
compared to a reference value for the same biomarker, or, in a further embodiment, it is
compared to the level of the same biomarker in a sample obtained from the same patient at an
earlier point in time, either while the patient was under therapy or before start of the therapy.
In one embodiment, a decreased level or an increased level of one or more biomarkers
selected from integrin beta7 subunit-containing receptor occupancy by the antagonist on
colonic lymphocytes, gene expression levels of one or more integrin receptor ligands, gene
expression levels of one or more lymphocyte genes, gene expression levels of one or more
cytokines, and the number of alphaE-positive cells in intestinal crypt epithelium, a decreased
level or an increased level depending upon the particularly biomarker assessed as described
further herein, of a biomarker as compared to the level of the same biomarker in a sample
obtained from the same patient at an earlier point in time, either while the patient was already
under therapy or before start of the therapy indicates that the patient is responsive to the
therapy.
[0063]              The term "diagnosis" is used herein to refer to the identification or classification
of a molecular or pathological state, disease or condition. For example, "diagnosis" may
refer to identification of a particular type of gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder, and more
particularly, the classification of a particular sub-type of gastrointestinal inflammatory
disorder, by tissue/organ involvement (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or by other features
                                                     -24
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

(e.g., a patient subpopulation characterized by responsiveness to a treatment, such as to a
treatment with an integrin beta7 antagonist).
[0064]              The term "prognosis" is used herein to refer to the prediction of the likelihood of
disease symptoms, including, for example, recurrence, flaring, and drug resistance, of a
gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder.
[0065]              The term "sample" or "test sample", as used herein, refers to a composition that is
obtained or derived from a subject of interest that contains a cellular and/or other molecular
entity that is to be characterized and/or identified, for example based on physical,
biochemical, chemical and/or physiological characteristics. For example, the phrase "disease
sample" and variations thereof refers to any sample obtained from a subject of interest that
would be expected or is known to contain the cellular and/or molecular entity that is to be
characterized. The sample can be obtained from a tissue for the subject of interest or from
peripheral blood of the subject.
[0066]              A "reference sample," as used herein, refers to any sample, standard, or level that
is used for comparison purposes. In one embodiment, a reference sample is obtained from a
healthy and/or non-diseased part of the body (e.g., tissue or cells) of the same subject or
patient. In another embodiment, a reference sample is obtained from an untreated tissue
and/or cell of the body of the same subject or patient. In yet another embodiment, a reference
sample is obtained from a healthy and/or non-diseased part of the body (e.g., tissues or cells)
of an individual who is not the subject or patient. In even another embodiment, a reference
sample is obtained from an untreated tissue and/or cell part of the body of an individual who
is not the subject or patient.
[0067]              "A beta7 integrin antagonist" or "beta7 antagonist" refers to any molecule that
inhibits one or more biological activities or blocking binding of beta7 integrin with one or
more of its associated molecules. Antagonists of the invention can be used to modulate one
or more aspects of beta7 associated effects, including but not limited to association with
alpha4 integrin subunit, association with alphaE integrin subunit, binding of alpha4beta7
integrin to MAdCAM, VCAM- 1 or fibronectin and binding of alphaEbeta7 integrin to E
cadherin. These effects can be modulated by any biologically relevant mechanism, including
disruption of ligand binding to beta7 subunit or to the alpha4beta7 or alphaEbeta7 dimeric
integrin, and/or by disrupting association between the alpha and beta integrin subunits such
that formation of the dimeric integrin is inhibited. In one embodiment of the invention, the
beta7 antagonist is an anti-beta7 integrin antibody (or anti-beta7 antibody). In one
                                                      -25
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

embodiment, the anti-beta7 integrin antibody is a humanized anti-beta7 integrin antibody and
more particularly a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-beta7 antibody (or rhuMAb
beta7 also referred to as etrolizumab). In some embodiments, the anti-beta7 antibodies of the
present invention are anti-integrin beta7 antagonistic antibodies that inhibit or block the
binding of beta7 subunit with alpha4 integrin subunit, association with alphaE integrin
subunit, binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to MAdCAM, VCAM- 1 or fibronectin and binding
of alphaEbeta7 integrin to E-cadherin.
[0068]              By "beta7 subunit" or "P7 subunit" is meant the human Pf7 integrin subunit (Erle
et al., (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266:11009-11016). The beta7 subunit associates with alpha4
integrin subunit, such as the human .alpha.4 subunit (Kilger and Holzmann (1995) J. Mol.
Biol. 73:347-354). The alpha4beta7 integrin is reportedly expressed on a majority of mature
lymphocytes, as well as a small population of thymocytes, bone marrow cells and mast cells.
(Kilshaw and Murant (1991) Eur. J. Immunol. 21:2591-2597; Gurish et al., (1992) 149:
1964-1972; and Shaw, S. K. and Brenner, M. B. (1995) Semin. Immunol. 7:335). The beta7
subunit also associates with the alphaE subunit, such as the human alphaE integrin subunit
(Cepek, K. L, et al. (1993) J. Immunol. 150:3459). The alphaEbeta7 integrin is expressed on
intra-intestinal epithelial lymphocytes (iIELs) (Cepek, K. L. (1993) supra).
[0069]              By "alphaE subunit" or "alphaE integrin subunit" or "aE subunit" or "aE integrin
subunit" or "CD103" is meant an integrin subunit found to be associated with beta7 integrin
on intra-epithelial lymphocytes, which alphaEbeta7 integrin mediates binding of the iELs to
intestinal epithelium expressing E-cadherin (Cepek, K. L. et al. (1993) J. Immunol.
150:3459; Shaw, S. K. and Brenner, M. B. (1995) Semin. Immunol. 7:335).
[00701              "MAdCAM" or "MAdCAM-1" are used interchangeably in the context of the
present invention and refer to the protein mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1, which
is a single chain polypeptide comprising a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region and
an extracellular sequence composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains. The cDNAs for
murine, human and macaque MAdCAM-1 have been cloned (Briskin, et al., (1993) Nature,
363:461-464; Shyjan et al., (1996) J. Immunol. 156:2851-2857).
[00711              "VCAM-1" or "vascular cell adhesion molecule-i" "CD106" refers to a ligand of
alpha4beta7 and alpha4betal, expressed on activated endothelium and important in
endothelial-leukocyte interactions such as binding and transmigration of leukocytes during
inflammation.

[0072]              "CD45" refers to a protein of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs
are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including
cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP contains
an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment and two tandem intracytoplasmic
catalytic domains, and thus belongs to receptor type PTP. This gene is specifically expressed
in hematopoietic cells. This PTP has been shown to be an essential regulator of T- and B-cell
antigen receptor signaling. It functions through either direct interaction with components of
the antigen receptor complexes, or by activating various Src family kinases required for the
antigen receptor signaling. This PTP also suppresses JAK kinases, and thus functions as a
regulator of cytokine receptor signaling. Four alternatively spliced transcripts variants of this
gene, which encode distinct isoforms, have been reported. (Tchilian EZ, Beverley PC (2002).
"CD45 in memory and disease." Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. (Warsz.) 50 (2): 85-93. Ishikawa
H, Tsuyama N, Abroun S, et al. (2004). "Interleukin-6, CD45 and the src-kinases in
myeloma cell proliferation." Leuk. Lymphoma 44 (9):1477-81.
[0073]              Various isoforms of CD45 exist: CD45RA, CD45RB, CD45RC, CD45RAB,
CD45RAC, CD45RBC, CD45RO, CD45R (ABC). CD45 is also highly glycosylated. CD45R
is the longest protein and migrates at 200 kDa when isolated from T cells. B cells also
express CD45R with heavier glycosylation, bringing the molecular weight to 220 kDa, hence
the name B220; B cell isoform of 220 kDa. B220 expression is not restricted to B cells and
can also be expressed on activated T cells, on a subset of dendritic cells and other antigen
presenting cells. Stanton T, Boxall S, Bennett A, et al. (2004). "CD45 variant alleles:
possibly increased frequency of a novel exon 4 CD45 polymorphism in HIV seropositive
Ugandans." Immunogenetics 56 (2): 107-10.
[0074]              "Gut-homing lymphocytes" refer to a subgroup of lymphocytes having the
characteristic of selectively homing to intestinal lymph nodes and tissues but not homing to
peripheral lymph nodes and tissues. This subgroup of lymphocytes is characterized by an
unique expression pattern of a combination of multiples cell surface molecules, including, but
not limited to, the combination of CD4, CD45RA and Beta7. Typically, at least two subsets
of peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocytes can be subdivided based on the markers of CD45RA
and Beta7, CD45RA-                  P7 high, and CD45RA-17 " CD4+ cells. CD45RA-P7 high CD4+ cells
home preferentially to intestinal lymph nodes and tissues, whereas CD45RA- P7 lOW CD4+

 1997; Williams et al. 1998; Ros6 et al. 1998; Williams and Butcher 1997; Butcher et al.

 1999). Gut-homing lymphocytes are therefore a distinctive subgroup of lymphocytes
identified as CD45RA-               P7 high CD4+ in a flow cytometry assay.  The methods of identifying
this group of lymphocytes are well-known in the art and also disclosed in detail in Examples
of the present application.
 [0075]             As used herein with respect to a cell surface marker, the symbol      "+"  indicates a
positive expression of a cell surface marker. For instance, CD4+ lymphocytes are a group of
lymphocytes having CD4 expressed on their cell surfaces.
 [0076]             As used herein with respect to a cell surface marker, the symbol "-" indicates a
negative expression of a cell surface marker. For instance, CD45RA- lymphocytes are a
group of lymphocytes having no CD45RA expressed on their cell surfaces.
[0077]              As used herein with respect to the expression of a cell surface marker, the symbol
"low" indicates a relatively low level of expression of a cell surface marker on lymphocytes,
while "high" indicates a relatively high level of expression of a cell surface marker on
lymphocytes. In a flow cytometry, the intensity of P7 high is at least about 10 or 100 fold
higher than that of P 7 low. Thus, as provided herein in exemplary embodiments, the
CD45RA- P 71 w CD4 + and CD45RA-                    Pf7 high CD4 + lymphocytes locate in distinct portions
of a dot plot or histogram of a flow cytometry analysis where X-axis is the intensity of
expression of CD45AR and Y-axis is the intensity of the expression of Beta7.
 [0078]             "Peripheral-homing lymphocytes" refer to a subgroup of lymphocytes having the
characteristic of homing to peripheral lymph nodes and tissues and not homing to intestinal
lymph nodes and tissues. In an exemplary embodiment, as explained above, Peripheral
homing lymphocytes are a distinctive group of lymphocytes identified as CD45RA- P7 ow
CD4+ cells in a flow cytometry assay. The methods of identifying this group of
lymphocytes are known in the art and disclosed in detail in the present application.
[0079]              An "amount" or "level" of biomarker can be determined using methods known in
the art and disclosed herein, such as flow cytometry analysis.
[0080]              A "change in the amount or level of a biomarker" is as compared to a
reference/comparator amount of the biomarker. In certain embodiments, the change is
greater than about 10%, or greater than about 30%, or greater than about 50%, or greater than
about 100%, or greater than about 300% as a function of the value for the reference or
comparator amount. For example, a reference or comparator amount can be the amount of a
biomarker before treatment and more particularly, can be the baseline or pre-dose amount.

10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

[0081]              The phrase "essentially the same as" as used herein, denotes an insignificant
degree of change such that one of skill in the art would not consider the change to be of
statistical significance or a biologically meaningful change within the context of the
biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., the drug serum level needed to
saturate the drug target receptors). For example, serum drug concentrations needed to
saturate receptors that are less than about two fold different, or less than about three fold
different, or less than about four fold different from each other are considered essentially the
same.
[0082]              "Gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders" are a group of chronic disorders that
cause inflammation and/or ulceration in the mucous membrane. These disorders include, for
example, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, indeterminate
colitis and infectious colitis), mucositis (e.g., oral mucositis, gastrointestinal mucositis, nasal
mucositis and proctitis), necrotizing enterocolitis and esophagitis. In a preferred
embodiment, the gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder is a inflammatory bowel disease.
[0083]              "Inflammatory Bowel Disease" or "IBD" is used interchangeably herein to refer to
diseases of the bowel that cause inflammation and/or ulceration and includes without
limitation Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
[0084]              "Crohn's disease (CD)" or "ulcerative colitis (UC)" are chronic inflammatory
bowel diseases of unknown etiology. Crohn's disease, unlike ulcerative colitis, can affect any
part of the bowel. The most prominent feature Crohn's disease is the granular, reddish-purple
edematous thickening of the bowel wall. With the development of inflammation, these
granulomas often lose their circumscribed borders and integrate with the surrounding tissue.
Diarrhea and obstruction of the bowel are the predominant clinical features. As with
ulcerative colitis, the course of Crohn's disease may be continuous or relapsing, mild or
severe, but unlike ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease is not curable by resection of the
involved segment of bowel. Most patients with Crohn's disease require surgery at some
point, but subsequent relapse is common and continuous medical treatment is usual.
[0085]              Crohn's disease may involve any part of the alimentary tract from the mouth to the
anus, although typically it appears in the ileocolic, small-intestinal or colonic-anorectal
regions. Histopathologically, the disease manifests by discontinuous granulomatomas, crypt
abscesses, fissures and aphthous ulcers. The inflammatory infiltrate is mixed, consisting of
lymphocytes (both T and B cells), plasma cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. There is a
                                                     -29
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

disproportionate increase in 1gM- and IgG-secreting plasma cells, macrophages and
neutrophils.
[0086]              Anti-inflammatory drugs sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalisylic acid (5-ASA) are
useful for treating mildly active colonic Crohn's disease and are commonly prescribed to
maintain remission of the disease. Metroidazole and ciprofloxacin are similar in efficacy to
sulfasalazine and appear to be particularly useful for treating perianal disease. In more
severe cases, corticosteroids are effective in treating active exacerbations and can even
maintain remission. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine have also shown success in patients
who require chronic administration of corticosteroids. It is also possible that these drugs may
play a role in the long-term prophylaxis. Unfortunately, there can be a very long delay (up to
six months) before onset of action in some patients. Antidiarrheal drugs can also provide
symptomatic relief in some patients. Nutritional therapy or elemental diet can improve the
nutritional status of patients and induce symptomatic improvement of acute disease, but it
does not induce sustained clinical remissions. Antibiotics are used in treating secondary
small bowel bacterial overgrowth and in treatment of pyogenic complications.
[0087]              "Ulcerative colitis (UC)" afflicts the large intestine. The course of the disease
may be continuous or relapsing, mild or severe. The earliest lesion is an inflammatory
infiltration with abscess formation at the base of the crypts of Lieberkuhn. Coalescence of
these distended and ruptured crypts tends to separate the overlying mucosa from its blood
supply, leading to ulceration. Symptoms of the disease include cramping, lower abdominal
pain, rectal bleeding, and frequent, loose discharges consisting mainly of blood, pus and
mucus with scanty fecal particles. A total colectomy may be required for acute, severe or
chronic, unremitting ulcerative colitis.
[0088]              The clinical features of UC are highly variable, and the onset may be insidious or
abrupt, and may include diarrhea, tenesmus and relapsing rectal bleeding. With fulminant
involvement of the entire colon, toxic megacolon, a life-threatening emergency, may occur.
Extraintestinal manifestations include arthritis, pyoderma gangrenoum, uveitis, and erythema
nodosum.
[0089]              Treatment for UC includes sulfasalazine and related salicylate-containing drugs
for mild cases and corticosteroid drugs in severe cases. Topical administration of either
salicylates or corticosteroids is sometimes effective, particularly when the disease is limited
to the distal bowel, and is associated with decreased side effects compared with systemic use.
Supportive measures such as administration of iron and antidiarrheal agents are sometimes
                                                        -30
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

indicated. Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate are sometimes also prescribed
for use in refractory corticosteroid-dependent cases.
[0090]              An "effective dosage" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of
time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.
[0091]              As used herein, the term "patient" refers to any single animal, more preferably a
mammal (including such non-human animals as, for example, dogs, cats, horses, rabbits, zoo
animals, cows, pigs, sheep, and non-human primates) for which treatment is desired. Most
preferably, the patient herein is a human.
[0092]              The term "non-human subject" refers to any single non-human animal, more
preferably a mammal (including such non-human animals as, for example, dogs, cats, horses,
rabbits, zoo animals, cows, pigs, sheep, and non-human primates).
[0093]              The terms "antibody" and "immunoglobulin" are used interchangeably in the
broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies (for example, full length or intact
monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multivalent antibodies, multispecific
antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity)
and may also include certain antibody fragments (as described in greater detail herein). An
antibody can be human, humanized and/or affinity matured.
 [0094]             "Antibody fragments" comprise only a portion of an intact antibody, wherein the
portion preferably retains at least one, preferably most or all, of the functions normally
associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. In one embodiment, an
antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains
the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment, an antibody fragment, for example one
that comprises the Fc region, retains at least one of the biological functions normally
associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody, such as FcRn binding,
antibody half life modulation, ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment,
an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially
similar to an intact antibody. For example, such an antibody fragment may comprise on
antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the
fragment.
[0095]              The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained
from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies
comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that
may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed
                                                      -31
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

against a single antigen. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that
typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each
monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen.
[0096]              The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies in
which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to
corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a
particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or
homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or
belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so
long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; and Morrison
et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855 (1984)).
[0097]              "Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric
antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the
most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which
residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a
hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or
nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances,
framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by
corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise
residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These
modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized
antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains,
in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non
human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human
immunoglobulin lo sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least
a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human
immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986);
Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596
(1992). See also the following review articles and references cited therein: Vaswani and

[0098]              A "human antibody" is one which comprises an amino acid sequence
corresponding to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of
                                                    -32

the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. Such techniques include
screening human-derived combinatorial libraries, such as phage display libraries (see, e.g.,
Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991) and Hoogenboom et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 19:
4133-4137 (1991)); using human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for
the production of human monoclonal antibodies (see, e.g., Kozbor J Immunol., 133: 3001
(1984); Brodeur et al., MonoclonalAntibody Production Techniques and Applications,
pp. 55-93 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987); and Boerner et al., J. Immunol., 147: 86
(1991)); and generating monoclonal antibodies in transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are
capable of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous
immunoglobulin production (see, e.g., Jakobovits et al., Proc.Nati. Acad. Sci USA, 90: 2551
(1993); Jakobovits et al., Nature, 362: 255 (1993); Bruggermann et al.,Year in Immunol., 7:
33 (1993)). This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody
comprising antigen-binding residues from a non-human animal.
 [0099]             An "isolated" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or
recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its
natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses
for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or
nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to
greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most
preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues
of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to
homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue
or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant
cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present.
Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.
[00100]             The term "hypervariable region," "HVR," or "HV," when used herein refers to the
regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form
structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions; three in
the VH (HI, H2, H3), and three in the VL (LI, L2, L3). A number of hypervariable region
delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity
Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly
used (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health
Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). Chothia refers instead to the
                                                     -33

location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). The
AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia
structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software. The
"contact" hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal
structures. The residues from each of these HVRs are noted below.

[00101]             Hypervariable regions may comprise "extended hypervariable regions" as follows:
24-36 or 24-34 (LI), 46-56 or 49-56 or 50-56 or 52-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the VL and 26
35 (H1), 50-65 or 49-65 (H2) and 93-102, 94-102 or 95-102 (H3) in the VH. The variable
domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al., supra for each of these definitions.
[00102]             "Framework" or "FR" residues are those variable domain residues other than the
hypervariable region residues as herein defined.
[0100]               A "human consensus framework" is a framework which represents the most
commonly occurring amino acid residue in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH
framework sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH
sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of
sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment, for the VL, the subgroup is
subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment, for the VH, the subgroup is
subgroup III as in Kabat et al.
[0101]               An "affinity matured" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more
CDRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen,
compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). Preferred affinity
matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen.
Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al.
Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain
shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework residues is described by: Barbas
                                                      -34

[0102]                "Binding affinity" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent
interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding
partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, "binding affinity"
refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a
binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can
generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by
common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity
antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity
antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of
methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for
purposes of the present invention.
[0103]                The term "variable" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains
differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of
each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly
distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three
segments called hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable
domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework
regions (FRs). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four
FRs, largely adopting a -sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions,
which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the p-sheet structure. The
hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with
the hypervariable regions from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen
binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteins ofImmunological Interest,
5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)). The
constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit
various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
[0104]               Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments,
called "Fab" fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual "Fc" fragment,
                                                        -35
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab')2
fragment that has two antigen-binding sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.
[0105]               "Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen
recognition and antigen-binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy chain and
one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in this configuration
that the three hypervariable regions of each variable domain interact to define an antigen
binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six hypervariable regions
confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain
(or half of an Fv comprising only three hypervariable regions specific for an antigen) has the
ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.
 [0106]               The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the
first constant domain (CHI) of the heavy chain. Fab= fragments differ from Fab fragments
by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH 1 domain
including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation
herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear at least one free
thiol group. F(ab')2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments
which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments
are also known.
[01071               The "light chains" of antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to
one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa          (K) and lambda (X), based on the amino acid
sequences of their constant domains.
[01081               Depending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domains of their heavy
chains, antibodies (immunoglobulins) can be assigned to different classes. There are five
major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be
further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgGi, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAi, and IgA2. The
heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins
are called a, 6, 8, y, and p, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional
configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known and described
generally in, for example, Abbas et al. Cellular and Mol. Immunology, 4th ed. (W. B.
Saunders, Co., 2000). An antibody may be part of a larger fusion molecule, formed by
covalent or non-covalent association of the antibody with one or more other proteins or
peptides.

[0109]               The terms "full-length antibody," "intact antibody," and "whole antibody" are
used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, not
antibody fragments as defined below. The terms particularly refer to an antibody with heavy
chains that contain an Fc region.
[0110]               A "naked antibody" for the purposes herein is an antibody that is not conjugated
to a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.
[0111]               The term "Fc region" herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an
immunoglobulin heavy chain, including native sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions.
Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the
human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at
position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The C-terminal lysine
(residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for
example, during production or purification of the antibody, or by recombinantly engineering
the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly, a composition of
intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed,
antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations having a
mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.
[0112]               Unless indicated otherwise, herein the numbering of the residues in an
immunoglobulin heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteins
ofImmunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD (1991), expressly incorporated herein by reference. The "EU index as in
Kabat" refers to the residue numbering of the human IgGI EU antibody.
[0113]               A "functional Fc region" possesses an "effector function" of a native sequence Fc
region. Exemplary "effector functions" include Cl q binding; complement dependent
cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC);
phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g., B cell receptor; BCR), etc.
Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding
domain (e.g., an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays as
herein disclosed, for example.
[0114]               A "native sequence Fc region" comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the
amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Native sequence human Fc regions
include a native sequence human IgGI Fc region (non-A and A allotypes); native sequence
                                                      -37
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

human IgG2 Fc region; native sequence human IgG3 Fc region; and native sequence human
IgG4 Fc region as well as naturally occurring variants thereof.
[0115]               A "variant Fc region" comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that
of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification, preferably
one or more amino acid substitution(s). Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one
amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a
parent polypeptide, e.g., from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably
from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the
Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at
least about 80% homology with a native sequence Fc region and/or with an Fc region of a
parent polypeptide, and most preferably at least about 90% homology therewith, more
preferably at least about 95% homology therewith.
[0116]               Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy
chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different "classes." There are five major classes
of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further
divided into "subclasses" (isotypes), e.g., IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The
heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called
a, 6, c, y, and [t, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of
different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.
[01171               "Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity" and "ADCC" refer to a cell
mediated reaction in which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g.
Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a
target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. The primary cells for mediating
ADCC, NK cells, express FcyRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcyRI, FcyRII and
FcyRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells in summarized is Table 3 on page 464 of
Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a
molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Patent
No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or
additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a
animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS (USA) 95:652-656 (1998).
[0118]               "Human effector cells" are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and
perform effector functions. Preferably, the cells express at least FcyRIII and perform ADCC
                                                     -38
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and
neutrophils; with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated
from a native source thereof, e.g., from blood or PBMCs as described herein.
 [0119]               The terms "Fc receptor" or "FcR" are used to describe a receptor that binds to the
Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a
preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors
of the FcyRI, FcyRII, and FcyRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively
spliced forms of these receptors. FcyRII receptors include FcyRIIA (an "activating receptor")
and FcyRIIB (an "inhibiting receptor"), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ
primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcyRIIA contains an
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain.
Inhibiting receptor FcyRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif
(ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain (see review M. in Daeron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203
234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991);
Capel et al., Immunomethods 4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., J Lab. Clin. Med. 126:330
41 (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the
term "FcR" herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible
for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., J Immunol. 117:587 (1976) and
Kim et al., J Immunol. 24:249 (1994)), and regulates homeostasis of immunoglobulins.
Antibodies with improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), and increased half
lives, are described in WOOO/42072 (Presta, L.) and US2005/0014934A1 (Hinton et al.).
These antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which
improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. For example, the Fc region may have
substitutions at one or more of positions 238, 250, 256, 265, 272, 286, 303, 305, 307, 311,
312, 314, 317, 340, 356, 360, 362, 376, 378, 380, 382, 413, 424, 428 or 434 (EU numbering
of residues). The preferred Fc region-comprising antibody variant with improved FcRn
binding comprises amino acid substitutions at one, two or three of positions 307, 380 and 434
of the Fc region thereof (EU numbering of residues).
[0120]                "Single-chain Fv" or "scFv" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL
domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain.
Preferably, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL
domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a
                                                      -39

Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994). HER2
antibody scFv fragments are described in W093/16185; U.S. Patent No. 5,571,894; and U.S.
Patent No. 5,587,458.
[0121]               The term "diabodies" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen
binding sites, which fragments comprise a variable heavy domain (VH) connected to a
variable light domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH - VL). By using a linker that is
too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are
forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen
binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO
93/11161; and Hollinger et al., Proc.Nati. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993).
[0122]               An "affinity matured" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more
hypervariable regions thereof which result an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for
antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). Preferred
affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target
antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et
al. Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain
shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework residues is described by: Barbas
et al. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci, USA 91:3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al. Gene 169:147-155 (1995);

(1995); and Hawkins et al,J Mol. Biol. 226:889-896 (1992).
 [0123]              An "amino acid sequence variant" antibody herein is an antibody with an amino
acid sequence which differs from a main species antibody. Ordinarily, amino acid sequence
variants will possess at least about 70% homology with the main species antibody, and
preferably, they will be at least about 80%, more preferably at least about 90% homologous
with the main species antibody. The amino acid sequence variants possess substitutions,
deletions, and/or additions at certain positions within or adjacent to the amino acid sequence
of the main species antibody. Examples of amino acid sequence variants herein include an
acidic variant (e.g., deamidated antibody variant), a basic variant, an antibody with an amino
terminal leader extension (e.g. VHS-) on one or two light chains thereof, an antibody with a
C-terminal lysine residue on one or two heavy chains thereof, etc, and includes combinations
of variations to the amino acid sequences of heavy and/or light chains. The antibody variant
of particular interest herein is the antibody comprising an amino-terminal leader extension on
                                                      -40
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

one or two light chains thereof, optionally further comprising other amino acid sequence
and/or glycosylation differences relative to the main species antibody.
[0124]               A "glycosylation variant" antibody herein is an antibody with one or more
carbohydrate moieties attached thereto which differ from one or more carbohydrate moieties
attached to a main species antibody. Examples of glycosylation variants herein include
antibody with a GI or G2 oligosaccharide structure, instead a GO oligosaccharide structure,
attached to an Fc region thereof, antibody with one or two carbohydrate moieties attached to
one or two light chains thereof, antibody with no carbohydrate attached to one or two heavy
chains of the antibody, etc, and combinations of glycosylation alterations. Where the
antibody has an Fc region, an oligosaccharide structure may be attached to one or two heavy
chains of the antibody, e.g. at residue 299 (298, EU numbering of residues).
[0125]               The term "cytotoxic agent" as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or
prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to
include radioactive isotopes (e.g. At 2 11, 1131, 1125, Y 90, Re1 86, Re 88
                                                                            , SmI 5 3 , Bi 2 12, p 32 and
radioactive isotopes of Lu), chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as small molecule
toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including
fragments and/or variants thereof.
[01261               The term "cytokine" is a generic term for proteins released by one cell population
which act on another cell as intercellular mediators. Examples of such cytokines are
lymphokines, monokines, and traditional polypeptide hormones. Included among the
cytokines are growth hormone such as human growth hormone, N-methionyl human growth
hormone, and bovine growth hormone; parathyroid hormone; thyroxine; insulin; proinsulin;
relaxin; prorelaxin; glycoprotein hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH); hepatic growth factor;

proteins from natural sources or from recombinant cell culture and biologically active
equivalents of the native sequence cytokines.
[01271               The term "immunosuppressive agent" as used herein for adjunct therapy refers to
substances that act to suppress or mask the immune system of the subject being treated
herein. This would include substances that suppress cytokine production, down-regulate or
suppress self-antigen expression, or mask the MHC antigens. Examples of such agents
include 2-amino-6-aryl-5 -substituted pyrimidines (see U.S. Patent No. 4,665,077); non
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); ganciclovir; tacrolimus; glucocorticoids such as

(TGF-beta); streptodomase; RNA or DNA from the host; FK506; RS-61443; chlorambucil;
deoxyspergualin; rapamycin; T-cell receptor (Cohen et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,114,721); T-cell
receptor fragments (Offner et al., Science, 251: 430-432 (1991); WO 90/11294; laneway,

interfere with T cell helper signals, such as anti-CD40 receptor or anti-CD40 ligand (CD154),
including blocking antibodies to CD40-CD40 ligand.(e.g., Durie et al., Science, 261: 1328-30
(1993); Mohan et al., J. Immunol., 154: 1470-80 (1995)) and CTLA4-Ig (Finck et al.,
Science, 265: 1225-7 (1994)); and T-cell receptor antibodies (EP 340,109) such as T10B9.
[0128]               The term "ameliorates" or "amelioration" as used herein refers to a decrease,
reduction or elimination of a condition, disease, disorder, or phenotype, including an
abnormality or symptom.
[0129]               A "symptom" of a disease or disorder (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, e.g.,
ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) is any morbid phenomenon or departure from the
normal in structure, function, or sensation, experienced by a subject and indicative of disease.
[0130]               The expression "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount that is
effective for preventing, ameliorating, or treating a disease or disorder (e.g., inflammatory
bowel disease, e.g., ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease). For example, a "therapeutically
effective amount" of an antibody refers to an amount of the antibody that is effective for
preventing, ameliorating, or treating the specified disease or disorder. Similarly, a
"therapeutically effective amount" of a combination of an antibody and a second compound
refers to an amount of the antibody and an amount of the second compound that, in
combination, is effective for preventing, ameliorating, or treating the specified disease or
disorder.
[0131]               It is to be understood that the terminology "a combination of' two compounds
does not mean that the compounds have to be administered in admixture with each other.
Thus, treatment with or use of such a combination encompasses a mixture of the compounds
or separate administration of the compounds, and includes administration on the same day or
different days. Thus the terminology "combination" means two or more compounds are used
for the treatment, either individually or in admixture with each other. When an antibody and
a second compound, for example, are administered in combination to a subject, the antibody
is present in the subject at a time when the second compound is also present in the subject,
whether the antibody and second compound are administered individually or in admixture to
the subject. In certain embodiments, a compound other than the antibody is administered
prior to the antibody. In certain embodiments, a compound other than the antibody is
administered after the antibody.

[01321               For the purposes herein, "tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)" refers to a
human TNF-alpha molecule comprising the amino acid sequence as described in Pennica et
al., Nature, 312:721 (1984) or Aggarwal et al., JBC, 260:2345 (1985).
[0133]               A "TNF-alpha inhibitor" herein is an agent that inhibits, to some extent, a
biological function of TNF-alpha, generally through binding to TNF-alpha and neutralizing
its activity. Examples of TNF inhibitors specifically contemplated herein are etanercept
(ENBREL), infliximab (REMICADE), adalimumab (HUMIRA), golimumab
(SIMPONITM), and certolizumab pegol (CIMZIA).
[0134]               "Corticosteroid" refers to any one of several synthetic or naturally occurring
substances with the general chemical structure of steroids that mimic or augment the effects
of the naturally occurring corticosteroids. Examples of synthetic corticosteroids include
prednisone, prednisolone (including methylprednisolone), dexamethasone triamcinolone, and
betamethasone.
[0135]               An "antagonist" refers to a molecule capable of neutralizing, blocking, inhibiting,
abrogating, reducing or interfering with the activities of a particular or specified protein,
including its binding to one or more receptors in the case of a ligand or binding to one or
more ligands in case of a receptor. Antagonists include antibodies and antigen-binding
fragments thereof, proteins, peptides, glycoproteins, glycopeptides, glycolipids,
polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, nucleic acids, bioorganic molecules, peptidomimetics,
pharmacological agents and their metabolites, transcriptional and translation control
sequences, and the like. Antagonists also include small molecule inhibitors of the protein,
and fusion proteins, receptor molecules and derivatives which bind specifically to the protein
thereby sequestering its binding to its target, antagonist variants of the protein, antisense
molecules directed to the protein, RNA aptamers, and ribozymes against the protein.
[0136]                The term "detection" includes any means of detecting, including direct and
indirect detection.
[01371               A variety of additional terms are defined or otherwise characterized herein.
II.          COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS
             A.            Beta7 integrin Antagonists
[0138]                The present invention is directed to methods of predicting the responsiveness of a
patient to the treatment of beta7 integrin antagonists. Examples of potential antagonists
include an oligonucleotide that binds to the fusions of immunoglobulin with beta7 integrin,
                                                        -44
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

and, in particular, antibodies including, without limitation, poly- and monoclonal antibodies
and antibody fragments, single-chain antibodies, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and chimeric or
humanized versions of such antibodies or fragments, as well as human antibodies and
antibody fragments. Alternatively, a potential antagonist may be a closely related protein, for
example, a mutated form of the beta7 integrin that recognizes the ligand but imparts no
effect, thereby competitively inhibiting the action of the beta7 integrin.
[0139]               Another potential beta7 integrin antagonist is an antisense RNA or DNA
construct prepared using antisense technology, where, e.g., an antisense RNA or DNA
molecule acts to block directly the translation of mRNA by hybridizing to targeted mRNA
and preventing protein translation. Antisense technology can be used to control gene
expression through triple-helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA, both of which methods
are based on binding of a polynucleotide to DNA or RNA. For example, the 5' coding portion
of the polynucleotide sequence, which encodes the beta7 integrin herein, is used to design an
antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA
oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in
transcription (triple helix--see Lee et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 6:3073 (1979); Cooney et al.,
Science, 241: 456 (1988); Dervan et al., Science, 251:1360 (1991)), thereby preventing
transcription and the production of the beta7 integrin. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide
hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into beta7
integrin protein (antisense--Okano, Neurochem., 56:560 (1991); Oligodeoxynucleotides as
Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression (CRC Press: Boca Raton, Fla., 1988). The
oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA
or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of the PRO polypeptide. When
antisense DNA is used, oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from the translation-initiation site,
e.g., between about -10 and +10 positions of the target gene nucleotide sequence, are
preferred.
[0140]               Other potential antagonists include small molecules that bind to the active site,
the ligand or binding molecule binding site, thereby blocking the normal biological activity
of the beta7 integrin. Examples of small molecules include, but are not limited to, small
peptides or peptide-like molecules, preferably soluble peptides, and synthetic non-peptidyl
organic or inorganic compounds.
 [0141]              Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific
cleavage of RNA. Ribozymes act by sequence-specific hybridization to the complementary
                                                       -45

target RNA, followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within
a potential RNA target can-be identified by known techniques. For further details see, e.g.,
Rossi, Current Biology, 4:469-471 (1994), and PCT Publication No. WO 97/33551
(published Sep. 18, 1997).
 [0142]              Nucleic acid molecules in triple-helix formation used to inhibit transcription
should be single-stranded and composed of deoxynucleotides. The base composition of these
oligonucleotides is designed such that it promotes triple-helix formation via Hoogsteen base
pairing rules, which generally require sizeable stretches of purines or pyrimidines on one
strand of a duplex. For further details see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 97/33551. These
small molecules can be identified by any one or more of the screening assays discussed
hereinabove and/or by any other screening techniques well known for those skilled in the art.
 [0143]               Screening assays for antagonists are designed to identify compounds that bind or
complex with the beta7 integrin encoded by the genes identified herein, or otherwise interfere
with the interaction of the encoded polypeptides with other cellular proteins. Such screening
assays will include assays amenable to high-throughput screening of chemical libraries,
making them particularly suitable for identifying small molecule drug candidates.
 [0144]               The assays can be performed in a variety of formats, including protein-protein
binding assays, biochemical screening assays, immunoassays, and cell-based assays, which
are well characterized in the art.
             B.            Anti-Beta7 integrin Antibodies
 [0145]              In one embodiment, the beta7 integrin antagonists are anti-beta7 antibodies.
Exemplary antibodies include polyclonal, monoclonal, humanized, human, bispecific, and
heteroconjugate antibodies, etc., as described below.
             1.     Polyclonal Antibodies
 [0146]              Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous
(sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful
to conjugate the relevant antigen to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be
immunized, e.g., keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or
soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, for example,
maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N
hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCl 2 , or
RN=C=NR, where R and R' are different alkyl groups.
                                                       -46
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

[01471               Animals are immunized against the antigen, immunogenic conjugates, or
derivatives by combining, e.g., 100 [g or 5 [g of the protein or conjugate (for rabbits or
mice, respectively) with 3 volumes of Freund's complete adjuvant and injecting the solution
intradermally at multiple sites. One month later the animals are boosted with 1/5 to 1/10 the
original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvant by subcutaneous
injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later the animals are bled and the serum is
assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Preferably, the
animal is boosted with the conjugate of the same antigen, but conjugated to a different
protein and/or through a different cross-linking reagent. Conjugates also can be made in
recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also, aggregating agents such as alum are
suitably used to enhance the immune response.
              2.            Monoclonal Antibodies
[0148]               Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described
by Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods
(U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567).
[0149]               In the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a
hamster, is immunized as described above to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable
of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization.
Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. After immunization, lymphocytes
are isolated and then fused with a myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as
polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles
and Practice, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)).
[0150]                The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture
medium which medium preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or
survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells (also referred to as fusion partner). For
example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine
phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the selective culture medium for the
hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium),
which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.
[0151]               Preferred fusion partner myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support
stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are
sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. Preferred
                                                      -47
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and
MPC-1 1 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego,
Calif. USA, and SP-2 and derivatives e.g., X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human
heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal
antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); and Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody
Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).
[0152]               Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production
of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of
monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation
or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
[0153]               The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined
by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980). Once
hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity are
identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by
standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103
(Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D
MEM or RPMI- 1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as
ascites tumors in an animal e.g., by i.p. injection of the cells into mice. The monoclonal
antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites
fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example,
affinity chromatography (e.g., using protein A or protein G-Sepharose) or ion-exchange
chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, etc.
[0154]               DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using
conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding
specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The
hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be
placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells,
simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not
otherwise produce antibody protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the
recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA

10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

encoding the antibody include Skerra et al., Curr. Opinion in Immunol., 5:256-262 (1993)
and Pluckthun, Immunol. Revs. 130:151-188 (1992).
 [0155]              In a further embodiment, monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be
isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in
McCafferty et al., Nature, 348:552-554 (1990). Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991)
and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 (1991) describe the isolation of murine and
human antibodies, respectively, using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the
production of high affinity (nM range) human antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et al.,
Bio/Technology, 10:779-783 (1992)), as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo
recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries (Waterhouse et al.,
Nuc. Acids. Res. 21:2265-2266 (1993)). Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to
traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal
antibodies.
[0156]               The DNA that encodes the antibody may be modified to produce chimeric or
fusion antibody polypeptides, for example, by substituting human heavy chain and light chain
constant domain (CH and CL) sequences for the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Patent
No. 4,816,567; and Morrison, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851 (1984)), or by
fusing the immunoglobulin coding sequence with all or part of the coding sequence for a
non-immunoglobulin polypeptide (heterologous polypeptide). The non-immunoglobulin
polypeptide sequences can substitute for the constant domains of an antibody, or they are
substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody to create a
chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for an
antigen and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.
[01571               Exemplary anti-beta7 antibodies are Fib504, Fib 21, 22, 27, 30 (Tidswell, M. J
Immunol. 1997 Aug 1;159(3):1497-505) or humanized derivatives thereof. Humanized
antibodies of Fib504 was disclosed in detail in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20060093601
(issued as U.S. Patent No. 7,528,236), the content of which is incorporated by reference in its
entirety (also see discussion below).
              3.           Human and Humanized Antibodies
[0158]               The anti-beta7 integrin antibodies of the invention may further comprise
humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine)
antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such
                                                       -49
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

as Fv, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain
minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include
human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary
determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non
human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity,
affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human
immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies
may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the
imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise
substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or
substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin
and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus
sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an
immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin [Jones et
al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta,
Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596 (1992)].
[0159]               Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art.
Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from
a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as
"import" residues, which are typically taken from an "import" variable domain.
Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers
[Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature,        332:323-327 (1988);
Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)], by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR
sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such
"humanized" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567), wherein
substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the
corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are
typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are
substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. The choice of human
variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is
very important to reduce antigenicity and HAMA response (human anti-mouse antibody)
when the antibody is intended for human therapeutic use. According to the so-called "best
fit" method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the
                                                  -50
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human V domain sequence
which is closest to that of the rodent is identified and the human framework region (FR)
within it accepted for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., J. Immunol. 151:2296 (1993);
Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 196:901 (1987)). Another method uses a particular framework
region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup
of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized
antibodies (Carter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., J.
Immunol. 151:2623 (1993)). It is further important that antibodies be humanized with
retention of high binding affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties.
To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by
a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products
using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three
dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those
skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable
three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin
sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in
the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that
influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR
residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the
desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is
achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially
involved in influencing antigen binding.
[01601               Various forms of a humanized Anti-beta7 integrin antibody are contemplated.
For example, the humanized antibody may be an antibody fragment, such as a Fab, which is
optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent(s) in order to generate an
immunoconjugate. Alternatively, the humanized antibody may be an intact antibody, such as
an intact IgGI antibody.
[01611               Exemplary humanized anti-beta7 antibodies include, but are not limited to
rhuMAb Beta7, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the integrin subunit            Pf7
and was derived from the rat anti-mouse/human monoclonal antibody FIB504 (Andrew et al.,
 1994 J Immunol 1994;153:3847-61). It has been engineered to include human
immunoglobulin IgGI heavy chain and            KI light chain frameworks and is produced by
                                                    -51

Chinese hamster ovary cells. This antibody binds to two integrins, a14P7 (Holzmann et al.
 1989 Cell, 1989;56:37-46; Hu et al., 1992, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1992;89:8254-8) and
aEf 7 (Cepek et al., 1993 J Immunol 1993;150:3459-70), which regulate trafficking and
retention of lymphocyte subsets in the gastrointestinal tract and are involved in inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). rhuMAb
Beta7 is a potent in vitro blocker of the cellular interaction between a14P 7 and its ligands
(mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-i [MAdCAM]-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule
[VCAM]-1, and fibronectin) as well as the interaction between aIEf 7 and its ligand
(E-cadherin). rhuMAb Beta7 binds reversibly, with similar high affinity, to P7 on
lymphocytes from rabbits, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans. It also binds to mouse Pf7
with high affinity. The amino acid sequence and the make and use of rhuMAb Beta7 and its
variants are disclosed in detail in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20060093601
(issued as U.S. Patent No. 7,528,236), the content of which is incorporated in its entirety.
[0162]               FIGS. 1A and 1B depict alignment of sequences of the variable light and heavy
chains for the following: light chain human subgroup kappa I consensus sequence (FIG. 1A,
SEQ ID NO: 12), heavy chain human subgroup III consensus sequence (FIG. IB, SEQ ID

NO: 10), rat anti-mouse beta7 antibody (Fib504) variable heavy chain (FIG. IB, SEQ ID
NO: 11), and humanized antibody variants: Humanized hu504Kgraft variable light chain
(FIG. 1A, SEQ ID NO:14), humanized hu504K graft variable heavy chain (FIG. 1B, SEQ ID
NO: 15), variants hu504-5, hu504-16, and hu504-32 (amino acid variations from humanized
hu504K graft are indicated in FIG. 1A (light chain) (SEQ ID NOS:22-24, respectively, in
order of appearance) and FIG. 1B (heavy chain) for variants hu504-5, hu504-16, and 504-32
(SEQ ID NO:25).
             4.            Human Antibodies
[0163]               As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated. For
example, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon
immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of
endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the
homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (J.sub.H) gene in chimeric
and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production.
Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array into such germ-line mutant
                                                      -52
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g.,
Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., Nature,
362:255-258 (1993); Bruggemann et al., Year in Immuno. 7:33 (1993); U.S. Patent Nos.
5,545,806, 5,569,825, 5,591,669 (all of GenPharm); U.S. Patent No. 5,545,807; and WO
97/17852.
[0164]               Alternatively, phage display technology (McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552-553
[1990]) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from
immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors.
According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major
or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed
as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the
filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections
based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene
encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the
properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats, reviewed in,
e.g., Johnson, Kevin S. and Chiswell, David J., Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:564
571 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et
al., Nature, 352:624-628(1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a
small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice.
A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies
to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following
the techniques described by Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597 (1991), or Griffith et al.,
EMBO J. 12:725-734 (1993). See, also, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,565,332 and 5,573,905.
[0165]               As discussed above, human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro
activated B cells (see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,567,610 and 5,229,275).
             5.            Antibody Fragments
[0166]               In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments, rather
than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance, and may
lead to improved access to solid tumors.
[01671               Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody
fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact
antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods
                                                       -53
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

24:107-117 (1992) and Brennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments
can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example, the antibody
fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively,
Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form
F(ab')2 fragments (Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992)). According to another
approach, F(ab')2 fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture.
Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled
practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment
(scFv). See WO 93/16185; US Patent No. 5,571,894; and US Patent No. 5,587,458. The
antibody fragment may also be a "linear antibody," e.g., as described in US Patent
No. 5,641,870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or
bispecific.
              6.           Bispecific Antibodies
[0168]               Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two
different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of
beta7 integrin as described herein. Other such antibodies may combine a TAT binding site
with a binding site for another protein. Alternatively, an anti-Beta7 integrin arm may be
combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell
receptor molecule (e.g., CD3), or Fc receptors for IgG (Fc.y.R), such as Fc.yRI (CD64),
Fc.yRII (CD32) and Fc. y.RIII (CD16), so as to focus and localize cellular defense
mechanisms to the TAT-expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize
cytotoxic agents to cells which express TAT. These antibodies possess a TAT-binding arm
and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent (e.g., saporin, anti-interferon-.alpha., vinca
alkaloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten). Bispecific antibodies
can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., F(ab')2 bispecific
antibodies).
[0169]               Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional
production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two
immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different
specificities (Millstein et al., Nature 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random
assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas)
produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the
                                                       -54
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by
affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar
procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J. 10:3655-3659
(1991).
 [01701              According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired
binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin
constant domain sequences. Preferably, the fusion is with an Ig heavy chain constant
domain, comprising at least part of the hinge,         CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have
the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light chain
bonding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy
chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate
expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host cell. This provides for greater
flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in
embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction
provide the optimum yield of the desired bispecific antibody. It is, however, possible to
insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains into a single expression
vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high
yields or when the ratios have no significant affect on the yield of the desired chain
combination.
 [01711              In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are
composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one
arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding
specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the
separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain
combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the
bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in
WO 94/04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example,
Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology 121:210 (1986).
 [0172]              According to another approach described in U.S. Patent No. 5,731,168, the
interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage
of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface
comprises at least a part of the C.sub.H3 domain. In this method, one or more small amino
acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side
                                                      -55
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

chains (e.g., tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory "cavities" of identical or similar size to
the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by
replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g., alanine or threonine). This
provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end
products such as homodimers.
[01731               Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or "heteroconjugate" antibodies. For
example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to
biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to
unwanted cells (U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO
91/00360, WO 92/200373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using
any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the
art, and are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking
techniques.
[0174]               Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have
also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared
using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., Science 229:81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein
intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab').sub.2 fragments. These
fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent, sodium arsenite, to
stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab' fragments
generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives: One of the Fab'-TNB
derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab'-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is
mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab'-TNB derivative to form the bispecific
antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective
immobilization of enzymes.
[01751               Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab'-SH fragments from E.
coli, which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., J. Exp.
Med. 175: 217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody
F(ab')2 molecule. Each Fab' fragment was separately secreted from E. coli and subjected to
directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody
thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T
cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human
breast tumor targets. Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody
fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example,
                                                       -56
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., J. Immunol.
 148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were
linked to the Fab' portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody
homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to
form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of
antibody homodimers. The "diabody" technology described by Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making
bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a V.sub.H connected to a V.sub.L by
a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain.
Accordingly, the V.sub.H and V.sub.L domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the
complementary V.sub.L and V.sub.H domains of another fragment, thereby forming two
antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use
of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al., J. Immunol.,
 152:5368 (1994).
[0176]               Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example,
trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al., J. Immunol. 147:60 (1991).
             7.            Heteroconjugate Antibodies
[01771               Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention.
Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such
antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells
[U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980], and for treatment of HIV infection [WO 91/00360; WO
92/200373; EP 03089]. It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using
known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents.
For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by
forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include
iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed, for example, in U.S.
Patent No. 4,676,980.
             8.     Multivalent Antibodies
[0178]               A multivalent antibody may be internalized (and/or catabolized) faster than a
bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The
antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies (which are other than of the
IgM class) with three or more antigen binding sites (e.g., tetravalent antibodies), which can
                                                      -57
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide
chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and
three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises (or
consists of) an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario, the antibody will comprise an Fc
region and three or more antigen binding sites amino-terminal to the Fc region. The
preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises (or consists of) three to about eight, but
preferably four, antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one
polypeptide chain (and preferably two polypeptide chains), wherein the polypeptide chain(s)
comprise two or more variable domains. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may
comprise VD1-(X1).sub.n-VD2-(X2).sub.n-Fc, wherein VD1 is a first variable domain, VD2
is a second variable domain, Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region, X1 and X2
represent an amino acid or polypeptide, and n is 0 or 1. For instance, the polypeptide
chain(s) may comprise: VH-CH1-flexible linker-VH-CH1-Fc region chain; or VH-CH1-VH
CH1-Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least
two (and preferably four) light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent
antibody herein may, for instance, comprise from about two to about eight light chain
variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated
here comprise a light chain variable domain and, optionally, further comprise a CL domain.
              9. Effector Function Engineering
[01791               It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to
effector function, e.g., so as to enhance antigen-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC) and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of the antibody. This may be
achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody.
Alternatively or additionally, cysteine residue(s) may be introduced in the Fc region, thereby
allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus
generated may have improved internalization capability and/or increased complement
mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See Caron et al.,
J. Exp Med. 176:1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, B. J. Immunol. 148:2918-2922 (1992).
Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity may also be prepared using
heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al., Cancer Research 53:2560-2565
(1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may
thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al., Anti
                                                      -58
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

Cancer Drug Design 3:219-230 (1989). To increase the serum half life of the antibody, one
may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody (especially an antibody
fragment) as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,739,277, for example. As used herein, the term
"salvage receptor binding epitope" refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule
(e.g., IgGi, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life
of the IgG molecule.
              10. Immunoconjugates
[0180]                The antagonist or antibody used in the methods herein is optionally conjugated to
another agent, such as a cytotoxic agent, or cytokine.
[0181]                Conjugation will ordinarily be achieved through a covalent linkage, the precise
nature of which will be determined by the targeting molecule and the linking site on the
integrin beta7 antagonist or antibody polypeptide. Typically, a non-peptidic agent is
modified by the addition of a linker that allows conjugation to anti-beta7 integrin antibody
through its amino acid side chains, carbohydrate chains, or reactive groups introduced on
antibody by chemical modification. For example, a drug may be attached through the
.epsilon.-amino group of a lysine residue, through a free .alpha.-amino group, by disulfide
exchange to a cysteine residue, or by oxidation of the 1,2- diols in a carbohydrate chain with
periodic acid to allow attachment of drugs containing various nucleophiles through a Schiff
base linkage. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,256,833. Protein modifying agents include
amine-reactive reagents (e.g., reactive esters, isothiocyanates, aldehydes, and sulfonyl
halides), thiol-reactive reagents (e.g., haloacetyl derivatives and maleimides), and carboxylic
acid- and aldehyde-reactive reagents. Integrin beta7 antagonist or antibody polypeptides can
be covalently joined to peptidic agents through the use of bifunctional cross-linking reagents.
Heterobifunctional reagents are more commonly used and permit the controlled coupling of
two different proteins through the use of two different reactive moieties (e.g., amine-reactive
plus thiol, iodoacetamide, or maleimide). The use of such linking agents is well known in the
art. See, for example, Brinkley, supra, and U.S. Patent No. 4,671,958. Peptidic linkers can
also be employed. In the alternative, an anti-beta7 integrin antibody polypeptide can be
linked to a peptidic moiety through preparation of a fusion polypeptide.
[0182]               Examples of further bifunctional protein coupling agents include N-succinimidyl
3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane
1-carboxylate, iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl
                                                       -59
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as
glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis
diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates
(such as tolyene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro
2,4-dinitrobenzene).
              11.          Immunoliposomes
[01831               The anti-beta7 integrin antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as
immunoliposomes. A "liposome" is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids,
phospholipids and/or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug to a mammal. The
components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the
lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared
by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
82:3688 (1985); Hwang et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 77:4030 (1980); U.S. Patent Nos.
4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and W097/38731 published Oct. 23, 1997. Liposomes with
enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,013,556.
[0184]               Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation
method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG
derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of
defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter.
[0185]               Fab' fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the
liposomes as described in Martin et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257:286-288 (1982) via a disulfide
interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent is optionally contained within the liposome.
See Gabizon et al., J. National Cancer Inst. 81(19):1484 (1989).
              12.            Vectors, Host Cells and Recombinant Methods For Antibody Production
 [0186]              Also provided are isolated nucleic acids encoding the anti-beta7 antibodies or
polypeptide agents described herein, vectors and host cells comprising the nucleic acids and
recombinant techniques for the production of the antibodies.
[01871               For recombinant production of the antibody, the nucleic acid encoding it may be
isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA)
or for expression. In another embodiment, the antibody may be produced by homologous
recombination, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,204,244, specifically incorporated
herein by reference. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibody is readily isolated and
                                                        -60
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are
capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody).
Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to,
one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker
genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence, e.g., as
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,534,615 issued Jul. 9, 1996 and specifically incorporated
herein by reference.
[0188]                Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are the
prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells described above. Suitable prokaryotes for this
purpose include eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example,
Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia, e.g., E. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella,
Proteus, Salmonella, e.g., Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia, e.g., Serratia marcescans, and
Shigella, as well as Bacilli such as B. subtilis and B. licheniformis (e.g., B. licheniformis 41P
disclosed in DD 266,710 published 12 Apr. 1989), Pseudomonas such as P. aeruginosa, and
Streptomyces. One preferred E. coli cloning host is E. coli 294 (ATCC 31,446), although
other strains such as E. coli B, E. coli X1776 (ATCC 31,537), and E. coli W3 110 (ATCC
27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.
[0189]               In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or
yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for anti-beta7 integrin antibody-encoding
vectors. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or common baker's yeast, is the most commonly used
among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms. However, a number of other genera, species,
and strains are commonly available and useful herein, such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe;
Kluyveromyces hosts such as, e.g., K. lactis, K. fragilis (ATCC 12,424), K. bulgaricus
(ATCC 16,045), K. wickeramii (ATCC 24,178), K. waltii (ATCC 56,500), K. drosophilarum
(ATCC 36,906), K. thermotolerans, and K. marxianus; yarrowia (EP 402,226); Pichia
pastoris (EP 183,070); Candida; Trichoderma reesia (EP 244,234); Neurospora crassa;
Schwanniomyces such as Schwanniomyces occidentalis; and filamentous fungi such as, e.g.,
Neurospora, Penicillium, Tolypocladium, and Aspergillus hosts such as A. nidulans and A.
niger.
[0190]                Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated anti-Beta7 antibody are
derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect
cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host
cells from hosts such as Spodoptera frugiperda (caterpillar), Aedes aegypti (mosquito), Aedes
                                                         -61
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

albopictus (mosquito), Drosophila melanogaster (fruitfly), and Bombyx mori have been
identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available, e.g., the L-1
variant of Autographa californica NPV and the Bm-5 strain of Bombyx mori NPV, and such
viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention, particularly for
transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Plant cell cultures of cotton, corn, potato,
soybean, petunia, tomato, and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts.
[0191]               However, interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells, and propagation of
vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of
useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS
7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth
in suspension culture, Graham et al., J. Gen Virol. 36:59 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells
(BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR(CHO, Urlaub et al., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, Biol. Reprod. 23:243
251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells
(VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2);
canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL
 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065);
mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL5 1); TRI cells (Mather et al., Annals
N.Y. Acad. Sci. 383:44-68 (1982)); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep
G2).
[0192]               Host cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors
for anti-beta7 integrin antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media
modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the
genes encoding the desired sequences.
[0193]               The host cells used to produce the anti-beta7 integrin antibody of this invention
may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F1O
(Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's
Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In
addition, any of the media described in Ham et al., Meth. Enz. 58:44 (1979), Barnes et al.,
Anal. Biochem. 1 02:255 (1980), U.S. Patent Nos. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762;
4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; or U.S. Patent Re. 30,985 may be
used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as
necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or
                                                      -62
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and
phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine),
antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN.TM.drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic
compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or
an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at
appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture
conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell
selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.
[0194]               When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced
intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody
is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed
fragments, is removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al.,
Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992) describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are
secreted to the periplasmic space of E. coli. Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of
sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about
30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into
the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using
a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore
Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the
foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of
adventitious contaminants.
[0195]               The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for
example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity
chromatography, with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique.
The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any
immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify
antibodies that are based on human .gamma. 1, .gamma.2, or .gamma.4 heavy chains
(Lindmark et al., J. Immunol. Meth. 62:1-13 (1983)). Protein G is recommended for all
mouse isotypes and for human .gamma.3 (Guss et al., EMBO J. 5:15671575 (1986)). The
matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are
available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or
poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can
be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a C.sub.H3 domain, the Bakerbond
                                                    -63

ABX.TM.resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques
for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol
precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin
SEPHAROSE.TM. chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a
polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate
precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered. Following any
preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and
contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an
elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations
(e.g., from about 0-0.25 M salt).
              C.           Pharmaceutical Formulations
[0196]                Therapeutic formulations comprising the therapeutic agents, antagonists or
antibodies of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the
desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or
stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the
form of aqueous solutions, lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers,
excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations
employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, histidine and other organic acids;
antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as
octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium
chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as
methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low
molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum
albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone;
amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine;
monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or
dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or
sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein
complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN.TM., PLURONICS.TM. or
polyethylene glycol (PEG).
[01971               The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as
necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary
                                                     -64

activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in
combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.
[01981               The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared, for
example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example,
hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule,
respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin
microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions.
Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A.
Ed. (1980).
[0199]               The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is
readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.
 [0200]               Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained
release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers
containing the immunoglobulin of the invention, which matrices are in the form of shaped
articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include
polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or
poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Patent No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid
and .gamma. ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic
acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT.TM. (injectable microspheres
composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3
hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic
acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for
shorter time periods. When encapsulated immunoglobulins remain in the body for a long
time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 0 C., resulting in
a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can
be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the
aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S--S bond formation through thio
disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues,
lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives,
and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.

             D.             Treatment Methods
[0201]               The integrin beta7 antagonists, such as anti-beta7 antibodies of the invention (and
adjunct therapeutic agents) are administered by any suitable means, including parenteral,
subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local
treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular,
intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In addition, the
antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of the
antibody. Dosing can be by any suitable route, for example by injections, such as
intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is
brief or chronic.
[0202]               The therapeutic agents of the invention will be formulated and administered in a
fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context
include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical
condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent,
the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to
medical practitioners. The therapeutic agent need not be, but is optionally formulated with
one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question.
[0203]               The standard of care for subjects with active moderate-severe active UC involves
therapy with standard doses of: an aminosalicylate, an oral corticosteroid, 6-mercaptopurine
(6-MP) and/or azathioprine. Therapy with an integrin beta7 antagonist, such as an anti-beta7
integrin antibody as disclosed herein will result in an improvement in disease remission
(rapid control of disease and/or prolonged remission), and/or clinical response, superior to
that achieved with the standard of care for such subjects.
[0204]               In one embodiment, the treatment of the present invention for inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) in a human subject with IBD comprises administering to the subject an
effective amount of an therapeutic agent, such as an anti-beta7 integrin antibody, and further
comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a second medicament, that is
an immunosuppressant, a pain-control agent, an antidiarrheal agent, an antibiotic, or a
combination thereof.
[0205]               In an exemplary embodiment, said secondary medicine is selected from the group
consisting of an aminosalicylate, an oral corticosteroid, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and
azathioprine. In another exemplary embodiment, said secondary medicine is another integrin
                                                       -66
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

beta7 antagonist, such as another anti-beta7 integrin antibody or an antibody against a
cytokine.
 [0206]              All these second medicaments may be used in combination with each other or by
themselves with the first medicament, so that the expression "second medicament" as used
herein does not mean it is the only medicament besides the first medicament, respectively.
Thus, the second medicament need not be one medicament, but may constitute or comprise
more than one such drug.
[02071               These second medicaments as set forth herein are generally used in the same
dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the
heretofore-employed dosages. If such second medicaments are used at all, optionally, they
are used in lower amounts than if the first medicament were not present, especially in
subsequent dosings beyond the initial dosing with the first medicament, so as to eliminate or
reduce side effects caused thereby. For instance, therapy with a anti-beta7 integrin antibody
herein permits tapering or discontinued administration of steroid.
[02081               Combined administration herein includes co-administration, using separate
formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either
order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents
simultaneously exert their biological activities.
[0209]               The combined administration of a second medicament includes co-administration
(concurrent administration), using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical
formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time
period while both (or all) active agents (medicaments) simultaneously exert their biological
activities.
              E.             FACS Analysis
[0210]               Various lymphocyte populations are identified by the expression levels of a
combination of biomarkers, for example, but not limited to, CD4, CD45RA and Beta7, using
the techniques available in the art, for example, flow cytometry analysis (FACS), etc. The
subset population of lymphocytes with different expression patterns of these markers are
identified with the standard techniques used in the art, such as flow cytometry (FACS).
[0211]               Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) provides a method for sorting a
heterogeneous mixture of biological cells into two or more containers, one cell at a time,
based upon the specific light scattering and florescent characteristics of each cell. It is a
                                                       -67
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

useful scientific instrument as it provides fast, objective and quantitative recording of
fluorescent signals from individual cells as well as physical separation of cells of particular
interest. The cell suspension is entrained in the center of a narrow, rapidly flowing stream of
liquid. The flow is arranged so that there is a large separation between cells relative to their
diameter. A vibrating mechanism causes the stream of cells to break into individual droplets.
The system is adjusted so that there is a low probability of more than one cell being in a
droplet. Just before the stream breaks into droplets the flow passes through a fluorescence
measuring station where the fluorescent character of interest of each cell is measured. An
electrical charging ring is placed just at the point where the stream breaks into droplets. A
charge is placed on the ring based on the immediately prior fluorescence intensity
measurement and the opposite charge is trapped on the droplet as it breaks from the stream.
The charged droplets then fall through an electrostatic deflection system that diverts droplets
into containers based upon their charge. In some systems the charge is applied directly to the
stream and the droplet breaking off retains charge of the same sign as the stream. The stream
is then returned to neutral after the droplet breaks off.
[0212]               The data generated by flow-cytometers can be plotted in a single dimension to
produce a histogram, or in two dimensional dot plots or even in three dimensions. The
regions on these plots can be sequentially separated, based on fluorescence intensity, by
creating a series of subset extractions, termed "gates." Specific gating protocols exist for
diagnostic and clinical purposes. The plots are often made on logarithmic scales. Because
different fluorescent dyes' emission spectra overlap signals at the detectors have to be
compensated electronically as well as computationally. Often, data accumulated using the
flow cytometer can be re-analyzed elsewhere freeing up the machine for other people to use
(Loken MR. "Immunofluorescence Techniques in Flow Cytometry and Sorting": 341-53.
Wiley. (1990).
[0213]               The amount of various lymphocytes can be quantified in various ways in the art.
Absolute counts as percentage of baseline levels at predose can be calculated for lymphocyte
subsets at each time point in the samples collected from a patient. Also can be calculated are
the absolute counts for each respective subset of lymphocytes, which equal to the absolute
lymphocyte counts (a value obtained from hematology measurements expressed as
lymphocytes per microliter of peripheral blood) times the percentage of gated lymphocytes
for each subset (obtained from flow cytometry analysis).

             F.             Design Treatment Regimens
[0214]               Drug development is a complex and expensive process. The cost of bringing a
new drug to market is estimated to be $1 billion or more. Less than 10% of drugs in phase I
clinical trials make it to the approval phase. Two key reasons why drugs fail at late stages
are a lack of understanding of the relationship between dose-concentration response and
unanticipated safety events. Given this scenario, it is critical to have enabling tools that help
predict how a drug will perform in vivo and assist in the success of a clinical therapeutic
candidate (Lakshmi Kamath, Drug Discovery and Development; Modeling Success in PK/PD
Testing Drug Discovery & Development (2006)).
[0215]               Pharmacokinetics (PK) characterizes the absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and elimination properties of a drug. Pharmacodynamics (PD) defines the physiological and
biological response to the administered drug. PK/PD modeling establishes a mathematical
and theoretical link between these two processes and helps better predict drug action.
Integrated PK/PD modeling and computer-assisted trial design via simulation are being
incorporated into many drug development programs and are having a growing impact
(Lakshmi Kamath, Drug Discovery and Development; Modeling Success in PK/PD Testing
Drug Discovery & Development (2006)).
[0216]               PK/PD testing is typically performed at every stage of the drug development
process. Because development is becoming increasingly complex, time consuming, and cost
intensive, companies are looking to make better use of PK/PD data to eliminate flawed
candidates at the beginning and identify those with the best chance of clinical success.
(Lakshmi Kamath, supra).
[02171               PK/PD modeling approaches are proving useful in determining relationships
between biomarker response, drug levels, and dosing regimens. The PK/PD profile of a drug
candidate and the ability to predict a patient's response to it are critical to the success of
clinical trials. Recent advances in molecular biology techniques and a better understanding
of targets for various diseases have validated biomarkers as a good clinical indicator of a
drug's therapeutic efficacy. Biomarker assays help identify a biological response to a drug
candidate. Once a biomarker is clinically validated, trial simulations can be effectively
modeled. Biomarkers have the potential to achieve surrogate status that may someday
substitute for clinical outcomes in drug development. (Lakshmi Kamath, supra).

Examples.

    PHASE II RANDOMIZED DOUBLE-BLIND PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDY TO
 EVALUATE THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF rhuMAb BETA7 (ETROLIZUMAB) IN
                 PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE ULCERATIVE COLITIS
Description of the Clinical Study
Description of rhuMAb Beta7 (etrolizumab)
[0219]               RhuMAb Beta7 (etrolizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody based on the
human IgGI subgroup III VH,             K subgroup-I VL consensus sequences and is directed
specifically against the P37 subunit of the integrin heterodimer. See Figs. 1A and B. It has
been shown to bind with high affinity to a4p 7 (Kd of about 116 pM) and aEf 7 (K of about
1800 pM).
[0220]                This recombinant antibody has two heavy chains (446 residues) and two light
chains (214 residues) that are covalently linked by interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds
typical of IgGI antibodies. For the work described herein, it was produced in Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The molecular mass of the intact, nonglycosylated rhuMAb
Beta7 molecule was approximately 144 kDa. Each heavy chain of rhuMAb Beta7 has one
conserved N linked glycosylation site at Asn297. The oligosaccharides present at this site
were typical of those observed in recombinant antibodies expressed in CHO cells, with the
predominant glycoforms being the asialo, biantennary GO, and GI glycans. The mass of the
most prevalent rhuMAb Beta7 form containing two GO glycans and no C terminal lysine
residues was approximately 147 kDa.
[0221]               RhuMAb Beta7 drug product and placebo were prepared by Genentech. They
were clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow aqueous solutions. Both
solutions were sterile and preservative-free liquid intended for IV and SC administration.
Study Design
Description of the Study
[0222]               This Phase II study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety across two rhuMAb Beta7 dose levels
compared with placebo in patients with moderate to severe UC. The primary efficacy
endpoint was evaluated at Week 10 (2 weeks after the final dose of study drug was
administered) with a secondary efficacy endpoint at Week 6.
                                                      -70

[02231               Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio across a dose range of rhuMAb Beta7
 100 mg SC (flat dose) at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 (100 mg dose) and 420 mg SC (flat loading dose)
at Week 0 followed by 300 mg SC at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 (referred to herein as "300 mg +
LD," LD          =   loading dose) or matching placebo SC. The study schema is shown in Figure 2.
The study was divided into a screening period of 0-35 days, a double-blind treatment period
of 10 weeks, a safety follow-up period of 18 weeks, and a progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy (PML) follow up period of 17 months (2 years after randomization).
[0224]               The dose values provided in the preceding paragraph are nominal doses. The
phase II dose administration used a vial and a syringe with a vial concentration of 150 mg/ml.
In order to enable consistent accurate dose administration, 0.7 ml was the selected volume
per subcutaneous (SC) injection. The actual drug amount therefore, for the nominal 100 mg
dose arm was 105 mg (1 x 0.7 ml SC injection) and for the nominal 300 mg dose was 315 mg
(3 x 0.7 ml SC injections). The actual loading dose of 420 mg was 420 mg (4 x 0.7 ml SC
injections). All SC injections were administered into the abdomen. Accordingly, a dose of
"100 mg" and a dose of "105 mg" are used interchangeably herein. In addition, a dose of
"300 mg" and a dose of "315 mg" are used interchangeably herein.
[0225]               To be eligible, patients must have had a minimum of a 12-week duration of UC
diagnosed according to the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) practice
guidelines; that is, clinical and endoscopic evidence corroborated by a histopathology report,
with evidence of moderate to severe disease as evidenced by, in certain instances an MCS of
> 5, or in certain instances, an MCS of> 6, including an endoscopy subscore of                  2; a rectal
bleeding subscore of                1 (see Table 1); and endoscopic evidence of disease activity a
minimum of 25 cm from the anal verge. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria for this
study are provided in Intn'l Patent Pub. No. WO/2012/135589.

stable for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization on Day 1. Patients who were receiving
topical 5-ASA or corticosteroids must have discontinued 2 weeks before randomization on
Day 1. Oral corticosteroid doses must have been kept stable for 2 weeks prior to
randomization on Day 1. Patients receiving high-dose steroids must have had the dose
reduced to              20 mg/day for 2 weeks prior to randomization on Day 1. For patients receiving
oral corticosteroids during the study treatment period, tapering of steroids must have been
commenced at Week 10 at a rate of a 5-mg prednisone or prednisone equivalent per week for
2 weeks and then at a rate of 2.5 mg prednisone or prednisone equivalent per week to
discontinuation. For patients receiving oral immunosuppressants (other than oral
                                                        -72

corticosteroids), tapering of immunosuppressants must have been commenced at Week 8, and
patients must have completely discontinued immunosuppressants by Week 10. Patients who
have previously received anti-TNF therapy must have discontinued therapy for a minimum of
8 weeks prior to randomization to receive study drug on Day 1. If patients experienced
persisting or increasing disease activity at any time during the study, rescue therapy in the
form of an increase in steroids and or immunosuppressant dose may be increased or initiated
according to the investigator's clinical judgment. Patients who required rescue therapy were
permitted to remain in the study but discontinued study treatment and, during data analysis,
were classified as having experienced treatment failure.
[02271               Patients were assessed to determine whether they failed to respond to
conventional therapy, including at least one anti-TNF agent. As used herein, loss of response
and/or intolerance to anti-TNF agents and immunosuppressants means the following. With
respect to anti-TNF agents, loss of response and/or intolerance means that symptoms of
active disease persist despite previous treatment with one or more of (a) infliximab: 5 mg/kg
IV, 3 doses over 6 weeks with assessment at 8 weeks; (b) adalimumab: one 160-mg SC does
at week 0, followed by one 80-mg dose at week 2 and then 40 mg at 4 and 6 weeks, with
assessment at 8 weeks; or recurrent active symptoms during regularly scheduled maintenance
dosing following a previous response (elective discontinuation of treatment by patient who
has responded and did not lose response does not qualify); or history of intolerance to at least
one ant-TNF antibody (including but not exclusive of or limited to infusion-related reaction
or injection-site reaction, infection, congestive heart failure, demyelination). With respect to
immunosuppressant agents, loss of response and/or intolerance means that symptoms of
active disease persist despite previous treatment with one or more of azathioprine (> 1.5
mg/kg) or equivalent dose of 6-mercaptopurine mg/kg (> 0.75 mg/kg) or methotrexate, 25
mg SC/intramuscular (or as indicated) per week for at least 8 weeks; or history of intolerance
of at least one immunosuppressive (including, but not exclusive of pancreatitis, drug fever,
rash, nausea/vomiting, liver function test elevation, thiopurine S-methyltransferase genetic
mutation, infection).
[0228]               Randomization to study treatment were stratified by concomitant treatment with
corticosteroids (yes/no), concomitant treatment with immunosuppressants (yes/no), previous
anti-TNF exposure (yes/no) (except for patients randomized in the United States), and study
site.

[02291               UC disease activity was assessed using the MCS at Screening (and this was
considered the baseline MCS), Week 6 (2 weeks after dosing at Week 4), and Week 10 (2
weeks after the final dose of study drug). Biopsies of the colon were obtained during the
flexible sigmoidoscopy conducted at these same time points. Partial MCS was also collected
throughout the study. Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) were also assessed by using a
Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) and MCS, which were to be
completed by patients at Day 1 and at Weeks 6 and 10. In addition, disease activity, daily
symptoms, and impact of UC were collected in a patient diary, to be completed daily by
patients from screening (approximately 7 days prior to and up to Day 1) and at least 7 days
prior to and up to the study visits at Weeks 6 and 10. Serum and fecal samples were also
obtained for biomarker analysis. Stool was obtained at screening and Weeks 6, 10, and 28
for measurement of biomarkers. Exemplary biomarkers that were considered for
measurement include, but are not limited to, lipocalin, calprotectin, and lactorferrin. Serum
and plasma were obtained at screening, at Day 1, and at Weeks 4, 6, 10, 16, and 28 for
measurement of exploratory biomarkers.
[0230]               The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the proportion of patients who
achieved clinical remission, defined as an absolute reduction in MCS to            2 with no
individual subscore exceeding 1 point, by Week 10. Additional secondary endpoints are
listed in the study outcome measures as described below.
Outcome Measures
Primary Efficacy Outcome Measure
[0231]               The primary efficacy outcome measure was clinical remission at Week 10.
Clinical remission is defined by an MCS             2 with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point
(see Table 1).
Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measures
[0232]               The secondary efficacy outcome measures for this study were (1) Clinical
response at Week 6 and Week 10 where clinical response was defined by at least a 3-point
decrease and 30% reduction from baseline in MCS and a > 1-point decrease in rectal
bleeding subscore or absolute rectal bleeding score of 0 or 1; (2) Clinical remission (defined
above) at Week 6; and (3) An indicator for endoscopic score and rectal bleeding score of 0 at
Week 6 and Week 10.

10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

Exploratory Outcome Measures
[02331               The exploratory outcome measures for this study were the time to flare of UC in
patients who achieved response or remission. For this outcome measure, a flare is defined as
a 2 point increase in partial MCS accompanied by 3 days of continuous rectal bleeding and
an endoscopy score of 2 on flexible sigmoidoscopy.
Safety Outcome Measures
[0234]               The safety and tolerability of rhuMAb Beta7 were assessed using the following
measures: (1) Incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events graded according to
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE)
Version 4.0; (2) Clinically significant changes in vital signs and safety laboratory measures;
(3) Discontinuation due to adverse event(s); (4) Incidence and nature of injection-site
reactions and hypersensitivity; (5) Incidence of infectious complications; and (6)
Immunogenicity as measured by the incidence of ATAs.
Pharmacokinetic Assays
[0235]                Serum samples were obtained from all patients for determination and
characterization of the PK of rhuMAb Beta7. Serum PK samples were analyzed using a
validated bridging ELISA, with a minimum quantifiable concentration of 12.5 ng/mL. The
assay method has been described previously (see, e.g., Intn'l Patent Pub. No. WO
2012/135589). Briefly, a sandwich ELISA with a colorimetric detection system was
validated to quantify rhuMAb Beta7 (PRO 145223) in human serum. Microtiter plates were
coated with an anti-rhuMAb Beta7 antibody at 1.0 pg/mL to capture rhuMAb Beta7. Diluted
samples, standards, and controls were added to the plate and incubated. Subsequently,
biotinylated anti-rhuMAb Beta7 and streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
were added for detection and incubated. A peroxidase substrate (tetramethyl benzidine) was
added to develop color, and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 M phosphoric acid. The
plates were read at 450 nm for detection absorbance and at 620 or 630 nm for reference
absorbance.
Pharmacodynamic Assays
[0236]               To evaluate etrolizumab pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, two different assays,
each using an anti-beta7 antibody, were employed. The first assay, referred to herein as an
"occupancy assay" and shown schematically in Fig. 2A was performed essentially as
described previously (see, e.g., Intn'l Patent Pub. No. WO 2012/135589), with the exception
that a different competing anti-beta7 antibody, FIB504, (which binds to the same epitope as
                                                       -75

rhuMAb Beta7) was used instead of rhuMabBeta7. Briefly, peripheral blood samples from
each of the patients were collected at certain time points throughout the study. Samples were
collected in sodium heparin vacutainer tubes and shipped at room temperature overnight to
contract testing facility for assessment. Samples were aliquotted, lysed, washed and stained
with the fluorescently labeled anti-Beta7 antibody, FIB504 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA),
which does not bind to P7 integrin in the presence of etrolizumab. Antibodies to CD3, CD4,
CD45RA, CD19, CD38 and IgD were also added to identify the specific subsets of T and B
lymphocytes. Samples were then acquired by BD FACS Canto and analyzed by gating on
subsets of lymphocytes. The subsets are described further in Table 2 below.
Table 2. Subsets of lymphocytes.
                       Lymphocyte Subset                            Cell Surface Markers
T Helper lymphocytes                                      CD3+, CD4+
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes                                   CD3+, CD4
Naive T lymphocytes                                       CD45RA+, CD3+
Systemic (peripheral) homing T lymphocytes                CD45RA-, CD3+, beta7low
Mucosal (gut) homing T lymphocytes                        CD45RA-, CD3+, beta7high
Naive B lymphocytes                                       IgD+, CD19+
Systemic (peripheral) B homing lymphocytes                IgD-, CD19+, beta7low
Mucosal (gut) B homing lymphocytes                        IgD-, CD19+, beta7high
[0237]               T lymphocytes as described in Table 2 above were in certain experiments further
analyzed as CD4+ or CD4-.
 [0238]              Binding of fluorescently labeled FIB504 was evaluated at 2 separate pre-dose
time points (screen, and day 1 pre-dose) and at certain post dose time points throughout the
study. The absolute number of T and B cell subsets with unoccupied            P37 integrin was
assessed at each study time point and expressed as a percentage of the respective predose
baseline (%BL) or as change from baseline. Baseline was defined as the average of the
predose (screening and Day 1 predose) values. For each cohort, the mean absolute counts of
patients treated with etrolizumab or placebo was calculated.
 [0239]               The second assay, shown schematically in Fig. 2B and referred to herein as a
"cell surface beta7 integrin detection assay" or "expression assay" was designed to assess the
level of integrin beta7 present on the surface of lymphocytes before, during and/or after
treatment with etrolizumab or placebo. The expression assay is also a method for assessing
etrolizumab mechanism of action (MOA). This is because in the periphery, binding of
etrolizumab to integrin alpha4beta7 blocks interaction with the ligand MAdCAM- 1 and is
                                                      -76
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

thus hypothesized to block trafficking of gut homing lymphocytes to the gut resulting in a
concomitant rise in gut homing lymphocytes in the periphery. Indeed, this has been observed
and previously described in both pre-clinical and clinical studies. See, e.g, Intn'l Patent Pub.
No. 2009/140684 and Stefanich et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 162:1855-1870 (2011).
Accordingly, the assay is also referred to as an "MOA assay." In addition, binding of
etrolizumab to integrin alphaEbeta7 blocks interaction with the ligand E-cadherin and in the
gut is hypothesized to inhibit retention of lymphocytes in the gut. Etrolizumab-mediated
disruption of homing and retention of proinflammatory leukocytes within lymphoid tissue is
hypothesized to lead to decreased inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby down
modulating disease symptoms characteristic of IBD, including those associated with UC and
CD.
[0240]               The beta7 expression assay (MOA assay) has been described previously. See,
e.g., Intn'l Patent Pub. No. WO 2009/140684. Briefly, the number of P7 expressing T cells
was evaluated by flow cytometry. The assay was conducted similarly to the occupancy assay
as described above, with the exception of substitution of fluorescently conjugated anti-beta7
antibody known as 9D8, a non-competing anti-Beta7 antibody (i.e. capable of binding to          P37
integrin in the presence of etrolizumab) for fluorescently labeled FIB504. The absolute
number of T and B cell subsets with P7 integrin expressed on cell surface was assessed at
each study time point and expressed as a percentage of the cell subset pre-dose baseline
(%BL) or change from baseline.
[0241]               To evaluate the levels of P7 integrin expression on the surface of T and B
lymphocyte subsets, median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cell surface P7 expression was
assessed by flow cytometry and normalized to fluorescently labeled microbead standards of
known fluorophore concentrations. Molecules of Equivalent Soluble Fluorochrome (MESF)
of fluorescent 9D8 on cell surface of T and B cell subsets was evaluated at pre-dose and at
subsequent post-dose time points. The MESF of P7 integrin expressed on the surface of T
and B cell subsets was evaluated at each study time point and expressed as a percentage of
that subset's pre-dose baseline (%BL) or change from baseline.
Colonic Tissue Analysis
[0242]               Etrolizumab binds the P7 subunits of the heterodimeric integrins a4p7 and CEf7.
While a4p7 is expressed on leukocyte subsets in both blood and mucosal tissue, CEf7 is
primarily confined to intraepithelial lymphocytes and dendritic cells in mucosal tissue.
                                                       -77
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

Therefore, to evaluate the pharmacology and mechanism of action of etrolizumab at the site
of action as well as in circulation, colonic tissue was assessed in addition to peripheral blood.
Colonic tissue biopsies were collected using standard surgical procedures from 23 consented,
study-enrolled patients at pre-dose (screen) and at certain post dose time points (day 43 and
day 71). Sample tissues collected were processed on-site by washing whole biopsies in
sterile HBSS, reducing with HBSS+ 5mM DTT, then washing in culture medium and
digesting with collagenase VIII (1.5 mg/ml). Samples were then filtered through a 40 PM
nylon filter to remove tissue debris. Cell suspensions were washed with culture medium
prior to staining with fluorescently labeled antibodies (noted below) for evaluation by flow
cytometry.
 [0243]               Similar to the flow cytometry assay conducted on peripheral blood cells,
occupancy of P7 integrin receptors on colonic tissue T lymphocyte subsets was assessed by
staining with fluorescently labeled (PE label) FIB504, while expression of P7 integrin
receptors was evaluated using fluorescently labeled 9D8 (PE label). Antibodies to CD3
(APC label), CD4 (PerCP label), CD45RA (FITC label), aE integrin (CD103) and C4
integrin (CD49d) were also added to identify specific subsets of colonic tissue T
lymphocytes. Samples were then acquired on a BD FACS CantollTM or a BD
FACSCaliburTM (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA USA) and analyzed by gating on subsets of
cEf 7-expressing and a4f 7-expressing CD3+CD45+, cEf 7-expressing and a4 7-expressing
CD3+CD4+CD45+, and cE 7-expressing and a4 7-expressing CD3+CD4-CD45+ T cell
subsets. Percentages of cEf 7+ and a4f 7+ T cell subsets, as determined by FIB504 (to
detect un-occupied                  Pf7) or 9D8 (to detect total cell surface P37), were assessed at each sample
collection time point and expressed as a percentage of the cell subset pre-dose baseline
(%BL) or as change from baseline.
 [0244]               Changes in the levels of aE and P37 integrin expression on surface of T
lymphocyte subsets were also evaluated similar to blood (noted above). In brief, median
fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cell surface aE and                    P37 expression was assessed by flow
cytometry and normalized to fluorescently labeled microbead standards of known
fluorophore concentrations. Molecules of Equivalent Fluorescence (MOEF) of fluorescent
9D8 and anti-cE on the cell surface of T cell subsets were evaluated at pre-dose and at
subsequent post-dose time points. The MOEF of P7 integrin expressed on surface of T cell
                                                               -78
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

subsets was evaluated at each study time point and expressed as a percentage of the
respective cell subset pre-dose baseline (%BL).
Gene Expression Analysis by Quantitative Polymerase chain Reaction
[0245]               RNAlater@ biopsies were thawed and homogenized and ribonucleic acid (RNA)
was isolated using the RNeasy* Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. RNA integrity was assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
using the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Samples with low RNA quality (RNA integrity number <5) were excluded from the analysis
(n=9). RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary deoxyribonucleic acid using the
High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). Gene expression levels were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction,
also referred to as quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Real-time polymerase chain
reactions were run on the BioMarkTM HD System (Fluidigm Corporation, South San
Francisco, CA, USA) with TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix (Life Technologies Corporation,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reagents (Fluidigm) using human integrin aE (ITGAE), integrin a4
(ITGA 4), integrin               Pl (ITGB1), P7 integrin (ITGB7), interleukin (IL) 17A, IL23A, interferon y
(IFNG), IL1 7F, IL1B, IL12B, IL6, tumor necrosis factor a (TNFA), mucosal addressin cell
adhesion molecule-I (MADCAM1), E-cadherin(CDH1), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primer sets (all from Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. ITGAE, ITGA4, ITGB1, ITGB7, IL1 7A,
IL23A, IFNG, IL1 7F, IL1B, IL12B, IL6, TNFA, MADCAM],                      and CDH1 expression were
normalized to GAPDH expression using the ACt method.
Immunohistochemistry and Image Quantification
 [0246]              Formalin-fixed tissue samples were embedded in paraffin blocks and cut into 4
[M sections for staining. Staining was performed on a Benchmark XT (Ventana Medical
Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA) autostainer with anti-integrin aE antibody (EPR4166;
Abcam plc, Cambridge, MA, USA), developed with 3,3"-diaminobenzidine and
counterstained with hematoxylin.
 [02471              Whole slide images were acquired by the Olympus Nanozoomer automated slide
scanning platform (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Bridgewater, NJ, USA) at 200x final
magnification. Scanned slides were analyzed in the MATLAB* software package (version
R2012a; The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) as 24-bit RGB images. Total cells, aE*
cells, and aE* cells associated with crypt epithelium were counted. Crypt epithelial areas
                                                           -79

were identified using a combination of support vector machines and genetic programming,
within which individual cell nuclei were segmented, and then scored immunohistochemistry
positive if >25% of their total area colocalized with 3,3"-diaminobenzidine.
Results of PD Biomarker Assessments in Peripheral Blood
[0248]               To conduct PD biomarker assessments, we first determined parameters to
subdivide populations of lymphocytes as described in Table 2 and elsewhere above. Fig. 3A
shows the phenotypic subdivision of peripheral blood CD3+CD4+ T cells based on surface
expression of CD45RA and P7. CD3+CD4+ T cells were phenotypically subdivided
according to their homing properties into subsets of CD3*CD4*CD45RA Beta7high T cells
(mucosal-homing), CD4*CD45RA Beta7w T cells (peripheral homing), and CD4*CD45RA*
T cells (naive T cells that traffic well to both intestinal and peripheral lymph nodes and
tissues). Similar phenotypic subdivisions were also evaluated on total CD3+ and CD3+CD4
T cells (not shown). These phenotypic subdivisions are consistent with those reported
previously in the scientific literature. See, e.g., Rott et al., J. Immunol 156:3727-3736
(1996); Rott et al., J. Clin Invest 100:1204-1208 (1997); Williams et al., J. Immunol.
 161:4227-4235 (1998); Ros6 et al., J. Virol. 72:726-730 (1998); Williams et al., J. Immunol
 159:1746-1752 (1997); and Butcher et al., Adv. Immunol. 72:209-253 (1999). We also
subdivided populations B lymphocytes as shown in Fig. 3B. Here, phenotypic subdivision of
peripheral blood CD 19+ B cells was based on surface expression of IgD and         P37. CD 19+ B
cells were phenotypically subdivided according to their homing properties into subsets of
CD19*IgD-Beta7high B cells (mucosal-homing), CD19*IgD-Beta7low B cells (peripheral
homing), and CD19*IgD* B cells (naive B cells that traffic well to both intestinal and
peripheral lymph nodes and tissues). After having established the parameters for subdividing
populations of lymphocytes, we then proceeded to conduct PD biomarker assessments on
patient samples from the Phase II study of etrolizumab described above.
 [0249]              Using the occupancy assay, we examined occupancy of beta7 integrin on
peripheral blood T and B lymphocytes pre-dose and post-dose with etrolizumab or placebo
according to the clinical study design described above. Fig. 4A shows the cohort mean
( SD) occupancy of P7 Integrin on CD3*CD4*CD45RA Beta7high T lymphocytes expressed
as a percentage of baseline following subcutaneous (SC) administration of 100mg or
300mg+loading dose (LD) etrolizumab or placebo. Fig. 4B shows the cohort mean ( SD)
occupancy of P7 Integrin on CD3*-            CD45RA Beta7high T lymphocytes expressed as a
                                                    -80
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

percentage of baseline following SC administration of 100mg or 300mg+LD etrolizumab or
placebo. And Fig. 4C shows the cohort mean ( SD) occupancy of P7 Integrin on CD19*
IgD-Beta7high B lymphocytes expressed as a percentage of baseline following SC
administration of 100mg or 300mg+LD etrolizumab or placebo. Taken together, these data
show that the mean absolute numbers of subsets of mucosal homing phenotype T cells
(CD3+ CD4+ CD45RA- P 7 high and CD3+ CD4- CD45RA- P7 high and mucosal homing
phenotype B cells (CD19+ IgD- b7high) decreased in all study cohorts following the once
every 4 weeks (Q4W) administration of 100 mg or 300 mg+LD of etrolizumab, indicating
occupancy of etrolizumab on the target cells. There was no apparent          P37 occupancy  in
patients treated with placebo. In addition, etrolizumab given at the lower 100mg Q4W dose
was sufficient to maintain maximal/near maximal occupancy of P7 receptors during the entire
dosing phase.
[0250]               Next, using the expression assay, we evaluated the numbers of beta7 expressing T
and B lymphocytes circulating in the peripheral blood. The results are shown in Figs. 5A
(gut homing CD3+ CD4+ T cells), 5B (gut homing CD3+ CD4- T cells) and 5C (gut homing
CD19+ B cells). As can be seen, the median absolute numbers of subsets of peripheral blood
T cells (CD3+CD4*CD45RA-p 7 high and CD3+ CD4- CD45RA- b7high "mucosal" homing
phenotypes) and B cells (CD19+ IgD- b7high 'mucosal' homing phenotype) increased in all
study cohorts following the administration 100mg Q4W or 300mg+LD of etrolizumab,
indicating that etrolizumab bound the target cells. There was no substantial increase in
patients treated with placebo. When evaluating %baseline, the difference between
etrolizumab vs. placebo for the mucosal-homing CD4+ and CD19+ cell subsets was
statistically significant on days 29, 43, and 71 (p < 0.05, Kruskal Wallis ANOVA).
Moreover, we observed that the elevation of mucosal homing T and B cell subsets in
peripheral blood was similar in the 100mg Q4W compared to the 300mg+LD cohorts; there
was no statistical difference between the 300 mg + LD and 100 mg dose groups for the
CD4+, CD4-, and CD19+ subsets with the exception of CD19+ mucosal homing B cells (p <
0.03 on day 5, Kruskal Wallis ANOVA). We also observed similar elevations of the subsets
described above in TNF-IR and TNF-naive patients (data not shown) and when the data was
plotted as absolute counts %BL rather than absolute counts change from baseline (data not
shown). Together, these data suggest that the maximal increase may have been reached at
the lower 100mg Q4W dose.

Results of PD Biomarker Assessments in Colonic Tissue
[0251]               We first established parameters for assessing aEf7 expression on T lymphocytes
obtained from colonic biopsy samples. Representative results are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6
shows, in a pre-dose sample, the phenotypic subdivision of colonic tissue CD45+CD3+CD4
T lymphocytes based on cell surface expression of aE and P7 (upper right quadrant, boxed
section of plot). Similar phenotypic subdivision was also conducted on colonic tissue
CD45+CD3+ and CD45+CD3+CD4+ T lymphocyte populations and similar results were
observed (not shown), indicating that we could observe cE 7 expression in all lymphocyte
subsets.
[0252]               We next assessed occupancy ofcE7 receptors on CD45+CD3+CD4- T
lymphocytes obtained from colonic biopsies taken from a representative patient treated with
etrolizumab a single dose of etrolizumab, 100 mg, or from a representative patient treated
with placebo. For each treatment arm, samples were obtained at pre-dose, at day 43 and at
day 71. The results are shown in Fig. 7. Compared to predose levels, there was an
observable decrease in the percentages of cEf 7+ cells at days 43 and 71 after treatment with
etrolizumab (left-hand set of panels), confirming maximal receptor occupancy and consistent
with the results described above. No such decrease was observed in the cells from the
placebo-treated patient (right-hand set of panels) and consistent with the results described
above. These data demonstrate that etrolizumab was present in the gut at the disease site
where it remained bound to            Pf7 receptors for the duration of this study, 71 days. We believe
this is the first demonstration ofcE7 receptor occupancy on T cells in colonic tissue.
[0253]               In addition to the single patient analyses described above, we also assessed both
 cE 7 occupancy and a4 7 occupancy in CD45+ CD3+ CD4- T lymphocytes obtained from
colonic biopsies from each of 23 patients from the clinical study. Seven patients received
 100 mg etrolizumab, seven patients received 300 mg + LD etrolizumab, and nine patients
received placebo according to the administration schedule described above. The FACS plots
of cohort medians at screen (pre-dose), at day 43 and at day 71 are shown in Figs. 8A
(occupancy of cE 7) and 8B (occupancy of a4 7). In each of Figs. 8A and 8B, the
percentages of receptor positive T cells decreased in all patients following administration of
either 100 mg etrolizumab q4w or 300 mg q4w + LD but there was no such decrease in
placebo-treated patients. In addition, each of cEf7 and a4f7 were maximally occupied, or
nearly so, at both dose levels and at both time points examined after etrolizumab
                                                        -82

administration. We observed no apparent difference in occupancy in TNF-IR compared to
TNF-naive patients (data not shown). Accordingly, target engagement by etrolizumab in
colonic tissue was confirmed.
Additional PD Biomarker Assessments
[0254]               As discussed above, etrolizumab maximally occupied P7 receptors on CD4* 7* T
lymphocytes at both the 100 mg and the 300 mg + LD doses, with a corresponding specific
increase in CD4* 7* T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Similar results were observed
with CD19 P7* B lymphocytes. In the colonic mucosa, maximal occupancy of P7 receptors
also was observed at both doses. However, there was no difference in the overall relative
frequencies of P7 expressing CD4- T cells observed in etrolizumab-treated patients compared
with placebo.
[0255]               We also assessed the expression of integrins  P37 (Fig. 9A), P 1 (Fig. 9B), C4 (Fig.
9C) and aE (Fig. 9D) in colonic mucosa by qPCR. As shown in Fig. 9A, there was no
apparent change in P7 gene expression observed by qPCR between etrolizumab-treated
patients and placebo nor was there a change in expression between those etrolizumab-treated
patients who achieved clinical remission compared to those who did not. Figs. 9B-9D show
that there were minimal to no changes in P 1-, a 4 -, and cE-integrin expression in colonic
biopsy post etrolizumab in remitters.
[0256]               On further assessment of the intestinal lymphocyte compartments, a decrease in
the percentage of aE* cells in the intestinal crypt epithelium was observed in etrolizumab
treated patients compared with placebo (Figs. 10A-B), with no apparent decrease in aE* cells
in the lamina propria (Figs. 11 A-B). In addition, the number of epithelial cell-associated aE*
cells were reduced (Fig. 12A), and expression of E-cadherin was increased (Fig. 12B), in
biopsies from etrolizumab-treated patients who achieved clinical remission compared with
those who did not. An analysis of MAdCAM- 1 expression, lymphocyte gene expression and
inflammatory cytokine gene expression revealed reduced expression of the genes indicated in
Fig. 13 in biopsies from etrolizumab-treated patients who achieved clinical remission
compared with those who did not (Figs. 13A-M).
[02571               We interpret these results of the additional PD biomarker assessments as follows.
Consistent with the role of P7 receptors in mediating lymphocyte trafficking to the intestine,
there was a corresponding increased frequency of p7-expressing lymphocytes in the
peripheral blood but not in the colonic mucosa. Although maximal P7 occupancy was
observed for a minimum of 10 weeks in all etrolizumab-treated patients, clinical benefit was
                                                        -83
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

not observed in all patients, suggesting that the inflammatory process continues in some
patients despite blockade of the P7 receptor. This could be explained by proinflammatory
activity of immune cells already resident in the gut or p7-independent mechanisms of
leukocyte trafficking to the intestinal mucosa. In support of this, in contrast to etrolizumab
treated patients who achieved clinical remission, no decrease was observed in lymphocyte
gene expression in those who did not achieve clinical remission. Further understanding of
alternative mechanisms of inflammation will require exploration in patients undergoing long
term therapy with etrolizumab.
[0258]               While mucosal proinflammatory cytokine expression decreased in etrolizumab
treated patients who achieved clinical remission, expression of E-cadherin increased. E
cadherin has been shown to be expressed at lower levels in patients with inflammatory bowel
disease compared with healthy controls (Arijs et al., Am J Gastroenterol 106:748-61 (2011)),
suggesting that the observed increase in E-cadherin is related to mucosal healing in these
patients. This observation is supported by the improvement in histologic disease activity
score in patients who received etrolizumab.
Dose and Dose Regimen Rationale
[0259]               The rationale for the dosing regimen tested in the Phase II study was established
following the Phase I study and was based on PK analysis of Phase I patient samples and
population PK modeling as previously described. See, e.g., Intn'l Patent Pub. No. WO
2012/135589. Here, we wished to refine that analysis based on data obtained from patients in
the Phase II study, particularly with respect to beta7 occupancy in colonic tissue.
[0260]               Two of the patients in the study received only a single dose of etrolizumab and
had provided colonic biopsy samples at predose and at certain time points following the dose
as described further below. These patients are shown in Fig. 8C (dotted lines). When we
analyzed receptor occupancy in colonic tissue as described above, we found that one of the
two patients showed occupancy on day 43 but that occupancy was lost at day 71. In this
patient, the serum drug levels were 4.7 pg/ml on day 43 and 0.5 pg/ml on day 71. In the
second patient, we were unable to analyze occupancy on day 43 as sample was not available,
but as for the first patient, the receptors were unoccupied on day 71. The serum drug level in
this patient was below the limit of detection on day 71.
[0261]               This result led us to compare the serum concentrations of etrolizumab in each of
the 23 patients from whom colonic biopsies had been obtained to the level of beta7
occupancy on T cells obtained from those colonic biopsies at day 43 and at day 71. Those
                                                       -84
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

results are shown in Fig. 14. Occupancy of beta7 receptors on colonic tissue lymphocytes
was observed in all patients whose serum etrolizumab concentration was 1.7 pg/ml or higher.
The two patients who received only a single dose of etrolizumab and whose receptors were
not occupied on day 71 had serum concentrations lower than 1 pg/ml. For each patient
showing occupancy in colonic tissue, there was corresponding occupancy in the blood. Thus,
we compared the relationship between serum drug level and receptor occupancy on
lymphocytes in colonic tissue to the PK/PD relationships observed in peripheral blood in the
Phase I trial. In the phase I trial, the predicted IC90 for receptor occupancy was determined
to be 1.3 pg/ml, as previously described. This predicted IC90 is consistent with and
essentially the same as the serum concentration required for occupancy in colonic tissue, as
described here. Using these and other data from the Phase II study, we determined using
population PK modeling (see, e.g., Intn'l Patent Pub. No. WO 2012/135589) that a dose of
 100 mg every four weeks or a dose of 50 mg every two weeks is predicted to maintain a
minimum drug serum concentration of 1.7 pg/mL in the majority of the tested patients
population, which would be sufficient to maintain colonic tissue beta7 occupancy.
 [0262]              A surprising and unexpected finding from the results described above is that the
level of occupancy of beta7 receptors on lymphocytes in the peripheral blood at a particular
time following initiation of etrolizumab treatment (100 mg every 4 weeks) was essentially
the same as the level of occupancy of beta7 receptors on lymphocytes in colonic tissue. This
was surprising and unexpected because the large molecular weight of monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) limits their volume of distribution. Typically, the distribution of the mAbs is
confined to vascular and interstitial spaces due to their large size and hydrophilicity. Hence
the volume of distribution in the central compartment (Vc) for a mAb is usually equal to or
slightly larger than the plasma volume (Mascelli et al., J. Clin Pharmacol 47; 553-565 (2007);
Lobo et al., J. of Pharmaceutical Sci. Bol 93, 2645-2668 (2004)). Therefore, it is generally
considered that the mAb concentration in the serum is not representative of the mAb
concentration at the site of the action in the tissue.
 [0263]              Antibody distribution has been investigated more directly by assessing the
concentrations of mAbs in tissues, where tissue samples are obtained by biopsy or necropsy.
The distribution of mAbs has also been studied using radio-labeled antibody. For most
antibodies reported in the literature, tissue to blood concentration ratios were found to be in
the range of 0.1-0.5 (Lin et al., The J. of Pharmacol and Experi Thera Vol 288, 371-378
                                                      -85
10476975_1 (GHMatters) P100910.AU.1

(1999); Lobo et al., J. of Pharmaceutical Sci. Bol 93, 2645-2668 (2004)). This means that, in
most cases, the mAb concentration in the tissues (except brain tissue) is approximately 10
50% of that in the blood, while the mAb concentration in the brain is much less, ranging from
0.05-0.2% of those in the blood due to the protection by the blood brain barrier. Because it is
generally considered that the mAb concentration in the serum is not representative of the
mAb concentration at the site of the action, it may require up to 10-fold higher serum
concentration to provide sufficient exposure to saturate the receptors inside the tissue. Yet,
here we discovered that the serum concentration needed to saturate           Pf7 receptors  in the blood
(1-3 pg/mL) was very similar to that needed to saturate the         Pf7 receptors  in the gut tissue (1.7
- 4 pg/mL) in UC patients (based on data from N=23 patients). We believe this is the first
time that such a near one-to-one relationship between the blood and tissue compartments has
been observed and described. There are a few possible explanations for this relationship. It
is possible that the total amount of P 7 receptors available in the blood (e.g. number of cells
expressing P 7 antigen) may be much greater than those in the tissue. Alternatively, it may be
that the gut tissue in UC patients is "leakier" than normal tissue leading to more mAb
distribution into the tissue under the same serum concentration.
 [0264]              In sum, based on the work described herein, beta7 receptor occupancy in the
peripheral blood (an easily accessible site) can serve as a surrogate indicator of beta7 receptor
occupancy in colonic tissue (a far less accessible site). This can be applied to the selection of
dose and the design of dosing regimens for etrolizumab and other integrin beta7 antagonists.
PK/PD relationships can be established by assessing serum drug concentrations and beta7
receptor occupancy in the blood to identify serum drug target concentrations sufficient for
saturating receptors in the blood which can then be used to select doses or design dosing
regimens with the knowledge that the same or nearly the same relationship will apply to the
disease site in the colon thereby providing greater confidence in dose/dosing regimen
selection.
