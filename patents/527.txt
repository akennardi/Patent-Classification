    Device for marking molluscs and packaging line comprising such a
                                     device

           The present invention relates to the marking of molluscs with
   an external shell, and in embodiments to the engraving of live oysters
   on a packaging line.
           In general, the only indications for telling a customer about the
10 origin of an oyster or any other mollusc are those present on the
   hygiene label and also those on the packaging. However, there is no
   information on the product as such, that is to say on the mollusc.
           At   least preferred   embodiments    of the   invention  propose
   solving this problem with the aid of a marking device for realizing
15 systematic identification of each oyster, or of each mollusc, in order to
   reliably guarantee the origin of the products to the end consumer, but
   also to protect the producer from any imitations.
           This present application has been divided out of Australian
   patent application 2014202185 (AU 2014202185). In the description in
20 this specification reference may be made to subject matter which is not
   within the scope of the appended claims. That subject matter should be
   readily identifiable by a person skilled in the art and may assist in
   putting   into  practice  the  invention  as  defined   in  the  presently
   appended claims.
25         The full disclosure of AU 2014202185,       as originally filed, is
   hereby incorporated herein by reference.
           Described herein    is a device for marking molluscs with an
   external shell is proposed, comprising laser engraving means that are
   able to engrave an impression onto a shell, and control means that are
30 able to control the engraving of the impression onto the shells of the
   molluscs located in compartments in a loading tray.
           The shell of an oyster is formed from layers of mineral and
   organic materials. It has very variable colorations, thicknesses        and
   hardnesses, depending on the origin of the oysters. The multicoloured

                                         2
   nature of the oyster shell does not make it possible to systematically
   obtain optimal legibility with common marking methods such as inkjet
   printing,    no  matter   which   ink    is used. This  problem    is  also
   encountered in the marking of other molluscs.
 5         Laser engraving makes it possible to produce a marking by
   taking away material. The removal of material from the surface of the
   shell of an oyster or of another mollusc makes it possible to obtain a
   colour     contrast  that   renders     the  marking   visible  by    clear
   differentiation and makes it easier to read, regardless of the colour of
10 the shell.
           The impression engraved on the shell may be for example a
   brand or a logo, a date, or a unique identification code for each oyster,
   such as an identification number, a barcode, or any other identification
   code.
15         Preferably, the laser engraving means comprise at least one
   carbon dioxide laser with a power of between 50 W and 70 W, more
   particularly 60 W.
           The use of a carbon dioxide laser with a power of 60 W makes
   it possible to avoid any risk of piercing the shell of an oyster during
20 engraving, and to protect the live oyster by also avoiding prolonged
   exposure to the heat source. For other molluscs, the power can be
   adapted depending      on the type and thickness     of the shell of the
   mollusc.
           In one embodiment,      the laser engraving means comprise        a
25 number     of lasers equivalent to the number of compartments         in a
   loading tray of a transfer conveyor, the lasers being disposed so as to
   be located respectively opposite a compartment when a loading tray is
   positioned opposite the marking device.
           The plurality of lasers used makes it possible to reduce the
30 engraving time and to increase         the rate on a marking    line of a
   packaging line.
           In one variant, the laser engraving means comprise a single
   laser and means for moving in translation that are able to move the

                                        3
   laser opposite   each   compartment    in a   loading tray    of a transfer
   conveyor in order to engrave each mollusc on the tray.
           In another variant, the laser engraving means comprise a single
   laser associated with optical elements that are orientable and movable
 5 so as to allow the six molluscs on a single tray to be engraved in
   succession without the laser being moved.
           The use of a single laser makes it possible to reduce the
   production costs of the marking device.
           According to an aspect of the invention, a packaging line for
10 packaging   molluscs    with   an  external   shell   is  proposed   in  one
   embodiment.
           The packaging line comprises loading trays for molluscs with
   an external shell, said loading trays being provided with compartments
   for receiving   a mollusc and being carried by a transfer conveyor,
15 wherein the loading trays comprise nonslip surfaces in the bottom of
   each compartment, and a marking device as defined above that is able
   to engrave an impression onto the shell of each mollusc located on a
   loading tray. The packaging line comprises control means that are able
   to control the engraving of the impression onto the shells of the
20 molluscs located in compartments in the loading tray.
           In order to ensure that the products         are transferred  to the
   marking station, the conveyor may be a conveyor of the racetrack type.
           The size and shape vary greatly from one oyster to another. The
   size varies in three dimensions: length, width and thickness.           This
25 parameter creates problems with stability and the positioning of the
   oyster before and during the marking phase, causing rejects.
           By   using   trays   having   individual    compartments     on  the
   conveyor, it is possible to limit these phenomena.           The individual
   compartments are designed to receive molluscs of different sizes, and
30 in particular oysters of any grade. For this purpose, the individual
   compartments each have for example a size that makes it possible to
   receive an oyster of the largest grade.
           The mollusc is disposed so as to have its flattest side in contact
   with the nonslip surface. The oyster, for example, is disposed in the

                                         4
   compartment such that the side of its shell having a flat surface is in
   contact with the nonslip surface of the compartment.
            Advantageously,    each  compartment       of a   loading   tray    may
   comprise at least two positioning cleats that define at least one corner
 5 of the    compartment     and  are   able   to   retain  a   mollusc     in   the
   compartment.
            The disposition of the mollusc in abutment against the two
   cleats that form a corner of the compartment ensures that the mollusc
   is aligned and centred with respect to the three axes, while limiting the
10 phenomenon of sliding.
            The packaging line may also comprise line timing means that
   are able to advance the trays sequentially such that one tray is at a
   standstill when the marking device is acting on the oysters on the tray.
            The timing means can control the transfer conveyor such that
15 the latter advances the loading trays in a sequential manner.                The
   timing means can also be coupled to the marking device                 so as to
   synchronize    the movement of the trays         and the engraving of the
   molluscs on the trays.
            According to yet another aspect of the invention., a method for
20 packaging molluscs with an external         shell is proposed, comprising
   loading of molluscs onto a loading tray, moving of the tray by way of
   a transfer conveyor and marking of the shell of the molluscs.
            The marking may be carried out by laser.
            Advantageously, the movement may be timed sequentially such
25 that a pause is made after each movement of the tray by the transfer
   conveyor.
            Further advantages and features of the invention will become
   more    apparent    from   examining    the    detailed  description      of   an
   embodiment      and    an  implementation      mode,    which    are    entirely
30 nonlimiting, and the appended drawings, in which:
           -  Figure   1 schematically illustrates a perspective view of a
              transfer conveyor provided with loading trays for molluscs
              according to one embodiment of the invention;

               tray for molluscs of the conveyor from Figure 1;

               line comprising the transfer conveyor from Figure 1;
 5        -    Figure   4 shows a flow chart of a method for packaging
               molluscs   according   to  one implementation  mode   of the
               invention.
            Figure 1 schematically shows a perspective view of a transfer
   conveyor I provided with loading trays 2 for molluscs, in particular
10 oysters, according to one embodiment of the invention.
            The transfer conveyor 1 is a chain conveyor comprising a frame
   (not shown) formed by guides 20 that support two transfer chains 3.
   The chains 3 are provided with projections 4 to which the loading
   trays 2 are fixed. The chains 3 are mounted on two toothed pinions 21
15 and 22 that are each disposed at one end of the conveyor 1, one of the
   pinions 21 being motor-driven so as to generate the driving movement
   of the conveyor 1.
            In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1, each loading tray 2
   comprises six individual compartments 5. As is illustrated in Figure 2,
20 which shows a top view of a loading tray 2 for oysters H, each
   compartment 5 of the loading tray 2 comprises a nonslip surface 6 and
   two cleats 7 that define a corner of the compartment 5.
            The nonslip surface 6 is disposed on the entire surface of the
   compartment 5 so as to keep the oyster H in position and avoid any
25 sliding of the oyster H during the movement of the tray 2. In order to
   maximize the adhesion of the oyster H to the nonslip surface 6 of the
   compartment 5, the side of the oyster H shell that has the flattest
   surface is placed in contact with the nonslip surface 6.
            In addition, by covering the entire surface of the compartment
30 5 with such a nonslip surface 6, an oyster H of any grade can be placed
   in the compartment 5 and be kept correctly in position.
            In order to enhance the keeping in position of the oyster H and
   also to centre the oyster H in the compartment 5, the cleats 7 are
   disposed on two edges that form a single corner of the compartment 5

                                        6
   so as to define a rim of the corner. Each oyster H is thus placed in a
   compartment 5 with the flat side in contact with the nonslip surface 6
   and so as to be in contact with the two cleats 7.
            The oysters H are sorted by grade before being supplied to and
 5 disposed on the trays 2 of the transfer conveyor        1, such that the
   oysters H of a single grade are engraved during a marking session.
   Thus, positioning the oysters H against the two cleats 7 ensures that
   the engraving is carried out systematically on the same region of the
   shell.
10          Figure  3 illustrates a marking   line   8 of a packaging   line
   comprising the transfer conveyor I from Figure 1.
            The marking line 8 comprises the transfer conveyor 1, a feed
   conveyor 9 that delivers oysters of a single grade, a marking device 10
   and a vessel 11 for collecting the marked oysters.
15          The feed conveyor 9 is juxtaposed in a parallel manner with the
   transfer conveyor 1. In this way, one or more users can distribute the
   oysters conveyed by the feed conveyor 9 into the compartments 5 of
   the loading trays 2 of the transfer conveyor 1.
            The oysters thus disposed and centred in the compartments 5 of
20 the loading trays 2 by virtue of the cleats 7 are conveyed to the
   marking device 10 by the transfer conveyor 1.
            The marking device 10 is disposed above the transfer conveyor
    1 in a region close to the outlet end 12 of the transfer conveyor 1. In
   this embodiment, the marking device 10 comprises six carbon dioxide
25 lasers that are mounted so as to each be opposite a compartment 5 of a
   tray 2 when a loading tray 2 is positioned under the marking device
    10.  Of course,   the  number   of lasers  corresponds   to that of the
   compartments 5 in the loading trays 2. The lasers have a power of
   between 50 W and 70 W, and preferably around 60 W so as to allow
30 visible engraving of the shell without there being a risk of piercing the
   shell of the oyster.
            The marking device    10 comprises means for positioning the
   lasers that make it possible to move all of the lasers together such that
   they are each opposite a single area of the compartment 5.

                                         7
           The   marking    device   10  also comprises    control  means   for
   controlling the engraving of an impression on the shells of the oysters
   disposed in the compartments 5 of a loading tray 2. The control means
   have a parameterizable module that makes it possible to define the
 5 impression to be engraved and a synchronization module that makes it
   possible to synchronize the movement of the transfer conveyor 1 with
   the lasers of the marking device 10.
           In this embodiment, the transfer conveyor 1 is timed so as to
   make a pause between each movement of the chains 3 carrying the
10 loading trays 2.     Such timing of the transfer    conveyor    1 makes it
   possible to keep each loading tray 2 stationary under the marking
   device 10 for a period of time necessary for engraving the impression
   on the shell of the oysters.
           Once the impression has been engraved on the oysters on a
15 loading tray 2, the transfer conveyor 1 is actuated so as to convey
   another loading tray 2 under the marking device 10. The loading tray 2
   on which the oysters have been engraved is simultaneously conveyed
   to the outlet end 12 of the transfer conveyor 1, such that the oysters
   are discharged into the collecting vessel 11. When the loading tray 2 is
20 conveyed to the outlet end 12 of the transfer conveyor 1, the tray 2
   tips so as to discharge the oysters into the vessel 11.
           The vessel 11 may comprise a hamper disposed so as to receive
   the  six marked     oysters.  The   hamper  is then  closed    after having
   received a multiple of six oysters and replaced with another hamper
25 ready to receive the next marked oysters.
           Figure 4 shows a flowchart of a method for packaging molluscs
   according to one implementation mode of the invention.
           In a first step 100, a mollusc is disposed in a centred manner in
   each of the compartments 5 of a loading tray 2 of a transfer conveyor
30  1.
           In a following step 200, the transfer conveyor 1 conveys the
   tray 2 thus loaded into a position in which the molluscs disposed in the
   compartments 5 in the tray 2 are each opposite a carbon dioxide laser
   of a marking device 10. The tray 2 is moved in a timed manner by the

                                         8
   transfer conveyor 1, that is to say in a sequential manner, such that the
   tray 2 pauses prior to movement again.
           In a step 300,      the oysters in the tray     disposed under the
   marking    device 10 are engraved.      The engraving is carried out by
 5 regulating the lasers to a power of 60 W and by respecting an exposure
   time that is sufficient to engrave the impression without piercing the
   shell or exposing the oyster to an excessive overall quantity of heat.
           In a final step 400, the marked oysters are discharged into a
   collecting vessel   11   in order to pack the oysters and finalize the
10 packaging of an oyster hamper.
           The invention     thus makes    it possible   to realize  systematic
   identification of molluscs directly on their shell with the aid of a
   packaging line having a marking device, thus making it possible to
   reliably guarantee the origin of the products to the end consumer, but
15 also to protect the producer from any imitations.
           Finally, it will be noted that the invention is not limited to the
   above embodiment. Specifically, in the marking device described, the
   engraving means have a set of lasers, the number of which corresponds
   to the number of compartments in the loading tray.
20         Of course,   if   the  engraving means     of the marking     device
   comprise a single laser and the means for moving in translation that
   are able to move the laser opposite each compartment in a loading tray
   of a transfer conveyor in order to engrave each mollusc on the loading
   tray,  this does not    constitute a departure     from   the scope   of the
25 invention.
           The term 'comprising' as used in this specification and claims
   means 'consisting at least in part of'.    When interpreting statements in
   this specification and claims which include 'comprising'; other features
   besides the features prefaced by this term in each statement can also
30 be present.   Related terms such as 'comprise' and 'comprised' are to be
   interpreted in a similar manner.
           In this specification, where reference has been made to patent
   specifications,   other    external  documents,      or  other   sources  of
   information, this is generally for the purpose of providing a context

                                      9

  otherwise, reference to such external documents is not to be construed
  as an admission that such documents, or such sources of information,
  in any jurisdiction, are prior art, or form any part of the common
