CELL CULTURE DEVICE
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]    This is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, the
entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]    The present invention relates generally to cell culture devices and, more specifically, to
a stack of communicating trays for culturing cells.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]    Cell culture systems, including stacked trays, are useful for large-scale cell cultivation
and have become popular as an alternative to conventional roller bottles, bioreactors, and the
like. Exemplary stacked tray systems include the NUNC CELL FACTORY system (Nunc A/S,
Roskilde, Denmark), the Corning CELLSTACK (Coming Inc., Lowell, MA) and the Millipore
MILLICELL HY flasks (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). Such systems include one or more
culture trays, each with a larger cell growth surface area as compared to the conventional
devices, e.g., a surface area generally of at least 200 cm2 .
[0004]    For example, the NUNC CELL FACTORY system includes a stack of trays, wherein
each tray is approximately 335 mm in length and 205 mm in width to provide a cell growth
surface area of approximately 632 cm2 . Such trays are commercially-available as individual
trays or in stacks that generally consist of two, four, ten, or forty trays. The trays comprising a
stack are typically attached via ultrasonic welding. These systems further include a height of
about 14.65 mm and are recommended to contain about 200 mL of the growth culture medium.
Given the culture surface area per tray of about 632 cm2 , the about 200 mL of growth culture
medium would have a height of about 1.5 mm within the tray and the remaining height, about
12.6 mm (after accounting for the thickness of the bottom wall, e.g., approximately 0.5 mm) is
considered head space.
[0005]    Generally, the stack of trays is equipped with a gas exchanger having a gas conduit
providing fluid communication between the trays and at least one processed aperture for venting

                                                    2
the stack. The gas exchanger provides a fast and substantially uniform distribution of gas to all
trays within the stack.
[0006]    Although stacked tray culture systems have been widely used, particularly for large
scale cultivation of cultured cells, the stacked trays occupy a significant amount of incubator,
laboratory, and storage space, particularly when purchased as stacks include ten or more trays.
Thus, it would be advantageous to increase the total growing surface area per stack without
increasing the height or footprint of the stacks. An increase in growing surface area would
reduce the number of stacked tray systems needed to provide a given surface area, and reduce
the incubator, laboratory, or storage space occupied by the stacks.
[0007]    However, it has been conventional belief that proper growth of cells required a
significant air space volume above each cell growth surface area, for example, more than 3 mm
(in a vertical dimension) of air space above the cell culture. Alternatively, conventional devices
have incorporated bottom surface materials having a significant oxygen and/or carbon dioxide
permeability (e.g., silicone or 3 mil biaxially-oriented polystyrene film). Thus, optimizing the
total growing surface area without additional trays or increases the tray footprint and provided a
significant challenge to the space problem.
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
[0008]    It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate
one or more of the above disadvantages.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0019]    Referring now to the figures and, in particular, to FIG. 1, a cell culture device 10
("device" 10) in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is described. The
device is comprised of a plurality of trays 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d, each configured for the cultivation

                                                    5
of cells. Each tray 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d is stacked vertically with respect to another tray 12a, 12b,
12c, 12d. Although the number of trays 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d may vary, the illustrative
embodiment includes four.
[0020]    The trays 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d are configured to be in fluid communication with each
other and, thus, provide a total device volume that is the sum of each volume 13a, 13b, 13c, 13d
(FIG. 2) of the respective tray 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d. Gas exchange between the total device
volume and the environment outside the device 10 may occur via one or more venting ports 14.
A closure 16, 16' may be associated with each venting port 14 of the tray 12d positioned at a top
of the stack (or in the tray if only an individual tray is desired). In some embodiments, the
closure 16 may include a low profile shape so as to facilitate the stacking of two or more devices
10 as is shown in FIG. 2. An example of a low profile closure 16, 16' suitable for use with the
device 10 is described in U.S. Patent Application No. xx/xxx,xxx, entitled VENTABLE
CLOSURE WITH PORT (Attorney Docket Number NAC-147US), filed on even date herewith,
the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety..
[0021]    Referring still to FIG. 1, each tray 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d includes a floor or bottom 18
defining a growth surface 20 and at least one wall extending upwardly from the bottom 18 of the
tray 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d. While the trays 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d may incorporate any suitable shape,
including, for example, rectangular, square, round, circular, oblong, elliptical, polygonal, or
trapezoidal, the illustrated device 10 is substantially rectangular and includes two substantially
parallel end walls 22 and two substantially parallel side walls 24 extend upwardly from the
bottom 18 of the tray 12. When stacked, the bottom 18 of one tray may provide a top or cover
for an immediately adjacent tray positioned below the one tray. Thus, the top tray 12d may
remain open to the environment outside the device 10 or, alternatively, a separate cover piece
(not shown) may be used.
[0022]    The trays 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d may include one or more features designed to provide a
particular benefit to the device 10; however, the features may be incorporated in any
combination and all or some may not be included in any one particular embodiment. For
example, each tray 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d may be reinforced with one or more reinforcement ribs 26
extending at least partially in a longitudinal direction of the bottom 18 of the tray 12a, 12b, 12c,
12d. The reinforcement ribs 26 may further extend upwardly along the end walls 22. In some
embodiments, the reinforcement ribs 26 may extend along a substantial portion of the bottom

                                                   6
18, providing structural support to the bottom 18. In some embodiments, the sidewalls 24 may
also comprise reinforcement ribs 27, which may be shaped in a manner that is similar to the
reinforcement ribs 26 (e.g., extending along the bottom 18 of the tray 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d) or, as
shown, being primarily positioned at the junction between the bottom 18 and the side walls 24.
[0023]     As shown in FIG. 2, at least the top tray 12d in the device 10 may include one or more
indicia, e.g., lines or other marks 30, indicative of the volume of the contents of each tray 12a,
12b, 12c, 12d and/or the volume of the contents the device 10, in toto. Such marks 30 may be
located on either or both of the side wall 24 or the end wall 22. In some embodiments, the
reinforcement members 26 may also comprise, or be co-extensive with, the marks 30, thereby
providing a volume-indicating function as well as structural reinforcement. While the marks 30
as shown in FIG. 2are accompanied by labels indicating a volume amount, such as, "100",
"200", "300", it would be understood that the labels are not required.
[0024]     Referring to FIG. 3, the top-most tray may be somewhat different than the other trays
12b, 12c, 12d comprising the stack as the top-most tray 12a may require structural features for
performing one or more particular functions. For example, the venting ports 14 of the top-most
tray 12d may include a pour spout 28. In that regard, the pour spout 28 may be formed as a lip
29 extending laterally away from a rim 31 defining a top edge of the walls 22, 24 of the tray
12d. Accordingly, and with the closure 16 removed from the venting port 14, the pour spout 28
may be configured to drain a fluid from the device 10.
[0025]     The trays 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d may be molded using a thermoplastic material, including,
for example, polystyrene. Depending upon the material used, the thickness of the tray bottom
18 may vary but should be sufficient to prevent significant bowing of the bottom 18 when the
device 10 is filled with an appropriate volume of culture medium 32 (FIG. 4). For polystyrene,
a thickness of about 0.5 mm is recommended for trays having a culture surface area of about
632 cm2 and configured to hold about 200 mL to about 300 mL of culture medium 32 (FIG. 4).
[0026]     In some embodiments, the device 10 may constructed from a material that withstands
sterilization, including, for example, sterilization by irradiation (beta or gamma radiation), steam
autoclave, ethylene oxide, chemical disinfectants, or dry heat sterilization. In these or other
embodiments, the device 10 may be made from a thermoplastic material and/or from a material
that is formed, for instance, by injection molding. Examples of materials that are suitable for

                                                    7
use in the present context include, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene,
polycarbonate, polyurethane, polysulfone, polymethylpentene, polymethylmetacrylate,
polyethyleneterepthtalate, polytetrafluoroethylene, or ABS (acrylonitrilbutadiene styrene).
However, the examples given here only exemplary in nature a person skilled in the art would
readily appreciate how to select other materials suitable for use in constructing the device.
[0027]     With reference now to FIG. 4, the lower trays 12b, 12c, 12d are shown as including a
volume of a liquid, such as a cell culture medium 32. The lower trays 12b, 12c, 12d are
generally in fluid communication with one another via the venting ports 14 that, being a portion
of a lower tray 12b, 12c, 12d, lack a closure 16 and thus define a fluid path or channel 34
between and among the lower trays 12b, 12c, 12d. An opening 36 is formed between the
venting port 14 of each tray 12b, 12c, 12d and the above and immediately adjacent tray 12a,
12b, 12c and provides fluid communication between the volumes 13b, 13c, 13d of the trays 12b,
12c, 12d. In this way, gases may be exchanged between the cell cultures within each tray 12b,
12c, 12d and provides for a more uniform growth environment. The channel 34 has a lower
most end 37 that opposes the closure 16 and that is within the lower-most tray 12d. In that
regard, the lower-most tray 12d may include a stopper 38 within the venting port 14 to seal the
loser-most end 37 of the channel 34 and to prevent inadvertent loss of the culture medium 32
and/or reduce the risk of microbial contamination. The stopper 38 may include one or more
ribs, at least one thread, an o-ring 39, or other devices, with or without adhesives, for forming a
seal with the venting port 14
[0028]     Referring still to FIG. 4, the device 10 may be constructed by joining adjacent ones of
the trays 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d comprising the stack , which may include, for example, laser
welding, ultrasonic welding, solvent bonding, or adhesive bonding (gluing).
[0029]     Adhesive bonding offers production advantages, for example, by reducing the number
of stacks rejected due to failed attachment via welding. Thus, to further enhance the
effectiveness of adhesive bonding, the trays 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d may include various structural
elements that facilitate stacking, alignment, and attachment. More specifically, and with
reference now to FIGS. 4 and 5, the trays 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d may include a joint 41, namely, a
tongue-in-groove joint, at the point of contact between adjacent ones of the trays 12a, 12b, 12c,
12d. FIG. 5 illustrates, in more detail, one such embodiment of the tongue-in-groove joint 41.
In particular, each tray 12b, 12c, 12d (not including the top-most tray 12a as this tray includes

                                                  8
the pour spout 28) includes an upper surface 40 on each end wall 22 and side wall 24 and
positioned proximate the rim 31. A groove 42 extends downwardly into the walls 22, 24 and
may extend around at least a portion of the upper periphery of the walls 22, 24 of each tray 12b,
12c, 12d. The groove 42 defines an inner groove wall 44 and an outer groove wall 46, wherein
the inner groove wall 44 may be generally shorter than the outer groove 46. The groove 42 has
a shape and size that is configured to receive a tongue 48 that depends downwardly from a
bottom outer surface 50 of the tray 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d. In some embodiments, the tongue 48
may extend around at least a portion of the lower periphery of each tray 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d.
Thus, and when a first tray 12a, 12b, 12c is placed above and positioned onto a second 12b, 12c,
12d, the groove 42 of second tray 12b, 12c, 12d receives the tongue 48 of the first tray 12a, 12b,
12c, i.e., the above and immediate adjacent tray 12a, 12b, 12c. In some embodiments, the
tongue 48 may be a co-extensive with the walls 22, 24; otherwise, the tongue 48 may be
inwardly offset from the walls 22, 24 and extending from the bottom outer surface 50.
[0030]     The inner groove wall 44 may have an upper surface 52 that is configured to receive
and be adjacent to the bottom outer surface 50 of the above and immediately adjacent tray. This
contact is configured to resist movement of an adhesive from the groove 42 and into the volume
13b, 13c, 13d of the trays 12b, 12c, 12d. In some embodiments, the tongue 48 may have a
lateral width dimension that is smaller than a lateral width dimension of the groove 42 and so
the tongue 48 may reside within, but not completely fill, the groove 42. In some embodiments,
the tongue 48 may be configured so as to not contact the inner groove wall 44, the outer groove
wall 46, or a bottom wall 53 of the groove 42. Spacing the tongue 48 away from these walls 44,
46, 53 defines a space between the tongue 48 and the groove 42 configured to receive an
adhesive 54. The shape and size of the inner and outer groove walls 44, 46 is configured to
spread the adhesive upwardly and around the tongue 48 when the trays 12a, 12b, 12c, 12 are in
the stacked arrangement. Spreading the adhesive in this way increases the surface area for
adhesive bonding. While the spacing may vary, in some embodiments, the spacing between the
tongue 48 and the inner groove wall 44 may be approximately 0.015 inches (0.381 mm), the
spacing between the tongue 48 and the outer groove wall 46 may be approximately 0.025 inches
(0.635 mm), and the spacing between the tongue 48 and the bottom of the groove 42 may be
approximately 0.010 inches (0.254 mm).
[0031]     To construct the device 10, and once the trays 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d are stacked, a small
volume of adhesive 54 is directed into the groove 42. The contact angle of the adhesive 54

                                                  9
relative to the wall surfaces of the groove 42, and/or the viscosity of the adhesive, cause the
adhesive to spread and to fill the spaces between the tongue 48 and the inner groove wall 44, the
outer groove wall 46, and the bottom wall 53, as was discussed in detail above. While any
suitable adhesive known to those of ordinary skill in the art for bonding plastics may be used,
suitable adhesives may include those having a low cytotoxicity or, more preferably, an adhesive
considered non-cytotoxic. Examples of suitable adhesives useful for making the present
invention include, but are not limited to, UV/light cured urethane-acrylic adhesives,
oxygen/moisture-cured or UV/light-cured cyanoacrylate adhesives, self-curing epoxies, and
UV/light-cured vinyl acrylamide-based adhesives. Such adhesives may include poly(N,N
dimethyl acrylamide, poly(isobomyl methacrylate), poly(isobornyl acrylate), or a combination
thereof.
[0032]    The device 10 of FIG. 1, constructed in a manner as describe above, may offer several
advantages. For one, the strict tolerances as well as the shape and size of the relative surfaces of
the tongue-in-groove joint 14 enable manufacturing to be performed by automated machines and
according to efficient manufacturing processes. Automation of manufacturing methods may
provide consistency in product manufacture and a reduction of manufacturing errors. Moreover,
the tongue-in-groove joint 41 may provide consistency as to the relative positioning of one tray
12a, 12b, 12c, 12d with respect to an adjacent tray 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d, thereby reducing the
potential for positioning errors, which may otherwise propagate in a stack comprising a large
number of trays, for example, a stacks having twenty, forty, or more trays. Also, the shape and
size of the inner groove wall 44 relative to the bottom surface 50 of the above and immediately
adjacent tray contain the adhesive generally to the tongue-in-groove 41 joint and resists leakage
into the volume 13a, 13b, 13c, 13d of the trays 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d and reduces the risk of the
associated contamination.
[0033]    In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, the height of the
device 10 may be reduced for providing a larger cell growth surface area per unit height of the
device 10. As such, and with reference again to FIG. 4, each tray 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d has a
height dimension, htray, that extends from a bottom edge 59 of the tongue 48 to the rim 31 of
the same tray 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d. The device 10 comprising a stack of trays 12 extends
upwardly from the bottom edge 59 of the tongue 48 of the lower most tray 12d to the rim 3 1of
the topmost tray 12a (excluding any closure 16, which is removable from the stack 10), which
defines a total device height, hstack. The stack height, hstack, may be approximately equal to

                                                  10
the sum of the component tray heights, htray, comprising the stack; however, the total device
height, hstack, may, in reality, be slightly smaller than the straight sum because of the overlap of
the trays 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d in the region of the joint 41.
[0034]    During use, and when the culture medium 32 is contained within the volumes 13b, 13c,
13d of the trays 12b, 12c, 12d, a head space 60 is defined as being the space located the culture
medium 32 contained within the tray 12b, 12c, 12d and the bottom outer surface 50 of the above
and immediately adjacent tray 12a, 12b, 12c.
[0035]    The tray height, htray, of each tray 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d may be reduced, principally, by
reducing the height of the walls 22, 24. Surprisingly, the amount of head space 60 may be
reduced without detrimental effects to the growth rate and health of the cell culture. Said
another way, it was discovered that the tray height, htray, may be reduced to range from about
12 mm to about 6 mm without detrimentally affecting the cell culture growth and health. For
example, a tray having a growth surface area of about 632 cm2 and a tray height ranging from
about 7.5 mm to about 9.5 mm may accommodated up to 300 mL of culture medium per tray
while providing adequate headspace for gas exchange and cell growth. With such a reduction in
the tray height, a device comprising a stack of sixty trays in accordance with one or more
embodiments of the present invention may have, for example, a device height that is
substantially equivalent to the device height of a device comprising forty conventional trays.
Similarly, a device comprising a stack of fifteen trays in accordance with one or more
embodiments of the present invention may have a device height that is substantially equivalent
to the device height of a device comprising a stack of conventional trays. The reduction in
height yields substantial savings in terms of space and resources. Thus, the total cell growing
surface area of a device in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is increased
as compared to the total cell growing surface area of a conventional device of similar height
