  BACKGROUND
  1. Technical Field
  The field of the present disclosure relates to communications and particularly relates to a
  platform for audio-video communications.
  2. Description of Related Art
  An Internet service such as SKYPETM enables audio or audio-video conversations between two
  or more users. A server is used to initiate the conversation and negotiation of the type of media.
  The actual audio or video streams between the users are transferred in a peer-to-peer session
  without further server mediation.
  In services such as SKYPETM, the peer-to-peer session is established to avoid creating a bottle
  neck caused by overloading a server with traffic and to avoid introducing latency through the
  server.
  iMessageTM is a service that allows users to send texts, photos, videos, contact information, and
  group messages.
  AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) is a service to allow users to communicate in real time.
  WhatsApp TM Messenger is a proprietary, cross-platform instant messaging service for smart
  phones. In addition to text messaging, users can send to each other images, video, and audio
  media messages.
0 A traditional radio frequency half-duplex communications system provides communications
  from a single transmitter to one or more receivers. Only one transmitter may be broadcasting at a
  time because the same physical channel is shared for broadcasting to all receiving parties. Once
  receivers begin to receive a signal, the receiving parties need to wait for the transmitter to stop
  transmitting, before replying since the physical communications channel is unavailable.

  BRIEF SUMMARY
  Various data communications systems are disclosed herein of video communications between
  multiple computer systems configured as client computer systems. One (or more) of the client
  computer systems when transmitting is a client transmitter and one (or more) of the client
  computer systems when receiving or consuming is a client recipient. The client transmitter is
  enabled to transmit or record a video message for display on the client recipient. The client
  transmitter is configured to establish a connection with a video server and to transmit the video
  message to the video server. The video message is archived by the video server. If the client
  recipient is unavailable during the beginning of the transmission of the video message and when
  the client recipient is available later during the transmission of the video message, then the client
  recipient is enabled to display the video message from the beginning of the video message while
  the transmission of the video message is still ongoing.
  The client computer systems may be configured to alternate between being a client transmitter
  and a client receiver and to alternately transmit and receive video content.
  A management server may be adapted to receive from the client transmitter a first character
  string including a reference to the client recipient and in response transmit to the client recipient
  a second character string including a reference to the client transmitter. In response to the second
  character string, the client recipient is configured to transmit a third character string to the video
  server. The third character string references the video message and upon receipt by the video
0 server of the third character string, the video server transmits the video message to the client
  recipient.
  When the client recipient is unavailable, the client recipient may be adapted to retrieve the video
  message from a message archive of the video server when the client recipient is later available.
  Multiple client computer systems configured as client transmitters may transmit respective video
5 messages simultaneously to the client recipient.
  Various client computer systems and/or software applications thereof may be configured for use
  in the data communications network The client computer system and/or software applications
  may include a transmitter module configured to: establish the connection with the video server,
  transmit a first video message to the video server and transmit to the management server the first
0 character string. The client computer system and/or software applications may include a receiver

  video message; and display the second video message.
  Various management servers and/or software applications thereof may be configured for use in
  the data communications network. The management server may include: a management receiver
  module adapted to receive from the client transmitter the first character string and a management
  transmitter module adapted to transmit the second character string to the client recipient.
  Various video servers may be configured for use in the data communications network. The video
  server includes: a network adapter configured to establish the connection with the client
  transmitter and receive the video message and a video data storage adapted to archive the video
  message. The network adapter is configured to receive the third character string and to transmit
  the video message to the client recipient responsive to the third character string.
  Various methods are disclosed herein for management of video communications between
  multiple computer systems. One (or more) of the client computer systems when transmitting is a
  client transmitter and one or more of the client computer systems when receiving or consuming
  is a client recipient. The client transmitter is enabled to transmit a video message for display on
  the client recipient. The client transmitter is configured to establish a connection with a video
  server, to transmit a video message to the video server. The video message is archived by the
  video server. When the client recipient is unavailable during the beginning of the transmission of
  the video message and when the client recipient is available later during the transmission of the
0 video message, the client recipient is enabled to display the video message from the beginning of
  the video message during the transmission of the video message to the video server.
  The video message may be received and displayed by the client recipient.
  The client computer systems may be configured to alternate between being a client transmitter
  and a client receiver and to alternately transmit and receive respectively.
5 The client recipient may be selected for receiving or consuming the video message while the
  video message is being transmitted to the video server. The connection may be established
  autonomously without intervention by a user of the client transmitter. The connection may be
  established responsive to a program previously installed in the client transmitter by monitoring
  actions of a user of the client transmitter and the connection is established based on said
0 monitored actions of the user. Transmission by the client recipient of the second character string
  to the video server may be performed without prior notification to a user of the client recipient.

  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
  Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention, examples of
  which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the
  like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below to explain the present invention
  by referring to the figures.
  By way of introduction, embodiments of the present invention are directed to provide a video
  communications      system   and    method   with   a  user   experience  similar   to  half-duplex
  communications (sometimes known as "walkie-talkie" or "push-to-talk) as well known in radio
  frequency communications.. The average length of a "full-duplex" session using a service such as
  SkypeTM may be over ten minutes. The initialization time needed by existing technology to
  initiate a video stream using a prior art video service may range between 10 and 30 seconds
  depending on the network and the implementation used. This initialization time may be
  acceptable in prior art video services such as SkypeTM. Assuming a ten minute video session, for
  example, thirty seconds of initialization time for the 10 minute session amounts to 4.76%
  overhead. Embodiments of the present invention are intended to accommodate audio and/or
  video messages or bursts of average length 20 to 30 seconds. An initialization time of 30 seconds
  to transfer a 25 second audio and/or video message would amount to 54.5% overhead which
  would not be acceptable. Therefore, one of the technical problems being solved in embodiments
  of the present invention is to provide a user experience of "half-duplex" communications system
  while minimizing initialization time and other time latencies so the user experiences near real
  time message transfer.
  In sum, embodiments of the present invention are directed to an audio-video messaging
  communications platform appropriate for conversations including short audio-video message
  bursts, e.g. 10-30 seconds long, with a reduced initialization time and overall latency of less than
5 three to five seconds. Within one to two seconds after initiating transmission, the video content
  being recorded by a user is already being archived at a server and available to or being consumed
  by all the users sharing a communications thread. A user of an embodiment of the present
  invention may participate with other users to share video content in near real time. If the user is
  not available, e.g. not online, then the video content and the messages may be consumed later by
0 streaming from the archive. If a user is an intended recipient and is unavailable at the time
  transmission began and becomes available thereafter and as a result enters late into a
  communications thread, then the user may consume the video content from the beginning of the

          WO 2014/102720                                                        PCT/IB2013/061311
                                                    6
   thread when transmission of the video content began and participate in the thread without
   missing the beginning of the thread. Streaming from the archive enables multiple users to
   transmit to the same recipient at the same time and the recipient may receive and consume all the
   video content from all the users, for instance in the order of transmission.
   Before explaining embodiments of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the
   invention is not limited in its application to the details of design and the arrangement of the
   components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is
   capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to
   be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of
   description and should not be regarded as limiting.
   Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1 illustrates a simplified block diagram of a mobile
   computer system 100 according to features of the present invention. Mobile computer system
   100 is may connect through a cellular base station 119 to cellular network 121. A cellular
   communications module 117 connects processor 110 to cellular network 121. Mobile computer
   system 100 may also connect over a data communications network 106 to a server 205 and to a
   server 206. Mobile computer system 100 includes a processor 110 connected to local data
   storage 101. A data communications module 104 operatively connects processor 110 to data
   communications network 106. An audio-video encoder 202 and an audio-video decoder 204 are
   used to encode and decode respectively audio-video content sent from and received by mobile
 J computer system 100. Audio-video content of audio-video encoder 202 and audio-video decoder
   204 may include audio or video which includes multiple channels, for example stereoscopic
   video or sound each of which include right and left audio channels. Mobile computer system 100
   may include peripheral accessory devices such as a display 109, global positioning system (GPS)
   receiver 107, a camera 105, a microphone 111, a speaker 113, a vibrator 115, accelerometer
5 /gravity sensor(not shown), near field communication (NFC) (not shown), radio-frequency
   identification (RFID) (not shown), BluetoothTM (not shown) and IR sensor (not shown).
   Reference is now also made to Figure 2 which shows a simplified block diagram of a system 20,
   according to features of the present invention. System 20 may include a first mobile computer
   system 100 acting as a client transmitter 100T and a second mobile computer system 100 acting
0 as client recipient 100R. A video data system 206 including video server 206a, video database
   206b and video data storage 206c connects with client transmitter 100T and client recipient

         WO 2014/102720                                                     PCT/IB2013/061311
                                                  7
  100R. A management data system 205 including a management server 205a and a management
  database 205b connects with client transmitter 100T and client recipient 100R. An audio-video
  message 250 is shown as being transmitted from client transmitter 100T to video data system
  206. Message 250 may be recorded live using camera 105 while transmitting or message 250
  may be previously recorded and stored in local storage 101. Video data system 206 and
  management data system 205 may be collocated in the same installation or even in the same
  hardware unit and while operating share the same power supply, for instance. Video data system
  206 and management data system 205 may be implemented in different threads of a multi
  threaded processor.
  Reference is now also made to Figures 3a and 3b which show flow charts for respective methods
  301 and 300, according to features of the present invention. Methods 301 and 300 illustrate a
  process of client transmitter 100T connecting and transmitting to video data system 206 in
  system 20, to allow a user to transmit video messages 250 to other users. Method 301 (Figure 3a)
  illustrates process steps performed by client transmitter 100T and method 300 (Figure 3b)
  illustrates process steps performed by server data system 206.
  Referring now to system 20 and methods 301 and 300, a transmitter application according to an
  embodiment of the present invention is previously installed and stored in memory 101 of client
  transmitter 100T. The transmitter application of client transmitter 100T may connect (step 302)
  to video data system 206 and to video server 206a without yet receiving an explicit user
J instruction to transmit video message 250. Specifically, the transmitter application of client
  transmitter 100T based on previous user actions or prior programming may open a URI of the
  next video message 250 expected to be transmitted to video data storage 206c. In parallel, video
  server 206a of video data system 206 receives the connection (step 306). Client transmitter
  application in step 307 begins to transmit video message 250 and in parallel in step 308, video
5 message 250 is being archived by video data system 206 in video data storage 206c. Video
  compression may be performed while recording video message 250 using camera 105. The user
  may be notified in step 304 that one or more video messages will be prepared for transmission.
  In parallel, the archiving of video data message may be completed (step 310) at video data
  system 206. Client transmitter 100T application may select (step 305) one or more recipients or
0 the user of client transmitter 100T may select (step 305) one or more recipients. In step 309, a
  text message, including a URI, character string or message block including a reference to the
  recipient(s) is sent to management server 205a in management data system 205. Step 309 does

         WO 2014/102720                                                    PCT/IB2013/061311
                                                 8
  not generally require an acknowledgment from management server 205a. The URI referencing
  audio-video message 250, is intended for relaying to the recipient(s) to expect the audio-video
  message and to prepare client recipient 10OR for the upcoming receipt of audio-video message
  250.
  Several options are available for transfer of the message block from management data system
  205 to client recipient 10OR The message block may include: the URI to reference video
  message 250, a command for client 100 to expect a video message, a command for client 100 to
  prepare to play video message 250. Alternatively, the message block may includes only the URI
  to reference the message 250. Client recipient 10OR is programmed so that whenever it receives
  a URI, a video message, 250 is expected and client recipient 10OR prepares to play video
  message 250. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, management server 205
  may be avoided and message blocks may be transferred over a mesh network between client
  computer systems 100.
  In method 301, transmission latency may be reduced if based on previous user interaction or
  prior programming, the transmitter application deems the user has a high probability that he/she
  is going to record using camera 105 one or more video messages 250 and to transmit within the
  next few seconds. The transmitter application may prepare (step 303) client transmitter 100T
  accordingly and/or may begin to transmit (step 307), prior to the user being notified (step 304)
  that video message 250 is being or has been transmitted and prior to selecting recipients (step
J 305).
  Referring again also to Figure 1, preparation to transmit (step 303) may include steps such as
  turning on a camera 105 application and opening shutter of camera 105, allocating space in
  memory 101 for video message 250, beginning to record and encoding video message 250 by
  encoder 204. Preparation to transmit (step 303) may include opening a folder in storage 101
5 which includes images, audio-video clips, or other multimedia messages that have not been
  previously received and archived (step 308) and beginning to transmit (step 307 ) the contents of
  that folder.
  Reference is now also made to Figure 4 which illustrates a flow diagram of a method 320,
  according to an aspect of the present invention. Method 320 provides for receipt of an audio
0 video message when client recipient 10OR is available and/or subsequent audio-video message
  retrieval for instance when client recipient 10OR is not available or unavailable during the

         WO 2014/102720                                                       PCT/IB2013/061311
                                                   9
  original transmission from client transmitter 100T. In decision block 311, if client recipient
  10OR is available during or shortly after (within a few seconds) beginning of transmission (step
  307) then the flow continues with sub-process 501 as shown in Figure 5. If in decision block
  311, if client recipient 10OR is not available during or shortly after transmission, then the flow
  continues with sub-process 701 shown in Figure 7.
  Reference is now made also to Figure 5 which illustrates sub-process 501 which may be
  performed when client recipient 10OR is available, according to features of the present invention.
  In step 503, client recipient 10OR receives character string, including a URI, which includes a
  reference to audio-video message 250. A character string, is sent (step 505) from client recipient
  10OR to video data system 206 and video data system 206 on receiving the character string
  referring to video message 250 reads from video storage 206c video message 250 and transmits
  video message 250 to client recipient 100R. In the meantime, in step 506, client recipient 10OR
  prepares for playback and receipt of video message 250. In step 407, video message 250 is
  received and played by client recipient 100R. Alternatively, when client recipient 10OR is
  available, video message 250 may be copied during transmission from client transmitter 100T
  and relayed by video data system 206 to client recipient 10OR so that client recipient 10OR is not
  receiving message 250 from archive 206c,
  According to a feature of the present invention, when client recipient 10OR becomes available
  after beginning of transmission of video message 250 from client transmitter 100T, then video
0 data system 206 may transmit video message 250 from the beginning of the message. The time
  delay between the time of the beginning of transmission to the time when client recipient 10OR
  becomes available may be reduced during the remainder of the message thread. During the
  subsequent interchanges between client transmitters 100T and client recipients 100R, the client
  recipient will eventually catch up with the other participants in the conversation.
5 Reference is now made also to Figure 6 which illustrates sub-process 701 which may be
  performed when client recipient 10OR is not available at the original time of transmission (step
  307, Figure 3) of video message 250. When client recipient 10OR is available (decision block
  702) at an undetermined later time, client recipient 10OR synchronizes (step 703) message
  history with management database 205b. In step 705, the user of client recipient 10OR is notified
0 of missed messages, e.g. video message 250. At the same time, client recipient 10OR may send
  (step 505 ) a character string, including a URI, to video data system 206 referring to one or more

       WO 2014/102720                                                    PCT/IB2013/061311
                                               10
of the missed messages. Client recipient 10OR application may anticipate user choice and send
(step 505) character string to video data system 206 whilst receiving a response to the query in
step 705 regarding missed messages. The character string is received in video data system 206,
and in step 406, video message 250 is retrieved from archive 206c and video message 250 is
being received by client recipient 100R. Client recipient 10OR may prepare for playback, i.e. turn
on the media player application, in step 706, based on previous user actions. The application
running in client recipient 10OR may deem that there is a high probability that the user is going
to select viewing video message 250 already being received. If the user selects in decision box
707 playing of video message 250, then client recipient 10OR is already prepared to play message
250 being received or already received and step 407 of receiving and playing incoming video
message 250 may be performed with low overall latency.

  The process of user A to send a 30 second video to user B and subsequently for user B to watch
  the video and send back a 30 second response to user A and for user A to view the response
  requires about 150 seconds. For 60 seconds of content, 150 seconds is required for the content to
5 be transferred and viewed. In the example, the communication using a prior art service has 90
  seconds of latency, 60 seconds of content for a total time of communication T of 150 seconds
  where latency is 71% of the total time of communication.

  seconds of content is viewed which requires about 64 seconds to be transferred and displayed. A
  process using an embodiment of the present invention has a latency time of about 6.25% of the

  User experience
0 In embodiments of the present invention, two or more users need not be available to participate
  in a conversation since every video message 250 is archived (step 308) at server video data
  system 206. Users may be added to a group and view all prior video messages 250 that were
  transmitted prior to the addition of the new user.

  In embodiments of the present invention, video message 250 may be transmitted (step 307) and
  compressed while recording message 250 in camera 105 to reduce compression and transmission
  latency times.
  The user recipient(s) may begin streaming (step 407) a received message 250 for viewing within
  a few seconds of the user transmitter beginning to transmit (step 307), reducing latency time. In
  sum, low latency performance found according to features of the present invention create a
  dramatic change in user experience over prior art systems.
  Queuing messages within a thread
  Video communication system 20, according to embodiments of the present invention enables
  users of client computer systems 100 to alternately send and receive messages 250 as unicast
  (one to one) or multicast (one-to-many).
  In system 20, that includes playback of incoming messages 250 in near real time, multiple
  incoming messages 250 may be viewed contiguously although when transmitted in real time
  messages 250 may overlap.
  In near real time streaming video messaging system 20, according to embodiments of the present
  invention, video message 250 has a start time of transmission by streaming to video data system
  206, a latency time until message 20 begins to be consumed at client recipient 100R, and an end
  time when streaming ends of message 250 being received at client recipient 100R.
  According to a feature of the invention, a client 100 may either receive/consume                or
0 record/transmit video message 250 at any time but client 100 may not both consume and transmit
  content at the same time. A client 100 may be forced to stop one interaction to begin another, for
  example to stop consuming content in order to create content or vice versa.
  When client recipient 10OR detects an incoming message 250, various actions may happen. In
  one example, client recipient 10OR is playing another video message 250. The user may be
5 presented with a notification of incoming message 250 either a visual message, an audible
  message and/or vibration using vibrator 115 as notification. The user may select the notification
  via a tap or swipe on client recipient 10OR which causes video message 250 currently playing to
  stop or pause and video message 250 relevant to the notification begins to play.

        WO 2014/102720                                                     PCT/IB2013/061311
                                                   14
  In another example, when client recipient 10OR is not currently engaged playing a video message
  250, client recipient 10OR may be configured to play incoming message 250 without need for
  any interaction by the user.
  Reference is now made to Figure 7 which illustrates a simplified timing diagram 801 of client
  100 (of user A) transmitting two messages 250(1) and 250(2) to another client 100 of user Z
  The passage of time is identified by going from the top of diagram 901 to the bottom of diagram
  901.
  1. User A transmits message 250(1) to User Z.
  2. User Z receives message 250(1) with a latency of a few seconds and begins viewing message
  250(1).
  3. After User A completes transmitting message 250(1), an amount of time less than the latency
  between the transmission of User A of message 250(1) and playback of User Z of message
  250(1) passes.
  4. User A begins transmitting message 250(2) to User Z.
  5. User Z is unable to begin viewing message 250(2) because user Z is still viewing earlier
  message 250(1).
  6. System 20 recognizes that message 250(1) and message 250(2) are contextually related based
  on the thread between the users users and creates a queue that plays message 250(2) upon
  completion of viewing of message 250(1) by User Z.
J Reference is now made to Figure 8 which illustrates a timing diagram 801 of messages 250
  communicated between clients 100 of group thread, according to a feature of the present
  invention. The passage of time is identified by going from the top of diagram 801 to the bottom
  of diagram 801.
  1. The User Z is engaged in a group thread with users A, B and C.
5 2. The User Z creates a message 250T Z.
  3. While the User Z is recording and transmitting message 250T Z, user A, part of the same
  group thread, creates message 250T A.
  4. Message 250T A is streamed in real time to the other members of the group thread, including
  User Z.
0 5. User Z is unable to immediately view incoming message 250T in real time because client 100
  of user Z is still recording and transmitting outgoing message 250T Z

                                                   15
  6. While client 100 of User A is transmitting message 250T A, client 100 of user B begins
  transmitting message 250T B.
  7. While client 100 of user B is transmitting message 250T B , client 100 of user C begins
  transmitting message 250T C.
  8. Messages are archived in real time by video data system 206 and client 100 of user Z is
  notified of incoming messages 250R A, 250R B and 250R C.
  9. Client 100 of User Z forms a queue and time shifts the playback of incoming messages 250R
  A, 250R B and 250R C.
  10. Messages 250R A, 250R B and 250R C are played contiguously typically in time sequence
  of transmission.
  An outcome of steps 1-10 outlined above in reference to Figure 8 is that User Z experiences
  messages 250 which are transmitted while overlapping in time as if each user of the thread
  transmitting the messages waits until the queue is clear before creating and transmitting
  respective video messages 250T A, 250T B and 250T C
  User Z may or may not be notified that he/she is consuming video messages 250R A, 250R B and
  250R C as shifted in time.
  Compensating for sub-optimal network conditions during transmission
  Sub-optimal network conditions may exist which may cause high latency of or loss of
  information from video messages 250 when users of client computer systems 100 send video
0 messages 250. According to a feature of the present invention, client transmitter 100T may
  detect local network quality. If sub-optimal network quality exists, in order to maintain low
  latency quasi-real-time messaging, information content of messages 250 may be reduced prior to
  during or subsequent to recording of video message 250. Reducing information content of
  messages 250 may include: decreasing the video frame rate of video messages 250, reducing
5 color resolution or even switching to monochrome video messages 250, and/or reducing video
  frame size, by way of examples. A reduced quality video message 250 may be transmitted and
  stored on video data storage 206c and available for consuming or receiving by client recipients
  100R.
  In order to subsequently recover the original high quality message 250, the original reduced
0 quality message 250 or at least the dropped information thereof may be stored locally in client
  transmitter 100T or another device, e.g. removable disk, attachable thereto. High quality

                                                   16
  message 250 may be uploaded to replace the lower quality version previously stored on video
  data storage 206c so that client recipients 10OR may consume or download video message 250 in
  higher quality subsequent to original lower quality transmission. Alternatively, the dropped
  information may be used to repair original message 250 on either client transmitter 100T, on
  video data system 206 or on client receiver 100R. Thus, reduction of video quality may be used
  to maintain quasi-real-time low latency messaging even under sub-optimal network conditions
  while allowing subsequent consumption of the same message in the original quality. An
  example: User A is transmitting a video message 250 to User B. User A is on a network that is
  less than the required bandwidth for full quality video, so client transmitter 100T sends a
  reduced quality video message 250 to user B.
  In the case that User B is watching at the time of the transmission, User B receives/consumes the
  reduced quality video of the video message 250 of user A.
  Subsequent to the transmission of the reduced quality video message 250 from user A, client
  transmitter 100T may transmit the dropped information from the reduced quality video of the
  video message 250 of user A to user B. The dropped information may then be used to fill in the
  missing video information of the reduced quality video of the video message 250 as originally
  transmitted. So that in the case that User B is unavailable to watch the transmission live and
  chose to watch at a later time or, having watched the message at the time of the broadcast,
  returns later to re-watch video message 250, User B may view the full quality video of video
J message 250.
  Multi-function button
  System 20 may be implemented using a smart phone 100, e.g iPhone, equipped with a touch
  sensitive display 109. When a client application is installed on smart phone 100 for executing
  method 301, 501 and/or 701, a virtual button may be implemented on touch sensitive display
5 109. Alternatively, or in addition, a non-virtual or physical button may be designed into a smart
  phone 100 with similar functionality as the virtual button.
  The button, virtual or physical may include the following modes of function:
  1) Audio-Video Operation: The button may be tapped , e.g. for less than one second duration,
  and video recording begins using camera 205 and microphone 111 and simultaneously beginning
0 transmission (step 307) of the video recording begins. A second tap stops the recording and stops

  transmission and enables reception (step 407). Toggling between states of recording/transmission
  and enabling reception (step 407) may be performed by successively tapping the button.
  2) Audio-Video ("Push-to-talk") The button is held or touched for a defined period of time, e.g 2
  seconds. Video recording begins using camera 205 and microphone 111 and simultaneously
  beginning transmission (step 307) of the video recording as in mode 1. Release of the button then
  ends recording/ transmission and enables receiving (step 407) of video content.
  3) Audio Only: The button is slid up and released immediately and audio recording (without live
  images captured from camera 205) using microphone 111 and transmission (step 307) begins.
  When the button is slid back to its original position audio recording/transmission is stopped and
  receiving is enabled (step 407). The button may be held down for a period, e.g. two seconds,
  while in the slid up position and the button behaves as in mode 2 above but with audio
  recording/transmission only. Releasing the button in the slid up position stops audio-recording
  and transmission.
  Example: Client 100 under Computer Control
  According to other embodiments of the present invention, one or more client computer systems
  100 may operate autonomously without requiring intervention of a (human) user. Processor 110
  and/or another processor attached to computer system 100 may be programmed to control the
  operation of client computer system 100. Processor 110 may be configured to receive and
  transmit messages 250 simultaneously for instance within two independent message threads.
0 Processor 110 may be programmed to analyze, process and/or parse audio only and/or audio
  video messages 250 being received and to respond accordingly, by transmitting a message 250 to
  other users of the thread relevant to the received message 250. Processor 110 may be
  programmed to respond with a message 250 including educational or advertising content relevant
  to the audio and or visual content being shared by the users of the thread. An example, a user
5 while shopping may in a message transmit an image of a product for which he/she wishes to
  receive more information. Client 100 receiving message 250 may process the images in message
  250 and recognize the product, for instance using optical character recognition or bar code.
  Client 100 may respond with a message 250 including advertising or other information such as
  price and/or service information.

  Another example of an embodiment of the present invention in which clients 100 are under
  processor control is a camera security system. . Multiple security cameras may be attached
  individually to client transmitters 100T and programmed to transmit by unicast or multicast to
  one or more client recipients 100R. A user, e.g. security personnel, may view the display of
  client transmitter 100T for suspicious activity at any/all of the sites of client transmitters 100T.
  One or more client recipients 10OR may be fixed or mobile computer systems. The decision to
  transmit (decision block 304), may be previously programmed based on time interval or local
  image processing, e.g. significant features in a difference images between image frames.
  Alternatively, image processing may be performed elsewhere in network 106. Client recipient
  10OR may receive video messages 250 in a round-robin or random fashion, for example. If a
  significant event occurs such as suspicious activity based on one of messages 250, an interrupt to
  the round robin may be signaled by one of client transmitters 100T through management server
  205a, by one of the users of client recipients 10OR through management server 205a, video
  server 206 or by management server 205 based on the on-the-fly image processing. Central
  archiving of all the video messages is maintained at video data system 206 as is required in a
  security system for providing evidence.

        captured first message before the capturing of the first message ends; and
        while in the receiving mode, the method includes:
                receiving a second message of contiguous streaming multimedia data from an
        intermediary transmitting location in the network; and
                beginning displaying the received second message on the mobile communication
        device before the receiving of the second message ends;
        wherein, while receiving and displaying the second message in the receiving mode, the
switching includes interrupting the displaying of the second message, switching to operating in
the transmitting mode to capture the first message, and returning to the receiving mode to finish
the displaying of the second message, wherein a remaining portion of the second message is
queued for displaying after completing the capture of the first message.
