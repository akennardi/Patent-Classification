TECHNICAL FIELD
The invention refers to a purification and recycling system, particular refers to a
purification and recycling system for exhausted gas for activated carbon production.
BACKGROUND
In the existing technology for purifying the exhausted gas, the solution containing
chemical activator is used to blend with the wooden raw material before heating and
drying, so as to allow the chemical activator to stay in the wooden raw material,
thereby realizing the recycling of chemical activator. In this way, although partial
chemical activator in the solution can be recycled through the wooden raw material,
the use of solution to capture the chemical activator by spraying on the exhausted gas
may not efficient capture the chemical activator, and the solution obtained after being
sprayed on the exhausted gas may have low concentration of the chemical activator,
and it may not be easy for the wooden raw material to absorb the chemical activator,
in addition, when the wooden raw material blended with the solution is dried, partial
chemical activator may be taken away by vapor, which may cause low recycling rate
of chemical activator.

      1. The purification and recycling system for exhausted gas for activated carbon
production, comprising an absorber, which comprises an absorber body having a
                                            2

cavity, gas inlet, gas outlet, feed port and discharge port, and also comprises belt
conveyor disposed in the cavity and connected with the feed port and the discharge
port, for conveying raw material for activated carbon production between the feed
port and the discharge port; and further comprising a feed hopper, disposed at the feed
port, for storing the raw material for activated carbon production; a limitation device,
disposed on the absorber body and placed in the cavity, for coordinating with the belt
conveyor to limit thickness of the raw material for activated carbon production on a
belt of the belt conveyor to 500-550mm; a pipeline with one end communicated with
the gas inlet and the other end communicated with an exhausted gas outlet of an
activated carbon production equipment; two heating devices, one of which is disposed
at one end of the pipeline, and the other of which is disposed at the other end of the
pipeline, for heating the exhausted gas entering and exiting from the pipeline; two
fans, one of which is disposed at the gas inlet and the other of which is disposed at the
gas outlet; a fan controller, for respectively controlling the power of the two fans so as
to control the speed of the exhausted gas entering and exiting the pipe line to be
1.5m/s-2m/s. In the above embodiment, inputting the heated exhausted gas into the
absorber to contact with the raw materials for activated carbon production may
increase the absorbing rate of the chemical substance in the exhausted gas, since the
substance in gas state may contact with the raw material more sufficiently. Two
heating devices disposed at both ends of the pipeline may make sure the temperature
of the exhausted gas entering the absorber reaches a required valve, in order to make
sure the rate of absorbing. Two fans disposed at the gas inlet and the gas outlet may
make sure the gas flow in the cavity of the absorber, in order to make sure the
exhausted gas may sufficiently contact with the raw material. And the thickness of the
raw material of the belt of the belt conveyor is limited to 500-550 mm, which may
raise the use rate of the raw material for absorbing the chemical substance in the
exhausted gas. Controlling the speed of the exhausted gas exiting from the pipeline to
be 1.5-2m/s may help the raw material evenly and sufficiently to contact with the
exhausted gas and absorb the substance contained therein.
      2. The belt is 8-10m in length, and the belt moves at a speed of 1-2m/s and in an
opposite direction of the gas flowing in the absorber, which may help the raw material
                                              3

more sufficiently to contact with the exhausted gas and absorb the substance
contained therein

production comprises a heat preservation device, disposed on the pipeline, for
preserving the heat of the exhausted gas in the pipeline. This design may effectively
avoid the temperature of exhausted gas has a significant decrease, so that it is not
necessary to use a heating device with large power for raising the temperature of the
exhausted gas at the end of the pipeline connected with the gas inlet.
