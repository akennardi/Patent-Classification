                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[00031    Multifunctional nanoparticles have received attention in a wide range of applications
such as biosensors, diagnostic nanoprobes and targeted drug delivery systems. These efforts
have been driven to a large extent by the need to improve biological specificity with reduced
side effects in diagnosis and therapy through the precise, spatiotemporal control of agent
delivery in various physiological systems. In order to achieve this goal, efforts have been
dedicated to develop stimuli-responsive nanoplatforms. Environmental stimuli that have been
exploited for pinpointing the delivery efficiency include pH, temperature, enzymatic expression,
redox reaction and light induction. Among these activating signals, pH trigger is one of the most
extensively studied stimuli based on two types of pH differences: (a) pathological (e.g. tumor)
vs. normal tissues and (b) acidic intracellular compartments.
[00041    For example, due to the unusual acidity of the tumor extracellular microenvironment
(pHe ~ 6.5), several pHe-responsive nanosystems have been reported to increase the sensitivity
of tumor imaging or the efficacy of therapy. However, for polymer micelle compositions that
release drug by hydrolysis in acidic environments, it can take days for the release of the drug. In
that time period, the body can excrete or break down the micelles.
                                                    1

     WO 2012/039741                                                         PCT/US2011/001418
10005]     To target the acidic endo-/lysosomal compartments, nanovectors with pH-cleavable
linkers have been investigated to improve payload bioavailability. Furthermore, several smart
nanovectors with pH-induced charge conversion have been designed to increase drug efficacy.
Despite these advances, specific transport and activation of nanoparticles and their interactions
with different endocytic organelles during endocytosis in living cells is not well understood.
The endocytic system is comprised of a series of compartments that have distinctive roles in the
sorting, processing and degradation of internalized cargo. Selective targeting of different
endocytic compartments by pH-sensitive nanoparticles is particularly challenging due to the
short nanoparticle residence times (<mins) and small pH differences in these compartments (e.g.
<1 pH unit between early endosomes and lysosomes).
[0006]     Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, plays an essential role in normal
physiological processes such as development and wound repair. Pathological angiogenesis
occurs in tumors as well as a range of non-neoplastic diseases (e.g. diabetic retinopathy,
endometriosis). In cancer, the formation of new blood vessels from an existing vasculature
network is necessary for sustained tumor growth and exchange of nutrients and metabolic
wastes. In the tumor microenvironment model of carcinogenesis, angiogenesis represents the
last critical step to overcome the ischemia barrier. Acquisition of the angiogenic phenotype
results in rapid tumor expansion, as well as facilitation of local invasion and cancer metastasis.
[0007]     Tumor angiogenesis is a complex biological process that is orchestrated by a range of
angiogenic factors. Initially, stressed tumor cells (e.g. under hypoxia) secrete growth factors and
chemokines (e.g. VEGF-A) that stimulate quiescent vascular endothelium from adjacent host
vessels to sprout new capillaries. These growth factors activate or upregulate the expression of
integrins (e.g. avB3, avp5) on blood vessels, which promote endothelial cell migration and
survival in the creation of new vessel sprouts. Mechanistic understanding of tumor angiogenesis
has propelled the rapid development of a variety of antiangiogenesis agents. Bevacizumab
(Avastin@, Genentech) is a humanized anti-VEGF antibody that inhibits VEGF binding to and
signaling through VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 receptors that are over-expressed on angiogenic
endothelial cells. It is clinically approved in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy for the
treatment of colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer. Sunitinib
(Sutent@, Pfizer) and sorafenib (Nexavar@, Bayer Pharm. Corp.) are small molecule inhibitors
of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases including the VEGF receptors. They have been approved
                                                    2

     WO 2012/039741                                                            PCT/US2011/001418
by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, GI stromal tumors (sunitinib), and
unresectable liver cancer (sorafenib). A variety of other targeted agents are currently in late
stage clinical trials (e.g. Vitaxin and Cilengitide, which target ap   3 integrin, are in phase II/III
clinical trials for treatment of metastatic melanoma and prostate cancer).
 [0008]    Angiogenesis imaging holds considerable promise for early detection of cancer, as well
as post-therapy assessment of many new molecular-targeted antiangiogenic therapies. Two main
strategies, functional and targeted imaging, are currently employed in angiogenesis imaging.
Functional imaging strategy measures the blood flow, tumor blood volume and vascular
permeability of solid tumors. These imaging techniques include Doppler ultrasound, dynamic
contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. The major advantages are that they can be easily adapted and
have already been clinically implemented to monitor the efficacy of antiangiogenic drugs. The
major drawback is that these methods are not very specific toward tumor angiogenesis.
Recently, targeted imaging strategy is under intensive investigation with potential advantage of
more precise characterization of the state of endothelium in a tumor. Among key angiogenesis
targets are VEGF and its receptors, integrins (e.g. a4    3 and avps), and matrix metalloproteases.
Various imaging modalities, such as PET, MRI, optical imaging, ultrasound, are being
investigated with different degrees of success.
 [0009]    For cancer molecular imaging applications, achieving high contrast sensitivity and
specificity remains a formidable challenge. Currently, most conventional imaging probes utilize
an always ON design of contrast probes and the contrast sensitivity arises from the difference in
tissue accumulation of the imaging payloads. Low tissue concentrations of intended biomarkers,
lack of an amplification strategy to increase signal output, and high background signals are
several major limiting factors. For small molecular radiotracers (e.g.      64Cu-labeled  cRGD),
although the detection sensitivity is very high (e.g. <10-2 M), the contrast sensitivity is limited
by their relatively low binding affinity to the targeted receptors and insufficient accumulation of
imaging payloads in the targeted tissues. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have shown superb
affinity and specificity to a variety of cancer cell surface markers. However, radiolabeled or
fluorescently labeled mAbs are limited in molecular imaging applications due to their slow
clearance times and persistent high background signals in blood. In many conventional contrast
agents, the contrast sensitivity is intrinsically limited by the relatively low tissue concentrations

of cancer biomarkers on one hand, and high non-specific background signals from the always
ON nanoprobes on the other.
[0010]     What is needed are improved pH-responsive micelle compositions for therapeutic and
diagnostic applications, in particular compositions having one or more of: increased imaging
and/or drug payloads, prolonged blood circulation times, high contrast sensitivity and
specificity, rapid delivery of drug at the target site, and responsiveness within specific narrow
pH ranges (e.g. for targeting of tumors or specific organelles).

                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0048]     The present invention provides block copolymers and micelle compositions comprising
one or more of said block copolymers that are useful in one or more therapeutic and/or
diagnostic applications, such as treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, an
autophagy-related disease, or lysosomal storage disease, tumor imaging, and/or imaging of
intracellular organelles such as early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes. The invention
further provides methods for using the micelle compositions in such therapeutic and diagnostic
applications.
                                                     11

     WO 2012/039741                                                        PCT/US2011/001418
 [0049]   The block copolymers of the invention comprise a hydrophilic polymer segment and a
hydrophobic polymer segment, wherein the hydrophobic polymer segment comprises an
ionizable amine group to render pH sensitivity. The block copolymers form pH-activatable
micellar (pHAM) nanoparticles based on the supramolecular self-assembly of these ionizable
block copolymers (see e.g. Figure 1C). For example, Figure 1C illustrates the design principle
of a non-limiting example of a micelle of the invention. At higher pH, the block copolymers
assemble into micelles, whereas at lower pH, ionization of the amine group in the hydrophobic
polymer segment results in dissociation of the micelle. Without wishing to be bound by theory,
micelle formation and its thermodynamic stability are driven by the delicate balance between the
hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments. The ionizable groups may act as tunable
hydrophilic/hydrophobic blocks at different pH values, which may directly affect the dynamic
self-assembly of micelles. Without wishing to be bound by theory, micellization may sharpen
the ionization transition of the amines in the hydrophobic polymer segment, rendering fast and
ultra-sensitive pH response. Different block copolymers may be selected to provide micelles
having different transition pH values within physiological range, in order to achieve selective
activation within various environments, such as tumors (e.g. the extracellular environment of
tumors), or within specific endocytic compartments such as early or late endosomes or
lysosomes.
 [0050]   For therapeutic applications, a drug may be incorporated into the interior of the
micelles. Specific pH conditions (e.g. acidic pH present in tumors and endocytic compartments)
may lead to rapid protonation and dissociation of micelles into unimers, thereby releasing the
drug. In some embodiments, the micelle provides stable drug encapsulation at physiological pH
(pH 7.4), but can quickly release the drug in acidic environments. The micelles of the invention
may provide one or more advantages in therapeutic applications, such as: (1) disassociation of
the micelle (and rapid release of drug) within a short amount of time (e.g. within minutes) under
certain pH environments (e.g. acidic environments), as opposed to hours or days for previous
micelle compositions; (2) encapsulation of a high percentage of drug; (3) selective targeting of
drug delivery to the desired site (e.g. tumor or lysosome), which may enhance drug efficacy and
reduce toxicity to healthy cells (see e.g. Figure 15); (4) prolonged blood circulation times; (5)
responsiveness within specific narrow pH ranges (e.g. for targeting of specific organelles), and
(6) image-guided therapy, where imaging signals can be a predictive factor for the therapeutic
efficacy for the treatment.

     WO 2012/039741                                                         PCT/US2011/001418
[0051]     For diagnostic applications, a labeling moiety may be conjugated to the block
copolymer. In some embodiments, the label (e.g. a fluorescent label) is sequestered inside the
micelle when the pH favors micelle formation, and sequestration results in a decrease in label
signal (e.g. via fluorescence quenching, see e.g. Figure IC). Specific pH conditions (e.g. acidic
pH present in tumors and endocytic compartments) may lead to rapid protonation and
dissociation of micelles into unimers, thereby exposing the label, and increasing the label signal
(e.g. increasing fluorescence emission). The micelles of the invention may provide one or more
advantages in diagnostic applications, such as: (1) disassociation of the micelle (and rapid
increase in label signal) within a short amount of time (e.g. within minutes) under certain pH
environments (e.g. acidic environments), as opposed to hours or days for previous micelle
compositions; (2) increased imaging payloads; (3) selective targeting of label to the desired site
(e.g. tumor or particular endocytic compartment); (4) prolonged blood circulation times; (5)
responsiveness within specific narrow pH ranges (e.g. for targeting of specific organelles); and
(6) high contrast sensitivity and specificity. For example, the micelles may stay silent (or in the
OFF state) with minimum background signals under normal physiological conditions (e.g. blood
circulation), but imaging signals can be greatly amplified when the micelles reach their intended
molecular targets in vivo (e.g. extracellular tumor environment or cellular organelle). As a non
limiting example, upon specific targeting to angiogenic biomarkers (e.g. avpI), micelle
nanoprobes can be turned ON by pH activation inside endosomes/lysosomes after receptor
mediated endocytosis. Figure 12 illustrates an example of pH-activatable (pHAM) nanoprobes
for imaging of angiogenesis biomarkers (e.g. VEGFR2, avp3) in vascularized tumors. These
nanoprobes will stay "silent" (or OFF state) during blood circulation, but can be turned ON by
pH activation after receptor-mediated endocytosis in angiogenic tumor endothelial cells. Figure
13 illustrates the intracellular activation mechanism for a vascular targeted pHAM inside acidic
intracellular organelles (i.e. endosomes/lysosomes).
Definitions
[0052]     As used herein, "alkyl" indicates any saturated hydrocarbon moiety, including, for
example, straight chain, branched chain, or cyclic (including fused and spiro bicyclic and
polycyclic) saturated hydrocarbon moieties which may optionally be substituted with one or
more additional saturated hydrocarbon moieties.

     WO 2012/039741                                                         PCT/US2011/001418
[00531     As used herein, "pH-sensitive micelle", "pH-activatable micelle" and "pH-activatable
micellar (pHAM) nanoparticle" are used interchangeably herein to indicate a micelle comprising
one or more block copolymers, which disassociates depending on the pH (e.g. above or below a
certain pH). As a non-limiting example, at a certain pH, the block copolymer is substantially in
micellar form. As the pH changes (e.g. decreases), the micelles begin to disassociate, and as the
pH further changes (e.g. further decreases), the block copolymer is present substantially in
disassociated (non-micellar) form.
[0054]     A "nanoprobe" is used herein to indicate a pH-sensitive micelle which comprises an
imaging labeling moiety.
[00551     As used herein, "pH transition range" indicates the pH range over which the micelles
disassociate. In some embodiments, the pH transition range is the pH response sharpness. An
example of determining pH response sharpness is described in Example 2 below. Briefly, the
fluorescence intensity versus pH is measured for a block copolymer which comprises a
fluorescent label that is sequestered within the micelle (quenching fluorescence) when the block
copolymer is in micellar form (see e.g. Figure IC). As the pH changes (e.g. decreases), the
micelle disassociates, exposing the fluorescent label and resulting in fluorescence emission.
Normalized fluorescence intensity (NFI) vs. pH curves permit quantitative assessment of the pH
responsive properties of the micelle. NFI is calculated as the ratio of [F-Fmin]/[Fma-Fmin], where
F is the fluorescence intensity of the micelle at any given pH, and Fma. and Fmin are the maximal
and minimal fluorescence intensities at the ON/OFF states, respectively. pH response sharpness
is ApHo.9o%, the pH range in which the NFI value varies from 10% to 90%. For label-free
copolymers, dynamic light scattering (DLS) or an external fluorophore (e.g. pyrene) can be used
to characterize the pH-dependent micellization behaviors. For example, Figure 14A shows the
normalized light scattering intensity of several PEO-b-PR copolymers at 0.1 mg/mL
concentration as a function of pH. At different pH values, dramatic increase of light scattering
intensity was observed due to the formation of micelle nanoparticles from unimers in solution.
The hydrodynamic diameters of the resulting micelles were measured at 40-50 nm. The light
scattering data was further supported by examining the 11/13 ratios (at 372-374 and 382-384 nm,
respectively) of pyrene emissions (ex = 339 nm) (Figure 14B). 11/13 ratio reflects the polarity of
the pyrene environment where a partition of pyrene in the micelle core leads to decreased 11/13
values.

[0056]      As used herein, "pH transition value" (pHt) indicates the pH at which half of the
micelles are disassociated. An example of determining pH transition value is described in
Example 2 below. Briefly, for a block copolymer which comprises a fluorescent label that is
sequestered within the micelle (quenching fluorescence) when the block copolymer is in micellar
form, the pH transition value is the pH at which the fluorescence emission measured is 0.5 x
(Fmax+Fmin), where Fma. and Fmin are the maximal and minimal fluorescence intensities at the
ON/OFF states, respectively. For label-free copolymers, dynamic light scattering (DLS) or an
external fluorophore (e.g. pyrene) can be used to characterize the pH-dependent micellization
behaviors. For example, Figure 14A shows the normalized light scattering intensity of several
PEO-b-PR copolymers at 0.1 mg/mL concentration as a function of pH. At different pH values,
dramatic increase of light scattering intensity was observed due to the formation of micelle
nanoparticles from unimers in solution. The hydrodynamic diameters of the resulting micelles
were measured at 40-50 nm. The light scattering data was further supported by examining the
11/13 ratios (at 372-374 and 382-384 nm, respectively) of pyrene emissions (           = 339 nm)
(Figure 14B). 11/13 ratio reflects the polarity of the pyrene environment where a partition of
pyrene in the micelle core leads to decreased 11/13 values. Both light scattering and pyrene
experiments yielded similar pH transition values. The pHt values were 5.0, 6.2, 7.0, and 7.2 for
PEO-b-PDBA, PEO-b-PDPA, PEO-b-PC7A, PEO-b-PC6A, respectively.
[0057]      As used herein, the term "treating" refers to a clinical intervention designed to alter the
natural course of clinical pathology of the disease or disorder being treated (e.g., cancer).
Desirable effects of treatment include, for example, ameliorating or palliating the disease state,
slowing or reversing the progression of the disorder, remission, or improved prognosis.
[0058]      As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages
and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic
result. An effective amount can be provided in one or more administrations.
[00591      As used herein, "individual" indicates an animal, preferably a mammal, including
humans, primates, laboratory animals (e.g. rats, mice, etc.), farm animals (e.g. cows, sheep,
goats, pigs, etc.), pets (e.g. dogs, cats, etc.), and sport animals (e.g. horses, etc.). In some
embodiments, an individual is a human.

other monomers to form block polymers such as MPC-b-PDPA. PEO-b-PR block copolymers
can be synthesized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) or reversible addition

Volume: 58 Issue: 6 Pages: 379-410 (2005); Progress in Polymer Science Volume: 32 Issue: 1

[0077]     The hydrophobic polymer segment may be synthesized according to, e.g. Atom
Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) or reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer
(RAFT). An example of ATRP synthesis of a hydrophobic polymer segment may be found in
Example 1. In some embodiments, the polydispersity index (PDI) for the hydrophobic polymer
segment is less than about 1.2. In some embodiments, the polydispersity index (PDI) for the
hydrophobic polymer segment is less than about 1.1.
Labeling moiety
[0078]     The block copolymer may optionally comprise one or more labeling moieties (e.g. 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, or more). In some embodiments, the label is a fluorescent label. In some embodiments,
the fluorescent label is tetramethyl rhodamine (TMR). In some embodiments, the label is a near
infrared (NIR) label. In some embodiments, the NIR label is cypate or a cypate analog.
[0079]      When the block copolymer is a compound of Formula I, in some embodiments, R" is
CH 3 . In some embodiments, R" is -H. In some embodiments, m is 1 to 4. In some embodiments,
m is 2. In various embodiments, m is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. In some embodiments, y is 0.
In some embodiments, y is 1 to 6. In various embodiments, y is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In some
embodiments, y is 3.
[0080]     The labeling moiety may be conjugated to the copolymer directly or through a linker
moiety. Methods known in the art may be used to conjugate the labeling moiety to, for example,
the hydrophobic polymer. Examples of conjugation may be found in, for example, Examples 1
and 5 below.
[0081]     The micelles of the invention may advantageously have high imaging payloads. In
various embodiments, the micelles have at least about 500 dyes, at least about 1000, at least
about 1500, at least about 2000, at least about 2400, at least about 3000 dyes per micelle. In
comparison, typical immunofluorescent conjugates have 4 fluorophores per molecule, as a
higher number will lead to dye quenching and may also modify binding epitopes.
[0082]     Different labels may be preferred for the particular method of use. For example,
tetramethyirhodamine may be used, e.g., for in vitro cell study on confocal imaging, while for
animal imaging studies in vivo, NIR dyes may increase the tissue penetrations.

Micelle Compositions
[0086]     One or more block copolymers (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, or more) described herein may be used
to form a pH-sensitive micelle. In some embodiments, a composition comprises a single type of
micelle. In some embodiments, two or more (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, or more) different types of micelles
may be combined to form a mixed-micelle composition.
[0087]     The pH-sensitive micelle compositions of the invention may advantageously have a
narrow pH transition range, in contrast to other pH sensitive compositions in which the pH
response is very broad (i.e. 2 pH units). In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition
range of less than about 1 pH unit. In various embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition
range of less than about 0.9, less than about 0.8, less than about 0.7, less than about 0.6, less than
about 0.5, less than about 0.4, less than about 0.3, less than about 0.2, less than about 0.1 pH
unit. In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition range of less than about 0.5 pH
unit. In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition range of less than about 0.25 pH
unit.
[00881     When the micelles comprise a fluorescent label, the narrow pH responsive properties of
pHAM may improve the efficiency of fluorescence generation. Without wishing to be bound by
theory, the pH response of pHAM may originate from both homoFRET and PET mechanisms as
a result of the cooperative neutralization and micellization of the block copolymers (see e.g.
Figure IC). Compared with small molecular pH-sensitive dyes or PET-based micelles
(activations need 2 pH units), the sharpened pH response from pHAM may result in complete
turn-ON of the fluorophores with subtle changes of pH in tumor microenvironment (pHe = 6.5
6.9) or intracellular organelles (5.0-6.2).
[0089]     The micelles may have different pH transition values within physiological range, in
order to target specific cells or microenvironments. In some embodiments, the micelles have a
pH transition value of about 5 to about 8. In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH
transition value of about 5 to about 6. In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition
                                                    25

     WO 2012/039741                                                             PCT/US2011/001418
value of about 6 to about 7. In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition value of
about 7 to about 8. In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition value of about 6.3
to about 6.9 (e.g. tumor microenvironment). In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH
transition value of about 5.0 to about 6.2 (e.g. intracellular organelles). In some embodiments,
the micelles have a pH transition value of about 5.9 to about 6.2 (e.g. early endosomes). In some
embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition value of about 5.0 to about 5.5 (e.g. late
endosomes or lysosomes). As described in the Examples, nanoprobes 4, 3, 7 and 6 had
fluorescence transition pH values of 5.4, 6.3, 6.8 and 7.2, respectively.
[00901     Labeled micelles of the invention may advantageously have a large signal response
(e.g. a larger difference in signal between ON and OFF states). For example, when fluorescent
labels are used, the ratio of Fmna and Fmin (RF=Fma/Fmin) can be used to quantify the fluorescence
response between the ON/OFF states. As shown in the Examples, nanoprobes having RF values
in the range of 10 to 55 fold were made (Table 3), demonstrating the large fluorescence
response of the nanoprobes. In various embodiments, labeled micelles have a signal response of
at least about 10, at least about 20, at least about 30, at least about 40, at least about 50, at least
about 60.
[0091]     Without wishing to be bound by theory, the use of micelles in cancer therapy may
enhance anti-tumor efficacy and reduce toxicity to healthy tissues, in part due to the size of the
micelles. While small molecules such as certain chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. doxorubicin) can
enter both normal and tumor tissues, non-targeted micelle nanoparticles may preferentially cross
leaky tumor vasculature (see e.g. Figure 15). In some embodiments, the micelles have a size of
about 10 to about 200 nm. In some embodiments, the micelles have a size of about 20 to about
100 nm. In some embodiments, the micelles have a size of about 30 to about 50 nm.
[0092]     Examples of methods of generating micelles from block copolymers may be found in
the Examples below. For example, block copolymer is first dissolved in organic solvent (e.g.
THF) and may be added to an aqueous solution, optionally under sonication, wherein the
copolymer self-assemble to form micelles in the solution.
[0093]     In some embodiments, the micelle further comprises a drug. In some embodiments, the
micelle further comprises a labeling moiety. In some embodiments, the micelle further
comprises a targeting moiety. In some embodiments, the micelle further comprises a drug and a
                                                     26

labeling moiety. In some embodiments, the micelle further comprises a drug and a targeting
moiety. In some embodiments, the micelle further comprises a targeting moiety and a labeling
moiety. In some embodiments, the micelle further comprises a drug, a targeting moiety, and a
labeling moiety.
Targeting Moieties
[0094]      The micelles may further optionally comprise a targeting moiety in therapeutic or
diagnostic applications. For example, a targeting moiety can target a cancer cell surface marker,
such as an angiogenesis biomarker. For example, in diagnostic applications, targeted nanoprobes
may be useful for diagnosing tumors and/or the efficacy assessment of molecular-targeted
antiangiogenic therapies, where the expression levels of the therapeutic targets (e.g. VEGFR2,
aVp 3 ) can be specifically measured.
[0095]      In some embodiments, the targeting moiety binds to an angiogenesis biomarker. In
some embodiments, the angiogenesis biomarker is VEGF-VEGFR complex or endoglin. In some
embodiments, the targeting moiety binds to VEGFR2. In some embodiments, the targeting
moiety is a Fab' fragment of RAFL-1 mAb. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety binds to
aV0 3 integrin. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety is cRGDfK.
[00961      The targeting moiety may be conjugated to the block copolymer (e.g., the hydrophilic
polymer segment) by methods known in the art. Examples of conjugation may be found in the
Examples below.
Drug Encapsulation
[0097]      The micelles may further optionally comprise a drug encapsulated within the micelle.
Due to the hydrophobic interior of the micelle, hydrophobic drugs may be more readily
encapsulated within the micelles. In some embodiments, the drug is hydrophobic and has low
water solubility. In some embodiments, the drug has a log p of about 2 to about 8. In some
embodiments, the drug is a chemotherapeutic agent. In some embodiments, the drug is
doxorubicin. In some embodiments, the drug is     p-lapachone. In some embodiments, the drug is
paclitaxel.

[0098]     The drug may be incorporated into the micelles using methods known in the art, such
as solvent evaporation. Examples of drug incorporation may be found in, e.g. Example 4 below.
Briefly, for example, drug may be encapsulated in micelles by first dissolving the drug and the
block co-polymer in organic solution. Addition of this solution to an aqueous solution,
optionally under sonication, may result in micelle-encapsulated drug.
Therapeutic and Diagnostic Methods
10099]     Micelles comprising a drug may be used to treat e.g. cancers, cardiovascular disease,
inflamation, an autophagy-related disease, or lysosomal storage disease, or other diseases
wherein the drug may be delivered to the appropriate location due to localized pH differences
(e.g. a pH different from physiological pH (7.4)). Micelles for therapeutic methods may
optionally further comprise a labeling moiety (e.g. to assist in the imaging of the treatment)
and/or a targeting moiety (e.g. to target a specific cell surface marker or to target the micelles for
endocytic delivery). In some embodiments, the disorder treated is a cancer. In some
embodiments, the cancer comprises a solid tumor. In embodiments wherein the micelle
comprises a targeting moiety, non-solid cancers may be treated. In some embodiments, the
disorder treated is lysosomal storage disease. In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH
transition value of about 6.3 to about 7.2 (e.g. for delivery to the tumor microenvironment). In
some embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition value of about 5.0 to about 6.5 (e.g. for
delivery to intracellular organelles). In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition
value of about 6.2 or above 6.2 (e.g. for delivery to early endosomes). In some embodiments,
the micelles have a pH transition value of about 5.5 (e.g. for delivery to late endosomes or
lysosomes). In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition value of about 6.3 to about
6.9. In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition value of about 5.0 to about 6.2. In
some embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition value of about 5.9 to about 6.2. In some
embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition value of about 5.0 to about 5.5. As described in
the Examples, nanoprobes 4, 3, 7 and 6 have fluorescence transition pH values of 5.4, 6.3, 6.8
and 7.2, respectively. In some embodiments, non-targeted pHAM with higher pHt (e.g. 7.2, 6.8)
may be used to delivery drug to tumors. In some embodiments, targeted pHAM with lower pHt
(e.g. 5.4, 6.3) may be used to delivery drug to endocytic compartments.
[0100]     Micelles comprising a labeling moiety may be used in imaging applications, for
example, imaging tumors or endocytic compartments. Micelles for diagnostic methods may
                                                    28

optionally further comprise a targeting moiety (e.g. to target a specific cell surface marker or to
target the micelles for endocytic delivery). In some embodiments, the method is used to diagnose
a tumor in the individual. In some embodiments, the method is used to monitor a tumor in the
individual, for example to monitor the effects of a treatment. In some embodiments, the micelle
is used for imaging early endosomal activity. In some embodiments, the micelle is used for
imaging late endosomal activity. In some embodiments, the micelle is used for imaging
lysosomal activity. In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition value of about 6.3 to
about 7.2 (e.g. for delivery to the tumor microenvironment). In some embodiments, the micelles
have a pH transition value of about 5.0 to about 6.5 (e.g. for delivery to intracellular organelles).
In some embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition value of about 6.2 or above 6.2 (e.g. for

embodiments, the micelles have a pH transition value of about 5.0 to about 5.5 (e.g. for imaging
late endosomes or lysosomes). As described in the Examples, nanoprobes 4, 3, 7 and 6 have
fluorescence transition pH values of 5.4, 6.3, 6.8 and 7.2, respectively. In some embodiments,
non-targeted pHAM with higher pHt (e.g. 7.2, 6.8) may be used for imaging tumors. In some
embodiments, targeted pHAM with lower pHt (e.g. 5.4, 6.3) may be used for imaging endocytic

[0101]    More than one type of label may be used in the compositions of the invention. For
example, different NIR fluorophores (e.g. with distinctive excitation/emission wavelengths) may
be used to generate a series of multi-chromatic nanoprobes for different biomarkers. This
creates a multichromatic set of nanoprobes that allow the simultaneous imaging of several
molecular targets (e.g. VEGFR2 and avN3) which may further improve the imaging efficacy of
angiogenic tumor vasculature.
[0102]    The invention further provides a composition comprising a micelle and a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such composition may be administered to the individual by

[0106]    2-(Tetramethyleneimino) ethanol (C5A), 2-(pentamethyleneimino) ethanol (C6A) and
N,N,N',N",N"-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
2-(Hexamethyleneimino) ethanol (C7A) and 2-(dibutylamino) ethanol (DBA) were purchased
from Alfa Aesar Company and TCI America Inc., respectively. NHS-tetramethyl rhodamine
(NHS-TMR) was purchased from Invitrogen Company. Monomers 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl
methacrylate (DMA-MA), 2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DEA-MA), 2-(diisopropyl
anino)ethyl methacrylate (DPA-MA) and 2-aminoethyl methacrylate (AMA) were purchased
from Polyscience Company. AMA was recrystallized twice with isopropanol and ethyl acetate
(3:7). PEG macroinitiator, MeO-PEG 1 14 -Br, was prepared from 2-bromo-2-methyl propanoyl

bromide and MeO-PEGI 14 -OH according to the procedure in literature (Bronstein et al., J. Phys.
Chem. B, 2005, 109:18786-18798). Other solvents and reagents were used as received from
Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher Scientific Inc.
[0107]    All new methacrylate monomers (C5A-MA, C6A-MA, C7A-MA, DBA-MA) were
synthesized following a similar method. Synthesis of 2-(pentamethyleneimino)ethyl
methacrylate (C6A-MA) is described as a representative procedure. First, 2
(pentamethyleneimino)ethanol (12.9 g, 0.1 mol), triethylamine (10.1 g, 0.1 mol), and inhibitor
hydroquinone (0.11 g, 0.001 mol) were dissolved in 100 mL Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and then
methacryloyl chloride (10.4 g, 0.1 mol) was added dropwise into a three-neck flask. The
solution was refluxed in THF for 2 hrs. After reaction, the solution was filtered to remove the
precipitated triethylamine-HCl salts, and THF solvent was removed by rotovap. The resulting
residue was distilled in vacuo (83~87 *C at 0.05 mm Hg) as a colorless liquid. After syntheses,
the monomers were characterized by 1H NMR. All the NMR spectra were obtained in CDCl 3
using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference on a Varian 500MHz 'H NMR
spectrometer. The characterization and yield for the monomers are as following are shown in

II. Synthesis of PEO-b-PR and PEO-b-(PR-r-TMR) block copolymers
[0108]     Two series of block copolymers (PEO-b-PR (y-0) and PEO-b-PR-r-TMR, Figure 1A)
with different tertiary amine- containing segments (PR) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)
segments were made by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP; Tsarevsky &
Matyjaszewski, Chem. Rev. 2007, 107:2270-2299; Ma et al., Macromolecules 2003, 36:3475
3484). In the linear di-alkyl series (see Figure 1B, R groups 1, 2, 3, and 4) the chain length was
varied from methyl to butyl groups; in the cyclic series (see Figure IB, R groups 5, 6 and 7), the
ring size from 5- to 7-membered rings was varied.
[01091     A pH-insensitive dye, tetramethyl rhodamine (TMR; Albertazzi et al. Am. Chem. Soc.
2010, 132:18158-18167) was used as a model fluorophore and conjugated in the PR block as an
imaging beacon to investigate the pH responsive properties of pHAM nanoparticles. As
described in more detail below, at higher pH, neutral PR segments co-operatively self-assemble
into the hydrophobic cores of micelles, which results in the aggregation of fluorophores and
quenching of fluorescent signals through mechanisms of F6rster resonance energy transfer
between TMR molecules (homo-FRET) and photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) from tertiary
amines to TMR (Kobayashi et al., Chem. Rev. 2010, 110:2620-2640; Uchiyama et al., Chem. Int.
Ed. 2008, 47:4667-4669; Lakowicz, PrinciplesofFluorescenceSpectroscopy, 3rd ed., Springer,
New York City, 2006, pp. 443-475; Diaz-Femandez et al., Chem. Eur. J. 2006, 12:921-930). At
lower pH, PR segments become protonated and positively charged, leading to micelle
disassembly and dramatic increase in fluorescence emission due to the increase in TMR distance
and decrease in PeT (Figure 1C)).

[0110]    PEO-b-PR copolymers (Figure 2A) were first synthesized by atom transfer radical
polymerization (ATRP) method. The dye-free copolymers were used in polymer
characterizations and measurement of pKa and critical micelle concentrations (Tables 2 and 3).
PEO-b-PDPA is used as an example to illustrate the procedure. First, DPA-MA (1.06 g, 5
mmol), PMDETA (21 pL, 0.1 mmol), and MeO-PEGI 14-Br (0.5 g, 0.1 mmol) were charged into
a polymerization tube. Then a mixture of 2-propanol (2 mL) and DMF (2 mL) was added to
dissolve the monomer and initiator. After three cycles of freeze-pump-thaw to remove oxygen,
CuBr (14 mg, 0.1 mmol) was added into the reaction tube under nitrogen atmosphere, and the
tube was sealed in vacuo. The polymerization was carried out at 40 *C for 8 hrs. After
polymerization, the reaction mixture was diluted with 10 mL THF, and passed through an A12 0 3
column to remove the catalyst. The THF solvent was removed by rotovap. The residue was
dialyzed in distilled water and lyophilized to obtain a white powder. The resulting PEO-b-PR
copolymers were characterized by 'H 500 MHz NMR, gel permeation chromatography
(Viscotech GPCmax, PLgel 5pm MIXED-D columns by Polymer Labs, THF as eluent at 1
mL/min). Table 2 lists the yield, molecular weights (M, and Mw) and polydispersity index
(PDI) of each copolymer. PEO-b-PDPA (without labeling moiety) indicates block copolymer

[01111    To introduce the TMR dye, AMA was used in the copolymer synthesis (Figure 2B).
Synthesis of PEO-b-(PR-r-AMA) copolymers followed the procedure described above. Three

of the AMA monomer to the initiator (ratio = 3). Similar yields and molecular weights were
obtained for these PEO-b-(PR-r-AMA) copolymers. For TMR conjugation, PEO-b-(PR-r
AMA) (50 mg) was first dissolved in 2 mL DMF. Then NHS-TMR ester (1.5 equivalents to the
molar amount of the primary amino group) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room
temperature for two days. The copolymers were purified by preparative gel permeation
chromatography (PLgel Prep 10im 1OE3A 300x25mm columns by Varian, THF as eluent at 5
mL/min) to remove the free dye molecules. The produced PEO-b-(PR-r-TMR) copolymers
were lyophilized and kept at -20 *C for storage. In the TMR-containing copolymers, the number
of repeating units in the PR block was 70.
III. Preparation of micelle nanoparticles
[0112]     Micelles were prepared following a solvent evaporation method as previously
published (Nasongkla et al., Nano. Lett. 2006, 6:2427-2430). In the example of PEO-b-(PDPA
r-TMR), 24 mg of the copolymer was first dissolved in 1 mL THF and then added into 4 mL
distilled water dropwise under sonication. The THF was allowed to evaporate for 4 hrs by air
stream. Then distilled water was added to adjust the polymer concentration to 4 mg/mL as a
stock solution. After micelle formation, the nanoparticles were characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 1200 EX model) for micelle size and morphology, dynamic
light scattering (DLS, Malvern MicroV model, He-Ne laser, X= 632 nm) for hydrodynamic
diameter (Dh)

pHAM nanoprobes (3, 4, 6, 7) and PEO-b-(PDMA-r-TMR) were obtained on a Hitachi
fluorometer (F-7500 model). For each copolymer, the sample was initially prepared in MilliQ
water at the concentration of 6 mg/mL. Then the stock solution was diluted in 0.2 M citric
phosphate buffers with different pH values. The terminal polymer concentration was controlled
at 0.1 mg/mL. The nanoprobe was excited at 545 nm, and the emission spectra were collected
from 560 to 700 nm. The emission and excitation slits were both 5 nm.
[0115]     For fluorescence lifetime measurements, the fluorescence decays of TMR from PEO-b
(PDPA-r-TMR) (3) and PEO-b-(PDBA-r-TMR) (4) (both at 0.1 mg /mL) were measured. For
nanoprobe 3 (pHI = 6.3), the life times were measured at pH = 7.4 and 5.5 (above and below the
pHt, respectively) in sodium phosphate/citric acid buffers. Similarly, for nanoprobe 4 (pHi
5.4), the life times were measured at pH = 7.4 and 4.9. In both experiments, free TMR dye
(0.005 mg/mL) was also measured as a control. These studies were carried out on a LaserStrobe
fluorescence lifetime instrument (Photon Technology International, Inc., Birmingham, NJ),
which consists of a nitrogen laser (GL-3300) linked to a dye laser (GL 302) and a stroboscopic
detector. C-540A (Exciton, Inc., Dayton, OH) dye solution was used to generate an excitation
wavelength of 540 nm. The decay curves were analyzed at the wavelength of 570 nm. The
emission monochromator slit was at 4 nm. All measurements were conducted at room
temperature. The IRF (instrument response function) was determined by measuring scattered
light from a solution of glycogen. The fluorescence intensity decay data were analyzed by the
single exponential decay function, using the software supplied with the PTI instrument.
[0116]     Fluorescent images of a series of nanoprobe solutions at different pH values illustrate a
sharp fluorescence transition for each nanoprobe, illustrating the tunable, ultra pH responsive
properties of pHAM nanoprobes.
[01171     Normalized fluorescence intensity (NFI) vs. pH curves (Figure 3A) permitted
quantitative assessment of the pH responsive properties of the pHAM nanoprobes. NFI was
calculated as the ratio of [F-Fmin]/[Fmax-Fmin], where F was the fluorescence intensity of the
nanoprobe at any given pH, and Fma and Fmin was the maximal and minimal fluorescence
intensities at the ON/OFF states, respectively. The emission intensity at 580 nrm was used to
quantify the ultra-pH response for different pHAM nanoprobes as shown in Figure 3A. To
quantify the sharpness in pH response, ApHio.9 o%, the pH range in which the NFI value varies

from 10% to 90%, for all the pHAM nanoprobes was evaluated. The sharpness values were
0.21, 0.23, 0.24, and 0.20 pH unit for nanoprobes 4, 6, 3 and 7, respectively.
[0118]      The small values of ApH1o.9o% indicate a remarkable pH sensitivity as it represents a <
2-fold change in proton concentration (i.e. [H+] ioo-/r[M90% =             1 0 ApH10-90%).  In comparison, for
small molecular dyes (Urano, et al., Nat. Med 2009, 15:104-109), the sharpness value is about 2
pH unit (100-fold in [H*]) for the same degree of emission change, consistent with Henderson
Hasselbalch equation (Atkins & De Paula, Physical Chemistry, Oxford University Press, 2009).
In addition to the pH sharpness, the ratio of Fmax and Fmin (RF=Fmax/Fmin) was also measured to
quantify the fluorescence response between the ON/OFF states. The values of RF range from 10
to 55 fold (Table 3), demonstrating the large fluorescence response of the nanoprobes.
Consistent with the decreased emission intensity in the micelles, the data demonstrated that
excited state of TMR had a much shorter life time (e.g. 0.44 ns for nanoprobe 3, in the micelles
(pH = 7.4) than the free dye (1.97 ns) at pH 7.4 or the disassembled unimers at pH 5.5 (1.84 ns).

[01191      In summary, pH-activatable micellar nanoparticles demonstrate tunability and ultra
sensitive pH response in the physiological range (pH 5.0-7.4), large increases in emission
intensity between ON/OFF states (up to 55 times), and only require < 0.25 pH for activation.
II. pH temporal response
[01201      This study used stopped-flow measurements to gauge fluorescence activation in
synthesized pH-activatable micellar nanoparticles. Stopped-flow measurements of pHAM

nanoprobes were conducted using a Bio-Logic SFM-3 instrument. All experiments were carried
out at room temperature at different pH values in the sodium phosphate/citric acid buffer. A
monochromator was used for excitation at 540 nm and the fluorescence intensity at 570 nm long
pass was recorded. Experiments were controlled by BioKine 16 V 3.03 software and had an
estimated dead time of 1.5 ms.
[01211    The stopped-flow experiments showed that fluorescence activation was very fast, with
most nanoprobes fully activated within 5 ms at lower pH (e.g. 'Ti/2 = 3.7 ms for 4, Figure
3B).The ultra-sensitive pH response was only observed with nanoprobes 4, 3, 7 and 6. The
fluorescence transition pH values (pHt, the pH at which F = 0.5 x (Fmax+Fmin)) were 5.4, 6.3, 6.8
and 7.2 for nanoprobes 4, 3, 7 and 6, respectively (Figure 3A). The other copolymers either did
not show any pH response (e.g., 1) or only broad pH responses (e.g. 2, 5, data not shown).
[0122]    In summary, the stopped-flow experiments demonstrated that the pH-activatable
micellar nanoparticles have fast temporal response in the range of less than 5 ms.
III. pH titration curves of copolymers and constituent monomers and subsequent 'H NMR
spectra analysis
[01231    Without being bound to theory, it is believed that hydrophobic micellization is the
driving force of the ultra-pH responsive properties of pHAM, and a critical threshold of
hydrophobicity in the PR segment is necessary to achieve the co-operative response. To test this
hypothesis, the pH titration curves of two representative block copolymers, 5 and 7, and their
corresponding monomers were compared (Figure 4A).
[01241    In a typical procedure, a PEO-b-PR copolymer or its corresponding monomer was first
dissolved in 0.1 N HCl to reach the final concentration of 5-10 mg/mL. pH titration was carried
out by adding small volumes (50-100 ptL increments) of 0.1 N NaOH solution under stirring.
The pH increase in the range of 2 to 11 was monitored as a function of total added volume of
NaOH (VNaOH). The pH values were measured using a Mettler Toledo pH meter with a
microelectrode. Figure 4A shows the representative titration curves for the cyclic PEO-b-PR
copolymers (5 and 7) and corresponding monomers. For each sample, the pKa value was
calculated as the pH in the middle of the two equivalence points in the titration curve. The pKa
values for all the PEO-b-PR copolymers and corresponding monomers were listed in Table 3.
                                                  38

     WO 2012/039741                                                         PCT/US2011/001418
[0125]    Both monomers behaved like small ionizable molecules with broad pH responses over
added volumes of NaOH. Copolymer 5 showed a similar broad pH response. In contrast,
copolymer 7 had a dramatically sharpened pH transition, demonstrating a greatly increased
buffer capacity. Deuterated 'H NMR spectra of 5 and 7 at different ionization states of tertiary
amines ([R 3NH]/[R 3N]o) further support the hypothesis (Figure 4B). The PEO segment did not
change its peak intensity and was used as an internal standard. Throughout the ionization states,
the proton resonance peaks for the PR segment of 5 were easily visualized although the peak
intensity decreased with broadened peak width at higher pH, reflecting the bulk aggregation
behavior of the copolymer. For 7, neutral state of the copolymer (i.e. 0%) led to completely
suppressed resonance peaks in the PR segment due to the formation of highly compact micelle
cores. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of 7 in aqueous solution demonstrated the
formation of micelles above its pKa (6.7) at pH 7.4 and complete micelle dissociation at pH 5.5
(Figure 4C). In comparison, no micelles were formed from 5 at either pH (data not shown).
[0126]    In summary, these data suggested that hydrophobic micellization was the primary
driving force for the observed cooperative deprotonation behavior of the ammonium groups in 7.
IV. Measurement of critical micelle concentration (CMC) of PEO-b-PR diblock copolymers
101271    CMC of each PEO-b-PR copolymer was measured in the 0.2 M sodium phosphate
buffer at pH 7.4. First, a copolymer stock solution (3 mg/mL) was diluted to different
concentrations in the same buffer. In each solution, 5iL pyrene in THF solution (2x 104 mol/L)
was added to 2 mL polymer solution to produce the final pyrene concentration at 5x 10-7 mol/L.
The fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Hitachi fluoremeter (F-7500 model) with the
excitation wavelength of 339 nm and the excitation and emission slits at 10.0 nm and 1.0 nm,
respectively. The I and 13 values were measured as the maximum emission intensity at ca. 372
and 382 nm, respectively. 11/13 ratio was plotted as a function of polymer concentration at
different pH values. 11/13 ratio reflects the polarity of the pyrene environment where partition of
pyrene in the hydrophobic micelle core leads to decreased 11/13 values (Kalyanasundaram et al.,
J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977, 99:2039-2044; Winnik, Chem. Rev. 1993, 93:587-614). CMC values
were measured as the threshold polymer concentration at which micelles were formed in
solution. To avoid TMR interference, PEO-b-PR copolymers without TMR conjugation were
used in these studies. The CMC values at pH 7.4 were listed in Table 3.

EXAMPLE 3: Location and Mechanism of Intracellular pHAM (TMR nanoprobes) Activation.
I. Confocal laser scanning microscopy in human lung carcinoma cells
[01281    To investigate the intracellular activations of pHAM, nanoprobe 3 in human H2009
lung cancer cells was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy and the activation of
pHAM nanoprobes in H2009 cells was quantified by relative fluorescence intensity (Figure 5).
[0129]    H2009 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, CA) supplemented with
5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 pig/mL streptomycin at 37 *C in 5%
C02 atmosphere. For subcellular trafficking and colocalization studies, H2009 cells were
transfected with baculovirus using Organelle LightsTM Endosomes-GFP and Lysosomes-GFP
BacMam 1.0 kits (Molecular Probes, OR) for Rab5a (early endosome marker) and Lamp1 (late
endosome/lysosome marker) labeling, respectively. Cells were then cultured in growth medium
for further analysis. For confocal imaging studies of micelle uptake and intracellular activation,
H2009 cells were plated in glass bottom dishes (MatTek, MA) in 2 mL complete RPMI medium
and incubated with nanoprobe 3 at a polymer concentration of 0.2 mg/mL at pH 7.4. Confocal
images were captured at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after addition of micelles. After 60 min
incubation, 0.1 N HCl solution (250 tL) was added into medium to acidify the medium pH to
5.0 and cells were immediately imaged. The images were analyzed using Image-J software. Five
independent measurements were presented as the mean ± standard deviation. For colocalization
experiments, transfected cells expressing Rab5a-GFP or Lamp 1-GFP were seeded in glass
bottom dishes in 2 mL complete RPMI medium without phenol red. After 24 hr cell growth, 0.4
mg of nanoprobe 3 or 4 (5 mg/mL copolymer solution) in PBS (pH 7.4) was added into medium
to give a final polymer concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. Images were captured at designated time
points by a Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000-E confocal microscope with a 100x objective lens. GFP
and TMR were excited at 488 and 543 nm, respectively. The emission wavelengths of GFP and
TMR were 515 and 595 nm, respectively.
 [0130]   Because pHAM nanoprobes are "silent" at neutral pH, they were directly applied in the
culture medium and the kinetics of their internalization was monitored without the need to
remove the medium. Right after the nanoprobe addition, neither the H2009 cells nor the
medium showed observable fluorescence signal. At 15 min, punctuate fluorescent dots appeared
inside the cells. The number of fluorescent dots increased over time. Signal to noise ratio of the
                                                    40

H2009 cells (SNRceni, using fluorescence intensity at time 0 as the background noise) allowed
further quantification of the increased nanoprobe uptake and activation over time. At 60 min, a
31-fold increase in SNRell (2.14t0.17x10 3) was observed over the medium (SNRmed=69.3±9.1,
P<0.001) where majority of the nanoprobes were still present (Figure 5A). Then 0.1N HCl
solution was added to acidify the medium pH to 5.0 and considerable increase in fluorescence
intensity in the medium background was found. A reverse trend of fluorescence contrast was
observed, where SNRcenl was 74% of SNRMed (P<0.05) (Figure 5B).
[0131]     These data illustrated that pHAM nanoprobes can dramatically increase the contrast
sensitivity of cancer cells compared to potentially always ON nanoprobes (as in the case after
HCl was added).
II. Activation of pHAM in endocytic organelles in human lung cancer cells
[0132]     To further investigate whether different endocytic organelles can selectively activate
pHAM, H2009 cells were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused Rab5a and
Lamp I biomarkers in early endosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes, respectively.
 101331    H2009 cells were plated in glass bottom dishes (MatTek, MA) in 2 mL complete RPMI
medium and incubated with nanoprobe 3 at a polymer concentration of 0.2 mg/mL at pH 7.4.
Confocal images were captured at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after addition of micelles. After 60
min incubation, 0.1 N HCl solution (250 ptL) was added into medium to acidify the medium pH
to 5.0 and cells were immediately imaged. The images were analyzed using Image-J software.
Five independent measurements were presented as the mean ± standard deviation. For
colocalization experiments, transfected cells expressing Rab5a-GFP or Lampl-GFP were seeded
in glass bottom dishes in 2 mL complete RPMI medium without phenol red. After 24 hr cell
growth, 0.4 mg of nanoprobe 3 or 4 (5 mg/mL copolymer solution) in PBS (pH 7.4) was added
into medium to give a final polymer concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. Images were captured at
designated time points by a Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000-E confocal microscope with a 100 x
objective lens. GFP and TMR were excited at 488 and 543 nm, respectively. The emission
wavelengths of GFP and TMR were 515 and 595 nm, respectively. For experiments on the
inhibition of acidification of lysosomes with bafilomycin A l and its effect on intracellular
activation of nanoprobes 3 and 4, transfected H2009 cells expressing Lamp 1-GFP was seeded in
glass bottom dishes in 2 mL complete RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red. After 24 h cell
                                                   41

     WO 2012/039741                                                         PCT/US2011/001418
growth, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing bafilomycin Al (final
concentration = 1 pM) and cells were incubated at 37 *C for 1 h. Then, 0.4 mg of nanoprobe 3 or
4 in PBS (pH 7.4) was added into medium to give a final polymer concentration of 0.2 mg/mL.
After incubation at 37 *C for 1 h, cells were imaged by a Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000-E confocal
microscope with a 100 x objective lens. GFP and TMR were excited at 488 and 543 nm,
respectively. The emission wavelengths of GFP and TMR were 515 and 595 nm, respectively.
After images captured, the medium was replaced by fresh medium. The cells were incubated at
37 *C for 5 h, followed by confocal microscopy analysis.
[0134]    Two pHAM nanoprobes (3 and 4 with pHt of 6.3 and 5.4, respectively) were incubated
with H2009 cells and confocal imaging was used to examine the subcellular locations for pHAM
activation. H2009 cells (N=30-50) with 20 or more colocalized dots (i.e. activated pHAM
within early endosomes or lysosomes) were identified as positive and the percentage was
quantified (Figure 6A and 6B). For nanoprobe 3, 80% of cells were positive in colocalization
with early endosomes at 30 min, whereas only 12% colocalized with late endosomes/lysosomes.
Over time, colocalization of activated 3 decreased with early endosomes but increased with late
endosomes/lysosomes (Figure 6A). In contrast, nanoprobe 4 (pHt = 5.4) showed a different
pattern of subcellular location for activation. At all times, less than 10% of positive cells were
found with early endosome colocalization. Instead, almost all the activated nanoprobe 4
colocalized with late endosomes/lysosomes (Figure 6B). Figure 6C and Figure 6D depict the
different processes of intracellular uptake and activation of the two nanoprobes. Nanoprobe 3
can be quickly activated inside early endosomes with higher vesicular pH (5.9-6.2) (Casey et al.,
Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010, 11:50-61; Modi et al., Nat. Nanotech. 2009, 4:325-330) and the
activation is sustained as the nanoprobes traffic into late endosomes/lysosomes. By contrast,
nanoprobe 4 is almost exclusively activated inside the late endosomes/lysosomes with lower
vesicular pH (5.0-5.5) (Casey et al., Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010, 11:50-61; Modi et al., Nat.
Nanotech. 2009, 4:325-330). Similar results were also found with human SLK tumor
endothelial cells (data not shown).
[01351    These data demonstrate the feasibility of targeting small differences in the vesicular pH
inside different endocytic organelles by the pHAM nanoparticles.
[01361    To verify the intracellular activation mechanism of pHAM, H2009 cells were incubated
with bafilomycin Al for 1 hr and then added nanoprobe 3. Bafilomycin is a specific inhibitor of

vacuolar-type H-ATPase (V-ATPase; Gagliardi et al., Curr.Med. Chem. 1999, 6:1197-1212.),
which is responsible for the proton pumping across the plasma membranes and acidification of
intracellular organelles (e.g. lysosomes). Data show that in the presence of bafilomycin Al,
nanoprobe 3 was not activated as indicated by the absence of TMR fluorescence. After removal
of bafilomycin Al and 3 in the culture medium, the activation of 3 emerged with colocalization
of TMR fluorescence with lamp 1-GFP labeled lysosomes. Similar results were also found with
nanoprobe 4 in H2009 cells.
[0137]     These experiments demonstrated that the synthesized nanoparticles are "silent" in the
media at pH 7.4 but can be activated upon uptake into the cells. Moreover, nanoparticles with
pH transitions at 6.3 and 5.4 can be selectively activated in different endocytic compartments
such as early endosomes (pH 5.9-6.2) and lysosomes (5.0-5.5). These data demonstrate the
feasibility of targeting small differences in the vesicular pH inside different endocytic organelles
by the pHAM nanoparticles.
EXAMPLE 4: Chemotherapeutic encapsulation into pHAM nanoparticles.
[01381     This study sought to demonstrate that pHAM nanoparticles could encapsulate a high
percentage of chemotherapeutics and subsequently quickly release it when exposed to an acidic
environment similar to what is observed in tumor cells.

[0139]     PEO-b-PC6A was synthesized as above (see Example 1 (I and II)). Doxorubicin
encapsulation in micelles was achieved by first dissolving doxorubicin and PEO-b-PC6A in
water and hydrochloric acid. This solution was then added drop by drop into a 0.1 M pH 9 buffer
solution under sonication.
[01401     By using this method, doxorubicin loading percentages between 5 and 6 percent out of
a theoretical loading of 10 percent were obtained. Drug loading was calculated by dissolving
doxorubicin-encapsulated micelles in chloroform and then measure the UV-vis absorbance.
II. Release of doxorubicin upon exposure to acidic environments
[01411     Doxorubicin release experiments were conducted by measuring the fluorescence
intensity at different time points of the doxorubicin-loaded micelles in various pH environments.
                                                    43

     WO 2012/039741                                                        PCT/US2011/001418
At first, 125 pL of doxorubicin-loaded micelles was mixed with 175 gL water in a cuvette, and
an initial fluorescence spectrum was taken. Then, 10-20 pL of 5M pH buffer was added to the
cuvette to measure the doxorubicin release over time. Drug concentration was calculated based
on fluorescence calibration curves of free doxorubicin in water and pH buffer. At low
concentrations (<0.025 mg/mL), fluorescence intensity and concentration are directly
proportional. Fluorescence quenching occurs at higher concentrations.
[0142]     The release study shows that doxorubicin releases from the micelles rapidly at pH 5.0
and that the micelles at pH 7.4 are relatively stable. At pH 5.0, the micelles release doxorubicin
rapidly in the first two hours and afterwards, the release is very slow. At pH 7.4, doxorubicin
slowly releases out of the micelles after several hours, but the majority of the drug remains
encapsulated (Figure 7). At low concentrations (< 0.025 mg/mL), fluorescence intensity and
concentration are directly proportional. Fluorescence quenching occurs at higher concentrations.
[0143]     This study demonstrated that polymeric micelles can encapsulate a high percentage of
doxorubicin (~6%) and that polymers that are protonated in acidic conditions can dissociate
much faster than polymers that undergo hydrolysis at low pH values. Release studies showed
that the micelles can release doxorubicin rapidly at pH 5.0, with the majority of the drug released
in the first two hours.
III. Encapsulation of paclitaxel into micelles
[0144]     Paclitaxel-loaded micelles were prepared according to a previously published
procedure. In brief, 20 mg of MeO-PEO5k-PDPA25k and 2 mg of paclitaxel were dissolved in 1
mL THF. Then, the mixture was rapidly added into 10 mL of Milli-Q water under sonication.
The mixture was ultrafiltrated for more than 6 times to remove THF using the micro
ultrafiltration system. The resulting micellar solution was placed at room temperature for 4 hour
and filtrated through a 0.45 ptm cellulose membrane to remove any precipitates in micelle
solution. Paclitaxel loading content in polymeric micelles was determined by disintegrating of
micelles in acetonitrile. Paclitaxel concentration was determined by HPLC using a reversed
phase C18 column (5 pm, 4.6 x 250 mm) with a mobile phase consisting of 34% acetonitrile and
66% water at 227 nm at the flow rate of 1 mL/min. Paclitaxel content in MeO-PEO5k
PDPA25k micelles was 8.3 ± 0.6%.

     WO 2012/039741                                                        PCT/US2011/001418
EXAMPLE 5: Generation of a pHAM-NIR fluorophores comprising cypate for tumor
angiogenesis imaging.
I. Synthesis of NIR-pHAM
[0145]    Cypate-NHS esters (an NIR dye) were synthesized following published procedures
(Figure 8; Lopalco, et al., Org. Biomol. Chem., 2009, 7:856-859; Ye et al., Bioconjug. Chem,
2007, 19:225-234). Figure 8 shows a representative synthetic scheme of NIR-NHS and PEO-b
(PR-r-NIR) copolymers. Reaction of 1,2,2-trimethyl-1H-benz[e]indole (A) with 3
bromopropanoic acid in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at 11 00C yielded B. Further reaction of B with
malonaldehyde bis(phenylimine) monohydrochloride (n = 1) or glutaconaldehyde dianil
monohydrochloride (n = 2) yielded the corresponding NIR fluorophores (C). Treatment of C
with O-(N-succinimidyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TSTU) and N,N
diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) in dry DMF yielded NIR-NHS ester. Finally, the PEO-b-(PR-r
NIR) was synthesized through conjugation of NIR-NHS onto the block copolymers bearing the
primary amino groups. In the cypate-containing copolymers, the number of repeating units in the
PR block was 70. After syntheses, polymers were fully characterized by gel permeation
chromatography, 'H NMR, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Useful analogs with different
excitation/emission wavelengths (e.g. Xex/Xem = 678/704 nm when n= 1; Xex/Xem = 781/808 im
when n=2) were subsequently produced.
II. Optimization of NIR-pHAM fluorophores
[0146]    Preliminary studies on TMR-pHAM show that PR length and TMR number may affect
the ultra-pH response. Adequate PR length may provide for cooperative micellization and
directly affects pH response, i.e. ApHio.90%. The TMR density may control the fluorescence
response. For example, an optimal Fmax/Fmin of 55 was achieved for TMR nanoprobe 3 at y = 3
without the observable intramolecular fluorescence quenching at the ON state. In comparison, at
y =1, only a Fma/Fmin of 10 was obtained (data not shown).
[0147]    For the NIR-pHAM development, the PR length (70) is maintained to investigate the
optimal NIR density per polymer chain. It is anticipated that different fluorophores (i.e. cypate
vs. TMR) have different homoFRET and PET quenching effects, which may affect the optimal
pHAM composition. To quantify the contributions from homoFRET and PET, a NIR
                                                  45

     WO 2012/039741                                                          PCT/US2011/001418
conjugated polymer is blended with NIR-free polymer and systematically the molar ratios of
NIR-conjugated polymer are varied. Extrapolation of quenching coefficient to one NIR dye per
micelle permits the quantification of PET contribution. The cypate density (e.g. y = 1, 3, 6) on
the PR segment is then systematically increased. Quenching efficiency is measured and
correlated with the homoFRET model (Lakowicz (ed.), PrinciplesofFluorescence
Spectroscopy, Edn.   3 rd, 443-475 (Springer, New York City; 2006), which is inversely
proportional to r6 (r is the distance between the dye pairs in the micelle core).
 [01481   A unable set of NIR-pHAM (i.e. nanoprobes 3, 4, 6, 7, where TMR is replaced with
NIR dye) nanoprobes with pH transitions at 5.4, 6.3, 6.8 and 7.2, respectively is then
synthesized. Slight variations of pHt may result when a different dye (e.g. cypate) is used. After
NIR-pHAM syntheses, pH and fluorescence responses (e.g. pHt, ApHio.9o%, Fmax/Fmin, as
described previously), article size (TEM and DLS), critical micelle concentration and
fluorescence life times are measured.
EXAMPLE 6: Development of vascular-targeted cRGDfK-pHAM.
[0149]    This study demonstrates the development of cRGDfK-pHAM to target pH sensitive
polymeric micelle nanoparticles to the vasculature of tumors. The small peptide ligand cRGDfK
(cRGD) specifically targets axvp3 integrins (CD61) which are over-expressed in angiogenic
tumor endothelial cells.
[0150]    Thiol-maleimide chemistry was used for ligand conjugation on the pHAM surface
(Figure 9). MAL-PEO-b-PR was mixed with PEO-b-(PR-r-NIR) at 10 mol% molar ratio of
MAL-PEO-b-PR. After micelle formation, cRGD-SH peptides were conjugated via thiol
maleimide linkage. The peptide conjugation was monitored by the disappearance of maleimide
group (6.7 ppm) and formation of the aromatic group (7.0-7.5 ppm) from D-Phe on the cRGDfK
by the 'H NMR. Amino acid analysis was further used to quantify the peptide density on the
surface of pHAM nanoprobes (Khemtong, et al., CancerRes., 2009, 69:1651-1658). TEM and
DLS was used to examine the ligand functionalization on the particle size and morphology, and
fluorescence spectrophotometry was used to verify the pH-responsive fluorescence properties of
pHAM. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was the primary tool to examine the kinetics of
cell uptake and intracellular activation of the targeted pHAM.
                                                    46

      WO 2012/039741                                                        PCT/US2011/001418
[0151]     Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used in these studies. This
cell line is well accepted as a cell culture model in vitro for angiogenic endothelial cells and
avp3 integrin is over-expressed on HUVEC cells (Ellis et al., J. Vasc. Res., 2003, 40:234-243;
Vag et al., ContrastMedia Mol. Imaging, 2009, 4:192-198). Figure 10 shows the contrast
specificity of cRGD-encoded PEG-b-(PDPA-r-NIR) pHAM (pH transition = 6.3) in HUVEC
cells. The surface density of cRGD/cRAD was controlled at 20mol%. To examine avp3
specificity, cRAD-encoded pHAM and free cRGD block +cRGD-encoded pHAM were used as
controls. HUVEC cells were cultured in EGM medium prior to incubation of different pHAM
samples (polymer concentration: 0.2 mg/mL) for 3 hrs. In the cRGD block control, 20 molar
excess of free cRGD peptides were co-incubated with cRGD-pHAM to compete for avp3
binding. Because pHAM is silent at medium pH, activation of pHAM inside HUVEC cells can
be directly imaged without the need to remove the medium.
[0152]     The data demonstrated that after cell incubation, cRGD-pHAM showed dramatically
increased fluorescence intensity inside HUVEC cells. In comparison, cRAD-pHAM and cRGD
block controls showed little fluorescence signals. ROI analyses of different HUVEC cells
showed the average fluorescence intensity was 15.2+3.5, 1.4+0.2, 1.5+0.2 for cRGD-pHAM,
cRAD-pHAM, and cRGD block control, respectively (Figure 10A). The fluorescence for the
medium background of similar ROI size was 0.56±0.09. The culture medium was used as the
background noise to calculate the contrast over noise ratio (CNR=(FIpHAM-FImed)/FImed,
where FIpHAM and FImed are the fluorescence intensity of pHAM sample and medium,
respectively) for different pHAM conditions. The values of CNR were 26.1+6.2, 1.5±0.4, and
 1.6+0.4 for cRGD-pHAM, cRAD-pHAM, and cRGD block control, respectively (Figure 10B).
It is worth noting that >10-fold increase in CNR for cRGD-pHAM was observed over the two
controls, indicating avp3-specific targeting (P<0.01). In particular, this contrast was observed
in the presence of a high concentration (0.2 mg/mL) of "silent" pHAM nanoprobes in the cell
culture medium.
EXAMPLE 7: Evaluation of the specificity and efficacy of targeted pHAM in the imaging of
distinctive angiogenesis biomarkers in tumor-bearing mice in vivo.
I. pHAM activation in the tumor vasculature
                                                    47

     WO 2012/039741                                                        PCT/US2011/001418
[0153]     Since TMR has short excitation/emission wavelengths (Xex = 540 nm, Xem = 580 nm),
these studies used cRGD-encoded, TMR-conjugated pHAM nanoparticles to demonstrate
pHAM activation in tumor vasculature.
[0154]    Athymic nude mice bearing A549 tumor xenografts (100-200 mm3 , n = 3 for each
group) were used in these studies. cRGD- and cRAD-encoded PEG-b-(PDPA-r-TMR) pHAM
nanoprobes were used with 20mol% surface density. Nanoprobes were injected at 14 pmol
TMR/kg dose via the tail vein and animals were sacrificed 3 hrs after pHAM injection. Various
organs were removed and placed on a Petri dish and imaged by IVIS Spectrum.
[0155]    TMR signals of the explanted organs and tumor tissues from cRAD-encoded and
cRGD-encoded TMR-pHAM can be directly observed by a Maestro fluorescence imaging
instrument with identical imaging conditions. Despite the limited tissue penetration of TMR,
tumor from cRGD-encoded pHAM clearly showed higher fluorescence intensity than that from
cRAD-encoded pHAM, as well as the adjacent muscle tissues. In both groups, the blood drops
did not show any fluorescence signals, demonstrating the intended background suppression
effect of pHAM in blood. Meanwhile, liver appeared to be the major organ that took up both
pHAM formulations, consistent with the RES clearance of nanosized particles (Moghimi, et al.,
Pharmacol. Rev., 2001, 53:283-318).
[0156]    After ex vivo imaging, tumor tissues were frozen and sectioned at 8 tm. Confocal
imaging of tumor tissues showed a remarkable increase of fluorescence intensity in cRGD
pHAM treated tumor than cRAD-pHAM control. To verify the location of pHAM activation,
tumor sections were first stained with rat primary anti-mouse mAb against PECAM (CD3 1),
followed by washing and staining with Delight 488-conjuated anti-rat secondary antibody.
Overlay images show that majority of pHAM activation co-localized with the vasculature stain,
indicating the active targeting and activation of cRGD-encoded pHAM in the tumor vasculature.
This study demonstrates the feasibility of targeting specific angiogenesis biomarkers (i.e. ocvp3)
by cRGD-encoded pHAM in tumor-bearing mice. To overcome the short tissue penetration of
TMR dye, NIR-pHAM nanoprobes (e.g. cypate, Xex/Xem = 781/808 nm when n=2) may be used
for further animal studies in vivo.
II. Evaluation of targeted NIR-pHAM nanoprobes with optimal pH, values
                                                   48

     WO 2012/039741                                                        PCT/US2011/001418
[0157]     The influence of pHt on the imaging specificity of angiogenesis biomarkers is
investigated. In this series of studies, cRGD-encoded NIR-pHAM is used as a model system and
cRAD-encoded NIR-pHAM as a control. NIR-conjugated PEG-b-PDBA (pHt = 5.4), PEG-b
PDPA (6.3), or PEO-b-PC7A (6.8) nanoprobes are evaluated. cRGD-pHAM nanoprobes with
larger pHt values (e.g. 6.8) may lead to faster fluorescence response time inside early stage
endosomes. However, it may also be more susceptible to be "activated" by other non-aA3
related mechanisms, such as acidic pH in tumor microenvironment. Vice versa, cRGD-pHAM
with lower pHt values (e.g. 5.4) can be more specifically turned "ON" via avp 3 -mediated
endocytosis; however, it may take longer time for them to be activated in angiogenic endothelial
cells.
[0158]     In this series of experiments, we inject the cRGD- and cRAD-encoded NIR-pHAMs
with different pHt via the tail veins of mice bearing A549 tumors. The fluorescence intensity of
tumors and other organs are recorded over time to examine the kinetics of pHAM activation.
Living Image 4.0 software is used to display the 3D volume images superimposed with mouse
anatomy. For tumor tissues, the fluorescence intensity is plotted over time to examine whether
saturation kinetics is present for cRGD-encoded NIR-pHAM (as expected from receptor
saturation). If saturation kinetics is observed, the optimal pHAM dose as the minimal dose that
allows for receptor saturation is determined. This dose is then used in subsequent studies to
minimize non-specific uptake in other organs (e.g. liver). The CNRs of tumors over the
surrounding muscle tissues for cRGD-encoded vs. cRAD-encoded NIR-pHAM is then
calculated and compared to investigate the target-specific contrast due to ayp 3-mediated
endocytosis. For NIR-pHAMs with different pHt values, CNRs between the targeted (i.e.
cRGD-encoded) and non-targeted (i.e. cRAD-encoded) groups across different NIR-pHAM
designs is compared. These results are correlated with data on stealth pHAM (PEO surface)
activation in tumor microenvironment. This results of this study selects the most optimal pHt
design for NIR-pHAM to image specific angiogenesis biomarkers in vivo.
[0159]     cRGD-encoded NIR-pHAM (NIR-conjugated PEG-b-PDPA (pHt = 6.3)) was used as a
model system and non-targeted NIR-pHAM as a control. The NIR-conjugated PEG-b-PDPA had
the structure of Formula I with the following:
        R'         Ri/R2         n     z      R"        m    x        y     L         R"'

                                                                            Cy5.5
The targeted NIR-conjugated PEG-b-PDPA had 10mol% surface density of cRGD.
[0160]     cRGD-encoded and non-targeted NIR-conjugated PEG-b-PDPA were intravenously
injected via the tail veins of athymic nude mice bearing A549 lung tumors. The in vivo NIR
fluorescence intensity was recorded 3 hours postinjection. In a comparison group, a blocking
dose of cRGDfK peptide was injected 30 min prior to the cRGD-encoded NIR-conjugated PEG
b-PDPA administration.
[0161]     The tumor from cRGD-encoded NIR-conjugated PEG-b-PDPA clearly showed higher
fluorescence intensity than that that from non-targeted NIR-conjugated PEG-b-PDPA or the
cRGD blocking group.
III. Pharmacokinetics studies of cRGD-encoded pHAM
[0162]     This study showed the blood circulation time of cRGD-encoded pHAM (targeted
micelles) and cRGD-free pHAM (nontargeted micelles) in A549 tumor-bearing mice.
[0163]     Female athymic nude mice (20-25 g) were inoculated s.c. on the right flank with
human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells (5x 106 cells/mouse). Tumors were allowed to
reach 200-300 mm 3 before injection of micelles. For PK studies, cRGD-free pHAM or 10%
cRGD-encoded PEG-b-(PDPA-r-TMR) pHAM were injected at a dose of 20 mg/kg micelles
through the tail vein. Blood was collected at 2 min, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after i.v. injection.
Plasma was isolated from RBCs by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. The plasma was
stored at 4 *C for further analysis. Polymer was extracted from plasma with acidic methanol (0.1
M HCl: MeOH, 3:7, v/v) and detected with a fluorometer using excitation and emission
wavelengths of 545 and 580 nm, respectively.
[01641     Both cRGD-encoded pHAM and cRGD-free pHAM displayed prolonged blood
circulation time. The blood half lives of cRGD-encoded pHAM and cRGD-free pHAM wer 10.0
and 9.5 hours, respectively (Figure 11).

     WO 2012/039741                                                        PCT/US2011/001418
IV. Testing the generality of NIR-pHAM nanoplatform in imaging a           integrin and VEGFR2
in several tumor xenograft models.
[0165]    NIR-pHAM formulation with the optimal pHt is used in these studies. For the
VEGFR2-targeted nanoprobes, we purify the FabR2'-SH fragment of RAFL-1 mAb for NIR
pHAM conjugation. A non-specific Fab'-SH is also prepared from control rat IgG. Fab'-SH is
conjugated to the NIR-pHAM surface via thiol-maleimide chemistry. RAFL-1-NIR immuno
conjugate is used as the always ON control. For the avp3-targeted NIR-pHAM, cRGD-NIR as a
small molecular dye conjugate is also synthesized. It is expected that these always ON probes
have elevated blood signals with limited imaging payload increase at the targeted site, which
have significantly less contrast sensitivity compared to the corresponding NIR-pHAM
nanoprobes.
[0166]     The targeted nanoprobes are investigated in other more clinically relevant tumor
models in an orthotopic MDA-MB-231 breast tumor model in the mammary pad of female nude
mice (Ran et al., Neoplasia,2003, 5:297-307) orthotopic MiaPaca-2 pancreatic tumor model in
nu/nu mice (Korpanty et al., Cancer Res., 2007, 13:323-330). Both tumor models express high
levels of angiogenesis biomarkers (e.g. VEGFR2, avp3, endoglin). Imaging specificity and
efficacy of NIR-pHAM nanoprobes in these tumor models is evaluated and results are validated
by immunohistochemistry of these angiogenesis biomarkers in tissue sections.
EXAMPLE 8. Evaluation of activation of non-targeted NIR-pHAM in acidic tumors.
101671     Extracellular pH is becoming an important physiological parameter to study tumor
microenvironment and metabolism. (Cardone et al., Nature Rev. Cancer, 2005, 5:786-795;
Gerweck & Seetharaman, Cancer Res. 1996, 56:1194-1198; Helmlinger et al., Nature Medicine,
1997, 3:177-182). Aerobic glycolysis (aka, Warburg effect), conversion of glucose to lactic acid
in the presence of oxygen, is uniquely observed in cancers. To maintain a healthy intracellular
pH (~7.2), cancer cells utilize several transport systems (e.g. Na*/H* exchange, vacuolar H*
ATPases (V-ATPase), Na*/HCO 3 ~exchange) to export the protons from inside cells. This
results in microenvironmental acidosis that further facilitates cancer invasion through ECM
degradation and promotion of angiogenesis.
[0168]     Prior to studying the pHAM activation, the map in tumors is first measured using MRI
relaxometry method for imaging of tissue pH in vivo (Garcia-Martin et al., Magn. Reason. Med.,
                                                    51

     WO 2012/039741                                                           PCT/US2011/001418
2006, 55:309-315; Raghunand et al., Magn. Reason. Med, 2003, 49:249-257). After
measurement by MRI the activation of non-targeted NIR-pHAM in the tumor microenvironment
is evaluated. Due to the small size of pHAM (diameter 40-50 nm), they accumulate in the tumor
interstitium through the leaky tumor microvasculature. In a typical experiment, NIR-pHAM
nanoprobes are injected via the tail vein. 3D activation map and dynamic contrast over time are
measured on the IVIS Spectrum. Living Image (4.0) software provided by the manufacturer is
used to analyze the spatial and temporal activation of NIR-pHAM nanoprobes. Moreover, the
quantitative 3D fluorescence (FLIT4) toolset is used to co-register the optical images with the
map from MRI. The pattern of pHAM activation with the map in tumors is then compared. The
NIR-pHAM activation profiles are examined and compared for nanoprobes with different pH
transitions (i.e. 5.4, 6.3, 6.8, 7.2).
[0169]     The experiments show the following: (1) closely correlated pHe and pHt relationships
between the tumor microenvironmental pH and NIR-pHAM activation, respectively; (2) for
NIR-pHAM with high pH transitions (i.e. 6.8 or 7.2), because of the ultra-pH response of the
tested pHAM nanoprobes (i.e. <0.25 pH unit for OFF/ON transitions), they are highly sensitive
imaging probes for acidic tumors and are useful for tumor drug delivery; and (3) for NIR-pHAM
with low pH transitions (i.e. 5.4 or 6.3), their lack of activation by the acidic tumor

hydroxycinnamate, a monocarboxylate transferase 1 (MCT1) inhibitor, was injected 24 hours
prior to nanoprobe administration. The tumor from the non-targeted PEG-PC7A-Cy5.5
nanoprobes clearly showed higher fluorescence intensity than that from the MCT1 inhibitor

EXAMPLE 9: Development of VEGFR2-targeted pHAM.
 [01711   This study demonstrates the development of FabR'-functionalized micelles for specific
targeting of VEGFR2 receptors on the surface of endothelial cells. The Fab' fragment of RAFL
 1 mAb is used for specific targeting to VEGFR2 receptors since VEGFR2 is over-expressed in
angiogenic tumor endothelial cells. RAFL-1 mAb binds to VEGFR2 with high affinity (15 pM)
and specificity (Ran et al., Neoplasia, 2003, 5:297-307) and, following purification of the
Fabp'-SH fragment of RAFL-1 for surface functionalization, FabY'-functionalized liposomes
showed >30-fold increase in cell uptake in mouse endothelial cells over the control liposomes
(Marconescu, PhD. Thesis, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, 2008). Compared with
the whole mAb, Fabp'-SH has the advantage of introducing a smaller targeting moiety (50 vs.
 150 kD), and superior presentation of binding epitope on the pHAM surface (i.e. facing solution
instead of random orientation for whole mAb).
 [0172]   Thiol-maleimide chemistry is used for ligand conjugation on the pHAM surface. MAL
PEO-b-PR is mixed with PEO-b-(PR-r-NIR) at different molar ratios (e.g. 20 mol% of MAL
PEO-b-PR). For each pHAM copolymer, its corresponding maleimide-terminated copolymer is
then synthesized (Figure 8). After micelle formation, FabP2'-SH peptides are conjugated via
thiol-maleimide linkage. Amino acid analysis is further used to quantify the peptide density on
the surface of pHAM nanoprobes (Khemtong, et al., CancerRes., 2009, 69:1651-1658). TEM
and DLS is used to examine the ligand functionalization on the particle size and morphology,
and fluorescence spectrophotometry is used to verify the pH-responsive fluorescence properties
of pHAM. Laser scanning confocal microscopy is the primary tool to examine the kinetics of
cell uptake and intracellular activation of the targeted pHAM.
