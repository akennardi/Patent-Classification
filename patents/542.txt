ABSTRACT
A truck body structure 10 has a floor 12 and front wall 14 connected by a curved
section 16. Floor side portions 18, 20 angle upwards and outwards relative to a
central floor portion 17. Also, the floor angles upwards towards a rear of the body
structure relative to the body structure being in a loading position. Floor plates 26
can overlap at overlap joints 28. Welded joints are provided along recesses 35
formed along plate edges 37. Structural support members 34 can provide
additional support to the floor 12. The structural support members can be curved
40 and can include recesses 35, 52 along side edges 37, 50 thereof to provide
intermittent side edge weld points 39, 54 between the recesses and therefore
decrease the risk of any weld crack propagating along an entire length of the
respective support member or joint.

DUMP TRUCK BODY, DUMP TRUCK BODY COMPONENTS, DUMP TRUCK
BODY SUPPORT STRUCTURE
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      The present invention relates to a dump truck body, components of a
dump truck body and/or a dump truck body support structure.
[0002]      Particular features of the dump truck body or components of a dump
truck body relate to fabrication or arrangement of components forming at least
part of a dump truck body and/or support structure therefor.
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0003]      Productivity in mine sites and other locations using heavy haul trucks
to transport bulk materials (such as coal, iron ore, mineral sands, gold ore etc.)
relies on maximising use of the available trucks on site. Downtime for truck
maintenance either means fewer trucks are available for use at any given time or
more trucks are needed in a fleet than would be preferred. This either increases
maintenance costs or capital cost for extra vehicles.
[0004]      One problem that causes increased maintenance frequency on heavy
haul trucks is the even loading or overloading of a payload within the truck body.
Uneven loading results in increased pressure on one or more tyres and/or on the
vehicle chassis or chassis mounting points for the body.
[0005]      Also, because the chassis, tyres and power/braking systems of the
vehicle are designed for a maximum overall vehicle weight and load, it is
beneficial to have a light yet sufficiently strong and wear resistant body for
carrying a maximised payload whilst the body structure aids even positioning of

                                           2
the load within the body to control premature wear and vehicle system/tyre
overload.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]      With the aforementioned in mind, an aspect of the present invention
provides a dump truck body having a body structure for holding a load to be
transported by and unloaded from a dump truck, the body structure including a
floor and a front wall, wherein the floor and front wall are continuous through a
curved wall portion.
[0007]      Preferably the floor extends transversely to respective opposed first
and second sides of the body, the floor extending at an angle of between 00
(horizontal) and positive 120 (upward) with respect to horizontal
[0008]      The floor may preferably curve along a front to rear axis to form a
concave interior portion when viewed in longitudinal cross section.
[0009]      The front wall may curve to form a concave front wall portion when
viewed from the interior of the body, and/or the front wall may be angled forward
such that an upper portion of the front wall is forward of a lower portion of the
front wall that merges with the curve into or forming part of the floor.
[0010]      The front wall and the floor may be at an interior angle of 1000 to 1200
with respect to one another, and preferably between 1050 and 1100
[0011]      The floor may include floor plates, such as steel plates, fabricated
together. The floor plates may overlap to create thicker sections of floor
compared to single plate thickness.

                                           3
[0012]     At least one support member may be provided to support the floor from
underneath i.e. external of the body structure.
[0013]     The at least one support member may be provided between
consecutive overlaps of the floor plates such that an intermediate portion of a
respective floor plate is supported structurally between one overlap and the next.
[0014]     The at least one support member may extend at least partially between
a centreline of the body structure and a side wall of the body structure. More
preferably, at least one of the support members, preferably multiple such support
members, extends transversely at least partially between a centreline of the body
structure and a left side of the body structure. And preferably, at least one other
of the support members, preferably multiple other such support members,
extends transversely at least partially between a centreline of the body structure
and a right side of the body structure.
[0015]     The at least one support member may include a curved beam portion.
For example, one or more of the support members may include a curved
longitudinal member, which may preferably have flat portions along longitudinal
edges thereof for attachment of the support member directly or indirectly to an
underside of the floor.
[0016]     The flat portions at the longitudinal edges of the support member may
have spaced recesses or cut-outs. Welding the support member to the floor
along the remaining outer side edges not within the recesses or cut-outs of the
support member allows the body to flex and stretch without cracking.
[0017]     Preferably, weld is only placed on the straight outer edge of the
support member. Consequently, if a cracked weld appears along the side edge, it
only does so as a localised crack and cannot propagate along the whole length of
the side edge weld.

                                            4
[0018]      The floor may be supported by longitudinal supports.
[0019]      Preferably the longitudinal supports extend in parallel to one another
along an underside of at least part of the floor and part of the front wall.
[0020]      Preferably the longitudinal supports curve in unison with the curved
portion connecting portions of the floor and the front wall.
[0021]      Preferably the longitudinal supports include or are attached to pivot
points by which the body may be pivotably mounted to a vehicle chassis for
unloading a load from the body.
[0022]      It will be appreciated that the body structure provides an elastically
deformable shape with multiple angles (angled front wall portion and angled floor
portions) for a dump truck body (such as for use on a mining dump truck/haul
pack).
[0023]      Preferably a rearward portion of the body structure includes an
upwardly inclined or increased upward angle to the rear portion/edge of the floor
to decelerate material during unloading. The upward/increased angle is evident
when the body is in a lowered position for loading/transport of load as the floor
curves upward towards the rear of the truck body structure, the final portion of the
floor increases in angle such that, during unloading, the load sliding form the
dump truck decelerates to help control unloading, and helps to retain the load
within the body structure during transport and loading.
[0024]      Preferably each of the side walls of the body includes a stiffener along
its upper edge.
[0025]      The front wall may include at least one curved beam extending
transversely across the external front face of the front wall.

                                             5
[0026]      Preferably a flange plate is provided in between the floor and curved
support member.
[0027]      A first floor sheet may connect with and overlap with which connects a
wall or curved sheet which forms at least part of the front wall.
[0028]      A second floor sheet may connect with and overlap with the first floor
sheet and/or with a third floor sheet.
[0029]      The third floor sheet may connects and overlap with a fourth floor
sheet.
[0030]      It will be appreciated that one reason that the present invention was
developed was because mines needed to maximise operating costs. By reducing
the weight of the body structure of the dump truck this in turn gives the truck a
bigger payload carrying captivity.
[0031]      Also, the body structure according to one or more forms of the present
invention enables weight distribution to the wheels of the vehicle to be correct for
both an empty and a full body. This helps to prevent tyre overload due to uneven
weight distribution, which even distribution of tyre load allows the truck to travel at
a relatively high travelling speed because of tyre operating temperature is
minimised.
[0032]      Because the load is more evenly supported within the truck body, truck
maintenance is reduced and also stays with the truck manufactures warranty
requirements on chassis load and drive lines.
[0033]      It will be appreciated that the floor structure internally of the body
guides the load to accumulate over a central zone of the floor. The floor
preferably angles upwards along side portions thereof with respect to a central

                                            6
front to rear extending portion of the floor (i.e. when the truck body is a position
for loading).
[0034]      A further aspect of the present invention provides a structural joint for a
truck body, the structural joint including an overlap between respective edges of
two metal portions, and recesses along an edge of at least one of the metal
portions, the recesses providing an edge length of the metal portion compared
with a straight edge of same metal portion.
[0035]       Preferably the metal portion includes a sheet of metal.
[0036]      The two metal portions may be or include overlapping sheets of metal,
such as steel.
[0037]      Such a unique overlapping joint structure provides enhanced structural
integrity without the need for extra structural members, thereby controlling overall
weight of the body structure whilst maintaining or increasing load carrying
capacity.
[0038]      A further aspect of the present invention provides a support member
including an elongate body portion and side edges, at least one of the side edges
including recesses spaced therealong, and a weld point provided intermediate
adjacent said recesses.
[0039]       Preferably, the recesses are provided along the edge or edges of a
structural beam for welding to an underside of a floor of a heavy haul vehicle,
such as for a floor of a dump truck body.
[0040]      The support member may have a curved central section connected
directly or indirectly to the side edge(s) having the recesses.

                                            7
[0041]      Preferably the support member provides a structural beam that is
welded to the underside of the floor intermediate one overlap joint between floor
plates and another overlap joint between floor plates. Consequently, the floor
structure or body structure can have an alternate overlap joint and support
member structure.
[0042]      The support member may be fabricated by welding components
together or may be pressed or forged as a single component.
[0043]      The recesses may be laser or plasma cut, or may be stamped, from
the material, such as steel, used for forming the member.
[0044]      The recesses may be curved or include a curved portion. The
recesses may provide a regular pattern of recesses along one or more side
edges of the support member.
[0045]      Preferably, the recesses include curved recesses, such as a key
pattern, loop, scallop, part circular, curved, keyhole or omega shaped openings
into the longitudinal edge of the metal portion.
[0046]      The recesses provide for an interrupted or discontinuous overall length
of weld joint between overlapping sheets compared with a simple straight edge
continuously welded overlapping joint, allowing flexibility and reducing risk of
welds cracking.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
[0059]      Figure 1 shows a side view projection of a floor 12 and the front wall 14
of a dump truck body structure 10.
[0060]      The floor 12 is preferably formed of sheets 26 which overlap at overlap
joints 28. The overlap joints provide a double thickness sheet welded for strength
and integrity of the structure at the overlaps.
[0061]      The floor and front wall join at a curved portion 16.
[0062]      The floor 12 has a concave curvature front to rear when viewed from
the interior of the body.
[0063]      As shown in Figure 2, side floor plates 18 or 20 extend upwardly in
transversely from a lower central portion of the floor 17 at an angle from
horizontal. Preferably the angle is between 00 and 120, and more preferably
between 50 and 100, and indeed more preferably 60 and 80.
[0064]      As shown in Figures 3 and 4, longitudinal supports 30 extend front to
rear along the underside of the dump truck body 10 and provides support to the
floor 12.
[0065]      Pivot points 32 are provided on the longitudinal supports for pivotally
mounting the dump truck body to a vehicle chassis, as shown in figures 9 and 10.

                                            10
[0066]      Transverse support members 34 extend transversely from a centre
portion of the floor to opposed to left and right sides of the dump truck body. The
support members can have a curved elongated section 40 extending between the
flat plates of 36 provided at each longitudinal edge of the respective support
member.
[0067]      Preferably a flat or straight section 38 connects the curved portion 40
to the respective flat plate 36, as shown in Figures 6, 7 and 8.
[0068]      Longitudinal edges of the support members can include cut-outs
increasing the overall length of the side edge of the respective support member
for welding connection to the underside of the respective floor plate(s) to provide
additional rigidity.
[0069]      A trailing end 44 of the floor can provide an increased angle to
decelerate unloading of load from the tipped dump truck body, shown in Figure 9
compared with Figure 10.
[0070]      Figures 11 to 14 show features of an arrangement for joining floor or
wall plates at their overlap 28.
[0071]      Recesses 35 are provided along the edge of at least one of the plates,
preferably the edge of the plate edge exposed at the underside of the body.
[0072]      The recesses 35 provide for non-welded spaces between welds 39
along the side edge 37 of the floor plate, helping to prevent propagation of an
weld crack that might occur, and thereby maintaining structural integrity of the
floor structure.
[0073]      As shown in Figure 13, the overlap joint can be provided between a flat
plate 26 of the floor 12 and a curved section 16 continuing to the front wall 14.

                                            11
[0074]      Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4, for example, the floor inclines
progressively steeper towards the open unloading end of the floor. Figure 4
shows dashed lines 1-4 compared with a horizontal H dashed line. The dashed
lines 1-4 are at a progressively steeper angle of inclination compared with
horizontal with the body in a lowered, loading orientation shown in Figure 4. This
configuration helps to guide the bulk of the load within the body structure to a
more forward position within the body structure and to a position between the
wheels.
[0075]      The sloping side portions 18, 20 of the floor, as shown in Figure 3 for
example, help to maintain/guide the load toward the central portion 17 of the floor.
[0076]      It will be appreciated that the floor structure helps to maintain the load
in a desired position within the body structure, helping to avoid overloading on
any one particular tyre or mounting point.
[0077]      Also, the angled/curved front wall also helps to ensure that the load
stay within a desired area within the body structure.
[0078]      The body structure can include a Roll Over Protection System (ROPS)
protective canopy 46 to protect the operator's cabin 48 from falling rocks or risk of
crushing if the vehicle rolls over. The canopy 46 can be integral to the body
structure, such as formed of sheets and/or castings welded together rather than a
separately fabricated and bolt on ROPS/canopy.
[0079]      As shown in Figures 15 to 17, a support member 34 with curved centre
section 40 can include longitudinal side edges 50 incorporating recesses 52.
[0080]      Weld points 54 are provided along the side edges 50 between adjacent
recesses 52. The weld points and recesses (which as not welded) provide for a
discontinuous weld along the edges of the support member, and thereby prevent

                                          12
weld cracks propagating along the length of the support member, limiting any
cracking to localised welds.
[0081]     Preferably the longitudinal side edges and recesses are provided in
plates 36 attached to the curved section 40. More preferably, the plates 36
connect to the curved section via straight portions 38.

                                         13
