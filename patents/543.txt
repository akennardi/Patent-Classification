   ABSTRACT
   The invention discloses a dietary fiber tablet with a weight-reducing effect and the
   preparation method thereof. The dietary fiber tablet comprises soluble dietary fiber,
   insoluble dietary fiber, food additives and auxiliary materials. The dietary fiber tablet
 5 with weight-reducing effect and the preparation method thereof are formed by
   combining different types of soluble dietary fiber with insoluble dietary fiber. And the
   weight-reducing effect is obviously stronger than that of using only one dietary fiber.
   The effect of using only one dietary fiber is not ideal, and the invention overcomes the
   disadvantage of large dose in using only one dietary fiber.

   TECHNICAL FIELD
 5 [0001]    The invention relates to the technical field of health products, particularly to
   a dietary fiber tablet having a weight-reducing effect and a preparation method
   thereof.
   BACKGROUND ART
10 [0002]    Obesity is a chronic nutritional disease caused by the loss of balance in
   energy metabolism in the body. With the improvement of human living standards,
   lifestyle changes, changes in dietary patterns and changes in the living environment,
   obesity has become a major killer of human health. As early as in 1997, the World
   Health Organization (WHO) proposed that obesity is a pandemic and has seriously
15 affected human health. Studies have shown that obesity can be caused by a variety of
   factors including genetics, environment, dietary structure, lifestyle and metabolism. It
   is the susceptible factors of atherosclerosis (AS), type II diabetes, cardiovascular
   disease,   tumor, non-alcoholic      fatty  liver disease   (NAFLD),    sleep   disorders,
   osteoarthritis and other diseases. In addition, obesity is an important component of
20 metabolic syndrome (MS) and constitutes the pathophysiological basis of metabolic
   syndrome. The damage to the cardiovascular system caused by obesity is particularly
   noticeable. Every 1% increase in the body mass index (BMI) increases the prevalence
   of hypertension by 16%, and increases the risk of coronary heart disease in men and
   women by 3.6% and 3.3%; Obesity also causes a decrease in cardiac contractility and
25 a negative effect on heart function; Mild obesity can lead to myocardial remodeling,
   left ventricular hypertrophy, and structural changes and dysfunction of the peripheral
   blood vessels. According to WHO statistics, at least 2.8 million adults die of
   overweight or obesity each year, 23% of ischemic heart disease, 44% of diabetes and
   7%- 4 1% of cancers are attributable to overweight and obesity.
30 [0003]    In recent years, the incidence of obesity has increased year by year, and it has
   become widespread all over the world, becoming a serious threat to human health.
   With the development of China's economic level, the improvement of people's living
   standards, changes in lifestyle, changes in dietary patterns and changes in the living
   environment,     various problems      caused by obesity have become increasingly
35 prominent, bringing many problems to people's lives. Therefore, effective prevention
                                                   2

   and reduction of obesity has become a very urgent medical issue and has important
   practical significance.
   [0004] However,       there   are  many     disadvantages    and shortcomings      in the
   weight-reducing drugs or health foods on the market. For example, "Orlistat" and
 5 "Sibutramine" and other foreign-produced weight-reducing drugs have characteristics
   of large side effects and drug-withdrawal rebound. Some domestic health foods for
   weight loss and some Chinese medicines for weight loss do not have a clear
   mechanism for weight loss, always with many safety issues; and the safety of
   domestic chemical weight loss pills is also worrying. Events such as the
10 NOMATYNE Incident and the YUZHITANG Incident, arising out of the toxic side
   effect of chemical synthesis weight-loss drugs, have been exposed one after another,
   leaving a very bad influence on the reliability of the weight-loss products in the hearts
   of the general public.
   [0005] Therefore, how to solve the obesity problem safely and effectively is a
15 challenge that we face today, and it is also a subject of great market value.

30 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
   [0021]   To make the objectives, technical solutions and advantages of the present
   invention clearer, the following further describes the embodiments of the present
   invention in detail with the reference of the accompanying drawings.
   [0022]   Embodiment 1
                                                  4

   [0023]    For the combination of different types of dietary fiber, the optimal dietary
   fiber combination is determined by observing the weight loss effect in animal
   experiments.
   [0024]    100 male Wistar rats weighing 80±5g were provided by the Experimental
 5 Animal Center of Jilin University. After one week of fitness observation, their bodies
   were weighed. They were randomly divided into 10 groups: normal control group,
   high-fat modeling group, dietary fiber group 1 (0.5 parts of sodium alginate, 5.45
   parts of fructo oligosaccharide, 3.5 parts of konjac flour, 0.5 parts of chitosan and 0.05
   parts of capsorubin), dietary fiber group 2 (sodium alginate 0.5 parts, fructo
10 oligosaccharide 4 parts, konjac flour 3.45 parts, chitosan 2 parts, capsorubin 0.05
   parts), dietary fiber group 3 (sodium alginate 1.5 parts, fructo oligosaccharide 2.5
   parts, konjac flour 3 parts, chitosan 3 parts, capsorubin 0.05 parts), dietary fiber group
   4 (sodium alginate 0.5 parts, fructo oligosaccharide 3 parts, konjac flour 2.45 parts,
   chitosan 4 parts, capsorubin 0.05 parts), fructo oligosaccharide group, konjac flour
15 group, sodium alginate group, and chitosan group. In each group there are 10 rats.
   Except for the normal control group, other groups were fed with lard with a high
   content of saturated fatty acids, as well as cholesterol and bile salts to cause a
   hyperlipidemia model. After 8 weeks of feeding, body weight was taken as the index
   of observation. Experimental data were statistically processed, and Student's test was
20 used for the significance test. The results are shown in Table 1.

   [0026]    Note: Group 1 is the normal control group; Group 2 is the high-fat modeling
   group; Group 3 is the sodium alginate group; Group 4 is the fructo oligosaccharide
25 group; Group 5 is the konjac flour group; Group 6 is the chitosan group; Group 7 is
   the optimal dietary fiber group (dietary fiber group 4).
   [0027]    The experimental results showed that the average body weight of the high-fat
   modeling group was 185.6±12.3g, while the average body weight of the optimal
                                                  5

   dietary fiber group (dietary fiber group 4) was 151.3±10.9g. The Student's test
   showed that the difference between the two groups was extremely significant (p<0.01),
   indicating that the dietary fiber group has a good effect of reducing body weight in
   rats. As shown in Figure 1, the experimental results also show that the dietary fiber
 5 group is superior to the single use of a dietary fiber.
   [0028]   Embodiment 2
   [0029]   Preparation of a dietary fiber combination was studied and the dosage form
   was tablet. The tablets were prepared through full powder tableting and granule
   tableting respectively.
10 [0030]   (1) Full powder tableting
   [0031]   In proportion, 0.5 parts of sodium alginate, 4 parts of fructo oligosaccharide,
   3.45 parts of konjac flour, 2 parts of chitosan, and 0.05 parts of capsorubin were
   weighed. After the above substances were mixed uniformly, magnesium stearate was
   added as a lubricant and compress directly. According to the general rules for
15 preparations of Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015, the quality inspection results show that
   the tablet weight of tablets prepared by the full powder tableting process exceeds the
   limit (20 samples are randomly selected, each tablet and all are accurately weighed,
   and the difference in tablet weight is calculated; when the average tablet weight is
   0.30g or more, the weight difference limit is ±5%), which is related to the poor
20 flowability of raw materials such as konjac flour.
   [0032]   (2) Granule tableting is divided into two categories of processes, wet granule
   tableting and dry granule tableting:
   [0033]   (a) Wet granulation
   [0034]   0.5 part of sodium alginate, 4 parts of fructo oligosaccharide, 3.45 parts of
25 konjac flour, 2 parts of chitosan and 0.05 parts of capsorubin were weighed in
   proportion. The above substances were uniformly mixed, and wet granulation was
   performed. Magnesium stearate was added as a lubricant and the tablets were formed
   by compression.
   [0035]   (b) Dry granulation
30 [0036]   Weigh proportions of sodium alginate 5%, fructo oligosaccharide 40%,
   konjac flour 35%, chitosan 20%, and then add the food additive capsorubin pigment.
   Mix the above materials and perform dry granulation. Add magnesium stearate as a
   lubricant and compress.
   [0037]   (3) Tablet quality testing with different preparation processes
                                                  6

   [0038]    Appearance measurement: Randomly select 20 samples and calculate the
   average score according to the following method: 4 points for completeness and
   smoothness, uniform color and without color spots; 2 points for completeness and
   smoothness, uniform color, but with color spots; 1 point for completeness and
 s smoothness, but uneven color; 0 for not being complete or smooth.
   [0039]    Hardness measurement: Randomly take 10 samples. Determine the radial
   pressure of each piece with a hardness tester and calculate the average value.
   [0040]    Friability measurement: Randomly take 20 samples, weigh accurately, place
   on the friability instrument for collision testing of 4 min, take out and weigh
10 accurately, and calculate the weight loss percentage of the samples. Repeated
   measurements are performed 6 times to calculate the average value.
   [0041]    Disintegration time limit (s): 6 samples are taken at random, placed on a
   disintegration time analyzer and the disintegration time of the drug was determined at
   37 0 C, and disintegration should be completed within 15 minutes.

   [0043]    As a result, both tablet preparation processes can meet the quality
   requirements of the general rules for preparations of Chinese Pharmacopoeia2015, in
20 terms of differences in tablet weight, hardness, friability, and so on.
   [0044]    Embodiment 3
   [0045]    30 volunteers were given 12 weeks of oral administration and the body
   weights, before and after the trial, were compared.

   [0047] As shown in Table 2 and FIG. 2, the body weight of 30 volunteers who took
   the dietary fiber combination tablet of the present invention (sodium alginate 0.5 parts,
   fructo oligosaccharide 3 parts, konjac flour 2.45 parts, chitosan 4 parts, capsorubin
 5 0.05 parts) was reduced by 12.1±2.9Kg after 12 weeks, indicating that the present
   invention has a better weight loss effect. Volunteers did not suffer excitement,
   insomnia, anorexia, constipation, and other undesirable symptoms during use,
   indicating that the product is of good safety.
   [0048] From the above test, it can be concluded that the combination of different
10 types of soluble dietary fiber and insoluble dietary fiber significantly enhances the
   weight loss effect compared with using only one kind of dietary fiber. The present
   invention overcomes the disadvantages of unsatisfactory weight loss and dose of
   using one kind of dietary fiber.
