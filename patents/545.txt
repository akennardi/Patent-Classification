       Prevention of adverse effects caused by CD3 specific binding domains
   [0001] The present invention relates to a glucocorticoid (GC) for use in the amelioration,
10 treatment or prophylaxis of neurological/psychiatric adverse events caused by a CD3
   binding domain. Kits comprising a GC, a CD3 binding domain and instructions for use
   which indicate that the GC is to be employed for the treatment amelioration and/or
   prophylaxis of neurological adverse events caused by said CD3 binding domain, are
   also disclosed.

   [0002] Antibody-based cancer therapies require a target antigen firmly bound to the
   surface of cancer cells in order to be active. By binding to the surface target, the
   antibody can directly deliver a deadly signal to the cancer cell or indirectly by, for
   example, recruiting a cytotoxic T cell, if it is a bispecific antibody. In an ideal treatment
20 scenario, a target antigen is abundantly present and accessible on every cancer cell and
   is absent, shielded or much less abundant on normal cells. This situation provides the
   basis for a therapeutic window in which a defined amount of the antibody-based
   therapeutic effectively hits cancer cells but spares normal cells.
25 [0003] Though binding domains like antibodies are an effective means in treating many
   disorders, in particular cancer, their administration is not necessarily devoid of side
   effects. Adverse effects may cause a reversible or irreversible change in the health
   status of a patient. As adverse effects could be harmful and undesired, it is highly
   desirable to avoid them. However, though it is known that a medicament can cause
30 adverse effects, its prescription and administration could not be avoided or is accepted,
   since the medicament has an outstanding beneficial therapeutic effect or may even be
   life-saving.
   [0004] In clinical trials, a general distinction can be made between adverse effects (AEs)
35 and serious adverse effects (SAEs). Specifically, adverse effects can be classified in 5
   grades in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
                                                   1

   WO 20121062596                                                            PCT/EP20111/068862
   (CTCAE). Grade 1 relates to mild AE, Grade 2 to moderate AE, Grade 3 to severe AE,
   Grade 4 to life-threatening or disabling AE, while Grade 5 means death related to AE.
   [0005] An adverse effect observed in antibody therapy is the occurrence of infusion
 5 related side effects, such as the cytokine release syndrome ("CRS"). Other adverse side
   effects described to be associated with CRS are fatigue, vomiting, tachycardia,
   hypertension, back pain, but also central nervous system reactions (CNS reactions,
   neurological and/ or psychiatric), such as seizures, encephalopathy, cerebral edema,
   aseptic meningitis, and headache.
10
   [0006] Adverse events such as cytokine release and neurological/psychiatric reactions
   have not only been observed with antibodies binding to the T cell receptor but also with
   a CD19xCD3 bispecific single chain antibody binding to the CD3 part of the T cell
   receptor (called Blinatumomab (MT103)). Blinatumomab (MT103) is a lymphoma
15 directed, recombinant bispecific single-chain CD19xCD3 antibody that binds to CD19 on
   the surface of almost all B cells and B tumor cells and concomitantly can engage a T
   cell, thereby triggering the T-cell to kill the target B cell or B tumor cell. Blinatumomab
   consists of four immunoglobulin variable domains assembled into a single polypeptide
   chain. Two of the variable domains form the binding site for CD19, a cell surface antigen
20 expressed on most B cells and B tumor cells. The other two variable domains form the
   binding site for the CD3 complex on T cells. Blinatumomab is designed to direct the
   body's cytotoxic, or cell-destroying, T cells against tumor cells, and represent a new
   therapeutic approach to cancer therapy. Blinatumomab is presently in clinical trials.
25 [0007] As described, for instance, in WO 99/54440, adverse effects have been observed
   in a previous study performed with Blinatumomab applied in repeated bolus infusions to
   a patient with B-cell derived chronic lymphatic leukaemia (B-CLL). As shown in Figures
   19 und 20 of WO 99/54440, release of TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 has been found in response to
   each of the administered 20 minute-infusions of 3 microgram and 10 microgram of the
30 mentioned bispecific single chain antibody, respectively, with cytokine release after each
   administration. Maximal cytokine release was observed after administration of 10
   microgram of bispecific single chain antibody. In a following clinical trial study, in which
   escalating doses of the CD19xCD3             bispecific single chain antibody have been
   administered to patients with B cell malignancies as bolus infusions, adverse effects
                                                   2

   WO 20121062596                                                         PCT/EP20111/068862
   have also been observed. According to a retrospective analysis, 7 out of 22 patients
   showed an early neurological reaction, including, for example, confusion, ataxia, speech
   disorder, or disorientation.
 5 [0008] As shown in Bargou et al. (Science 321 (2008): 974-7), doses as low as 0.005
   milligrams per square meter per day continuously administered to non-Hodgkin's
   lymphoma patients over four weeks led to an elimination of lymphoma target cells in
   blood. Partial and complete tumor regressions were first observed at a dose level of
   0.015 milligrams/m2 /d, and all seven patients treated at a dose level of 0.06
10 milligrams/m 2/d experienced a tumor regression (Bargou et al., cited above). The
   CD19xCD3 bispecific single chain antibody also led to clearance of tumor cells from
   bone marrow and liver. However, though this (still ongoing) study established clinical
   proof of concept for the therapeutic potency of the CD19xCD3 bispecific single chain
   antibody format in the treatment of blood-cell derived cancer, neurological reactions
15 have been found in the course of the aforementioned clinical trial. In order to get these
   undesired side effects under control, the mode of administration of the CD19xCD3
   bispecific single chain antibody has been changed in that it has been switched over from
   bolus infusion to a continuous intravenous administration of said antibody for a longer
   period of time. Accordingly, since Blinatumomab is a very promising candidate
20 medicament for treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), such as, diffuse large B-cell
   lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL),               acute
   lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and/or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), it is highly
   desirable to reduce or even completely avoid undesired side-effects in the treatment of
   patients in need thereof with the CD19xCD3 bispecific single chain antibody.
25
   [0009] It is however difficult to design a CD19xCD3 antibody-based therapy, which does
   not cause CNS (neurological and/or psychiatric) reactions or, to put it differently, it is
   desired to provide a CD19xCD13 antibody-based medical therapies with increased
   patient tolerability, i.e., reduced or even no undesired adverse effects such as CNS
30 reactions.
   [0010] Though pharmaceutical means and methods which allow a more gradual
   activation of T cell populations (see WO 2007/068354) already helped to avoid
   significant adverse side effects in patients treated with the CD19xCD3 bispecific single
                                                3

   WO 20121062596                                                            PCT/EP20111/068862
   chain antibody, neurological reactions could unfortunately not be prevented by these
   measures, in particular in cases in which doses of more than 5 to 10 microgram per
   square meter per day (i.e. 24h) of the antibody have been administered.
 5 [0011] Thus, the technical problem underlying the present invention was to provide
   means and methods to overcome the above problems.
   [0012] The present invention addresses this need and thus provides embodiments
   concerning means and methods for use in the amelioration, treatment or prophylaxis of
10 neurological adverse effects caused by a CD3 binding domain, such as a CD19xCD3
   bispecific antibody.
   [0013] These embodiments are characterized and described herein and reflected in the
   claims.
15
   [0014] It must be noted that as used herein, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the",
   include plural references unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Thus, for
   example, reference to "a reagent" includes one or more of such different reagents and
   reference to "the method" includes reference to equivalent steps and methods known to
20 those of ordinary skill in the art that could be modified or substituted for the methods
   described herein.
   [0015] All publications and patents cited in this disclosure are incorporated by reference
   in their entirety. To the extent the material incorporated by reference contradicts or is
25 inconsistent with this specification, the specification will supersede any such material.
   Unless otherwise indicated, the term "at least" preceding a series of elements is to be
   understood to refer to every element in the series. Those skilled in the art will recognize,
   or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to
   the specific embodiments of the invention described herein. Such equivalents are
30 intended to be encompassed by the present invention.
   [0016] Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context
   requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and
                                                 4

   WO 20121062596                                                           PCT/EP20111/068862
   "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or
   group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of
   integer or step.
   In each instance herein any of the terms "comprising", "consisting essentially of' and
 5 "consisting of" may be replaced with either of the other two terms.
   [0017] Several documents are cited throughout the text of this specification. Each of the
   documents cited herein (including all patents, patent applications, scientific publications,
   manufacturer's specifications, instructions, etc.), whether supra or infra, are hereby
10 incorporated by reference in their entirety. Nothing herein is to be construed as an
   admission that the invention is not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior
   invention.
   [0018] In view of the adverse events described in the sections above, particularly the
15 adverse CNS effects including neurological reactions observed with CD3 specific binding
   domains, the finding that these adverse effects can be mitigated or even prevented if the
   administration of the CD3-specific binding domain is accompanied or preceded by the
   administration of a glucocorticoid, is definitely remarkable.
20 [0019] Specifically, the present inventors observed that those patients, to whom a
   CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody was administered, encountered neurological side effects,
   and, further, that these neurological side effects could be prevented or alleviated by
   means of a glucocorticoid (pre) and/or (co)therapy.
25 [0020] Accordingly,    the  present     invention   establishes for  the   first time    that
   glucocorticoids     such     as     dexamethasone         mitigate  or    even       prevent
   neurological/psychiatric adverse effects which might occur in the course of a treatment
   with CD3 specific binding domains (see also the Example section).
30 [0021] Glucocorticoids (GCs) are still the most widely used immunosuppressive agents
   for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and autoimmune diseases. Glucocorticoids
   (GC) are a class of steroid hormones that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR),
   which is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell, including humans. These
   compounds are potent anti-inflammatory agents, regardless of the inflammation's cause.
                                                  5

   WO 20121062596                                                             PCT/EP20111/068862
   Glucocorticoids suppress, inter alia, the cell-mediated immunity by inhibiting genes that
   code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-y.
   [0022] Cortisone which belongs to the group of GCs is an important therapeutic drug
 5 which is used to fight many ailments ranging from Addison's disease to rheumatoid
   arthritis. Ever since the discovery of its anti-rheumatic properties, which led to its
   acclaim as a wonder drug, many derivatives of cortisone with enhanced properties to
   better fight a specific ailment have been produced. Cortisone belongs to a group of
   steroids known as corticosteroids. These steroids are produced by the adrenal cortex,
10 which is the outer part of the adrenal glands, near the kidneys. The corticosteroids are
   divided into two main groups: the glucocorticoids (GCs), which control fat, protein,
   calcium and carbohydrate metabolism, and the mineralocorticoids controlling sodium
   and potassium levels. Cortisone belongs to the former group, i.e. to the GCs. Cortisone
   and its many derivatives are used for a variety of diseases. Cortisone also helped to
15 make organ transplants a reality due to its ability to minimize the defence reaction of the
   body towards foreign proteins present in the implanted organ and thus damage the
   functionality of the implanted organ. However, despite clinical use during more than 50
   years, the specific anti-inflammatory effects of GC on different cellular compartments of
   the immune system are not yet clear. GCs affect nearly every cell of the immune
20 system, and there is growing evidence for cell type-specific mechanisms.
   [0023] In a first embodiment, the present invention relates to a glucocorticoid (GC) for
   use in the amelioration, treatment or prophylaxis of neurological adverse effects caused
   by a CD3 binding domain. As outlined above, these unwanted adverse effects frequently
25 accompany a therapy with a CD3 binding domain. The present invention remedies these
   disadvantages and provides glucocorticoid(s) for use in the amelioration, treatment or
   prophylaxis of neurological adverse effects in a patient wherein said patient is subject to
   therapy with a CD3 binding domain. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a
   glucocorticoid (GC) for use in a method in the amelioration, treatment or prophylaxis of
30 neurological adverse effects caused by a CD3 binding domain.
   [0024] The present invention thus relates to a GC for use in the amelioration, treatment
   or prophylaxis of neurological adverse effects caused by a CD3 binding domain in a
                                                   6

   WO 20121062596                                                               PCT/EP20111/068862
   human patient, wherein said GC is to be administered prior to, concurrently with and/or
   subsequently to the administration of said binding domain.
   [0025] Also, the present invention relates to a method of amelioration, treatment or
 5 prophylaxis of neurological adverse effects caused by a CD3 binding domain, said
   method comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a glucocorticoid (GC). The
   GC is preferably administered in an amount which is sufficient to ameliorate, treat or
   prevent said neurological adverse effects caused by a CD3 binding domain.
10 [0026] The neurological side effects are "caused by" the administration of a CD3 binding
   domain to a patient. The term "caused by" means that the CD3 binding domain is
   causative for the neurological side effects. The skilled person can easily evaluate
   whether the administration a CD3 binding domain is causative for a neurological effect or
   not. To this end, it is just required to closely monitor the patient during the course of the
15 administration and to detect, thereby, that the administration of the CD3 binding domain
   was causative for the neurological side effects. Likewise, it is envisaged to discontinue
   the administration of the CD3 binding domain and to evaluate whether the neurological
   side effects are thereby ameliorated or even fade away, which also indicates that the
   neurological side effects were caused by said CD3 binding domain.
20
   [0027] The term "glucocorticoid" means compounds that bind, preferably specifically, to
   the glucocorticoid receptor. Said term includes compound(s) selected from the group
   consisting of cortisone, cortisol (hydrocortisone), cloprednol, prednisone, prednisolone,
   methylprednisolone,         deflazacort,     fluocortolone,     triamcinolone,      (including
25 triamcinolonacetonide) , dexamethasone, betamethasone, cortivazol, paramethasone,
   flusticasonepropionate,        triamcinolonacetonide.     and/or     fluticasone    (including
   flusticasonepropionate), including pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. In
   the context of the embodiments of the present invention, the mentioned compounds
   may be used alone or in combination. Dexamethasone is preferred. The present
30 invention is however not limited to the above mentioned specific GCs. It is envisaged
   that all substances which already are or will be classified as a "glucocorticoid", may be
   employed in the context of the present invention as well. Such future glucocorticoids
   include compounds which specifically bind to and activate the glucocorticoid receptor.
   The term "specifically binds to the GC receptor" means in accordance with the present
                                                   7

   WO 2012/062596                                                          PCT/EP20111/068862
   invention that the GC (or a compound which is assumed to act like a GC) associates
   with (e.g., interacts with) the GC receptor (also known as NR3C1) to a statistically
   significant degree as compared to association with proteins/receptors generally (i.e.,
   non-specific binding). When the GC receptor binds to glucocorticoids, its primary
 5 mechanism of action is the regulation of gene transcription. In the absence of GC, the
   glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resides in the cytosol complexed with a variety of proteins
   including Heat shock protein 90 (hsp9O), the heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) and the
   protein FKBP52 (FK506-binding protein 52). The binding of the GC to the glucocorticoid
   receptor (GR) results in release of the heat shock proteins. It is thus envisaged that a
10 future GC, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or salt of a GC is preferably able
   to bind to the GC receptor and to release the above mentioned heat shock proteins. The
   activated GR complex up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the
   nucleus or represses the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins in the cytosol (by
   preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the
15 nucleus).
   [0028] In a preferred embodiment, said GC is selected from the most clinical used and
   relevant     GCs      like    dexamethasone,      fluticasonepropionate,    prednisolone,
   methylprednisolone, betamethasone, triamcinolonacetonide or combinations thereof.
20
   [0029] In an even more preferred embodiment, said GC is dexamethasone.
   [0030] Dexamethasone        has  the  highest   glucocorticoid   potency  of   the   most
   commonly used steroids and also has the longest half-life (see Table below).        But a
25 person skilled in the field can select one of the other known glucocorticoids, some of
   which are disclosed herein, and select an appropriate effective dose to ameliorate or
   prevent neurological adverse events that may result from the treatment of a patient in
   need thereof, such as a DLBCL patient with a bispecific antibody molecule that contains
   a CD3 binding domain, such as CD19xCD3 bispecific single chain antibody.

   [0031] Dexamethasone also possesses a beneficial effect in malignant central nervous
   system (CNS) disease (e.g. CNS lymphoma or brain metastases) - possibly due to
   specific penetration to the CNS.      It is also preferentially (over other steroids) used to
 5 treat brain edema. Although corticosteroids decrease capillary permeability in the tumor
   itself, it has been found in animal models that dexamethasone may act differently and
   decrease edema by effects on bulk flow away from the tumor (Molnar, Lapin, &
   Goothuis, 1995, Neurooncol. 1995; 25(1):19-28.
10 [0032] For the clinical trials in connection with the application of a CD19xCD3 bispecific
   single chain antibody for the treatment of tumorous mass of lymph node tissue and/or
   extranodal lymphoma caused by DLBCL, the present inventors had to develop a
   treatment regime which was efficient and would be well tolerated by most of the patients.
   To this end, the present inventors applied a step-wise application of a CD19xCD3
15 bispecific single chain antibody in that 5/15/60 tg/m 2/24h was administered to patients.
   Thereby, adverse effects, in particular neurological/psychiatric events could be reduced
   in number, ameliorated and even prevented. Also contemplated in the step-wise
   administration of a CD19xCD3 bispecific single chain antibody is a treatment regime
   using two of the dosages, such as 5/15 tg/m 2/24h, 5/60 tg/m 2/24h, or 15/60 jig/m 2/24h
20 for the duration of the patient's treatment. The appropriate dosage can be selected by
   the clinician on the basis of efficacy, tolerability and safety with a minimum of adverse
   effects in the patient.
   But the inventors also contemplate the treatment of tumorous mass of lymph node
   tissue and/or extranodal lymphoma caused by DLBCL to include the continuous
25 administration of a flat dose without escalation to a subsequent higher dose.             For

   15pg/m 2/24h, or 60pg/m 2/24h of a CD19xCD3 bispecific single chain antibody until the
   conclusion of a course of the treatment up to 8 weeks [56 days] with good tolerability
   and no adverse effects, and even longer if determined to be safe and effective.

   [0033] It is generally preferred that each of the doses disclosed herein can be converted
   from amount (in gg)/m 2/d into .tg/d by multiplying the respective dose with the factor 1.9.
   Accordingly, each of the doses disclosed herein can be applied in the methods and uses
   by multiplying it with the factor 1.9. For example, a dose of 5 tg/m 2/d is converted into
10 9.5 Vig/d, a dose of 15 4g/m 2 is converted into 28.5 Vig/m 2/ and a dose of 60 Vig/m2/ is
   converted into 114 jig/m 2. It is preferred that a decimal digit that results from the
   multiplication is either rounded up or rounded down, respectively, to a whole number.
   For example, a dose of 9.5 jig/d can be rounded down to 9 4g/d and a dose of 28.5
         2
   pIg/m   can be rounded down to 28 jig/d. Likewise, a dose of 9.5 jig/d can be rounded up
                                         2
15 to 10 Vig/d and a dose of 28.5 Vig/m    can be rounded up to 29 Vig/d.
   [0034] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives" includes salts, esters, enol
   ethers, enol esters, acetals, ketals, orthoesters, hemiacetals, hemiketals, acids, bases,
   solvates, hydrates or prodrugs thereof. Such derivatives may be readily prepared by
20 those of skill in this art using known methods for such derivatisation.
   [0035] The dose of the GC that is to be used in accordance with the embodiments of the
   present invention is not limited, i.e. it will depend on the circumstances of the individual
   patient. GC can be administered intravenously or orally. Preferred dosages of the GC
25 include, however, between 1 to 6 mg (dexamethasone equivalent) at the lower end of
   dosing to 40 mg/d (dexamethasone equivalent). Said dosage can be administered all at
   once or subdivided into smaller dosages (see the appended examples). Particularly
   preferred is a dosage of 4 to 24 mg/d. Daily dosages of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 or 24 mg/d are
   even more preferred. A dosage of 1 x 4mg per day, 2 x 4mg per day, 1 x 8 mg per day;
30 1x4 mg plus 1x8 mg per day, 2 x 8 mg per day, 2 x 10mg per day or 5 x 4mg per day
   and 3 x 8 mg per day of dexamethasone is particularly preferred. "d" denotes one day.
   Further dosage regimens are derivable from the appended examples. All dosages given
   in this paragraph refer to dexamethasone equivalents.

   WO 20121062596                                                            PCT/EP20111/068862
   [0036] An "adverse effect", which is sometimes also denoted as "side effect" or "adverse
   event (in clinical studies)" is a harmful and undesired effect resulting from medication in
   the treatment of a patient with a CD3 binding domain. A "neurological/psychiatric
   adverse effect" which is sometimes also denoted as neurological symptom or CNS
 5 adverse effect, includes conditions of a human patient such as all forms of pain,
   including headache and back pain, muscle weakness or incoordination, abnormal
   sensations in the skin, and disturbances of the senses, seizures, encephalopathy,
   cerebral edema, confusion, ataxia, speech disorder, hallucinations, apraxia, paresis,
   tremor, headache, or disorientation. A neurological effect as used herein preferably
10 includes psychiatric adverse effects. Sometimes, however, the terms "neurological
   adverse effect" and "psychiatric adverse effects" can be used interchangeable.
   [0037] Specifically, neurological/psychiatric reactions observed during treatment with a
   CD3 binding domain include for example confusion and disorientation. "Confusion" as
15 used herein refers to loss of orientation which is the ability to place oneself correctly in
   the world by time, location, and personal identity, and often memory which is the ability
   to correctly recall previous events or learn new material. The patients usually have
   difficulties to concentrate and thinking is not only blurred and unclear but often
   significantly slowed down. Patients with neurological/psychiatric reactions also suffer
20 from loss of memory. Frequently, the confusion leads to the loss of ability to recognize
   people and/or places, or to tell time and the date. Feelings of disorientation are common
   in confusion, and the decision-making ability is impaired. Neurological reactions further
   comprise blurred speech and/or word finding difficulties. This disorder may impair both,
   the expression and understanding of language as well as reading and writing. Besides
25 urinary incontinence, also vertigo and dizziness may accompany neurological reactions
   in some patients.
   [0038] The herein mentioned "patient" is a mammal, preferably a human, who will be or
   (already) is treated with a CD3 binding domain.
30
   [0039] It is also envisaged that the patient is characterized by a B/T-cell ratio of less
   than 1:5 (see PCT/EP2010/066207).
                                                 11

   WO 2012/062596                                                            PCT/EP20111/068862
   [0040] In a preferred embodiment, the patient is suspected/assumed to comprise or
   already comprises malignant CD19 positive lymphocytes (in particular B cells). In the
   latter case, said patient has already been diagnosed to comprise such cells. These
   malignant CD19 positive lymphocytes (in particular B cells) are present in a patient
 5 developing and/or suffering from leukemia and/or lymphoma.
   [0041] A "CD3 binding domain" characterizes in connection with the present invention a
   binding domain which comprises a framework region and an "antigen-binding-site" or
   "antigen-interaction site" which is able to specifically interact with a CD3 antigen. Said
10 binding/interaction is also understood to define a "specific recognition". The term
   "specifically interact/interacting" means in accordance with this invention that the binding
   domain is capable of binding to at least two, preferably at least three, more preferably at
   least four amino acids of the CD3 antigen, preferably the CD3epsilon antigen, and more
   preferably the human CD3epsilon antigen. Such CD3 binding domains as well as
15 specific CD3epsilon epitopes are well-known to the skilled person and exemplified in
   great detail for example in W02008119567 or in W02008119566, both of which are
   included herein by way of reference thereto.
   [0042] As used herein, "CD3" denotes a molecule expressed as part of the T cell
   receptor and has the meaning as typically ascribed to it in the prior art. In human, it
20 encompasses in individual or independently combined form all known CD3 subunits, for
   example CD3 epsilon, CD3 delta, CD3 gamma, CD3 zeta, CD3 alpha and CD3 beta.
   The human CD3 epsilon is indicated in GenBank Accession No.NM_000733.
   [0043] A CD3 binding molecule which binds to the human CD3 epsilon is preferred. The
   CD3epsilon epitope disclosed in great detail in W02008119567 or in W02008119566 is
25 even more preferred.
   [0044] The term "framework" includes a scaffold for antigen-binding sites. For example,
   such a scaffold could be provided by protein A, in particular, the Z-domain thereof
   (affibodies), ImmE7 (immunity proteins), BPTI/APPI (Kunitz domains), Ras-binding
30 protein AF-6 (PDZ-domains), charybdotoxin (Scorpion toxin), CTLA-4, Min-23 (knottins),
   lipocalins (anticalins), neokarzinostatin, a fibronectin domain, an ankyrin consensus
   repeat domain or thioredoxin (Skerra, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 18, 295-304 (2005); Hosse
   et al., Protein Sci. 15, 14-27 (2006); Nicaise et al., Protein Sci. 13, 1882-1891 (2004);
   Nygren and Uhlen, Curr. Opin. Struc. Biol. 7, 463-469 (1997)).

   [0045] A preferred "framework" is, in the context of the present invention, the art
   recognized portions of an antibody variable region that exist between the more divergent
   (i.e., hypervariable) complementarity determining regions (CDRs) within the variable
   region of an antibody. Such framework regions are typically referred to as frameworks 1
 5 through 4 (FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4) and provide a scaffold for the presentation of the
   six CDRs (three from the heavy chain and three from the light chain) in three
   dimensional space, to form an antigen-binding surface.
   [0046] A preferred example of a CD3 binding domain in line with the present invention is
10 an antibody. The binding domain may be a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody or derived
   from a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody. The term "antibody" comprises derivatives or
   functional fragments thereof which still retain the binding specificity. Techniques for the
   production of antibodies are well known in the art and described, e.g. in Harlow and
   Lane "Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual", Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988
15 and Harlow and Lane "Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual" Cold Spring Harbor
   Laboratory Press, 1999. The term "antibody" also comprises immunoglobulins (Ig's) of
   different classes (i.e. IgA, IgG, IgM, IgD and IgE) and subclasses (such as IgG1, IgG2
   etc.).
   [0047] The definition of the term "antibody" also includes embodiments such as
20 chimeric, single chain, de-immunized and humanized antibodies, as well as antibody
   fragments, like, inter alia, Fab fragments. Antibody fragments or derivatives further
   comprise F(ab')2, Fv, scFv fragments or single domain antibodies, single variable
   domain antibodies or immunoglobulin single variable domain comprising merely one
   variable domain, which might be VH or VL, that specifically bind to an antigen or epitope
25 independently of other V regions or domains; see, for example, Harlow and Lane (1988)
   and (1999), cited above. Such immunoglobulin single variable domain encompasses not
   only an isolated antibody single variable domain           polypeptide,    but also   larger
   polypeptides that comprise one or more monomers of an antibody single variable
   domain polypeptide sequence.
30
   [0048] Bispecific antibody formats are preferred; however other multispecific antibody
   formats (trispecifc, tetrabodies etc.) are not excluded.

   WO 20121062596                                                           PCT/EP20111/068862
   [0049] In a further preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to methods of
   treatment/dosage regimen which employ CD19xCD3 bispecific antibodies, comprising a
   first binding domain capable of binding to an epitope of human CD3 epsilon chain and a
   second binding domain capable of binding to human CD19. Examples for bispecific
 5 molecules according to the methods of the invention are described in great detail in
   WO 99/54440 and WO 2004/106381 and WO 2008/119565. All the specific CD1 9xCD3
   bispecific antibodies disclosed therein, including their variants, fragments, equivalents
   etc. are particularly preferred CD1 9xCD3 bispecific antibodies of the present invention.
10 [0050] As used herein, a "CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody" (including a CD19xCD3
   bispecific single chain antibody) denotes a single polypeptide chain comprising two
   binding domains. Such single chain antibodies are preferred in the context of the
   methods/dosage regimen of the present invention. Each binding domain comprises at
   least one variable region from an antibody heavy chain ("VH or H region"), wherein the
15 VH region of the first binding domain specifically binds to the CD3 epsilon molecule, and
   the VH region of the second binding domain specifically binds to CD19. The two binding
   domains are optionally linked to one another by a short polypeptide spacer. A non
   limiting example for a polypeptide spacer is Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser (G-G-G-G-S) and
   repeats thereof. Each binding domain may additionally comprise one variable region
20 from an antibody light chain ("VL or L region"), the VH region and VL region within each
   of the first and second binding domains being linked to one another via a polypeptide
   linker, for example of the type disclosed and claimed in EP 623679 B1, but in any case
   long enough to allow the VH region and VL region of the first binding domain and the VH
   region and VL region of the second binding domain to pair with one another such that,
25 together, they are able to specifically bind to the respective first and second binding
   domains. Such CD19CD3 bispecific single chain antibodies are described in great detail
   in WO 99/54440 and WO 2004/106381.
   [0051]     The human CD19 protein is indicated in GenBank Accession No. AAA69966.
30
   [0052] Preferably, the bispecific antibody applied in the methods/dosage regimens of the
   present invention has the domain arrangement VL(CD1 9)-VH(CD1 9)-VH(CD3)-VL(CD3).

   [0053] It is, however, also envisaged that the methods of the invention can be carried
   out with CD19xCD3 bispecific single chain antibodies of other domain arrangements,
   such as
   VH(CD1 9)-VL(CD1 9)-VH(CD3)-VL(CD3),

   invention comprises the
   (a)     anti-CD3 CDRs of the heavy chain shown as CD3 CDR-H1 in SEQ ID NO: 11

           CD19 CDR-L3 in SEQ ID NO: 22 (QQSTEDPWT).
   [0055] It is more preferred that the CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody applied in the
30 methods of the present invention comprises the CD3 CDRs of the heavy and light chain.
   Even more preferably, the CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody applied in the methods of the
   present invention comprises the CD3 CDRs of the heavy and light chain as well as the
   CD19 CDRs of the heavy and light chain.

   The CDRs referred to herein are in accordance with the Kabat numbering system. The
   Kabat numbering scheme is a widely adopted standard for numbering the residues in an
   antibody in a consistent manner (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological
   Interest, 1991).
 5
   [0056] Alternatively, it is preferred that the CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody applied in the
   methods of the present invention comprises the
   (a)     CD19 variable heavy chain shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 (nucleotide sequence is
           shown in SEQ ID NO: 4); and/or
10 (b)     CD19 variable light chain shown in SEQ ID NO: 5 (nucleotide sequence is shown

   (c)     CD3 variable heavy chain shown in SEQ ID NO: 7 (nucleotide sequence is
           shown in SEQ ID NO: 8); and/or
   (d)     CD3 variable light chain shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 (nucleotide sequence is shown
15         in SEQ ID NO: 10).
   More preferably, the CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody applied in the methods of the
   present invention comprises the CD19 variable heavy and light chain and/or the CD3
   variable heavy and light chain. Even more preferably, the CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody
   applied in the methods of the present invention comprises the CD19 variable heavy and
20 light chain as well as the CD3 variable heavy and light chain.
   [0057] In another alternative, it is also preferred that said bispecific single chain antibody
   comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of
   (a)     an amino acid sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1;
25 (b)     an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleic acid sequence as shown in SEQ
           ID NO: 2;
   (c)     an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleic acid sequence having at least
           70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 99% identity to a nucleic acid sequence of (b), wherein
           said amino acid sequence is capable of specifically binding to CD3 and CD19;
30         and
   (d)     an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleic acid sequence which is
           degenerate as a result of the genetic code to a nucleotide sequence of (b),
           wherein said amino acid sequence is capable of specifically binding to CD3 and
           CD19.

   WO 20121062596                                                           PCT/EP20111/068862
   [0058] It is to be understood that the sequence identity is determined over the entire
   amino acid sequence. For sequence alignments, for example, the programs Gap or
   BestFit can be used (Needleman and Wunsch J. Mol. Biol. 48 (1970), 443-453; Smith
   and Waterman, Adv. Apple. Math 2 (1981), 482-489), which is contained in the GCG
 5 software package (Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wisconsin,
   USA 53711 (1991). It is a routine method for those skilled in the art to determine and
   identify an amino acid sequence having e.g. 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or
   99% sequence identity to the amino acid sequences of the CD19xCD3 bispecific
   antibody described herein (preferably MT1 03). For example, according to Crick's Wobble
10 hypothesis, the 5' base on the anti-codon is not as spatially confined as the other two
   bases, and could thus have non-standard base pairing. Put in other words: the third
   position in a codon triplet may vary so that two triplets which differ in this third position
   may encode the same amino acid residue. Said hypothesis is well known to the person
   skilled in the art (see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WobbleHypothesis; Crick, J Mol
15 Biol 19 (1966): 548-55). It is furthermore a routine procedure for those skilled in the art
   to determine cytotoxic activity of such an amino acid sequence having e.g. 70%, 80%,
   90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence identity to the nucleotide or amino acid
   sequences of the CD19xCD3 bispecific single chain antibody described herein. Cytotoxic
   activity of the CD19xCD3 bispecific single chain antibody or an antibody construct
20 having e.g. 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence identity to the
   amino acid sequences of the CD19xCD3 bispecific single chain antibody can be
   determined by methods as illustrated e.g. in WO 99/54440.
   [0059] Particularly preferred, said CD19xCD3 bispecific single chain antibody has the
25 amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1.
   [0060] Also particularly preferred is the CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody MT103 described
   in WO 99/54440 as well as those CD19xCD3 bispecific antibodies described in
   WO 2004/106381 and WO 2008/119565.

   [0061] The present invention also relates to a CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody for use in
   the treatment of malignant CD19 positive lymphocytes in a human patient, wherein said
   antibody is to be administered prior to, concurrently with or subsequently to the
   administration of a GC.

   [0062] The present invention further relates to a method for
   (i)     administering a CD3 binding domain, such as a CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody to
           a human patient, or
   (ii)    treating   malignant    CD19   positive   lymphocytes   in  a  human     patient by
 5         administering the CD3 binding domain;
   wherein said antibody is to be administered prior to, subsequently to and/or in
   combination with a GC.
   [0063] The administration       of the CD3 binding domain or of a pharmaceutical
10 composition comprising said CD3 binding domain is preferably an intravenous
   administration. The administration       of the GC or a pharmaceutical composition
   comprising said GC is preferably intravenous or per os (p.o.). They may be administered
   as a bolus injection or continually (continuously), with continually being preferred. A
   continual administration     refers to an administration which is essentially without
15 interruption. "Essentially without interruption" includes a continual administration usually
   without an uninterrupted flow or spatial extension. By way of example, WO 2007/068354
   discloses a treatment regimen which is specifically included herein by way of reference
   thereto. Other treatment regimens which are envisaged in the context of the present
   invention are disclosed in PCT/EP2010/066207.

   [0064] In a preferred embodiment, a first dose of the CD3 binding domain is
   administered for a first period of time; and optionally consecutively a second dose of the
   CD3 binding domain is administered for a second period of time, wherein the second
   dose exceeds the first dose.
25
   [0065] The term "exceeds" means that the second period of time is at least one day
   longer than the first period of time.
   [0066] In another preferred embodiment of the present application, a third dose of the
30 CD3 binding domain is administered for a third period of time after administering a first
   and second dose for a first and second period of time. Accordingly, the present invention
   provides a three-stage (three-step) administration scheme (dosage regimen) to be
   applied in the uses and methods described herein.

   WO 20121062596                                                          PCT/EP20111/068862
   [0067] In a further preferred embodiment, the present invention encompasses the
   continuous administration of a flat dose of the CD3 binding domain without escalation to
   a subsequent higher dose.        For example, the present administration includes the
                              2
   administration of 60gg/m /24h, 15pig/m 2/24h or 5 Lg/m 2/24h of a CD3 binding domain, in
 5 particular a CD19xCD3 bispecific single chain antibody until the conclusion of a course
   of the treatment up to 8 weeks [56 days] and even longer if determined to be safe and
   effective.
   [0068] More specifically, in a three-stage administration scheme, dexamethasone is
10 administered in the range of between 6 and 48 hours before the administration of the
   first dose of the CD3 binding domain, more preferably between 6 and 12 hours, and
   more preferably 12 hours, before the first dose administration.     Then approximately 1
   hour before (range 15min - 2h including 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 75 min, 90 min) the first
   dose of the binding domain is administered, a dose of dexamethasone is again
15 administered to the patient. Then dexamethasone is administered 1 or more days,
   preferably 2 to 3 days, after the first dose of the antibody, preferably on the two days
   after the first binding domain administration and administered 1 or more days, preferably
   2 or more days after each dose increase, preferably on the two days after the
   administration of the dose increase of the binding domain. Each of the dexamethasone
20 doses is preferably between 6 and 40 mg, and preferably at approximately 20 or 24 mg
   per dose.
   [0069] The time range between 6 and 48 hours includes the administration of the
   dexamethasone dose and means that the times prior to the first administration of the
25 binding domain are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,
   25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46,47
   and 48 hours. Similarly, the preferred time range between 6 and 12 hours includes the
   administration of the dexamethasone dose prior to the first administration of the binding
   domain and includes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 hours,
30
   [0070] In a further embodiment, dexamethasone is administered for a period of two,
   three, four or five days during which the dose of the binding domain is increased. For
   example, dexamethasone is administered at a first point of time in a dose of 6 to 40 mg
   or 6 to 48 mg, preferably 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 or 48 mg, with 20 or 24 mg being
                                                19

   preferred, at a second point of time in a dose of preferably 8, 12, 16, 20, or 24 mg, with
   16 mg being preferred and/or at a third point of time in a dose of preferably 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
   or 12 mg, with 8 mg being preferred. It may also be administered at a fourth point of time
   or fourth and fifth point of time in a dose of preferably 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 mg, with 8 mg
 5 being preferred.
   [0071] It is also envisaged that the human patient of the present invention is
   characterized by a B/T-cell ratio of less than 1:5 (see PCT/EP2010/066207).                As
   disclosed in great detail in PCT/EP2010/066207, neurological side effects frequently
   accompany the administration of a CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody in patients which are
10 characterized by a B/T-cell ratio of less than 1:5. The prevention, amelioration or
   treatment of neurological side effects caused by a CD3 binding domain by way of a GC
   therapy disclosed herein, is however also applicable to patients which are characterized
   by a B/T-cell ratio of more than 1:5 (see PCT/EP2010/066207).
15 [0072] The present invention also relates to a (pharmaceutical)               kit or package
   comprising a GC and/or a CD3 binding domain, and instructions and/or an imprint
   indicating that the GC is to be employed for the treatment amelioration and/or
   prophylaxis of neurological adverse events caused by said CD3 binding domain. Said
   GC and CD3 binding domain are preferably packaged together in one sealed package or
20 kit. It is also envisaged that the package or kit of the present invention, further comprises
   means to administer the GC and/or Cd3 binding domain to a patient and/or buffers, vials,
   teflon bags or infusion bags which are normally used for the infusion of therapeutic
   agents. "Means" thereby includes one or more article(s) selected from the group
   consisting of a syringe, a hypodermic needle, a cannula, a catheter, an infusion bag for
25 intravenous administration,      intravenous vehicles, vials, buffers, stabilizers, written
   instructions which aid the skilled person in the preparation of the respective doses and
   infusions of the invention etc.
   [0073] By "complete response" is intended an absence of clinically detectable disease
   with normalization of any previously abnormal imaging studies such as radiographic
30 studies. Such a response preferably persists for at least 4 to 8 weeks, sometimes 6 to 8
   weeks or more than 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 or 20 weeks or longer, following treatment
   according to the invention. Alternatively, an improvement in the disease may be
   categorized as being a partial response.

   Preferably, complete remission in ALL is defined as a blast count below 5% in the bone
   marrow and recovery of bone marrow function. Detailed remission and response
   definitions for NHL patients are used according to Cheson et al., 1999, J Clin Oncol.

   [0074] By "partial response" is intended at least about a 50% decrease in all measurable
   tumor burden (i.e., the number of malignant cells present in the patient, or the measured
   bulk of tumor masses) in the absence of new lesions and persisting for 4 to 8 weeks or
   more than 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 or 20 weeks or longer. A "complete response" does,
10 however, not necessarily indicate that a disease has been cured, since a patient may
   relapse. However, if so, the patient can again be treated with a composition comprising a
   CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody as described herein.

   Examples
   [0075] The following examples illustrate the invention. These examples should not be
   construed as to limit the scope of this invention. The examples are included for purposes
 5 of illustration and the present invention is limited only by the claims.
   [0076] Patients have been treated with blinatumomab and                the co-medication of
   dexamethasone worked as amelioration, treatment or prophylaxis of neurological and/or
   psychiatric adverse events.
10
   [0077] The      administration  of therapeutic dexamethasone was beneficial in that
   neurological and/or psychiatric symptoms disappeared without necessity to stop
   treatment by Blinatumomab.
15 [0078] Patient 109-015 with follicular lymphoma received blinatumomab at a dose of
   60pgIm 2/d right from treatment start (i.e. without dose escalation step) for 4 weeks, the
   patient additionally received dexamethasone on days 4-5: 3x 8mg p.o. and on days 6-7:
   1x8mg p.o. in order to treat headache. This treatment cycle had not to be discontinued
   due to neurological/psychiatric adverse events.
20
   [0079] Patient 109-017 with follicular lymphoma received blinatumomab at a dose of
   60pg/m 2/d right from treatment start (i.e. without dose escalation step) for 5 weeks; in
   order to treat tremor dexamethasone was given p.o.: day 7: 8mg-4mg-4mg; day 8+9:
   8mg-4mg-Omg; day 10-11: 4mg-4mg-Omg; day 12-15:                   4mg- Omg - Omg)). This
25 treatment cycle had not to be discontinued due to neurological/psychiatric adverse
   events.
   [0080] Patient 109-026 with MCL received blinatumomab at a dose of 5 pg/m 2 /d for 1
   week followed by 60pg/m 2/d for the remaining 6 weeks. The patient received
30 dexamethasone p.o. in order to treat apraxia on day d11: 3x8mg and on day 12: 2x8mg.
   This treatment cycle had not to be discontinued due to neurological/psychiatric adverse
   events.

   [0081] Patient 135-001 with DLBCL received blinatumomab at 5 pg/m 2/d for one week,
   at 15 pg/m 2/d for the   2 nd week, and 60 pg/m 2/d for 4 more days.    The patient received
   dexamethasone in order to treat tremor at 5 pg/m 2/d on d3 (3x8mg) continued in
   decreasing dose over less than a week. There were no neurological events after
 5 escalation   to   15ug,      which  could  be explained      by  a   prophylactic effect   of
   dexamethasone. However, on day 4 after step to 60ug/m 2/d the patient had to stop due
   to neurologicallpsychiatric adverse events which occurred too fast to intervene with
   dexamethasone.
10 [0082] Patient 109-036 with follicular lymphoma was treated with 5pg/m 2/d for the first
   week followed by treatment at 60 pg/m 2/d blinatumomab for the remaining 6 weeks of
   treatment. The patient experienced neurological adverse events (tremor and apraxia)
   starting on day 11, i.e. four days after the step to 60 pg/m 2/d. Dexamethasone was
   administered i.v. (3x8 mg) and the neurological adverse events resolved under
15 continued treatment with blinatumomab.
   [0083] Patient 109-038 with DLBCL received blinatumomab at 5 pg/m 2/d for one week,
   at 15 pg/m 2ld for the   2n   week, and 60 pg/m 2/d for the remaining 6 weeks of treatment.
   On day 15, the patient developed intention tremor which resolved after dexamethasone
20 (3x8mg iv.) was given (continued blinatumomab treatment).
   [0084] Patient 109-039 with MCL received blinatumomab at 5 pg/m 2/d for one week, at
   15 pg/m 2/d for the 2 nd  week, and 60 pg/m 2/d for the remaining 12 days of treatment. On
   day 17, the patient developed tremor and slight speech disturbance which resolved after
25 dexamethasone; 3x8mg           of dexamethasone i.v. was given (continued blinatumomab
   treatment).
   [0085] Patient 153-002 with MCL received blinatumomab at 5 pg/m 2/d for one week, at
   15 pg/m 2/d for the 2 nd  week, and 60 pg/m 2/d for one week. The patient developed slight
30 speech problems on day 4 which completely resolved after dexamethasone was given
   (3x8mg p.o.), in decreasing doses over a few days. On day 22 the patient had to stop
   treatment due to paresis which disappeared without intervention.

   Besides the therapeutic use of dexamethasone to mitigate neurological adverse events,
   dexamethasone was also used as prophylaxis in order to prevent neurological adverse
   events.
 5 [0086] Patient 135-002 with DLBCL received blinatumomab at 5 pg/m 2/d for one week,
   at 15 pg/m 2/d for the 2 nd week, and 60 pg/m 2/d for the remaining 2 weeks and in addition
   received dexamethasone prophylaxis (dose: 3x8 mg on day of start of blinatumomab
   treatment and on days of dose escalation steps). The patient did not have to discontinue
   treatment with blinatumomab due to neurological adverse events.
10
   [0087] In patient 155-001 in trial 103-206 with relapsed ALL, was treated with a
   continuous infusion of blinatumomab at a dosage of 15pg/m2/d for 16 days. The patient
   was administered dexamethasone before the administration of blinatumomab in
   accordance with the teaching of the present application Specifically, dexamethasone
15 prophylaxis was given (8mg before treatment start): The patient did not have to
   discontinue treatment due to adverse events. The patient achieved a complete
   remission.
   Each of the following 5 patients in trial 103-104 (all with DLBCL) were treated with
20 blinatumomab continuous infusion at 5pg/m2/d for the        1st week, then 15pg/m2/d for the
   2ndt week, and then 60pg/m2/d for the remaining treatment period that could an
   additional 2-6 weeks. Also each of the following patients were treated prophylactically
   with 20 mg of dexamethasone at twelve hours and 1 hour before the start of
   blinatumomab treatment and before each dose increase from the 5 to 15 pg and from 15
25 to 60 pg.
   [0088] Patients 135-003 did not have to discontinue due to neurological/psychiatric
   adverse events.
30 [0089] Patient 108-007 did not have to discontinue due to neurological/psychiatric
   adverse events. This patient achieved a complete remission of the lymphoma.
   [0090] Patient 108-008 did not have to discontinue due to neurological/psychiatric
   adverse events.

   [0091] Patient 108-009 did not have to discontinue due to neurological/psychiatric
   adverse events. This patient achieved an objective response of the lymphoma.
   [0092] Patient 108-010 additionally received 100 mg prednisolone one hour before start
 5 of infusion. The patient did not have to discontinue due to neurological/psychiatric
   adverse events.
   [0093] Dexamethasone was used as a prophylaxis for neurological adverse events in a
   14-y female patient with ALL who was treated with 15pg/m 2/d blinatumomab on a named
10 patient compassionate use base. 4 weeks in first cycle The patient received
   dexamethasone on day 1: 3x6 mg p.o., on day 2: 2x 6mg p.o. and on day 3: 1x 6mg).
   The patient did not have to discontinue treatment due to adverse events. The patient
   achieved a complete remission.
15 [0094] A Phase I clinical trial was performed in patients with various B-NHL including
   DLBCL to evaluate the CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody construct          in DLBCL patients.
   Patients were treated for 4-8-weeks by continuous i.v. administration of the antibody with
   the following step-wise dosing regimen: first week at 5 pg/m 2/d, second week at 15
                                                              2
   pg/m 2/d and for the remaining treatment period at 60 pg/m /d.
20 Two cohorts each with 6 DLBCL patients were enrolled. The two cohorts solely differed
   by the dose and schedule of the glucocorticoid medication administered at the beginning
   of the antibody infusion for mitigation of adverse events.
   Out of the twelve patients, 5 were male and 7 female. The median age was 57 years
   (range from 24 to 78 years). Patients had received a median of 4 prior regimens (range
25 from 2-6). All patients had been exposed to rituximab. Eight of the 12 patients had
   undergone ASCT. International prognostic index (IPI) at screening ranged from 1 to 3
   with a median of 2. In the first cohort 100 mg prednisolone was administered 1 hour
   prior to start; and in the second cohort patients received dexamethasone (3x 8 mg) on
   days 1, 2, and 3. Before treatment start in the second cohort 20 mg dexamethasone was
30 administered at 12 hours and 1 hour prior to the administration of a CD1 9xCD3 bispecific
   antibody construct
   Although just one DLT (reversible CNS event grade 3) occurred in the prednisolone
   DLBCL cohort and, thus, the cohort is considered safe, a further DLBCL cohort applying
   prophylactic dexamethasone (3x8 mg at start of infusion or dose increase and reduction
                                                 25

   to 3x6 mg or 3x4 mg on the following 2 days, respectively) was opened to optimize
   management of CNS events. In light of one of the first two patients having a DLT due to
   a reversible CNS adverse event, a modified "early dexamethasone" schedule (20 mg at
   12 to -6 hours and -1 hour, at start of infusion or dose increase, and 3x8 mg during the
 5 following 2 days) was introduced to test if earlier and more intensive administration of
   dexamethasone may ameliorate CNS adverse events. No further DLTs were observed
   after this adjustment of the dexamethasone schedule. Thus, both the dexamethasone
   cohort as well as the "early dexamethasone administration" are considered safe. Among
   a total of 5 patients with DLBCL treated with the "early dexamethasone schedule" no
10 DLT was observed. Therefore, it was concluded that additional administration of "early
   dexamethasone" is the safest way to administer blinatumomab to patients with DLBCL.
   Also for patients with "early dexamethasone" objective responses have been observed.
