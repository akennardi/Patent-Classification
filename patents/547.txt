Background of the Invention
[0001] This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2013266007, the
entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference. The present invention relates to a
method and apparatus for extracting a sample from a biological subject, and in one particular
example, to an apparatus and method for extracting a sample from a subject as part of an
endoscopic procedure.
Description of the Prior Art
[0002] The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived
from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an
acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that the prior publication (or
information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general knowledge
in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.
[0003] In Australia functional dyspepsia (FD) affects 15% of the population, causing
considerable morbidity and is a common reason for medical consultations and a substantial
financial burden. Whilst it is accepted that treatment with proton pump inhibitors,
prokinetics, diets, psychotropic drugs and some herbal remedies may improve symptoms in a
subset of patients, there is no cure for this disease and at best the gain over placebo reaches
20%. Thus there is a pressing need to unravel the causes and develop effective treatment of
FD. In recent years, strict diagnostic criteria have evolved based on robust epidemiological
data (Rome III definition of FD); symptoms should have been present for the last 3 months,
with onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis.
[0004] There is strong emerging support for the concept that the intestinal microbiome plays
a critical role in mucosal inflammation. As mucosal inflammation appears to be central for
symptoms in FD it appears critical to take the microbiome into consideration. It is also
believed that micro-biota present in the stomach and intestines or other surfaces of biological
subjects can have a significant impact on digestive or other processes and general health.

                                                           -2
[0005] Data demonstrates that the stool microbiome poorly correlates with colonisation of
the mucosa. Thus it is essential to study the microbiome colonising the mucosa of gut
segments by taking targeted aseptic biopsies from defined segments of the gut rather than
relying on luminal or stool samples.
[0006] It is known to acquire samples from within biological subjects, in a procedure
commonly referred to as a biopsy. This is used for example to assist in performing clinical
diagnosis, or the like. In order to achieve this, it is typical to insert an endoscope into the
subject, with a tip of the endoscope being positioned adjacent a site to be sampled. Once in
place, an instrument, such as forceps or a blade, can be inserted through a working channel of
the endoscope, allowing the sample to be collected.
[0007] However, it can be difficult to extract a sample from the intestines without this being
contaminated by bacteria or other substances from elsewhere in the body. For example, in
order to retrieve a sample from the duodenum, it is necessary for the endoscope to pass
through a subject' s mouth and stomach, before reaching the duodenum. During this insertion
process, parts of the working channel become contaminated with bacteria and other
substances from the mouth and stomach. As a result, when the instrument is inserted into the
working channel, and when samples are removed therethrough, there is the potential for these
to come into contact with contaminants from the stomach, meaning it can be difficult to
obtain samples from a subject without these becoming contaminated.
[0008] Thus, with currently available methods it is impossible to obtain sterile or aseptic
biopsies from defined segments of the small bowel or colon. Biopsy channels of endoscopes
are used to aspirate luminal content or take mucosal biopsies but working channels of
endoscopes are always contaminated by luminal contents.
[0009] Given that accuracy of obtained results is heavily dependent on the quality of an
obtained sample, it is important that such sampling processes are improved.              This is
particularly important when analysing the bacterial content of different portions of the
intestines as little is currently known regarding expected micro-biota distribution, particularly
in the various parts of the gastrointestinal tract.

[00101 US-7,878,983 describes a method and device for removing tissue from a patient
during a biopsy procedure utilizing a biopsy collection device. The biopsy collection device
includes a body portion configured for attachment to an endoscope and a receptacle portion
configured to retain a portion of tissue removed from a target site during the biopsy
procedure. The biopsy collection device further includes a passageway configured to receive
a biopsy sampling device, such as a pair of forceps, passing through the endoscope to the
target site.
[0011] US-7,311,674 describes a cap for a medical device. The cap includes a body defining a
cavity configured to accommodate at least a portion of an end effector assembly of the
medical device, and a tissue removal portion attached to the body and configured to remove a
tissue sample disposed within the end effector assembly when the cavity is not
accommodating the end effector assembly. Embodiments of the invention also may include a
medical kit including a medical device and a cap and a method of performing a medical
procedure with the cap.

[0053] The endoscope 100 typically includes a control head 110, coupled to an insertion tube
 120, which has a bending section 121 and ends in a tip 122. The control head 110 is further
coupled to a connector assembly 130, sometimes referred to as a light guide connector. The
connector assembly 130 includes a number of ports 131, 132, 133, 134 for connection to
external equipment, such as a light source and imaging equipment, as well as sources of air,
water and suction.
[0054] The connector assembly 130 is typically coupled to the control head 110 via an
umbilical cable 140 which provides necessary connections between the ports 131, 132, 133,
 134 and the endoscope 100.                        In particular, the endoscope typically includes a number of
channels extending from the connector assembly 130, via the umbilical cable 140, to the
control head 110 and from the control head 110 along the insertion tube 120 to the tip 122.
These channels typically include a working channel 151, shown in Figure 1B, which is
coupled to the suction port 131 to provide suction, and which includes a biopsy port 154 to
allow for insertion of instruments 160, such as forceps, or the like. The channels typically
also include air/water channels 152 and an imaging/light guide 153.                          It will be appreciated
that although three channels only are shown, this is for the purpose of illustration and in
practice any appropriate number of channels may be provided.
[0055] The control head 110 includes a number of controls to allow an operator to control
operation of the endoscope 100.                            The controls typically include one or more articulation
mechanisms 111, allowing the shape of the bending section 121 to be adjusted so that the
endoscope can be inserted into the subject. Additionally, controls 112, 113 are provided for
controlling the application of air and water via the air/water channel 152 and for controlling
the application of suction via the working channel 151.
[0056] It will be appreciated that the above-described endoscope is therefore a typical
endoscope arrangement and its operation and construction will not therefore be described in
any further detail. It will also be appreciated from the following description that the
techniques described herein can be implemented using any suitable endoscope, and the above
described arrangement is for the purpose of illustration only.

[0057] Examples of sampling apparatus for extracting a sample from a biological subject will
now be described with reference to Figures 2A and 2B.
[0058] In this example, the sampling apparatus 200 includes a sampling device 210 which
typically includes a sampling tool 211 for extracting a sample from a biological subject
through the working channel 151 of an endoscope 100.           The sampling apparatus further
includes an isolating member 220 for isolating at least the sample from the working channel
during extraction of the sample.
[0059] The isolating member 220 acts as a barrier helping to prevent the sample from coming
into contact with bacteria or other contaminants within the working channel of the
endoscope, thereby allowing uncontaminated samples to be removed from a subject.               In
particular, this allows a medical practitioner to extract a sample from a biological subject by
positioning the endoscope 100 in the subject, for example, near a sampling site.           Once
positioned, the sampling apparatus can be introduced into the working channel, allowing a
sample to be extracted from the subject through the working channel with the isolating
member isolating at least the sample from the working channel during extraction of the
sample.
[0060] In this regard, during insertion of the endoscope 100 into a subject, it is important that
the tip 122 is open to the subject, for example to allow for the application of water, air or
suction. As a result, the working channel 151 of the endoscope will tend to accumulate
material from regions of the body through which the endoscope passes. For example, when
positioning the endoscope in the duodenum, it is typical for the working channel to contain
material from the stomach. Accordingly, by providing a sampling apparatus including an
isolating member, this allows the sample to be extracted from the subject via the working
channel 151, without the sample coming into contact with any contaminants therein.
[0061] In one particular example, the isolating member 220 is provided over the sampling
tool, so that the sampling tool is also isolated from the working channel during insertion into
the working channel, thereby further reducing the likelihood of contamination, as will be
described in more detail below. In this example, once the sampling device 210 and isolating
member 220 are in position, the isolating member is breached, to allow the sampling tool 211

H:\evk\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\EVK\16055275_1.docx 17/05/13
                                                                   - 10
to be used to collect a sample.                             This may be achieved in any suitable manner and will
typically depend on the nature of the isolating member 220 and the sampling tool 211, as will
be described in more detail below.
[0062] The above described arrangement therefore allows samples to be collected without
contamination, whist allowing a standard endoscope to be used in the normal way.                            This
technique therefore allows uncontaminated samples to be collected whilst using standard
equipment, and without requiring medical practitioners to alter existing sampling procedures,
as will become apparent from the following description.
[0063] A number of further features will now be described in more detail.
[0064] In the examples of Figures 2A and 2B, the sampling device 210 includes a flexible
elongate device body 212 for insertion into the working channel 151 of the endoscope 100,
with the sampling tool 211 being provided at a distal end of the device body. In the current
example, the sampling tool 211 is a pair of forceps allowing for collection and retrieval of a
sample.            However, alternative tools may be used such as a knife, scalpel, lasso, laser,
aspiration tube, or the like and this is not intended to be limiting.
[0065] The sampling device 210 may also include an actuator provided at a proximal end of
the device body to allow the sampling tool 211 to be actuated. The nature of the actuator will
depend on the preferred implementation and the nature of the sampling tool. In the current
example, the actuator includes a handle 213 having a moveable thumb ring 214 and finger
grips 215, allowing the thumb ring 214 to be moved relative to the handle 213. The thumb
ring is attached to the forceps 211 via one or more connecting cables 216, such that
movement of the thumb ring 214 can be used to allow the forceps 211 to be opened or closed.
It will be appreciated from the above that the sampling device can be any form of sampling
device, and that the use of a pair of forceps is for the purpose of example only.
[0066] The isolating member 220 may be of any suitable form, but in one example includes a
sheath or sleeve extending over at least the sampling tool 211.                         However, other forms of
isolating members, such as membranes, caps, plugs and enclosing bodies could be used, as
will be described in more detail below.

H\evk\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\EVK\16055275_1.docx 17/05/13
                                                                - 11
[0067] In the example of Figure 2A, the sheath 221 extends substantially along the length of
the device body 212 and includes a sealed distal end 222 for receiving the sampling tool 211,
and an open proximal end 223, allowing the sampling device to be inserted therein.
[0068] In contrast, in the example of Figure 2B, the isolating member 220 includes a sheath
231 that extends only part way along the device body 211.                          Again, a distal end 232 of the
sheath is sealed and sits over the sampling device 211, whilst a proximal end 233 of the
sheath is attached to the sampling device body 212, rearwardly of the sampling tool 211.
[0069] The sheaths must be capable of being inserted through the working channel and into a
subject, meaning they must be flexible, yet sufficiently resilient for insertion, whilst also
being biologically inert and providing a barrier through which contaminants cannot cross.
[0070] In one example, the sheaths are made of a high density polyethylene, a mixture of
high density polyethylene and low density polyethylene, a mixture of low density
polyethylene and polypropylene, or the like.                         In one particular example, the sheaths are
formed            at     least      in     part      from  resin   materials   or  a   mixture    selected  from,
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkoxy ethylene resin (PFA),
tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene                        resin    (FEP),    polyethylene,    polypropylene,
polyethylene-terephthalate, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, polyolefin, polyamide, vinyl
chloride, latex, natural rubber and others.
[0071] Furthermore, the sheath can be in the form of layer of material, or may alternatively
include an underlying structure, coated with material. For example, the sheath could include
a body having a wire coiled to define a hollow cylindrical body, which is then coated, in a
manner similar to that used in the manufacture of instruments, such as forceps.
[0072] In addition, the inner and/or outer surfaces of the sheath could be coated with a
material having a low coefficient of friction, such as Teflon or the like, allowing the sheath to
be easily inserted into and removed from the working channel, and similarly to allow the
sampling device 210 to be easily inserted into or removed therefrom.
[0073] Operation of the sampling apparatus of Figure 2A will now be described with
reference to Figures 3A to 3D.

                                                           - 12
[0074] In this example, the sampling apparatus is initially arranged as shown in Figure 2A
with the sheath 221, extending along the elongate device body 212 as shown. The sampling
device and sheath 210, 221 are inserted into the biopsy port 154 of the endoscope 100 after
the endoscope 100 has been provided adjacent a site 300 to be sampled. The sampling device
and sheath 210, 221 are then urged along the working channel 151, until the sampling tool
211 and the sheath distal end 222 project from the endoscope tip 122, as shown in Figure 3B.
[0075] Positioning of the sampling apparatus may be determined using any appropriate
technique. Thus, for example, the sampling device and/or sheath 221 may include markings
that align with the biopsy port 154 to show when the sampling device 210 and/or sheath 220
are correctly positioned.                     However more typically this is achieved by having a medical
professional view an image provided by the endoscope imaging system, which shows when
the sampling tool 211 and sheath distal end 222 project from the endoscope tip 122.
[0076] Once the sampling device 210 and isolating member 220 are in position, the distal end
of the sheath 221 is breached, to allow the sampling tool 211 to be used to collect a sample.
This may be achieved in any suitable manner and will typically depend on the nature of the
isolating member 220 and the sampling tool 211.
[0077] For example, the distal end 222 of the sheath 221 may include a piercable membrane
provided at the distal end, so that the sampling tool 211 can be used to pierce the sheath distal
end 222. This may involve utilising the actuator in order to actuate the sampling tool 211, for
example by opening the jaws of forceps to rip the sheath, or alternatively may simply involve
inserting the sampling device 210 further into the sheath 221, thereby urging the sampling
tool 211 through the distal end 221. In order to achieve this, the medical practitioner may
grasp the proximal end 222 of the sheath to thereby retain the sheath in position whilst the
sampling device is urged through the distal end 221.                    Alternatively, the proximal end 222
may include a fitting, such as a resilient ring, or the like, which engages with the biopsy port
 154 and prevents the sheath being inserted further into the working channel 151.
[0078] However, alternative mechanisms for breaching the isolating member can be used.
For example, the sheath 221 could incorporate an actuation mechanism that operates when
the sheath is in position, for example through manual or automated mechanisms.

                                                           - 13
[0079] In any event, once the distal end 222 of the sheath 221 has been breached, the
sampling device 210 may be used to collect a sample using standard biopsy techniques, and
this will not therefore be described in any further detail.
[0080] Once this has been completed, the sampling device 210 can be extracted through the
sheath 221, whilst the sheath remains in place, as shown in Figure 3D. Once the sampling
device 210, and in particular the collected sample, have been removed the sheath 221 can
then be removed from the working channel 151. Alternatively, further instruments may be
inserted into the sheath 221, allowing further work to be performed as required.
[0081] Accordingly, in the above described example, the sampling tool 211 is covered with
an isolating member 220 as the sampling tool is inserted through the working channel 151.
Consequently the sampling tool 211 remains isolated from the contents of the working
channel 151 thereby preventing contamination of the sampling tool 211.
[0082] In one particular example, the isolating member ensures that the sampling tool cannot
come into contact with an internal surface of the working channel 151 thereby ensuring any
material on the internal surface cannot contaminate the sampling tool. Furthermore, once the
sample has been collected, the sampling tool and sample can be withdrawn through the
sheath. As a result, the sample is also isolated from the working channel as the sample is
withdrawn.
[0083] Thus, in the above described example, the sampling tool 211 and removed sample are
protected from contaminants within the working channel.          This allows samples to be
collected from internally within a biological subject without contamination by substances
from other parts of the body.
[0084] Operation of the sampling apparatus of Figure 2B will now be described with
reference to Figures 4A to 4D.
[0085] In this example, the sampling device 210 is again inserted into the working channel
with the sheath 231 sealed at the distal end 232, as shown in Figures 4A and 4B. In this
example, once the sampling device 210 is correctly positioned, the actuator is actuated

causing the sampling tool 211 to pierce the sheath 231 thereby allowing the sampling tool
211 to collect a sample in the normal way.
[0086] In this instance, as the sampling device 210 is withdrawn into the working channel,
the sheath 231 is dragged back into the working channel 151 with the sample.             In this
instance, the sheath 231 is pulled back around the sample as the sampling tool 211 enters the
working channel 151, thereby ensuring the sample remains isolated at least from the working
channel 151 of the endoscope.
[0087] Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the second example of Figure 2B provides
similar functionality to the example of Figure 2A, albeit with the sheath being removed from
the working channel 151 as part of the process of removing the sampling device.
[0088] It will be appreciated from this, that a wide variety of different configurations can be
used to provide the required isolation between the sample and the working channel.
[0089] In a further variation shown in Figure 5, the distal end of the sheath is sealed using a
removable cap, although a plug or other similar arrangement could be used.
[0090] In this example, the isolation member includes a sheath 521 similar to that described
above with respect to Figure 2A, having distal and proximal ends 522, 523. The distal end
522 is sealed by a cap 524, which is provided over the sampling tool 211 and attaches to the
sampling device body 212. In this instance, once the sampling device 210 has been inserted
into the working channel 151, the cap 524 can be removed, for example through actuation of
the sampling tool 211, or urging the sampling tool against the cap, allowing the sampling
apparatus to function in substantially the same manner as the example of Figure 2A.
[0091] In this scenario, it is typical for the cap to be made of a degradable or biologically
inert material, allowing the cap to remain within the subject, with the cap being expelled
from the digestive system, in due course.
[0092] A further variation is shown in Figures 6A and 6B.
[0093] In this example, the sampling apparatus includes an isolation member 620 including
two substantially hemispherical bodies 621, 622, pivotally coupled to the sampling device

H:\evk\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\EVK\16055275_1.docx 17/05/13
                                                                  - 15
210 via a pivotal connection 623. In use, the bodies 621, 622, are movable between an open
position for use in collecting a sample, and a closed position in which the bodies define an
 internal cavity for containing a sample during extraction of the sample through the working
 channel, as shown in Figures 6A and 6B respectively.
 [0094] In one example, in the closed position, the bodies 621, 622 encompass the sampling
tool 211 so that the sampling tool is isolated from the external environment, and in particular,
the working channel 151.                        By contrast, in the open position, the sampling tool is exposed,
 allowing a sample to be collected in the normal way. Accordingly, in use, the bodies can be
provided in the closed arrangement during insertion of the sampling device into the working
 channel 151, and during removal of a collected sample, whilst the bodies can be moved into
 an open position when sample collection is being performed.
 [0095] In one example, movement of the bodies between the open and closed positions can
be controlled using an actuator, similar to the actuator used for controlling the forceps. In one
particular example, the bodies 521, 522 can act as the sampling tool, allowing the forceps
jaws to be replaced with the bodies 521, 522.
 [0096] However, alternatively, the bodies can be biased towards the open arrangement, using
 a biasing mechanism such as a spring or the like. In this instance, the bodies are sized to
 cooperate with the working channel, so that the bodies are retained in the closed position
within the working channel 151 by engagement with an inner surface of the working channel.
 This avoids the need to provide a separate actuator, and ensures that the bodies are closed
when the sampling tool 211 is in the working channel.
 [0097] In a further example, the bodies 521, 522 can actually act as the sampling tool,
 allowing the sample to be collected whilst isolating the collected sample from the working
 channel 151.
 [0098] In a further example, the isolation member includes a sheath in the form of a catheter
having a proximal end opening for receiving the sampling device and a distal end opening
 sealed by a pierceable membrane.                           An example of this arrangement will now be described
with reference to Figures 7A and 7B.

                                                              - 16
[0099] In this example, the sampling apparatus includes an isolation member 720 including a
catheter 721 sealed at a distal end opening 723, either by a pierceable membrane 722, or
another sealing member such as a plug or the like. In use, the sampling device 210 is inserted
into the catheter 721 at the proximal end opening 724, so that the sampling tool 211 is
contained within the catheter 721 proximate to the membrane 722, as shown in Figure 7A.
The catheter 721 can then be inserted into the working channel 151 of the endoscope 100,
when the endoscope 100 is positioned within the subject, until the distal end of the catheter
721 projects from the working channel 151 and into the subject.
[0100] The sampling device 210 can then be urged through the catheter 721 so that the
sampling tool 211 pierces the membrane 722, as shown in Figure 7B, thereby allowing
sample collection to be performed.                         Following this, the sampling device 210 can be
withdrawn into the catheter 721, which is then removed from the working channel 151, in a
manner similar to that described with respect to previous examples, thereby allowing the
sample to be extracted substantially without contamination.
[0101] Accordingly, in this example, the isolation member is formed from a catheter 721
having one end sealed by a pierceable membrane, which is pierced by forceps or another
sampling tool.
[0102] In another example, the isolation member and sampling device could be introduced
into the body of a subject using mechanisms other than an endoscope.                       For example, an
incision could be used to introduce the catheter 721 directly into a region of a subject's body.
The sampling device 210 can then be urged along the catheter towards the distal end, thereby
piercing the membrane 722, allowing a sample to be collected. The sampling device can then
be extracted from the subject through the catheter 721, with the catheter 721 then being
removed as required.
[0103] It will therefore be appreciated that whilst the use of an endoscope is highly desirable
in allowing samples to be easily collected from a range of locations, this is not intended to be
limiting, and that in practice, the apparatus could be used to isolate the sampling device from
a surrounding environment, such as a subject' s body without requiring use of an endoscope.

[0104] To demonstrate the effectiveness of the isolation members, duodenal biopsies were
collected from a subject using an isolation member, and using standard biopsy forceps. A
graph showing a comparison of the microbial community profile as sampled using the
isolation member arrangement and a standard biopsy arrangement are shown in Figure 8.
These preliminary data reveal significant differences between the microbial community
profile of samples taken from the same site with a normal biopsy or the isolation member,
highlighting that the use of the isolation members reduces contamination of biopsy samples,
in turn allowing a more accurate determination of microbial profile. This will allow for
enhanced study of FD and other related conditions, in turn allowing enhanced treatment
programs to be determined.
[0105] In any event, it will be appreciated from the above that isolation members can be used
to ensure that samples removed from the subject are uncontaminated by substances, such as
bacteria, that have entered the working channel during insertion of the endoscope into the
subject. This provides a mechanism for collecting uncontaminated samples, which can be
particularly important in diagnosing conditions associated with operation of the gastro
intestinal tract.
[0106] It will also be appreciated that the isolation member may be of any appropriate form,
including, but not limited to sheaths, sleeves, membranes, caps, plugs, catheters or enclosing
bodies. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that the isolation member can be incorporated
into the sampling device, or could alternatively be a separate device that functions with a
separate sampling device. This latter arrangement is particularly advantageous as this allows
existing sampling devices to be used in the above described sampling methods. It will
therefore be appreciated that the term isolation member can encompass any arrangement,
including one or more components, that is capable of isolating a sampling device from a
surrounding environment, such as a working channel of an endoscope, and that reference to
specific arrangements is not intended to be limiting.
[0107] The term sheath could encompass any arrangement that extends generally over and
along a body of a sampling device, including a catheter, and that the term is not intended to
be limited to a rigid or non-rigid body.

[0108] The terms proximal and distal are used to refer to opposing ends of a device, with
general reference to their position relative to an operator in use. However, this is merely for
the purpose of illustration and their use is not intended to be limiting.
[0109] Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that numerous variations and modifications
will become apparent.                     All such variations and modifications which become apparent to
persons skilled in the art, should be considered to fall within the spirit and scope that the
