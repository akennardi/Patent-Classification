[0001]            The    present invention           relates to          a hydroponic
       cultivationmethodusing,                   for example, amycorrhizal                fungus
       and its partner bacteria.
       Background Art
[0002]            A mycorrhizal          fungus is      a   soil      symbiotic
       micro-organism          that      infects     to roots        of a plant,       obtains
       photosynthetic          products from the plant,                  and in   return       for
       this,       contributes       to the       supply of nourishing water and
       the      impartation of environmental                   stress tolerance             and
       disease        and pest resistance             to   the plant.          Among
       mycorrhizal fungi, especiallyarbuscularmycorrhizal                                  fungi
        (AMF)     can create    a symbiotic relationship                 with practically
       all      terrestrial      plants.          By developing effective use
       methods        of these    fungi with their             functions       and roles        in

                                  la
       mind, these fungi can, hence, reduce the use amounts of
       chemical fertilizers and chemically-synthesized
       agrochemicals or can make them no longer needed.   They are,
       accordingly, expected to enable an increase in the
       production of safe, secure and sustainable foods.
[0003]       It has recently come clear that partner bacteria,
       which grow in  and around spores of AMF, promote the hyphal
       growth of AMF and have phosphate solubilizing ability,
       nitrogen fixing ability and antagonistic action against
                    [Text continues on page 2.]

       one of partner          plants      in  the hydroponic cultivation               of salad
       lettuce,        and AMF,        it   has been found that           the introduction
       of bahiagrass           gives no adverse effect             on the growth of salad
       lettuce or tends to                 slightly retard its growth and that
       the use of AMF reduces nutrient                      competition between salad
       lettuce       andbahiagrass            when suchnutrient         competition tends
       to take place under stress                  such low temperatures              (see,    for
       example, Non-patent                  Document     3).

       Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention
[0021]            A hydroponic     cultivation method according                        to     one
       embodiment of thepresent          invention     is   a cultivationmethod,
       which uses beneficial          micro-organisms such as mycorrhizal
       fungi       and their partner bacteria.              Further,           it uses          an
        (intercropping)         method that     allows an intercropping                    plant
        (partner plant),         which enables easy growth of the
       mycorrhizal         fungi  and their partner bacteria, to                          grow
       between rows of a crop.            By using such a method of use and
       a hydroponic cultivation           apparatus capable of creating                          an
       environment under which the beneficial                   micro-organisms are
       easy to         grow, the  yield and quality of the                   crop       can be
       increased,         thereby making      it possible            to  avoid using
       chemical         fertilizers   or chemically-synthesized
       agrochemicals          or to  reduce     their use amounts.

       organic matter                allowed to biodegrade beforehand with the
       partner         bacteria,         a lactic        acid bacteria,             a yeast         or the
       like,      for     example,       an organic liquid             fertilizer           from green
       manure        is     desired instead of chemical                        fertilizers.                In
       particular, preferred as                        the     organic matter             is     a

[0027]            As described           above,      the one embodiment of the present
       invention            can     create     an environment,               under which the
       mycorrhizal             fungi and their             partner      bacteria          are easy to
       grow, by planting,                between the rows of the crop,                    the partner
       plant       that      enables easy growth of the beneficial
       micro-organisms.                   At the same time, the use of ahydroponic

       cultivation            apparatus,        which can create                  an environment
       enabling easy growth of the beneficial micro-organisms,
       can      stimulate the growth of the                       crop if         the use amounts
       of chemical            fertilizers          and chemically-synthesized
       agrochemicals are               significantly reduced or even if they
       are      not used and are made unnecessary.
[0028]            Accordingly,         under hydroponic                 cultivation,              the use
       of the mycorrhizal               fungi and their               partner         bacteria          also

       increase its yield,                 to improve its quality, and further
       can impart disease              and pest         resistance            and environmental
       stress       tolerance.

       consideredtobe            hardly       infectedwith             amycorrhizal               fungus,
       the mycorrhizal fungus infects                       to their       roots      to some extent
       and stimulates their growth.                          Therefore,           the mycorrhizal
       fungus       can      increase their yields                  and can          improve         their
       quality,         and can also         impart disease               and pest         resistance
       and environmental             stress       tolerance          to them.           In    addition,

       fluorescence             around roots            under UV exposure,                   while     the
       AMF+PB+PP plot on the right                         side presented fluorescence
       around roots            under UV exposure and was observed brightly.
[0042]            As a result          of these,        it   has become evident                 that    the
       use of AMF and their                 partner         bacteria           assists       the growth
       of a       crop even under hydroponic                         cultivation and
       significantly contributes                        to    an     increase in            yield.       In
       particular,             the growth became vigorous even                              in   the
       Cruciferous            crops to which AMF is                  generally           considered to
       hardly infect.                 As a cause          of this,           it   is believed that
       AMF     infects to roots              of these crops                  to   some extent,          the
       partner        bacteria         grow in      a great        number around the roots,
       and AMF and the partner                   bacteria          take significant               part    in
       the     impartation of phosphate solubilizing                                     ability,
