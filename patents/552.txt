                                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
            [0002]                Disclosed herein are nutritional supplements comprising rice protein
isolate and methods of use thereof. In some embodiments, the use of rice protein leads to one

Description of the Related Art
            [0003]                Recommended levels for an adequate dietary protein intake for an adult is
0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, the average daily intake level that is sufficient to
meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all healthy individuals. The protein requirements are
based on nitrogen balance, trying to achieve a balance between nitrogen intake and excretion.
Protein recommendations for endurance and strength trained athletes range from 1.2 to 2.0
g/kg/d, reflecting the athlete's nutritional goal to increase lean body mass. The athlete has a
choice of different animal (e.g. whey, casein) or plant protein (e.g. soy) sources, differing in
numerous ways such as the presence of allergens (lactose, soy), cholesterol, saturated fats,
digestion rate (fast, intermittent, slow absorption of amino acids), or the relative amount of
individual amino acids.
            [0003a]               It is to be understood that if any prior art publication is referred to herein,
such reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of the
common general knowledge in the art in Australia or any other country.

                                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
            [0041]                Complete proteins, such as animal- or dairy-derived (e.g. meat, egg, and
whey proteins), are proteins having adequate proportions of each of the nine essential amino
acid (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan,
and valine).                As complete proteins, these sources meet the dietary needs of animals.
Complete proteins allow muscle growth, muscle maintenance, nutritional balance, weight
gain, and weight maintenance. Because they provide a complete amino acid profile, complete
proteins are the proteins of choice for doctors seeking to supplement the diets of infants and
geriatric patients in danger of losing weight or unable to sustain weight gain.                       Complete
proteins are also the first choice for athletes (and their trainers) seeking to improve the results
of exercise training.
            [0042]                Rice proteins, alternatively, are "incomplete proteins."      As "incomplete
proteins," rice proteins are deficient in one or more essential amino acids.                       Rice protein
specifically lacks sufficient amounts of threonine and lysine and, in comparison to whey
protein, contains lower amounts of leucine. Rice protein also has lower protein quality (i.e.
proportion of digestible protein) relative to many complete proteins.                        For example, rice
protein is only about 87% digestible relative to casein. Rice protein is also slower absorbing
than other proteins, discouraging its use.                       Thus, the use of rice protein in dietary
supplementation has been discouraged.
            [0043]                For instance, rice protein, by itself, is thought to be an inadequate protein
source for protein-based infant formulas. In order to reach acceptable essential amino acid
                                                              -6
98203241 (GHMatters) P100987.AU.1

levels, rice protein in infant formula is often fortified with other amino acids to enhance their
nutritive value. Some researchers have even sought to genetically engineer rice to improve
the proportional ratio of essential amino acids in rice protein isolates.
            [0044]                For the same reasoning, rice protein sources have been avoided in the
formulation of exercise supplements. Long term, periodized resistance training (RT) results
in increases in skeletal muscle size and, ultimately, force generating capacity.                      Sports
nutrition scientists have attempted to increase training induced gains through a number of
protocols, which generally attempt to augment and/or speed skeletal muscle regeneration.
One such intervention has been to increase the provision of the branched chain amino acids
(BCAAs), leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which make up more than one third of muscle
protein(s).            By providing complete protein sources before, during, and/or after exercise,
sufficient levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine are present to allow muscle growth. The
BCAAs are unique among the essential amino acids (EAAs) for their roles in protein
metabolism, neural function, and blood glucose and insulin regulation.                     In some studies,
researchers have shown that BCAAs potentially are able to stimulate skeletal muscle protein
synthesis (MPS) to the same degree as all the combination of all nine essential amino acids.
Leucine may play the most important role in muscle growth, as it is the only BCAA that was
able to independently stimulate MPS.
            [0045]                It is well known that vigorous exercise can induce a net negative protein
balance in response to both endurance and resistance training. Researchers have proposed
that consumption of BCAAs, namely leucine, could turn individuals from a negative to a
positive whole-body protein balance after intense exercise. In support, the consumption of a
protein or EAA complex that contains sufficient leucine has been shown to shift protein
balance to a net positive state after intense exercise training. These findings led researchers
to suggest that optimal protein intake per meal should be based on the leucine content of the
protein consumed.
            [0046]                Rice-based proteins, with as low as 55 % of the leucine content of animal
based proteins, have not been shown to increase MPS compared to animal-based proteins (i.e.
plant-based proteins have as little as 6% leucine and animal-based proteins contain as much
as 11 % leucine).                    Moreover at lower doses of protein (10% of energy), animal sources
stimulate MPS to a greater degree than plant sources. Similar to the results achieved with the
fortification of baby formulas, by fortifying plant-based proteins with the deficient amino
                                                            -7
98203241 (GHMatters) P100987.AU.1

acids, MPS comparable to that from animal protein supplementation can be achieved with
plant-based proteins.
            [0047]                An unmet need in the area of protein supplementation exists for a non
allergenic protein source that provides an amino acid profile sufficient to improve the results
of athletic training and to allow weight maintenance and/or gain in infant and geriatric
patients. Surprisingly, it has now been found that the particular rice protein isolate described
herein is a suitable form of protein to support muscle hypertrophy in combination with
athletic training. It has been found that rice protein isolate is actually comparable to whey
protein in its effects on lean mass and strength when given following RT. These results are
especially important given that food allergies may force some subjects to abandon the use of
milk (human or cow) and soy products. The rice protein lysate described herein, an allergen
free protein source, may offer an alternative to these other protein sources. The rice protein
lysates described herein may also be appropriate for helping increase weight gain, preventing
weight        loss, and meeting the nutritive demands                    in infants and geriatric   patients.
Furthermore, as a vegan protein source, the rice protein isolates described herein may offer
vegetarian and vegan people a way to increase their protein intake.

                                                       EXAMPLES
Example 1
            [0111]                The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of doses of rice
protein compared to equal doses of whey protein on skeletal muscle hypertrophy, lean body
mass, strength and power when given following 8 weeks of periodized RT in those
individuals with previous RT experience.
Experimental design
            [0112]                The study consisted of a randomized, double blind protocol consisting of
individuals given either 48 grams of rice or 48 grams of whey protein isolate following an
acute resistance exercise bout (Phase 1) and following each session during an 8 week
periodized training protocol (Phase 2). Phase 1 of the study investigated the effects of protein
sources on recovery 48 hours following a high volume, hypertrophy oriented resistance
training session.                 Phase two occurred for the remaining eight-week RT protocol, which
consisted of training each muscle group twice per week using a non-linear periodized RT
model.         Direct ultrasound determined muscle mass, dual emissions x-ray absorptiometery
(DXA) determined body composition, maximal                          strength, and power were       assessed
collectively at the end of weeks 0, 4, and 8.
Phase 1 Resistance training protocol
            [0113]                All subjects participated in a high volume resistance training session
consisting of 3 sets of leg press, bench press, and military press, pull-ups, bent over rows,
barbell curls and extensions.                  Immediately following the workout, subjects consumed 48
grams of RPI or WPI respectively. Immediately prior to the exercise session and 48 hours
post exercise, soreness, perceived readiness to train, and perceived recovery scale (PRS)
measurements were taken. Soreness was measured on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0
 10. With zero representing no soreness in the muscles at all, and 10 representing the worst
muscle soreness ever experienced. PRS consists of values between 0-10, with 0-2 being very
poorly recovered with anticipated declines in performance, 4-6 being low to moderately
recovered with expected similar performance, and 8-10 representing high perceived recovery
with expected increases in performance. Perceived readiness indicates how ready the subject
felt they were to train. In this scale a 10 is the most ready an individual could be to train,
                                                           -25
98203241 (GHMatters) P100987.AU.1

while a 0 indicates the subject feels they are not ready at all to train.
Resistance training protocol
            [0114]                The program was designed to train all major muscle groups using mostly
compound movements for the upper and lower body. The programmed, non-linear training
split was divided into hypertrophy days consisting of 8-12 RM loads for 3 sets, with 60-120
seconds rest and strength days consisting of 2 to 5 RM loads for 3 sets for all exercises except
the leg press and bench press which received 5 total sets.                    Weights were progressively
increased by 2-5 % when the prescribed repetitions could be completed. All training sessions
were closely monitored by the researchers to ensure effort and intensity were maximal each
training session.
Strength, Power, Body Composition and Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy Testing
            [0115]                Strength was assessed via 1-RM testing of the leg press and bench press.
Each lift was deemed successful as described by International Powerlifting Federation rules.
Body composition (lean body mass, fat mass, and total mass) was determined on a Lunar
Prodigy DXA apparatus (software version, enCORE 2008, Madison, Wisconsin, U.S.A.).
Skeletal muscle hypertrophy was determined via changes in ultrasonography determined
combined muscle thickness of the biceps brachii and vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus
intermedius (VI) muscles (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA).
            [0116]                Power was assessed during a maximal cycling ergometry test. During the
cycling test, the volunteer was instructed to cycle against a predetermined resistance (7.5% of
body weight) as fast as possible for 10 seconds. The saddle height was adjusted to the
individual's height to produce a 5-100 knee flexion while the foot was in the low position of
the central void. A standardized verbal stimulus was provided to the subjects. Power output
was recorded in real time by a computer connected to the Monark standard cycle ergometer
(Monark model 894e, Vansbro, Sweden) during the 10-second sprint test. Peak power (PP)
was recorded using Monark Anaerobic test software (Monark Anaerobic Wingate Software,
Version 1.0, Monark, Vansbro, Sweden). From completion of wingate tests performed over
several days, interclass correlation coefficient for peak power was 0.96.
Supplementation and Diet Control
            [0117]                Two weeks prior to and throughout the study, subjects were placed on a
diet consisting of 25 % protein, 50 % carbohydrates, and 25 % fat by a registered dietician
who specialized in sport nutrition. Subjects met as a group with the dietitian, and they were
                                                           -26

given individual meal plans at the beginning of the study. Daily total of calories were
determined by the harris benedict equation and tracked by weekly logs to ensure compliance.
The protein supplement was administered under supervision of a laboratory assistant
following resistance training, and it consisted of either 48g of whey protein isolate (Nutra Bio
Whey Protein Isolate (Dutch Chocolate), Middlesex, NJ; Figure 1B) or 48g of rice protein
isolate (Growing Naturals Rice Protein Isolate (Chocolate Power) made with Oryzatein@ rice
protein, Axiom Foods, Oro Valley, AZ; Figure 1A) dissolved in 500 ml of water. The amino
acid profile of the study material was analyzed by an independent analytical laboratory
(Eurofins Analytical Laboratories, Metairie, LA) and is displayed in Table 1. Both the whey
protein supplement and rice protein supplement were isonitrogenous, isocaloric, and
macronutrient ratio matched.

Statistics
            [0119]                An ANOVA model was used to measure group, time, and group by time
interactions for both phase 1 and 2. If any main effects were observed, a Tukey post-hoc was
employed to locate where differences occurred. All statistics were run using Statistica
software (Statsoft, 2011).
Results
Phase 1
            [0120]                No differences existed between groups at baseline for any measure. There
were no differences between the total amounts of weight lifted by the RPI (12296.3  2412.6
kg) or WPI (11831.6  2611.3 kg) group during the resistance training session. There was a
significant time effect (p <0.05) for soreness, which increased in both the RPI (0.3  0.6 to
5.6  2.2) and WPI (0.3  0.5 to 6.0  1.9) groups, with no differences between groups (no
condition X time effect).                   There was a significant time effect (p <0.05) for PRS, which
decreased in both the RPI (9.1  1.5 to 5.45  1.5) and WPI (8.7  2.6 to 5.6  1.4) groups,
with no differences between groups (no condition X time effect). There were no significant
time or condition x time effects for perceived readiness to train, indicating that the subject's
perceived readiness had recovered within 48 hours.
Phase 2
            [0121]                There was a significant time effect (p <0.01) for lean body mass, which
increased in both the rice (58.5  5.5 (baseline) to 59.5  4.5 (week 4) to 61.0  5.6 kg (week
8)) and whey protein (59.6  5.2 to 61.9  4.5 to 62.8  5.2 kg) conditions, with no
differences between conditions (no condition X time effect). There was a significant time
effect for body fat (p<0.05), which decreased in both conditions, 17.8  6.0 to 16.6  4.8 to
 15.6  4.9 kg in the rice protein condition and 16.3  5.1 to 15.7  4.8 to 15.6  4;9 kg in the
whey protein condition, from pre to post training, with no differences between conditions (no
condition X time effect). There was a significant time effect for quadriceps and biceps
thickness (p < 0.05), which increased from pre to post training in the rice protein (5.0  0.4 to
5.1  0.4 to 5.2  0.5 cm and 3.6  0.3 to 3.9  0.3 to 4.1  0.4 cm, respectively) and whey
protein (4.8  0.7 to 5.0  0.5 to 5.1  0.5 cm and 3.6  0.2 to 4.0  0.3 to 4.1  0.3 cm,
respectively) conditions, with no differences between conditions (no condition X time effect).
Body composition data is displayed in Figure 2.
            [0122]                There was a significant time effect (p<O.01) for 1-RM bench press strength,

which increased from baseline to week 8 in both the rice protein (85.9  20.5 to 95.5  21.4
kg) and whey protein (89.5  18.5 to 98.5  16.4 kg) conditions, with no differences between
groups (no condition X time effect)(Figure 3A). There was a significant time effect (p<0.01)
for 1-RM leg press strength, which increased from baseline to week 8 in both the rice (220.0 
38.5 to 286.8  37.2 kg) and whey (209.5  35.0 to 289.7  40.1 kg) conditions, with no
differences between conditions (no condition X time effect)(Figure 3B). Total body strength
also showed no difference between conditions (Figure 3C).                        There was a significant time
effect for wingate peak power (p<0.01), which increased from baseline to week 8 in both the
rice protein (638.4  117.2 to 753.9  115.6 watts) and whey protein (687.1  125.3 to 785.0
 101.1 watts) conditions, with no differences between conditions (Figure 3D). Performance
data is displayed in Table 2.

Discussion
            [0123]                The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of doses of rice
protein compared to whey protein on acute recovery from high volume resistance training as
well as skeletal muscle hypertrophy, lean body mass, strength and power when given
following eight weeks of periodized RT. The novel finding in the present study is that no
significant condition by time interactions were observed between the rice protein and whey
protein supplements on short term recovery or training-induced adaptations.                       Our findings
show that doses of rice protein (48g) are, surprisingly, comparable to an equal dose of whey
                                                             -29

protein in its effects on lean mass and muscle responses after periodized RT. In other words,
RPI supports changes in strength and body composition similarly to WPI.
            [0124]                Subjects were given either 48g of protein in the form of a rice protein
supplement or a whey protein supplement. Researchers conducted a dose response study of
an egg protein supplement comparing Og, 5g, 109, 20g, and 40g of egg protein delivered after
a bout of exercise. After consumption of the supplement, MPS rates were monitored for four
hours. Their results suggested that MPS was maximally stimulated with 20g of egg protein,
which contains 1.7 g of leucine. It was also observed that at double that dose (40g, 3.4 g of
leucine), no significant differences in MPS occurred.
            [0125]                Chronic free leucine supplementation alone did not improve lean body or
muscle mass during resistance training in the elderly, whereas it was able to limit the weight
loss induced by malnutrition.                  Leucine-rich amino acid mixture or proteins appeared more
efficient than leucine alone to improve muscle mass and performance, suggesting the efficacy
of leucine depends nevertheless on the presence of other amino acids. Small differences in
protein digestion rates, differences in branched-chain amino acid content can impact the
ability of the protein to maximize post exercise MPS. Available data on soy protein suggests
that plant proteins generally might differ in their ability to support muscle protein accretion
after resistance exercise.
            [0126]                For example, post exercise consumption of fat-free milk promotes greater
hypertrophy during the early stages of resistance training in novice weightlifters when
compared with isonitrogenous and isoenergetic fat-free soy protein. Researchers conducted
experiments comparing milk protein, to soy protein, to a maltodextrin control in untrained
individuals.             In that study, 17.5g of protein in the form of milk or soymilk was given
immediately and one hour following exercise, while the control group received an isocaloric
maltodextrin beverage.                  17.5g of protein from milk contains approximately 1.7g of leucine,
and 17.5g of protein from soymilk would contain 1.4g of leucine. Following a twelve week
RT program, the milk protein group experienced greater increases in type II muscle fiber area.
This study suggests that a moderate dose of milk protein increases lean mass to a greater
extent than soy or a maltodextrin control when given following exercise. Soy proteins appear
to support greater splanchnic rather than peripheral (i.e., muscle) protein synthesis and are
converted to urea to a greater extent than are milk proteins. Alternatively, observed
differences might be explained by differences in leucine content or absorption kinetics.

            [0127]                In the present study, the combined muscle thickness of the VI and VL
increased in both the rice protein (0.2 cm) and whey protein (0.5 cm) conditions. Lean body
mass increased in the rice protein condition by 2.5 kg, and it also increased in the whey
protein condition by 3.2 kg. Combined bench press and leg press 1-RM strength increased in
the rice protein condition by 76.4 kg and in the whey protein condition by 89.5 kg. However,
no significant differences were observed between the two conditions for any measure.
Conclusion
            [0128]                The results suggest that differences in protein composition are of less
relevance when protein is consumed in high doses throughout periodized RT. Rice protein
isolate administration post resistance exercise decreases fat-mass and increases lean body
mass, skeletal muscle hypertrophy, power and strength comparable to whey protein isolate.
Rice protein isolate is an excellent plant protein alternative to animal protein to optimize the
effects of resistance training.
Example 2
            [0129]                While digestibility of rice protein isolate (RPI) in rats has been shown to
be inferior to animal protein (87% vs. 97% for casein), as shown above, administration of 48
grams of RPI following resistance exercise decreased fat-mass and increased lean body mass,
skeletal muscle hypertrophy, power and strength comparable to whey protein isolate (WPI).
This study sought to investigate the amino acid rate of appearance in the blood of 48 grams of
RPI compared to 48 grams of WPI.
            [0130]                This study investigated the comparative appearance in the blood of total
amino acids (TAA), non-essential amino acids (NEA) and essential amino acids (EEA) after
the administration of RPI compared to WPI.
Methods
            [0131]                A double blind, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study was performed
to assess the amino acid appearance in the blood after the administration of RPI and WPI
from a fasted condition.                    The crossover design consisted of ten participants randomly
assigned within each of the two sequences (AB, BA), indicating that every participant
received the two protein supplements during the two periods separated by a one week
washout period. Each protein supplement was administered in the same quantity of 48 grams
of RPI (Growing Naturals Rice Protein Isolate made with Oryzatein@ rice protein, Axiom
Foods, Oro Valley, AZ) or WPI (Nutra Bio Whey Protein Isolate, Middlesex, NJ) that was
                                                             -31

taken in a liquid formulation of 500 ml of water.                    The WPI and RPI supplements were
matched to be isonitrogenous and isocaloric. The amino acid profile of each formulation was
the same as in Example 1. The study protein that was given to the participants remained
unknown to both the participants and the researchers for the entirety of the study.
            [0132]                Ten students currently enrolled at The University of Tampa volunteered
for this study. The participants were 22.2  4.2 years of age, had an average bodyweight of
77.4  0.6 kg, and an average height of 176.8 cm  8.6 cm. All subjects did not have any
physical or medical health complications according to past health examinations and further
had to be a non-smoker to be included in this study. Participants were required to abstain
from consuming any protein supplements for one month prior and during the wash-out of
seven days. The volunteers had to complete an overnight fast for a duration of 12 hours
before the morning of the study. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
at The University of Tampa and each participant had signed an informed consent before being
recruited into the study.
            [0133]                After a 12 hour overnight fast the 10 subjects were randomly assigned to
receive either 48 grams of RPI (Growing Naturals Rice Protein Isolate (Chocolate Power)
made with Oryzatein@ rice protein, Axiom Foods, Oro Valley, AZ and having the amino acid
profile shown in Table 1) or WPI (Nutra Bio Whey Protein Isolate (Dutch Chocolate),
Middlesex, NJ, also shown in Table 1), in a double-blind, crossover design, separated by a
washout phase of 7 days. Blood draws were taken immediately prior to, and at 1, 2, 3, and 4
hours following supplementation.
Measurement of Amino Acids
            [0134]                The amino acids measured in the blood plasma consisted of the nine
essential amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine,
tryptophan, threonine, and valine), as well as thirteen non-essential amino acids (alanine,
arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, citrulline, cystine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine,
ornithine, proline, serine, and tyrosine). Amino acid concentrations were measured in the
blood plasma prior to the oral administration of RPI or WPI to establish baseline
measurements.                  All amino acid concentrations were then tested by taking blood plasma
samples at 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, and 4 hours following the consumption of one of the two
protein supplements. The second period began after a seven day wash-out period and initial
blood test was completed once again to reassess the concentration of each amino acid in the
                                                           -32
98203241 (GHMatters) P100987.AU.1

blood plasma prior to taking the protein that the subject had not already consumed.
Measurement of amino acid plasma concentrations were then done consecutively in the same
manner as the subsequent week in the pattern of 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, and 4 hours.
Chromatography measures the amount of active amino acids and metabolite in the blood
plasma.
Data Analysis
            [0135]                The area under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC) was calculated
using the linear trapezoidal rule from time zero until the last time point of sampling t (AUCO
t). Cmin and Cmax were defined as the minimum and maximum observed concentrations,
respectively. tmax was the time at which Cmax was reached. AUC of the five conditions
were compared and analyzed by paired-samples t-tests.                     A P-value<0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Analyses were performed with the SPSS software package version
 16.0 for Windows.
Results
            [0136]                WPI and RPI showed a significant difference for Tmax for essential amino
acids (Table 3; EAA: RPI 87  7 min, WPI 67  4 min, p=0.03), non-essential amino acids
(NEA: RPI 97  4 min, WPI 71  5 min, p<0.001), and total amino acids (TA: RPI 93  4
min, WPI 69  3 min, p<0.001), however no significant differences were detected for AUC
(EAA: RPI 649.5  140.9 nmol/ml, WPI 754.2  170.0 nmol/ml, p=0.64; NEA: RPI 592.7

             [0138]                On an individual amino acid basis, WPI and RPI showed bioequivalency
(0.80-1.25 of the geometic mean ratio (GMR)) for AUC and Cmax for all amino acids with
the exception of cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, and threonine, in which WPI performed
significantly better. Tmax differed between WPI and RPI for histidine, phenylalanine,
threonine,             asparagine, glutamic acid, glycine, ornithine, proline,        and serine.   The
pharmacokinetic parameters of individual EAAs and NEAAs is shown in Table 4 and Table

Discussion
            [0139]                The primary findings from this investigation were that RPI is an
intermediate absorbed protein compared to the fast absorbing WPI and that the RPI showed
only a 6.8% lower total amino acid appearance in the blood compared to WPI.
Absorption Kinetics
            [0140]                Comparing different high quality proteins, the digestion rate of proteins
influences protein turnover and how amino acids support protein synthesis. Recent evidence
suggests that differences in the rate of absorption of different proteins can affect the
amplitude and possibly duration of MPS and that this effect is possibly accentuated with
resistance exercise. The fast absorbed whey protein increases mixed muscle protein fractional
synthetic rate at rest and after resistance exercise to a greater extent when compared to the
slow absorbed casein. Whereas faster absorption seems to favor MPS, slower absorption
seems to favor the satiating effect of proteins supplementation. Slow absorbed casein showed
a stronger satiating effect and subsequent reduced food intake compared to whey when
consumed as a preload to a meal. While TAA for WPI reached its maximum concentration
after 69 3 min, RPI was significantly slower (93 4 min). On an individual amino acid basis,
WPI was faster or equal for all amino acids with the exception of leucine, which reached
Cmax faster in the RPI group. While not being bound to any mechanism, these unique and
surprising absorption kinetics might be an additional explanation why 8 weeks of high-dose
WPI or RPI supplementation showed no difference between groups in improving body
composition and exercise performance. The slower overall absorption kinetics makes RPI an
interesting candidate for satiety.

AUC
            [0141]                The digestibility (87%) and biological value (51%) of RPI is inferior to
WPI (100%, and 100% respectively). Considering the 13% difference in digestibility or 49%
difference biological value significant differences in TAA levels were expected. However,
RPI showed only a 6.8% lower TAA appearance in the blood based on AUC and the
difference to WPI was not statistically significant. These surprisingly small, non-significant
differences in AUC match the Example 1 finding that 8 weeks of high-dose WPI or RPI
supplementation did not result in significant difference in body composition and exercise
performance.                Using low-dose supplementation strategies, the amount of RPI should be
increased by the lower amount of leucine and the reduced absorption to match WPI for
optimal MPS in combination with resistance exercise.
            [0142]                The cross-over design is the most fundamental study design since all
subjects are given both treatments therefore eliminating inter-subject variability between
subjects. There was no missing data from the attrition of participants throughout the study as
each participant completed the crossover for both treatments. The intra-subject coefficient of
variation for Cmax were 2.3%-6.2% (mean=4.4%) for the essential amino acids and 2.0%
 10.0% (mean=5.9%) for the non-essential amino acids. The intra-subject coefficient of
variations for AUC were 3.5%- 7 .3 % (mean=4.9%) for the essential amino acids and 1.9
 12.7% (mean=6.6%) for the non-essential amino acids. The low coefficient of variation
concludes that there is greater than 90% power of determining bioequivalence.
            [0143]                For non-metabolizable supplemental nutrients, bioavailability is effectively
equivalent to absorbability.                  Currently, there are no pre-specifications on the design and
procedures of bioequivalence studies that involve endogenous compounds and active
metabolites. The processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of rice
and whey protein are accompanied by the endogenous production of non-essential amino
acids and transamination of amino acids converting to other compounds at the same time.
Other studies suggest that the rate of endogenous production of amino acids within the body
remains unaffected directly by the levels accumulated in the body at that time, but the rate of
production is alternately dependent upon the dietary composition of amino acids and the
percentage fulfilled according to the daily nutritional guidelines.
Conclusion
            [0144]                These findings suggest that RPI, compared to WPI (fast) and casein (slow),
                                                            -38

is an intermediate digesting protein.                   While RPI showed a 6.8% lower total amino acid
appearance in the blood based on AUC, the difference was not statistically significant. These
findings suggest that RPI, compared to WPI (fast) and casein (slow), is an intermediate
digesting protein. While RPI showed a 6.8% lower total amino acid appearance in the blood
based on AUC, the difference was not statistically significant.
Example 3
            [0145]                Rice vs. Whey vs. Placebo Supplementation on Body Composition,
Strength, and Muscle Thickness. Nine resistance trained male participants were selected for
use in a study to determine differences between the exercise training results using a rice
protein supplement, a whey protein supplement, or placebo. Three participants were selected
for each group.
            [0146]                Each participant trained five times per week for four weeks using a
hypertrophy and strength oriented periodized resistance training program. Each of the three
participants in the whey protein group was given 18 g of whey protein concentrate (having
 1.8 g of leucine total per 18 g serving) and each of the three participants in the rice protein
group was given 18 g of rice protein concentrate (having 1.4 g leucine per 18 g serving).
            [0147]                Every workout session was monitored and post workout ingestion of
protein was monitored by an investigator. On non-workout days protein supplementation was
taken before bed time. Table 6 shows statistics gathered from the participants:

            [0156]                The night prior to gavage feeding, rats were fasted overnight (a total of 15
 18 hours). The day of feeding, rats were gavage-fed the respective test protein in 1-2 ml of
water under light isoflurane anesthesia. The human-equivalent dosing paradigms were
established per the methods of Reagan-Shaw et al.
            [0157]                After gavage feedings, rats recovered for 60 min in their home cages. They
were then injected with a metabolic tracer for muscle protein synthesis (i.p. injection of 5.44
g puromycin dihydrochloride in 1 ml of sterile PBS). Following injections, rats recovered for
an additional 30 min in their home cages (90 min total after gavage-feeding).
            [0158]                90 minutes following gavage feeding (30 min after puromycin-tracer
injections), rats were euthanized using C02 narcosis. Hind limb mixed gastrocnemius
muscles were extracted and processed for Western blotting and muscle protein synthesis,
respectively.

Anabolic protein signaling (Akt-mTOR pathway).
            [0160]                At the human equivalent dose (HED) of 19g and 10g, RPC significantly
activated phosph-p70s6k (Thr389) signaling in comparison to control (water), while WPC
and SPC failed to reach significance (see Figure 7; phosph-p70s6k (Thr389) activation by
WPC, SPC and RPC). RPC showed a 29% greater activation than WPC and a 14% greater
activation than SPC at a HED of 19g. At a lower dose, a HED of 10g, the differences became
even greater: RPC activated this marker of protein synthesis by 58% over WPC and even
69% over SPC.
