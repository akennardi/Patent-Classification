ABSTRACT
A system and a method for activating a duress alarm by voice command. When activated the
duress, alarm sends its spatial location to a computer server. The server sends commands to
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to fly and manoeuvre to the location specified by the duress alarm and
turn on the UAV cameras to provide live visual coverage to a third party. The location of the duress
alarm can be sent to other users of the system in the immediate location

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0001]
A system and a method for activating a duress alarm by voice command. When activated the duress,
alarm sends its spatial location to a computer server. The server sends commands to Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles to fly and manoeuvre to the location specified by the duress alarm and turn on the
UAV cameras to provide live visual coverage to a third party. The location of the duress alarm can be
sent to other users of the system in the immediate location.
{0002]
It should be noted that reference to the prior art herein is not to be taken as an acknowledgement
that such prior art constitutes common general knowledge in the art.
[0003]
Violent crime is a significant problem in campus environments such as universities, hospitals and
other such environments.
[0004]
These crimes commonly occur to lone victims in quite locations.
 [0005]
Current duress alarms are based on either smartphone applications or come in the form of hardware
devices. These known duress devices have a number of disadvantages. One disadvantage is the
requirement for the victim to manually press a button. The pressed button may call a pre
programmed telephone number to security control centres or pre-defined friends and family
[0006
A particularly serious disadvantage is obvious if a victim feels threatened or under attack; it may
prove difficult to unlock the phone, enter a PIN code, find an application on the smartphone and
launch this application to contact the control centre.
It may also be the case that the smartphone or hardware device is beyond the victims reach or in
another scenario the attacker may have control of the unit.
[0007]
Another disadvantage occurs even If a victim manages to manually activate the alarm via
smartphone or other device, then this usually opens a two way voice channel between the victim
and the control centre or friends and family allowing the attack be listened to only with no recording
of images.
[0008]
Another disadvantage occurs even If a victim manages to manually activate the alarm via
smartphone or other device, then the GPS co-ordinates of the victim are sent to the control centre
or friends and family normally by means of SMS a low priority form of telecommunications traffic
this is then displayed on mapping software on the internet.

 [0009]
Clearly it would be advantageous if a method and system could be devised that allowed a person to
activate a duress alarm through the use of a verbal command. It would also be advantageous to
provide, a method for transmitting commands to a drone to initiate a flight and continuously provide
positional updates to the drone. It would be advantageous if the drone flew to within a pre-defined
range of the co-ordinates and recorded visually through on board cameras the event and live
streamed them back to a control centre. It may also be advantageous to alert other users of the
application and security staff in the immediate location to the ongoing attack.
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION
[0010]
According to the first aspect, the present invention provides a means to activate a duress alarm by
means of a voice command.
[0011]
In accordance with a still further aspect of the invention the system provides a means for the duress
alarm to be communicated back to a central computer server.
[0012]
In accordance with still a further aspect of the invention the system provides a means to
continuously transmit the geographic position of the alarm back to a central server.
[0013]
In accordance with a still further aspect the system provides a means that communicates with
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or drones.
[0014]
In accordance with a still further aspect of the present invention comprises a software application
communicates with the UAVs to launch and manoeuvre to within a pre-defined range of the
provided locations
[0015]
In accordance with a still further aspect of the invention cameras on the drone are activated and the
information is streamed back to a control centre and recorded on the on-board cameras.
[0016]
In accordance with a still further aspect of the invention visual images and audio data is recorded
and stored on a computer server.
[0017]
In accordance with a still further aspect of the invention other users of the system within the
immediate region can also be informed of the duress activation on their communications devices

[0018]
Preferably, the duress device may comprise one or more of the following (a) A smart mobile phone
with a mobile software application installed; (b) A hardware device that has a microphone and a
tracking or locating technology
[0019]
Preferably the voice activation by key word may comprise one or more of the following (a) a
software application on a remote server that monitors the acoustic environment and listens for a
keyword (b) a software application on the duress device that monitors the acoustic environment and
listens for a keyword
[0020]
Preferably the tracking technology will comprise one or more of the following (a) GPS tracking; (b)
Blue Tooth tracking beacons;(c) Wi-Fi system; (d) Near Field Communications system (g) ZigBee
Wireless system
Each duress device may contain a unique identification number which is issued when the user
registers with the system.
[0020]
Preferably the system for communicating from the duress device to the server will comprise one or
any one of a digital transceiver using wireless or wired transmission, a wireless or wired file
transmitter, or any other form of digital communication used for wireless and wired transmission for
the purpose of transmitting voice and data.
[0021]
Preferably the remote computer server will comprise one or more of the following (a)a
communications system that can transmit and receive both voice and data (b)a software application
that detects and analyses the acoustic environment (c) a software application that detects keywords
(d) a software application that sends commands to the UAVs (e) a software application that displays
the position graphically (f) a software application that records and stores images and videos in a
database (g) a software application that can communicate with other users in the immediate area.
