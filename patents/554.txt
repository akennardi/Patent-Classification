Abstract
The present invention provides a bracket for use in the construction of steel frames for
buildings. The bracket includes a tab (which may be described as a tongue or an
extension) at one end that forms a bracket that can utilize a future locating hole in the
loadbearing top plate that links up with the bracket attached to the rafter or truss.
