   METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR TREATING MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE
   CROSS REFERENCE
   [0001] The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent
 5 Application 2013214939 filed 1 February 2013, the entire disclosure of which is
   incorporated herein by reference.
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   [0001a] The present invention relates generally to the treatment of process
10 materials, and more particularly to an apparatus, system and method for treating
   municipal solid waste (MSW) using heat and pressure.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [0002] Landfills are commonly used to dispose of waste materials of many
15 different types. These waste materials can include paper products, food scraps,
   yard waste, metal, glass, plastic and a host of other materials. In an attempt to
   reduce the amount of waste material that is deposited in landfills, source
   separating efforts in the form of recycling programs have been instituted. To the
   extent they are used, such recycling programs help reduce landfill dependence.
20 However, it has been found that such recycling programs only result in the
   removal of a relatively small percentage of the total waste material. In the case
   of at least some material, such as paper products and others, the relatively small
   recovery rate can be attributed at least in part to the fact that a large percentage
   of the products are food-contaminated and thus quite difficult to separate and
25 recycle.
   [0003] Various proposals have been made in the past to treat waste material
   prior to its introduction into a landfill in an attempt to recover portions of the
   material and thereby reduce landfill dependence. However, generally speaking,
   those proposals have not been well received, as they are not particularly suited
30 for efficiently and effectively treating different types of waste materials such as
   those commonly found in municipal solid waste (MSW). Municipal solid waste is
   generally the most complex and mixed material occurring in waste streams.
   Thus, systems for effectively and efficiently treating municipal solid waste must
   be capable of treating and breaking down a wide range of different materials.

WO 2013/116597                                                      PCT/US2013/024272
                                          2
     [0004]     In addition to being not well suited for handling a wide range of
     materials, past proposals for treating waste material also suffer from other
     disadvantages and drawbacks. For example, some proposals require a
     supply of heated boiler quality water for heating the treated material.
 5    However, the need for water of that quality significantly increases the cost
     and complexity of the treating facility. Moreover, the use of boiler quality
     water is not needed since the water immediately becomes contaminated
     once it is introduced into the treated material.
     [0005]     In addition, in situations in which the material being treated has
10   been heated and saturated with hot water for purposes of breaking down the
     waste material, steam is employed in an attempt to dry the material to a
     specified degree. However, as might be expected, steam is not very well
     suited as a drying mechanism since it tends to introduce additional moisture
     into the material. Thus, past proposals have not been well suited to allowing
15   the material to be dried to any desired degree. Moreover, little effort has
     been made to recover the heat that is generated during the treatment
     process.
     [0006]     Accordingly, it would be desirable to have an automated apparatus
     and system, which is designed to treat municipal solid waste (MSW), and
20   more particularly an automated system, which is designed to treat municipal
     solid waste (MSW) with wastewater from waste activated sludge (WAS)
     treatment facility.
     OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
25   [0007]     The present invention provides an apparatus, system and method
     for treating process material that are not susceptible to the same
     disadvantages and drawbacks as mentioned above. The present invention
     is well suited for effectively and efficiently treating materials of many different
     types, including municipal solid waste and oil contaminated soils. Organic
30   and inorganic materials can be conditioned by varying treatment parameters,
     thereby facilitating sorting by size and density separation into their primary
     components.

WO 2013/116597                                                     PCT/US2013/024272
                                         3
     [0008]    The present invention allows separation of food waste, ink, oil,
     grease and other related products from a host of base materials such as
     metal, glass and paper. Food products, for example, can be solubilized and
     then extracted from the waste stream. Additionally, a relatively clean, high
 5   quality form of cellulose can be recovered from the waste stream. It is also
     possible to obtain clean metal products (i.e., cans) which are much more
     readily acceptable as feedstock for various industries. Likewise, paper
     products can be treated to produce high quality recyclable material that can
     be separated for use in various industries. For example, through use of a
10   fractionator, larger fibrous material can be divided out from the shorter
     fibrous material, with the former having possible use in the paper industry as
     recycled paper and the latter being used possibly in the electrical industry.
     [0009]    The present invention is also advantageous, as it does not require
     boiler quality water to effectively treat the material. Indeed, through use of
15   the present invention, it is possible to use relatively low quality water, which
     is then extracted at the end of the treatment process as a relatively high
     quality water product. For example, waste activated sludge (WAS) or low
     quality water source can be used. It is possible to implement the present
     invention such that energy needs can be completely or at least partially
20   supplied from the process fuels generated. For example, it is possible to use
     low pressure steam that is readily available from the cogeneration features
     of most electrical generating facilities, which use steam or gas and seek low
     temperature application for their waste heat.
     [0010]    The present invention is also well suited for conserving and
25   optimizing heat and water usage through use of a system of two or more
     vessels, and more preferably three or four vessels that are connected to one
     another in a way that allows steam vented from one vessel during a drying
     phase of operation to be conveyed (or vented) to another vessel, which is in
     a phase of operation requiring the addition of heat and moisture. In addition,
30   the present invention allows the waste material being treated to be dried to a
     desired degree.

      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
      [0039]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the apparatus,
     method and system as described herein can be used for waste processing
20   and product recovery. For example, the apparatus, method and system as
     described herein can accommodate municipal waste as a separate stream
     covering municipal solid waste (MSW) and waste activated sludge (WAS) or
     low quality water source, which are jointly created continuously by all
     municipal communities. Municipal solid waste (MSW) typically includes
25   residential, both single family and multiple-tenant dwellings, food including
     fast food and restaurant facilities, and office buildings. These different types
     of MSW are normally combined at landfills the final repository as the
     culmination of a well-organized and regulated industry developed over many
     years for collection and recycling covering resource recovery requirements.
30   The need for altering this routine is primarily being insisted upon to counter
     the perception that landfill gas emissions are one of the main contributors to
     climate change and should be significantly reduced.

WO 2013/116597                                                    PCT/US2013/024272
                                        8
     [0040]    In addition to disposing of a very active waste, the processes
     described herein can greatly enhance the adverse production of greenhouse
     gases. For example, the processes can significantly increase the volume of
     biogas produced coupled with providing a source of low quality water
 5   needed as a wetting agent for the autoclave contents. This low quality water
     supplied with the waste activated sludge (WAS) is recycled in the extended
     process being reused many times in the rinsing tanks. In accordance with
     an exemplary embodiment, an anaerobic digester as described in detail in
     U.S. Patent No. 6,730,223 B1, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein
10   by reference, acts as a rinse water treatment system allowing multiple
     reuses of this water. Where it is possible to combine the waste activated
     sludge (WAS) from wastewater treatment plants with the municipal solid
     waste (MSW) transfer stations the resulting energy and other commodities
     produced provide an even more attractive investment return. In accordance
15   with an exemplary embodiment, a connector in the form of a small pipeline
     connection can be used to produce an efficient balance. In accordance with
     an exemplary embodiment, the introduction of waste activated sludge (WAS)
     coupled with a wastewater treatment and gas technology, such as those
     developed by Biothane* can produce a cellulose product, which can be
20   provided and/or sold to a number of markets including the paper industry,
     biofuels and bioproducts. In addition, the use of biofuels and bioparts can
     be optimized to address the dependency on petroleum products, which
     continues despite the development of renewable resources.
     [0041]    In addition, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the
25   autoclave pressure vessel (i.e., autoclave or vessel) is capable of operating
     in a vacuum mode that can act also act as a condenser when receiving
     steam (e.g., vapor form of a heated liquid). In accordance with an exemplary
     embodiment, the autoclave uses the wetted material as it is tumbled to
     accelerate the change of state from steam to water occurring with this mode
30   of heat exchange. A similar condition occurs when the autoclave is called
     upon later in the cycle to act as a steam generator as it moves into the cool
     down mode again taking advantage of the tumbling action to transfer heat

WO 2013/116597                                                     PCT/US2013/024272
                                           9
     from the autoclave through the change of state, this time water to steam. In
     accordance with an exemplary embodiment, because these two actions are
     between two autoclaves with identical heat loads the system interaction is
     time efficient related to the impact on cycle time providing equal and
 5   opposite transfers of energy.
     [0042]      In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, a preferred
     grouping of four autoclaves within a single plant with each vessel on a
     staggered two-hour cycle, which allows three of the four autoclaves to be
     continuously pressurized. The use of a grouping of four autoclaves allows
10   the system to maximize heat recovery and avoid plastics from inadvertently
     sticking to the indirect heat surfaces. In addition, the energy transfer
     between the vessels increases energy reuse and improves product quality.
     [0043]      In accordance with a further exemplary embodiment, in a system of
     two or more autoclaves, the behavior between at least two autoclaves
15   provide for a heat transfer operation wherein heat in the form of steam (e.g.,
     a heated liquid) is introduced from an adjacent autoclave during flashing of
     steam and/or during a cooling phase (i.e., cool-down phase) by using an
     interconnecting system of piping and valves. The system also preferably
     includes a gasifier to thermochemically reform the residual fines and other
20   combustibles into a synthetic gas that would further contribute to the
     significant biogas already obtained further increasing the landfill diversion
     rate while adding to the electrical generation capacity.
     [0044]     The apparatus (or autoclave) 100 according to a preferred
     embodiment of the present invention includes a vessel 200 that is fabricated
25   of a stiff and rigid material (e.g., steel). The vessel 200 is mounted in a
     frame structure 300 and includes a generally cylindrically-shaped
     intermediate section 220 that is positioned between a front cone portion 210
     located at a forward end 212 of the vessel 200 and a rearward cone portion
     230 located at a rearward end 232 of the vessel 200. The frame structure
30   300 includes a forward supporting section 310 and a rearward supporting
     section 330, which are connected together by longitudinal supporting
     members 320 that extend between corresponding corners of the forward and

WO 2013/116597                                                     PCT/US2013/024272

      rearward supporting sections 310, 330. As shown in FIGS. 1-4, the frame
      structure 300 is comprised of bracing members, which form a plurality of
      space frames 302 and rigid frames 304. The plurality of space frames 302
      are truss-like, interlocking struts, which are in geometric patterns. The
 5    plurality of rigid frames 304 are comprised of a plurality of straight or curved
      members interconnected by mostly rigid connections, which resist
      movements induced at the joints of members. The plurality of rigid frames
      304 are configured to handle bending moment, shear and axial loads within
     the frame structure 300. The combination of space frames 302 and rigid
10   frames 304 within the frame structure 300 provides a frame structure 300,
     which can support the loads generated by the weight and movement of the
     vessel 200 during the various stages of loading, cooking, and unloading of
     the vessel 200.
      [0045]    The cylindrical intermediate section 220 of the vessel 200 includes
15   several additional supporting sections, which are connected to one another
     by bracing members 350 as seen in FIGS. 1-4. The additional supporting
     sections are also generally rectangular in shape (as seen from either end of
     the apparatus) and surround the intermediate section 220 of the vessel 200.
      Diagonally extending bracing members (or space frame member 302) are
20   connected to the rearward supporting section 330 and serve to support the
     rearward end 232 of the vessel 200. Various other diagonally arranged
     bracing members 350 can also be provided to stiffen and strengthen the
     frame structure 300 and help support the significant loads imposed by the
     vessel 200.
25   [0046]     As seen in FIGS. 1-4, the frame structure 300 is pivotally mounted
     on a pair of trunnion supports 340 so that the frame structure 300 and the
     vessel 200 can pivot about a pivot axis. The pivot axis is arranged
     transverse to the longitudinal axis of the vessel 200. The pair of trunnion
     supports 340 is attached or fixed within a concrete flooring or housing 342.
30   The pair of trunnion supports 340 provides a swivel joint to the apparatus
      100, which allows for the vessel 200 to move or pivot as described herein.

     [0047]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the forward and
     rearward supporting sections 310, 330 have a generally rectangular cross
     section (as seen from either end of the apparatus 100) and surround the
     opposite ends of the intermediate section 220 of the vessel 200. As shown
 5   in FIGS. 1-4, the frame support 300 includes the forward and rearward
     support sections 310, 330, and an intermediate section 320. The
     intermediate section 320 comprises a first intermediate section 322, a
     second intermediate section 324, a third intermediate section 326 and a
     fourth intermediate section 328. The first, third and forth intermediate
10   sections 322, 326, 328 include a truss like structure in the form of a space
     frame 304 having a diamond shape thereto. The second intermediate 324
     includes an upper section 321, a mid section 323, and a lower section 325.
     The upper section 321 includes a space frame in the form of a diagonal strut,
     which forms a truss having upper and lower triangular units. The mid
15   section 323 includes a pair of struts, which are configured in a diagonal or X
     shaped configuration. The lower section 325 includes a space frame in the
     form of a diagonal strut, which forms a truss having upper and lower
     triangular units. The struts of the upper and the lower sections 321, 325
     extend from an upper portion of the frame structure 300 downward to a
20   vertical strut positioned towards the rearward end or portion 212 of the
     vessel 200. The second intermediate section 324 is adjacent to a pair of
     trunnion supports 340, which allows for the vessel 200 to move or pivot as
     described herein.
     [0048]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the vessel 200 is
25   movable between a first position (shown in dotted line configuration in FIGS.
     1 and 2) in which the forward end 212 of the vessel is directed upwardly at
     an angle of approximately 45 degrees (shown in dotted line configuration in
     FIG. 3) with respect to the horizontal so that the forward end 212 of the
     vessel 200 is positioned above the solid line horizontal position depicted in
30   FIG. 1, and a second position (also shown in dotted line configuration in FIG.
     4) in which the forward end 212 of the vessel 200 is directed downwardly at
     an angle of approximately 25 degrees with respect to the horizontal so that

 WO 2013/116597                                                    PCT/US2013/024272
                                        12
      the forward end 212 of the vessel 200 is positioned below the solid line (i.e.,
      horizontal position) shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.
      [0049]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, an arcuate rack 360
      is mounted on a supporting element for interacting with a pinion 362. The
 5    pinion 362 is driven by a motor 370, which is secured to the frame structure
      300. Thus, during operation of the motor, the pinion 362 moves along the
      rack 360 to cause the frame structure 300 and the vessel 200 to pivot about
      the pivot axis. A stop is provided on the rack to limit the pivoting movement
      of the vessel 200 in the clockwise direction while another stop is positioned
10    on the rack to limit pivoting movement of the vessel 200 in the
      counterclockwise direction. The pinion 362 and motor 370 in accordance
      with an exemplary embodiment are located on an upper portion of the frame
      structure 300, which provides for articulation of the vessel during loading and
      processing of the process material. Alternatively, the pinion 362 and motor
15    370 can be located on a lower portion of the frame structure 300.
      [0050]    As shown in FIGS. 1-4, the pair of trunnion supports 340 are
      located at forward portion or front end 212 of the vessel 200. The arcuate
      rack 360 extends from a rearward portion or rearward end 232 of the vessel
     200 on a lower portion of the frame structure 300 and arcs towards the front
20    portion 210 or front end 212 of the vessel 200. For example, for a vessel
     200 having a length of 60 feet and a diameter of 12 feet, the vessel 200 can
     weigh in excess of 200 tons (40,000 lbs). As described above, the pinion
      362 and motor 370 preferably moves the vessel 200 from a first position in
     which the forward end 212 of the vessel 200 is directed upwardly at an angle
25   of approximately 45 degrees with respect to the horizontal to a second
      position in which the forward end 212 of the vessel 200 is directed
     downwardly at an angle of approximately 25 degrees with respect to the
      horizontal. The respective angles of the forward end 212 of the vessel 200
     as described above are preferred and may vary depending on the desired
30   operating conditions of the vessel 200 without departing from the present
      invention.

WO 2013/116597                                                    PCT/US2013/024272
                                        13
     [0051]    During the initial phase of operation of the vessel 200, the waste
     material or process material to be treated preferably in the form of municipal
     solid waste (MSW) is introduced into the vessel 200 along with a wetting
     agent (e.g., water and/or waste activated sludge (WAS)). The wetting agent
 5   in accordance with an exemplary embodiment can be a waste activated
     sludge (WAS). The moisture content of the waste material is further
     increased through the introduction of a heated liquid in the form of steam,
     which is preferably in a saturated steam condition. The steam also
     increases the temperature within the vessel 200 as well as the temperature
10   of the waste material (e.g., MSW)) itself. Through the use of a heated liquid
     (e.g., steam), which is conveyed through the interior of the vessel 200,
     desired levels for the temperature and pressure within the vessel 200 are
     achieved. Throughout much of the vessel operation, the vessel 200 is
     preferably rotated to break down the paper type products and facilitate
15   cleaning of other materials (e.g., glass, metal objects, etc.). In accordance
     with an exemplary embodiment, the vessel 200 rotates at approximately one
     (1) revolution per minute (rpm) to approximately 12 revolutions per minutes
     (rpm), and more preferably approximately 4 rpm to approximately 8 rpm.
     [0052]    The vessel 200 is then vented (i.e., steam is released) to begin the
20   cooling and depressurization of the vessel 200 while at the same time
     reducing the moisture content of the material within the vessel 200. The
     steam within the vessel 200 is preferably released (or flashed) at least once,
     and can be released or flashed more than once without departing from the
     present invention. The one or more flashes of steam from within the vessel
25   200 can be used control the temperature within the vessel 200. For
     example, if the operator of the autoclave 100 wishes to control the
     temperature within a vessel 200 and/or alternatively an adjacent vessel 200,
     each of the vessels 200 can release and/or flash steam to another vessel
     200. In addition, the release or flashing of steam reduces the moisture
30   content within the vessel 200.
     [0053]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, one or more
     eductors 1750 (FIG. 17) can be used to reduce the pressure within the

WO 2013/116597                                                    PCT/US2013/024272
                                         14
     vessel 200, which in turn lowers the boiling point of the heated liquid (or
     steam). The one or more eductors 1750 can produce a negative explosion
     (or steam explosion), which assists with the drying of the process material
     within the vessel. In addition, by lowering the boiling point of the heated
 5   liquid (or steam) within the vessel 200, the one or more eductors 1750
     provide a means to reduce the moisture content within the vessel 200. The
     indirect heat source (e.g., hot oil) continues to be conveyed through the
     vessel 200, and is used to dry the material to a desired degree. Once the
     moisture content and the temperature of the process material within the
10   vessel 200 has been reduced to desired levels, the process material (or
     biomass) is emptied from the vessel 200, and the vessel 200 is readied to
     begin another treatment cycle.
     [0054] FIG. 5A is an end view of the apparatus showing the frame structure
     300 showing a pair of vessel supports 510. As shown in FIG. 5A, the vessel
15   200 is preferably supported on the frame structure 300 by way of a first pair
     of vessel supports (not shown) located towards the forward end of the vessel
     200 and a second pair of vessel supports 510, located near the rearward
     end of the vessel 200. The vessel supports support 510 the vertical loads
     imparted by the vessel 200 and transmit those vertical loads to the frame
20   structure 300. Each of the vessel supports 510 is comprised of a freely
     rotatable flat wheel 512 that is mounted on a shaft. During operation, the
     vessel 200 experiences thermal expansion and contraction in a direction
     along the longitudinal axis of the vessel (i.e., the vessel expands in length).
     The use of the support wheels 510, which have a flat outer circumferential
25   surface is advantageous since the support wheels allow that thermal
     expansion and contraction to occur in an unrestrained manner.
     [0055]     Each of the vessel supports 510 is also provided with a load sensor
     514 for measuring the live load distribution within the vessel 200. The load
     sensor 514 is preferably in the form of strain gauge instrumentation. In
30   accordance with an exemplary embodiment, input from the sensors 514 is
     used to effect an approximate equal distribution of the material located in the
     vessel during the treatment operation. For example, input from the sensors

 WO 2013/116597                                                     PCT/US2013/024272
                                         15
      514 can be used to control the angle of inclination of the vessel 200 through
     suitable operation of the motor 370. Thus, if the sensor 514 associated with
     the front vessel support detects a load significantly greater than the sensor
      514 associated with the rearward vessel support, the motor 370 is
 5   appropriately operated to raise the vessel 200 and thereby cause the
      material in the vessel 200 to move towards the rearward cone portion 230 of
     the vessel 200.
      [0056]    FIG. 5B is an end view of the apparatus 100 showing the vessel
     200, which is supported on the pair of trunnion supports 340. The frame
10   structure 300 is also provided with a plurality of longitudinal thrust bearings
     520, which are located between the first and second pair of vessel supports
     510. As seen in FIG. 5B, the apparatus includes eight longitudinal thrust
     bearings 520. The longitudinal thrust bearings 510 help prevent movement
     of the vessel 200 in a direction along the longitudinal axis of the vessel. In
15   addition, the longitudinal thrust beatings 520 support longitudinal loading
     along the longitudinal axis of the vessel 200 and transfer such loading to the
     frame structure 300 when the vessel 200 is in a position other than the
     horizontal position.
     [0057]     Each of the longitudinal thrust bearings 520 preferably includes a
20   roller 522 that is freely rotatable about an axis directed generally towards the
     longitudinal axis of the vessel 200. Each freely rotatable roller 522 is
     appropriately secured to a mounting bracket, which is attached to one of the
     mounts or the supporting section. An annular guide extends around the
     entire outer peripheral surface of the vessel 200 and is provided with an
25   annular groove that receives the respective rollers. In that way, the vessel
     200 is free to rotate-about its longitudinal axis, yet is prevented from
     substantially moving in the direction along the longitudinal axis of the vessel
     200. The longitudinal thrust bearings 520 are also designed to
     accommodate expansion and contraction of the vessel 200 during operation.
30   [0058]     The autoclave 100 also includes a drive means for rotating the
     vessel in opposite directions about the longitudinal axis to cause the vessel
     and the material contacting member to rotate the vessel 200 in order to

                                        16
     assist in breaking down the process material. The rotation of the vessel 200
     is about a 360-degree arc or circle (i.e., a complete revolution of the vessel
     200). In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the drive means is a
     rotary drive arrangement for the vessel 200 in the form of an arcuate rack
 5   and pinion system (not shown), which is positioned around an outer portion
     of the vessel 200. The arcuate rack and pinion system is preferably located
     along the longitudinal midpoint of the vessel 200 to avoid imparting eccentric
     movement to the vessel 200 during operation of the rotary drive
     arrangement. Additionally, the intermediate section 220 provides structural
10   support for the rotary drive arrangement.
     [0059]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the arcuate rack
     and pinion system preferably includes a series of limit switches for slowing
     the rotation of the vessel 200 in steps when the direction of rotation of the
     vessel 200 is changed or when the rotation of the vessel 200 is stopped. In
15   some instances, the arcuate rack and pinion system can be used to stop the
     rotation of the vessel 200 as needed. In addition, the drive means rotates
     the vessel 200 in both a clockwise and a counterclockwise direction
     depending on the phase or state of the treatment process. In addition, by
     varying the rotation of the vessel 200, the operator and/or automated
20   program can maximize the use of the liquid transport conduits or helices
     1510 (FIGS. 15 and 16) as described herein.
     [0060]    FIGS. 6-11 are illustrations of an exemplary door assembly (or split
     door assembly) 600, which includes a door 610, a pair of annular locking
     rings 620, 630 and a handling yoke and frame structure 640. In accordance
25   with an exemplary embodiment, the municipal solid waste or waste material
     (MSW) or process material is fed into the interior of the vessel 200 through
     the door 610 positioned on the front cone portion 210 of the vessel 200. The
     door 610 is preferably large enough in diameter to accommodate a wide
     delivery conveyor belt or system. For example, in accordance with an
30   exemplary embodiment, a twelve-foot diameter autoclave or vessel 200
     preferably has an approximately eight-foot (8) diameter door 610. The door
     assembly 600 has a first or main annular locking ring 620, which is capable

     of complimentarily engaging a pair of flanges 622, 624 located on the door
     610 and the vessel 200, respectively. The first or main annular locking ring
     620 is preferably configured to handle the precision and accuracy needed for
      remote automatic handling of a door 610. In accordance with an exemplary
 5   embodiment, the first or main annular locking ring 620 is a hydraulic
     powered locking ring, which rotates approximately 15 to 60 degrees (1/2 to 2
      notches) and more preferably approximately 30 degrees (or one notch) to
     compress the two flanges 622, 624 together forming an airtight seal between
     the interior of the vessel 200 and the door 610. The use of the hydraulic
10   powered locking ring provides for an airtight seal without having to rotate the
     door 610, which can weigh in the range of 8 tons (or 16,000 lbs) for an eight
     foot diameter door 610 used in an autoclave or apparatus 100 as described
     herein.
     [0061]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, an O-ring (not
15   shown) is placed between the pair of flanges 622, 624, which creates the
     airtight seal between the pair of flanges 622, 624 upon tighten or closing of
     the first or main annular locking ring 620. The O-ring is preferably a loop of
     elastomeric or elastomeric-like material, which is designed to be compressed
     between the pair of flanges 622, 624 during closure of the door 610 creating
20   an airtight seal. The O-ring preferably has a disc-shaped and/or elliptical
     cross-section. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the O-ring can
     be affixed to an outer surface of either flange 622, 624. In addition, if
     desired, the O-ring can be seated within a groove within either flange 622,
     624.
25   [0062]     As shown in FIG. 6, the door assembly 600 preferably includes a
     double locking ring system, which includes the first or main annular locking
     ring 620, which secures the door 610 to the front cone portion 212 of the
     vessel 200, and a second or locator annular locking ring 630, which provides
     a means for removing and attaching the door 610 to the front cone portion
30   210 of the vessel 200. As shown, the second or locator annular locking ring
     630 preferably includes a pair of flanges 632, 634, which are fixed to a
     handling yoke and frame structure 640 and the door 610, respectively. The

      second or locator annular locking ring 630 engages the pair of inner flanges
      to 632, 634 to remove the main annular locking ring 620 for loading and
      unloading of the vessel 200. For a twelve-foot diameter autoclave having an
      eight-foot diameter door 610, the second or locator annular locking ring 630
 5   will preferably have a diameter of approximately four-feet. The handling
      yoke and frame structure 640 includes an upper door frame lift 650 (FIGS. 9
      and 10) and a lower door frame lift 660 (FIG. 11), which articulate to provide
      added safety to the door assembly 600.
      [0063]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, as shown in FIGS.
10    7A and 7B, the door assembly 600 includes a two-position locator pin
      system 670, which can be initiated as part of the automated remote control
     system installed to handle the split door assembly 600. The locator pin
     assembly 670 assures that the door assembly 600 will remain securely fixed
      in either the open and/or closed position for the door 610, which allows the
15   vessel 200 to rotate or articulate freely. As shown in FIG. 7A, the two
     position locator pin system 670 includes a pair of locator pins 672, 674. The
     two-position locator pins 672, 674 are positioned adjacent to the pair of inner
     flanges 632, 634 and are configured to engage the second or locator annular
     locking ring 630 during removal of the main annular locking ring 620 for
20   loading and unloading of the vessel 200. In accordance with an exemplary
     embodiment, the two-position locator pin system 670 assures that the door
     assembly 600 will remain securely fixed in either the open position (i.e.,
     loading of the vessel) or the closed position (during heating and cooking).
     [0064]      In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the door assembly
25   600 can be manually operated and/or alternatively, the apparatus 100 can
     include a door assembly 600 having a computerized automatic handling
     system and/or robotic system (not shown). The door assembly 600 is
     preferably designed for vessels 200 (or autoclaves) used in a large municipal
     solid waste plant, and where the door 610 is supported from the main
30   structural frame 300 and can be stored under the front cone portion 212 of
     the vessel 200 when not locked in place on the front end 210 of the vessel
     200 during loading of the vessel 200.

     The handling yoke and frame structure 640 is configured to be strong
     enough and stiff enough to support the door 610 as it is moved between a
     locked or closed position on the front of the vessel 200 during use, and an
     unlocked or open position when the door 610 is positioned or stowed
 5   underneath the vessel 200 during loading of the vessel with municipal solid
     waste and the like.
     [0065]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the handling yoke
     and frame structure 640 includes a two sets of double servomotor pistons
     642, 644, 646, 648, wherein one set of the servomotor pistons 642, 644 is
10   aligned in a horizontal position and the other set (or second set) of
     servomotor pistons 646, 648 is aligned in the diagonal position. The
     opening and closing of the door 610 is effected through operation of the pair
     of horizontal servomotor piston arrangements 642, 644 and the pair of
     diagonal servomotor piston arrangements 646, 648. The horizontal
15   servomotor piston arrangements 642, 644 move the vessel door 610 in an
     axial direction away from the front cone portion of the vessel 200.
     Meanwhile, the diagonal servomotor piston arrangements 646, 648 move the
     vessel door 610 downwardly and slightly rearwardly. Thus, the vessel door
     assembly 600 is movable between a first position (i.e., a sealed as closed
20   position) shown in full line configuration in FIG. 1 to a second position (i.e., a
     stored or open position) shown in the dotted line configuration in FIG. 3.
     [0066]    As described above, in a sealed or closed position, the first or main
     annular locking ring 620 is engaged with the two flanges 622, 624 in
     connection with the O-ring to form an airtight seal on the front portion of the
25   vessel 200. In order to remove the door 610 from the vessel 200, the first or
     main annular locking ring 620 is disengaged from the two flanges 622, 624
     by rotating the locking ring 620 in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction
     approximately 30 degrees (e.g., one notch). The horizontal servomotor
     piston arrangements 642, 644 move the door 610 away from the vessel 200
30   in an axially direction. Once the door 610 has been disengaged from the
     vessel 200, the second or locator annular locking ring 630 rotates and
     engages the pair of inner flanges 632, 634. Once the second or locator

     annular locking ring 630 has engaged the pair of inner flanges 632, 634,
     which are connected to the door 610, and the handling yoke and frame
     structure 640, respectively, the diagonal servomotor piston arrangements
     646, 648 move the vessel door 610 downwardly and slightly rearwardly. The
 5   movement of the diagonal servomotor piston arrangements 646, 648
     downwardly and slightly rearward stows the door 610 underneath the vessel
     200 for loading and unloading of the process material. The steps are
     performed in the reverse order to attach the door 610 to the vessel 200 for
     processing of the municipal solid waste (MSW). The rotation of the first or
10   main annular locking ring 620 and the second or annular locking ring 630 are
     preferably controlled via a pair of hydraulic motor assemblies, which are
     attached to the vessel 200 and the handling yoke and frame structure 640,
     respectively.
     [0067]      FIG. 8A is a side view of the upper door lift frame ram hinge 700 for
15   a servomotor piston arrangement 642, 644 in accordance with an exemplary
     embodiment. As shown in FIG. 8A, the upper door lift frame ram hinge 700
     is attached and/or fixed to the autoclave subframe 680. The upper door lift
     frame ram hinge 700 includes a first member 702, which extends outward
     from the subframe 680 to a second member 704. The second member 704
20   is preferably configured to be attached and/or fixed to a ram hinge 710. The
     ram hinge 710 includes a plurality of bores or openings, 712, 714, 716,
     which are configured to receive fixed hinge pins (not shown), and which
     attaches the ram 710 to the upper door lift frame 650. As shown, the
     plurality of bores or openings 712, 714, 716, preferably include a first bore

      attaching and/or removal of the door 610 from the vessel 200 in a desired
      automated mode.
      [0068]      In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the ram 710 has a
 5    relatively flat upper portion 720, which extends outward towards the upper
      door lift frame 650 to a slightly rounded edge 722. The slightly rounded
      edge 722 transitions the upper portion 720 to an outer edge 724, which is at
      approximately 40 to 50 degree angle relative the relatively flat upper portion
      720. The outer edge 724 transitions to an outer rounded edge 726. The
10    outer rounded edge 726 transitions to a lower edge 728, which extends
     towards the autoclave subframe at an approximate 10 to 20 degree angle
      relative to the relatively flat upper portion 720 to an inner edge 730. The
      inner edge 730 transitions to an inner bore 732 and to a relatively flat lower
      portion 734, which attaches to the second member 704.
15    [0069]      FIG. 8B is an end view of an upper door lift frame ram hinge 700 for
     a servomotor piston arrangement in accordance with another exemplary
     embodiment. As shown in FIG. 8B, the ram 710 is attached to the second
     member 704 via a suitable connection.
     [0070]       FIG. 8C is a side view of a hydraulic assembly 750, which is
20   attached to the handling yoke and frame structure 640 (not shown) of the
     door assembly 600 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. The
     hydraulic assembly 750 includes a hydraulic pin actuator 752, which raises
     and lowers the door assembly 600 and door 610 of the vessel 200. As
     shown in FIG. 8C, the hydraulic pin actuator 752 moves a lower position
25   754, wherein the door 610 is stored underneath the front cone portion 210 of
     the vessel to an upper position 758, wherein the door 610 is removed and/or
     attached to the vessel 200. In addition, as shown in FIG. 8C, as the
     hydraulic pin actuator 752 moves upward to raised or lift the handling yoke
     and frame structure 640, the hydraulic pin actuator 752 moves through a
30   series of intermediate positions 756, which correspond to the relative
     positions of the door assembly 610 as the assembly 610 is raised and/or
     lowered.

     [0071]     As shown in FIG. 8C, in accordance with a lower position 754, the
     door 610 and the door assembly 600 are stored underneath the front cone
     portion of the vessel 200. In a series of intermediate positions 756, the door
     610 and the door assembly 600 moves from underneath the front cone
 5   portion of the vessel to attach and/or remove the door 610 from the vessel
     200. In an upper position 758, the door 610 is attached and/or removed
     from the vessel 200.
     [0072]     As set forth above, when the vessel 200 is in the loading (filling) or
     unloading (emptying) mode, the vessel 200 is open and the door 610 is
10   stowed under the front cone portion 210 (or nose cone) of the vessel 200. In
     the pressurized mode, the door 610 is securely engaged to the vessel 200
     using the main annular locking ring 620 with the handling yoke and frame
     structure 640 engaged with the second or locator annular locking ring 630
     with part of the door assembly 600 and which is stowed under the nose cone
15   of the vessel 200. In addition, the door assembly 600 is preferably braced in
     order to ensure that each of the components and/or parts of the door
     assembly 600 can be precisely located and relocated to their designated
     positions as needed.
     [0073]      In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the door assembly
20   600 can be fitted with rack and arcuate drives for rotation and locking ring
     operation in order to assure fit up and limit switch functioning to precise
     locations that are consistent and repeatable. The rack and arcuate drive
     system has the benefit of enhanced safety because of the locking feature,
     which the door assembly 600 may exhibit following loss of power during
25   operation, and avoids the inherent dangers from a large pressurized vessel
     (or mass) as it rotates within the support frame 300. In addition, the
     reliability of the door assembly 600 is improved with a number of
     replacement features available for items subject to wear, and which are
     important to the desirability of the continuous operational running of the
30   autoclaves and/or vessels 200.

     door assembly 600 is removably secured to the open forward end of the
     vessel 200 so that during operation of the vessel 200, the process material
     to be treated can be introduced into the vessel 200 and once the material
 5   has been treated, the material can be discharged or removed from the
     vessel 200.
     [0075]     FIG. 9 is a side view of the upper door lift frame 650 of the
     apparatus 100 as shown in FIGS. 6-8 in accordance with an exemplary
     embodiment. As shown in FIG. 9, the upper door lift frame 650 includes an
10   inner frame member 652, which is configured to engage the second or
     locator annular locking ring 630, and an outer frame member 654, which
     engages the second set of servomotor pistons 646, 648, which are aligned
     in the diagonal position of the door assembly. The inner frame member 652
     and the outer frame member 654 preferably have a hollow inner portion and
15   are constructed from steel and/or a steel-based material, which can
     accommodate the weight of the door 610, which can weigh in excess of eight
     (8) tons.

     apparatus as shown in FIG. 6 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment.
     As shown in FIG. 11, the lower door lift frame 660 includes a lower frame
     member 662, which extends underneath the vessel 200 from outer edge to
     outer edge. The lower frame member 662 is attached to the handling yoke
30   and frame structure 640 via the first set of servomotor piston 642, 644, which
     are aligned in a horizontal position and a handling yoke member 664. The
     handling yoke member 664 extends from the servomotor piston 642, 644 to

     650.
     [0078]     The apparatus 100 also includes a rotary coupling 1200, which is
     attached to the rearward end 232 of the vessel 200. As shown in FIG. 12,
 5   the rotary coupling 1200 includes two oppositely positioned steam supply
     inlets/outlets 1210 through which steam can be directed and introduced into
     the interior of the vessel 200. The steam supply inlet/outlet 1210 is
     connected to a centrally disposed conduit 1220 of the rotary coupling 1200,
     which fluidly communicates with a hollow shaft 1230. The hollow shaft 1230
10   is fixed to the rotary coupling 1200 and extends into a cantilever 1240
     fashion into the interior of the vessel 200. The cantilever shaft 1240 extends
     into the interior of the vessel 200 only for a portion of the longitudinal extend
     of the vessel 200 (e.g., between approximately fifteen (15) and twenty-five
     (25) percent of the total length of the vessel 200).
15   [0079]     The shaft 1230 is secured to the rotary coupling 1200 by way of a
     suitable securing device. A radially extending rib on the rearward end 232 of
     the vessel 200 is positioned between an annular shoulder of the shaft 1230
     and an end portion of the rotary coupling 1200. A suitable gland or bearing
     is positioned between the rib of the vessel 200 and the end portion of the
20   rotary coupling 1200. Suitable packing can also be provided to effect fluid
     tightness. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the cantilevered
     shaft 1240 is provided with several radially outwardly directed fins whose
     purpose will be explained in more detail below. In addition, the shaft 1240 is
     provided with a plurality of spaced apart openings or jets that communicate
25   with the hollow interior of the shaft 1240. In that way, a heated liquid (or
     steam) supplied to the inlets/outlets 1210 flows through the centrally
     disposed conduit 1220 and to the hollow shaft 1230 where the heated liquid
     (or steam) is introduced into the interior vessel 200 by way of the openings
     or jets in the shaft 1230. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment,
30   steam is supplied to the inlets/outlets 1210 via a steam supply line (not
     shown).

     [0080]     Additionally, the rotary coupling 1200 is fixed with respect to the
     vessel 200 so that the rotary coupling 1200 remains stationary during
     rotational movement of the vessel 200. In accordance with an exemplary
     embodiment, the rotary coupling 1200 is held in a fixed and stationary
 5   position by way of the diagonally oriented bracing elements. The rotary
     coupling 1200 is also provided with a liquid supply inlet and a liquid return
     outlet. The liquid supply inlet fluidly communicates with an annular fluid
     supply channel formed between the outer surface of the centrally disposed
     conduit of the rotary coupling and the inner surface of the cylindrical end
10   portion of the vessel 200. The annular fluid supply channel opens into an
     enlarged annular chamber portion, which communicates with a plurality of
     fluid transport conduits.
     [0081]     The liquid return outlet is in fluid communication with an annular
     fluid return channel, which is defined between two longitudinally extending,
15   generally cylindrical extensions at the rearward end of the vessel 200. The
     annular fluid return channel opens into an annular chamber portion, which
     also communicates with the fluid transport conduits. The cylindrical
     extensions at the rearward end 232 of the vessel 200 each have glands or
     beatings secured thereto. The glands or bearings are provided with a
20   packing to assist in providing a liquid and airtight fit. A suitable securing or
     fastening mechanism is associated with each of the glands or bearings.
     Through use of the fastening mechanisms, the rotary coupling 1200 can be
     secured in place on the rearward end of the vessel 200.
     [0082]     As noted above and as seen with reference to FIG. 12, the annular
25   chamber portions fluidly communicate with what are generally termed as
     fluid transport conduits. As seen more particularly in FIG. 12, each of the
     liquid transport conduits 1250 includes a liquid supply conduit 1252 and a
     liquid return conduit 1254. The liquid supply conduit 1252 fluidly
     communicates with the annular chamber as seen in FIG. 12 by way of a
30   through-hole provided in the wall at the rearward cone portion of the vessel
     200. Likewise, the liquid return conduit 1254 fluidly communicates with the
     annular chamber by way of a through-hole provided in the wall at the

WO 2013/116597                                                       PCT/US2013/024272
                                         26
      rearward cone portion of the vessel 200. In that way, liquid that is supplied
      to the inlet in the rotary coupling 1200 will flow into the liquid supply conduit
      1252, and liquid in the liquid return conduit 1254 will flow into the liquid
      return outlet. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, four (4)
 5   fluid transport conduits are provided in the vessel 200 and are appropriately
     fixed to the interior surface of the vessel 200. One function served by the
     fluid transport conduits is to transport heated fluid through the interior of the
     vessel 200 in order to heat and/or dry the material located in the vessel. Oil
      is the preferred fluid as it can be heated to a higher temperature than other
10    liquids (e.g., water) without creating excessive pressure. In addition, the
      heated oil preferably flows through the vessel 200 in a turbulent form so as
     to prevent an insulation layer of heater or hot oil from forming on an outer
     wall of the heated fluid or liquid transport conduits (e.g., 1510 of FIG. 15).
      By maintaining the heated oil within the transport conduits 1510 in a state of
15   turbulent flow, the heated oil (or hot oil) maximal heat exchange between the
     conduit and the materials within the vessel 200 can be achieved. In
     accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the hot oil preferably has the
     ability to be heated in upwards of temperatures in the range of approximately
     400 0 F.
20   [0083]     The steam supply inlets/outlets 1210 are preferably approximately
      12 to 24 inches in diameter depending on the size of the vessel 200. For
     example, a 12- foot diameter vessel 200 preferably includes a pair of steam
     supply inlets/outlets 1210 having a diameter of approximately 16 to 20
     inches, and more preferably approximately 18 inches in diameter.
25   Meanwhile, the liquid supply conduit 1252 and the liquid return conduits
      1254 are preferably approximately 4 to 12 inches in diameter depending on
     the diameter of the vessel 200. For a 12-foot vessel, the pair of steam
     supply inlets/outlets 1210 are preferably approximately 6 to 10 inches in
     diameter, and most preferably approximately 8 inches in diameter.
30   [0084]     FIG. 13 is a perspective view of a rotary coupling 1300 in
     accordance with an exemplary embodiment. The rotary coupling 1300
     provides a means for delivering a heated fluid down a central portion thereof

      1330 and for withdrawing steam and heat from within the vessel during
     venting or flashing of the steam and heat. As shown in FIG. 12, the rotary
     coupling 1300 is preferably attachable to a proximal end 1302 of the
     cantilevered shaft 1240 portion of the rotary coupling 1200. The rotary
 5   coupling 1300 includes a housing 1310 having a plurality of sides 1312
     thereto with openings 1314 configured to receive a screen or screen-like
     material 1320 (FIG. 14). The openings 1314 extend from one end to the
     other end of the housing 1310. The housing 1310 of the rotary coupling
      1300 preferably has at least at least eight (8) sides as shown, which forms
10   an octagon-like drum or cylinder. Alternatively, the housing 1310 can have
     more or less than eight sides. For example, in accordance with an
     alternative embodiment, the housing 1310 has five (5) or six (6) sides
     forming a pentagon or hexagon-like shaped drum and/or cylinder. The
     proximal end 1304 of the rotary coupling is attached or fixed to the proximal
15   end 1302 of the rotary coupling 1200. A distal end 1308 of the rotary
     coupling 1300 is fixed and/or attached to the proximal end of the
     cantilevered shaft 1240.
     [0085]     FIG. 14 is an end view of the rotary coupling 1300 of FIG. 13 with
     the screen or screen-like elements 1310 in accordance with an exemplary
20   embodiment. As shown in FIG. 14, the screen or screen-like material 1310
     are preferably fixed or attached to the housing 1320 via a bolt and/or bolt
     like system 1322. The screens or screen-like material 1310 allows the
     vessel to vent (or draw) steam from the interior of the vessel 200 without
     pulling out or withdrawing the process material from within the vessel during
25   venting. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, each of the screens
     or screen-like material can be replaced as need with a similar mesh size
     and/or different mesh size as desired. For example, for different types of
     municipal solid waste, the mesh size of the screens can be changed as
     needed. In addition, the screens or screen-like material 1310 can be
30   replaced as needed due to damage thereto and/or wear.

     section 220 of the vessel 200, each of the fluid transport conduits 1510
     extends helically through the vessel 200. Preferably, each one of the fluid
     transport conduits 1510 makes between a 90 degree helical revolution to an
 5   approximately 720 degree helical revolution between opposite ends of the
     intermediate section 220 of the vessel 200, and more preferably between a
     180 degree helical revolution to a single complete 360 degree helical
     revolution between opposite ends of the intermediate section 220 of the
     vessel 200, and more preferably a 180 degree helical revolution between
10   opposite ends of the intermediate section 220 of the vessel 200. However,
     the fluid transport conduits 1510 can be designed to complete more or less
     than a half of a revolution to one revolution within the interior of the
     intermediate section 220 of the vessel 200. In accordance with an
     exemplary embodiment, for a 12 foot diameter vessel 200, each of the fluid
15   transport conduits 1510 have a height of approximately 1 to 3 feet and more
     preferably approximately 2 feet, and are spaced from one another
     approximately 4 to 8 feet, and more preferably 6 feet apart. The number of
     fluid transport conduits 1510 is preferably half of the diameter of the vessel
     200 (e.g., a 8 foot diameter vessel with 4 fluid transport conduits, a 10 foot
20   diameter vessel with 5 fluid transport conduits, and a 12 foot diameter vessel
     with 6 fluid transport conduits).
     [0087]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the height of the
     fluid transport conduits 1510 are approximate 1/6 of the diameter of the
     vessel 200 (e.g., a 12 foot vessel has fluid transport conduits of
25   approximately 2 feet in height). In addition, the interior and/or exterior
     surfaces of the vessel 200 can be fitted with a heat plate system (or heat
     exchange system) to add an additional indirect heat source to the interior
     and/or exterior of the vessel 200. The heat plate system is preferably
     comprised of a pair of metal plates, one or both which are embossed, and
30   welded to one another. The embossings form a series of passages through
     which a heat exchange liquid or transfer media flows. In accordance with
     another exemplary embodiment, one or more heat sensors and/or pressure

WO 2013/116597                                                     PCT/US2013/024272
                                         29
     sensors can be positioned within and/or on the interior surface of the vessel
     200 to monitor the relative temperature of the vessel at various locations.
      [0088]    As seen in FIG. 16, each of the fluid transport conduits 1510 can be
     defined by two plates 1610, 1620 that are each secured to the inner surface
 5    1630 of the vessel wall 1640 in any suitable manner. The two plates 1610,
      1620 project inwardly towards the interior of the vessel 200 and are joined to
     one another by a pipe-section 1650 having a generally circular cross-section.
     Thus, the space defined by the two plates 1610, 1620 and the pipe 1650
     constitute the liquid return conduits 1660 while the hollow interior of the
10   generally circular pipe constitutes the liquid supply conduits 1600.
      [0089]    The fluid transport conduits 1510 act as a pressure plenum for the
      heat transfer medium and also provide significant stiffening to the wall of the
     vessel 200. In the intermediate section 220 and the rearward cone section
     232 of the vessel 200, at least one of the plates 1610, 1620 are preferably
15   provided with heat transfer fins (or ribs) 1670 (FIG. 16), which facilitates the
     transfer of heat to the interior of the vessel 200 and the process material (or
     MSW) located in the vessel 200. The fins (or ribs) 1670 also help agitate
     and condition the process material (or MSW) through direct physical contact
     with the material. Preferably, the fluid transport conduits 1510 are designed
20   to transport fluid from the rearward cone portion 230 to the forward end of
     the intermediate section 220. The portion of each fluid transport conduit
     located in the front cone portion is preferably not in fluid communication with
     the respective remaining portion of the fluid transport conduit. Thus, each of
     the fluid transport conduits is designed to transport heated fluid through the
25   rearward cone section and the intermediate section, but not through the front
     cone section. Thus, within the front cone section of the vessel 200, the fluid
     transporting member serves the primary function of a material contacting
     member.
     [0090]     For each fluid transport conduit, the liquid supply conduit and the
30   liquid return conduit are entirely separate from one another except at the
     forward end of the intermediate section 220 of the vessel 200 (i.e., the end
     of the intermediate section 220 adjacent the forward cone section). At the

WO 2013/116597                                                     PCT/US2013/024272
                                         30
      forward end of the intermediate section 220 of the vessel 200, the liquid
      supply conduit is in fluid communication with the liquid return conduit. Thus,
      heated fluid supplied to the liquid supply inlet flows from the rearward cone
      section of the vessel 200 to the forward end of the intermediate section 220
 5    of the vessel 200 by way of the liquid supply conduit. Upon reaching the
     forward end of the intermediate section 220, the heated fluid flows into the
      liquid return conduit where it flows back towards the rearward cone section
      of the vessel 200 and is discharged by way of the liquid return outlet. The
      liquid supply conduit and the liquid return conduit are specifically designed
10   so that fluid flowing there through remains separate from and does not
     contact the material in the vessel 200.
      [0091]     As noted above, within the intermediate section 220 of the vessel
     200, the fluid transport conduits extend in a helical manner. In the rearward
     cone section 212 of the vessel 200, the fluid transport conduits are arranged
15   as short helices in order to help expedite the initial breakdown of the material
     during filling of the vessel. In the forward cone section of the vessel 200, the
     fluid transport conduits extend in a generally helical manner, although
     somewhat differently than in the intermediate section 220, in order to assist
     the unloading movement of the materials from the vessel.
20   [0092]      In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, in the intermediate
     section 220 and the rearward cone section 232 of the vessel 200, the plates
     which define the liquid return conduits are arranged with respect to the
     vessel wall to form an angle of approximately 115 degree on the rearward
     end side and an angle of approximately 90 degree with respect to the
25   forward end side. As will become apparent from the description below, such
     a disposition of the plates is advantageous in assisting movement of the
     material within the vessel 200 during rotation of the vessel. In addition, the
     arrangement and disposition of the fluid transport conduits within the
     intermediate section 220 is designed to achieve significant cascading and
30   lifting of the material within the vessel 200, and less longitudinal movement,
     thereby resulting in optimum tumbling. In addition, the inclination of the
     plates on the rearward end side helps compress, but preferably not lock, the

WO 2013/116597                                                     PCT/US2013/024272
                                         31
     material as the material is being loaded into the vessel. Within the front
     cone section 210, the plates can form an angle of 110 degree with respect to
     the vessel wall at the rearward end side and an angle of 70 degrees with
     respect to the vessel wall on the forward end side. The arrangement and
 5   disposition of the material contacting member serves to facilitate the
     unloading of the material from the interior of the vessel by counteracting the
     additional lift that results from the way in which the wall of the front cone
     section converges towards the centerline of the vessel 200.
     [0093]      In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, a high
10   temperature oil is supplied as an indirect heat source from a heat oil source,
     which provides the main mixing and tumbling action that either absorbs or
     generates the direct heat from the steam involved. The high temperature oil
     (i.e., indirect heat source) can provide a significant impact on the rate of
     heat-up and/or cool down phases and the cycle time, which determines
15   throughput capacity. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the
     front of the vessel 200 as it articulates drops to about twenty-five degrees
     below the horizontal in order to fully form the cavity in the rearward of the
     vessel, which accommodates the exhausting steam delivered to the
     interconnecting headers.
20   [0094]      In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, as set forth above,
     the helices are arranged with one face smooth 1622, which helps to transfer
     the heat from the indirect heat source on the smooth side, by a wiping
     action. On the other side the fluid transport conduits (or helices) 1510 are
     fitted with projecting fins 1670, which break up the biomass in order to
25   rapidly release the direct heat source if in the steam generating mode or if in
     the condensing mode absorb this direct heat source. These features when
     coupled with the appropriate rotation both for direction and speed of the
     vessel 200, which can be varied to suit the desired treatment of the waste
     contents allows these contents to move longitudinally and transfers the heat
30   energy efficiently.
     [0095]      In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the plate 1620
     opposite the plate 1610 fitted with the projecting fins 1670 can be include a

WO 2013/116597                                                   PCT/US2013/024272
                                         32
      heat plate system 1680. The heated plate system 1680 is preferably
     comprised of a pair of metal plates, one or both which are embossed, and
     welded to one another. The embossings form a series of passages through
     which a heat exchange liquid or transfer media flows. In accordance with an
 5   exemplary embodiment, the heat exchange liquid is a hot oil, which transfers
      heat to the interior of the vessel 200. For example, the plate system 1680
     can be a panel produced by Platecoil* that can be sized to fit the curved
     surfaces of the autoclave 200 and likewise the helices 1510. In accordance
     with an exemplary embodiment, the hot oil is preferably maintained within
10   the plate system 1680 in a turbulent flow condition, which provides increased
     and/or improved heat exchange between the hot oil within the plate system
      1680 and the materials within the vessel 200.
     [0096]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the panel
     arrangement preferably includes at least four to six helices for a vessel 200
15   having a diameter of approximately 8 to 12 feet, which are anchored to the
     body of the vessel 200 using a system that allows the heat expansion growth
     of these panels to be adequately accommodated for within the temperature
     range experienced during operation. Panel arrangement with replacement
     provisions allow a fast replacement in the event that an oil leakage does
20   occur during plant operation but here again the use of hot oil as the
     preferred liquid with low operating pressures significantly reduces this
     probability.
     [0097]     FIG. 17 schematically illustrates a system 1700 that includes four
     interconnected vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, and 1716. The system 1700 also
25   includes a storage and/or starting pit 1702, wherein process material, which
     is preferably in the form of municipal solid waste (MSW) 1704 is delivered for
     treatment. The municipal solid waste 1704 can arrive and be delivered to
     the treatment plant from municipal trucks, railcars and/or any other type of
     waste delivery system to a truck receiving and dumping area 1706. In
30   accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the municipal solid waste 1704
     is placed on a conveyor belt system 1708, which delivers the process

WO 2013/116597                                                      PCT/US2013/024272
                                        33
      material (e.g., municipal solid waste) 1704 to the one of the four
      interconnected vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716.
      [0098]   The system 1700 includes a source of steam (or heated liquid)
      1730 and one or more hot oil heaters 1740. In addition, the system 1700
 5   also includes the piping scheme for each vessel 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716,
     and wherein each of the vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 preferably includes
     a supply line and a supply valve, which supplies the source of steam 1730
     and the one or more hot oil heaters 1740 to each of the vessels 1710, 1712,
      1714, 1716. A plurality of regulating valves movable between an open
10   position and a closed position direct the flow of fluid (i.e., heated liquid
     and/or steam) through the system 1700. The regulating valves are
     preferably connected to a controller, which controls the valves and which can
     control the overall operation of the system 1700. The supply lines and
     supply valves are all preferably provided with swivel joints, which allow
15   sections of the lines to move relative to one another during operation of the
     vessel to accommodate various movements of the apparatus 100.
     [0099]    The rearward cone portion 230 of each vessel 1710, 1712, 1714,
     1716 is preferably provided with a vacuum regulator for regulating air input
     into the vessels during the cooling and drying stages of operation as will be
20   discussed in more detail below. In accordance with an exemplary
     embodiment, the system 1700 preferably includes a vacuum regulator, which
     can include a vacuum breaker, which can be set to allow air to be input into
     the respective vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 when the pressure inside the
     respective vessel becomes less than a set pressure (e.g., 10 or 5 psi below
25   atmospheric). Preferably, the vacuum regulator is connected to a control
     system, which allows the point at which the vacuum regulator is made
     operational to be varied. The vacuum regulator is preferably positioned in
     the rearward cone portion of the vessel 200. In accordance with an
     exemplary embodiment, a steam vent header is connected to an eductor
30   1750 by way of a connecting line. A venting valve can be disposed in the
     connecting line and can be connected to a controller, which serves to open
     and close the venting valve. The eductor 1750 serves to condense steam by

WO 2013/116597                                                   PCT/US2013/024272
                                        34
     spraying water on the steam passing through the connecting line. In
     accordance with an exemplary embodiment, water is supplied from a
     condensate tank and is directed to the eductor 1750 through a pump and an
     eductor valve. The collapse of the steam in the eductor creates, in effect, a
 5   vacuum, which draws steam from the steam vent header. Additionally, if the
      regulating valve is open, the eductor 1750 tends to draw steam out of the
     interior of the respective vessel 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716.
      [0100]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the operation of
     each of the vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 and system 1700 as a whole
10   will be described in connection with the treatment of waste material (e.g.,
     municipal solid waste), but it is to be understood that the vessel 1710, 1712,
      1714, 1716, and system 1700 could also be used to treat other materials as
     well.
     [0101]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the system 1700
15   includes a four-vessel plant, which can be housed within a main building.
     The main building preferably includes a spreading floor, wherein the material
     is delivered and placed on one of a plurality of conveyor systems, and a
     main machine hall, which houses the plurality of vessels 200. In accordance
     with an exemplary embodiment, the main building is preferably arranged in a
20   manner to allow separate air ventilation for the spreading floor with the
     loading hoppers for the autoclaves, and the main machine hall, which
     houses the vessels, such that the spreading floor and main machine hall are
     independent of one another. In addition, the separation of the spreading
     floor and the main machine hall keeps the working environments apart so
25   that dissimilar duties are carried out by the operating staff as they perform
     their different tasks. Likewise, the remaining parts of the buildings can have
     various levels of separation. For example, the building can include a
     separate section and/or building where material is separated by size for
     recycling and the biomass is rinsed and prepared for commodity sale.
30   [0102]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the system 1700
     also includes a cogeneration plant 1720, which receives a supply of biogas
     and/or natural gas. The supply of biogas and/or natural gas is preferably

WO 2013/116597                                                     PCT/US2013/024272
                                       35
     supplied to an electrical generator in the form of one or more gas turbine
     electrical generators, and more preferably, a 2-unit gas turbine electrical
     generator. The system 1700 also preferably includes an area for a tank farm
     where process water is treated for reuse and the biogas can be stored,
 5   which is conveniently supplied to the cogeneration plant 1720. The
     cogeneration plant 1720 is preferably a separate building within the complex.
     Other major pieces of equipment include an eductor system 1750 along with
     the size separation trommels.
      [0103]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the hot oil heaters
10    1740, which provide the source of the indirect heat for the autoclaves 1710,
      1712, 1714, 1716 are preferably conveniently located near the cogeneration
     plant 1720 where industrial heat is produced along with green electricity.
     Truck access is generally peripheral to the building complex with the
     municipal solid waste (MSW) being delivered to the multiple doors above the
15   spreading floor where the first level of inspection is carried out by the loading
     operation team.
     [0104] The system 1700 also includes a spreading floor adjacent to the
     autoclaves where packer trucks can offload for about eight hours each day
     on a six-day week basis to a spreading floor is desirable. The spreading
20   floor should have a capacity large enough to store the twenty-four hour
     volume required to feed the four autoclaves including a seventh day storage.
      In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, each of the plurality of
     autoclaves 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 operate on a 24 hours per day, seven
     days per week scheduled to provide a constant supply of treated process
25   material in the form of pulp to a paper production facility and/or for biogas
     production. As shown in FIG. 17, vessel 1 (1710) and vessel 3 (1714) are
     located adjacent to one another, and vessel 2 (1712) and vessel 4 (1716)
     are adjacent to one another. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment,
     the vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 are preferably loaded in the following
30   order vessel (1710), vessel 2 (1712), vessel 3 (1714), and then vessel 4
     (1716). Accordingly, by arranging vessels 1 and 3 adjacent to one another,
     and vessels 2 and 4 adjacent to one another, the loading and unloading of

WO 2013/116597                                                  PCT/US2013/024272
                                        36
     the vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 can be performed, even if a delay
     occurs with one or more of the vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716.
     [0105]    A loading operation team consisting of two large sized rubber tired
     loaders with some floor inspection will move the dumped MSW 1704 to the
 5   loading conveyors 1708 where two walking floor hoppers each serving two
     vessels will feed the conveyors 1708 supplying their inclined autoclaves
     1710, 1712, 1714, 1716. At the top of each conveyor the belt 1708
     transitions into a separate wetting chamber where the water including the
     WAS (waste activated sludge), where it is available, is transferred into the
10   mouth of the rotating autoclave 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716. In accordance with
     an exemplary embodiment, during this floor operation over-sized objects are
     moved to the sides for separate disposal and excess municipal solid waste
     (MSW) is stockpiled for later use that same day and/or at another time. At
     the point where the autoclave 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 reaches the
15   predetermined weight determined by the load cells on the autoclave wheels,
     the conveyer belt 1708 is stopped and remains loaded until the same
     autoclave returns about two hours later for reloading.
     [0106]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the cycle time
     preferably includes one additional monitoring step, wherein an operator can
20   observe the loaded belt as the conveyor belt 1708 leaves the walking floor
     vessel. An inspection walkway preferably traverses the four loading belts
     1708 allowing an inspector to continuously observe and/or view the
     municipal solid waste (MSW) load in order to pick up unacceptable articles
     missed from previous inspections before reaching the autoclave. From this
25   station, an operator can stop the conveyor 1708, remove any unacceptable
     objects by using a suitable device, such as, a portable hook device, and
     convey the unacceptable objects to the side for separate disposal.
     [0107]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the loading
     conveyor 1708 passes the waste to the main mechanical building housing
30   the plurality of vessels (or autoclaves) 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 where a

     aggregation of high technical equipment including automation is
      incorporated into an interaction along with the four individual vessels 1710,
      1712, 1714, 1716 all sharing common services. The introduction of high
     temperature oil the primary heat source typically requires that the distribution
 5   between the hot oil heaters and the various units be run and/or operated in
     service galleries below the operating floor. Likewise piping for the eductor
     system 1750 along with the steam transfer piping between vessels or
     autoclaves 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 should be routed in these same service
     galleries including a connection to the cogeneration plant 1720. This avoids
10   congestion particularly at the operating level keeping this area relatively
     clear and visible from the remote control room where the operating staff is
     located. The service gallery also provides improved access for maintenance
     and servicing operations and allows for the separation preferred in order to
     minimize exposure to operational accidents.
15   [0108]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the vessels 200 are
     preferably design to cover potential wear or erosion factors during the
     extended operation that these vessels will be subjected to on a seven-day
     week basis. In addition, adequate stiffness in the support framing to ensure
     that the machined components supporting the rotating and articulating
20   portions of this equipment operate within acceptable tolerances. In
     particular, regard should be given to the rotary coupling support at the
     rearward of the autoclave as the autoclave operates as a third bearing in line
     with two other larger bearings each having a disproportionate amount of
     rotational mass in line as they support this machine. Although the treatment
25   of the contents is intentionally arranged to be gentle to minimize any
     fragmentation that could seriously impede future debris removal in the
     process the autoclave experiences significant dynamic impact from the
     necessary tumbling action sought from the helices. This is the reaction that
     the support frame has to resist from the two main steel tire bearings
30   combined with the thrust bearing retaining the vessel in a horizontal plane.
     [0109]    In accordance with an exemplary, the process described above is
     exclusively related to the treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW) wherein

WO 2013/116597                                                     PCT/US2013/024272

     the system seeks to recover cellulose as a commodity, which addresses the
     debris removal along with the physical separation of the solubilized organics
     from the cellulosic pulp. The overall process is generally described as the
     wet process to separate it from the autoclave process which is essentially
 5   dry and which relies on the steam atmosphere created under pressure to
     reform the contents not unlike a pressure cooker. The method, apparatus
     and system for processing municipal waste from a biomass that has been
     treated in a steam autoclave and follows up with a dilution tank process in
     hot water allowing further separation. This hot water process allows us to
10   remove undesirable debris such as glass, grit and low temperature plastics
     and finally separate the solubilized organics from the desired cellulose fibers
     now available as a valuable commodity.
     [0110]    The indirect heat oil is introduced to the liquid supply conduits (or
     plenums) where the sticking of certain low melt point plastics to the heated
15   surfaces now continuously wet was avoided. More importantly, the heat
     transfer rate was significantly increased by subjecting the contents to a
     wiping motion over the wet heated surface. In the case of the cool down or
     flashing mode where the material was required to be opened tIp thereby
     allowing the vessel to act as a steam generator, the helice surfaces can be
20   used to break up the contents exposing them to the saturated steam
     atmosphere in order to release the heat more rapidly.
     [0111]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the compaction
     carried out during the filling mode over fifty percent of the vessel volume is a
     space after cooking is completed, which favors expeditious steam removal
25   from the flume already incorporated into the shear spline as mixing and
     tumbling continues. From the heat cycle figures the large tonnages of steam
     being transferred from and to the autoclaves indicate the large amounts of
     energy in motion taking advantage of the change of state with no steam
     boiler required. Equally important is the speed that this heat transfer can be
30   carried out which is indicative of the large heat sink resident in these hot
     vessels entering into the heat removal mode with an equally receptive sink
     available in the cool vessel. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment,

WO 2013/116597                                                     PCT/US2013/024272

     the cycle time obtained along with the high-energy recovery achieved is
     favorable for the four-vessel embodiment, a system having an adequately
      large steam interconnecting flumes coupled with the eductor thereby
      increasing the steam flow from the relatively small pressure differential
 5   available between the two or more connected vessels.
      [0112]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a hybrid anaerobic
     digester concept, which produce a biogas combined with a high quality soil
     amendment and where such a commodity was sought for agricultural
     purposes is desirable. However to meet the primary and immediate needs
10   of metropolitan areas it would be preferable to stay with the proven Biothane
     system or like system, particularly as the system uses less tankage and
     space and has demonstrated its ability to incorporate the inclusion of WAS in
     the liquor obtained from the autoclaves. For example, the step can be a
     motivating influence, which brings the full range of municipal waste together
15   in our proposed system as a comprehensive package still retaining flexibility
     in the range of added value products offer to make this necessary change
     financially attractive and at the same time remove the need for a carbon tax.
     [0113]     In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, to
     accommodate the use of municipal waste that has to be treated, it is
20   desirable to quantify the waste activated sludge (WAS) behavior in both
     consistency and chemical composition. This requirement allows the
     operator to provide optimum benefits from the carbohydrate solution in the
     form of a brown liquor fed into the anaerobic digester, which can be passed
     through a dissolved air flotation unit prior to the digester. This step is
25   important to the optimum production of biogas (Biologically Derived Natural
     Gas) where separation of the lignocellulose pulp properly cleaned from the
     brown liquor is carried out in the rinsing cycle.
     [0114]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a certain amount of
     water chemistry has to be observed at this step to ensure that this combined
30   liquor created from the dissolved components of municipal solid waste
     (MSW) and waste activated sludge (WAS) in the autoclave does provide the
     anaerobic micro-organisms with a properly prepared feedstock. As

                                        40
     mentioned above, the digester for the gas production can be a Biothane@
     Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Unit*. This in turn will ensure the fast
     return of the process water following an aerobic polishing step where it can
     be reintroduced to the rinse cycle with a large supply of biogas now available
 5   for electrical cogeneration. The process also provides a fast turnaround for
     recycling the water, which has greatly reduced tankage demands compared
     to other digestion systems. In addition, the method and system provides the
     operator with electrical independence by supplying industrial heat for the
     autoclave hot oil system. After taking care of the energy demands for the full
10   plant, a significant amount of green electricity can be available for sale to the
     grid, which can provide a valuable revenue stream coupled with food waste
     conversion at the early stages of this process. In accordance with an
     alternative embodiment, the system can be designed with a hybrid digester,
     which in some circumstances is better suited for rural America and possibly
15   certain developing countries where commodities along the line of soil
     amendments are being sought.
     [0115]     The high-rate anaerobic digesters studied over an extended period
     were finally concluded by using the embodiment of the Biothane Upflow
     Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Unit, which can optimize the benefits for this
20   process. Such a teaming has been able to establish a process to manage
     these two dominant waste streams and produce a number of high value
     commodities that can reduce present municipal costs and still meet fully all
     environmental requirements.
     [0116]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the addition of a
25   wetting agent from a waste activated sludge to the autoclave 100 while it is
     being filled with municipal solid waste (MSW), provides the necessary
     moisture to bring the contents up to the proper consistency for pulping. Also
     at this point in the process, the chemical nutrient level aggregated in the
     mixture from the water chemistry sampling carried out at frequent intervals,
30   which can be adjusted to suit commodities being pursued. In accordance
     with an exemplary embodiment, the temperature within the vessel 200 is
     increased to a desired range, which does not exceed a maximum

WO 2013/116597                                                    PCT/US2013/024272
                                        41
     temperature or level, and held within the desired range for a prescribed
     duration. For example, for pulping of paper products, the temperature within
     the vessel preferably does not exceed 272'F (e.g., melt point of lignin within
     the pulp and/or paper). Alternatively, the temperature within the vessel can
 5   be designed and/or programmed to reach upwards of 292'F or higher, e.g.,
     for treating diseases such as mad cow and Escherichia coli (E.coli),
     sanitization or sterilization of medical devices and the like. During the
     processing of the process material, the vessel 200 is rotated about its
     longitudinal axis such that during the condensing mode the helice rotation
10   allows the fins to break up the process material and accelerate the
     condensing as well as the dissolving of the tumbling mass fraction of
     carbohydrate materials. In addition, the release of steam via flashing or
     steam explosions (e.g., a violent flashing or boiling of water into steam) can
     be used to treat and/or remove unwanted organisms from the process
15   material. For example, process material can be sterilized through one or
     more steam explosions or flashing of steam from within a vessel 200.
     [0117]     During part of this process treatment the contents (i.e., process
     material) will be pushed along the smooth side of the helice in order to wipe
     the heat off of this surface as part of the heat exchange method which
20   increases the heat transfer rate. This stage is also dependant on the correct
     moisture content being present in the material, which is now at its maximum
     along with having a saturated steam environment free from air. Water
     content present at this point of maximum prescribed temperature is an
     important element or key to the pulping quality required and is calculated
25   based on the known amount of inherent water present at filling and the need
     to reach approximately sixty percent (60%) water in the biomass fraction. In
     accordance with an exemplary embodiment, water transfer from the two hot
     autoclaves is calculated and the balance required is added at the filling in
     order to arrive at this desired level of consistency and the high transfer rate
30   achieved allows the avoidance of a separate steam boiler. In accordance
     with an exemplary embodiment, numerous tests were run to establish the
     variations of moisture content within the delivered municipal solid waste

WO 2013/116597                                                    PCT/US2013/024272

      (MSW) and with the exception of fast food or restaurant facilities variations
      were well within the limits needed to meet the pulping criteria. In addition, in
      accordance with an exemplary embodiment, when waste activated sludge
      (WAS) is included, the biogas production is increased by approximately
 5    twenty percent (20%). At the lower temperatures of cooking, heat is
      supplied sequentially from each of the two other autoclaves under pressure
      in the form of steam releases as they move through the cool down or
     flashing mode with the final topping off and actual cooking using only the
      indirect heat source. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment,
10    maximum temperature attained and duration held is often predetermined
      based on the downstream commodity prescribed and also the sanitation or
     sterilization effects sought to combat pathogens and parasites. These
     variations are readily attained with the apparatus and computerized
      programs included in the process and the larger autoclave vessels more
15    readily bridge the variations between delivery trucks.
      [0118]     In the past, autoclaves have normally relied on direct heat to
     provide the heat energy in the form of steam from boilers which was
     normally the prime mover in the process but when it was applied to MSW
     treatment the inability to produce a dry enough product became a problem.
20   The four-vessel configuration uses an indirect heat source (e.g., hot oil) that
     combines the drying process into a single operational entity without going to
     an independent drying process. If a separate drying process was required,
     in addition to adding more cost, the separate drying process can extend the
     cycle time, which can have a significant reduction in throughput capacity with
25   very little energy recovery and all with a significant increase in capital and
     operating cost. The systems and methods as described herein allow the
     organic fraction from the inorganic fraction using the pulping action built into
     the autoclave along with the indirect heat features. In accordance with an
     exemplary embodiment, the system and method described herein focuses
30   on the presence of two constituents that were dominant in MSW these being
     food waste and paper waste both carbohydrates but each behaving
     differently when subjected to heat and pressure when coupled with moisture.

WO 2013/116597                                                     PCT/US2013/024272

     The preferred linkage between moisture and temperature demonstrates the
     need for a higher moisture content being required to accomplish a complete
     repulping. This same moisture level was equally important in solubilizing the
     food waste and was particularly effective when carried out at the higher
 5   temperature level allowing significant enhancement of the finished product to
     occur, which will be further explained below.
     [0119]     In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, the methods
     and systems described herein have been developed to incorporate the other
     constituents in MSW in such a way that the size separation after autoclaving
10   would be successful and allow the fraction other than the biomass (or
     renewable energy source) to be easily handled for further recycling thereby
     ensuring that the landfill diversion rate can be maximized. The biomass
     includes biological material from living, or recently living organisms. Delivery
     to the trommel in a sufficiently dry state to allow size separation through the
15   various screen sizes without sticking is the second control point where the
     moisture content is critical and the contents are now cooled down to a
     desired exit level that reduces moisture emissions from the conveyor
     system. For example, the size separation of the MSW in a sufficiently dry
     state allows size separation on trommels having a screen size of
20   approximately % (0.5 inch) and 2.0 inches. Alternatively, different sizes
     screens and more or less screens can be used. In a preferred process for
     the pulping or paper industry, the systems and methods as described herein
     produce a biomass, which has been dried to a desired state, so as to provide
     for approximately 60% (percent) of the organic material to be sifted through
25   the    -inch screen, and an additional 10% through the 2-inch screens. The
     remaining 30% (percent), which will typically include the inorganic material
     (or "overs") continues onward through the trommel stations to be disposed
     through further recycling systems and methods. The trommel system
     preferably includes one or more rotary brushes to assist with the separation
30   of the organic material from inorganic material through the % inch and 2 inch
     screens.

      [0120]     Before the door is removed, the moisture within the vessel has to
      be reduced to an acceptable level, which is carried out using a combination
      of the flash mode and cool down phases developed between the autoclaves
     where one vessel would act as a heat removal sink to allow the connected
 5   vessel to vent a portion of the heat and moisture within the vessel and
      gradually cool down. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a
      certain amount of variation was allowed for in this process in order to
      accommodate moisture differences between incoming loads, which has a
     fairly broad band of acceptable limits, which in turn minimizes changes
10    required to the automated settings for process control purposes. For
     example, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the process
      material (or biomass) is removed from the vessel 200 at approximately
      120'F to approximately 190 F, and more preferably approximately 150'F to
     approximately 160 0 F.
15   [0121]     In the final stage, the maximum moisture content is present just
     before the flashing operation starts and the system enters into the moisture
     removal step and the indirect heat continues to be supplied to the hot vessel
     (or autoclave) as the steam is transferred at a faster rate to the cooler vessel
     (or autoclave). These vessels 200 are preferably in an equal and opposite
20   mode, which is also the beginning of reducing the total heat sink content in
     the hot vessel with the drying stage started with steam removed being
     vented or passed to the cooler vessel now entering the cooking stage. This
     next period continues and the contents in the hot autoclave 100 continue to
     be dried and cooled as the moisture is removed and added to the cooler
25   autoclave. The differential pressure between the autoclaves 100 is now
     gradually reducing and finally the hot autoclave still in the cool down mode is
     reconnected to the eductor system for the final part of the cooling and it is
     now taken well below the boiling point once in the vacuum cycle. When the
     final drying is completed the interior pressure is equalized allowing the door
30   to be removed for emptying which is the end of the pressure cycle for that
     vessel which is picked up again thirty minutes later after filling for a new run.
     Although, the system is described with the use of a four-vessel system, the

WO 2013/116597                                                    PCT/US2013/024272
                                        45
     system can be operated with more or less than four vessels (or autoclaves)
     and the advantages of the systems 100 as described herein can be
     obtained.
      [0122]    As shown in FIGS. 18 and 19, each of these steps are illustrated in
 5   the four-vessel heat cycle chart where a two hour cycle time demonstrates a
     separate load being made available for size separation every thirty minutes
     and because half of the time under pressure is in the drying mode when
     emptied the contents readily pass through the smallest opening screen in the
     size separation trommel. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the
10   quality of the secondary fiber recovered exhibited improved freeness
     increasing its value to the paper industry and is attributed to the flashing
     stage used in drying. This same part of the treatment accelerates the
     breakdown of the waste, however it exerts a gentle overall action that does
     not further contaminate the contents often done by other separation
15   techniques. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the vessel 200
     is preferably operated at approximately 50 to 70 percent full by volume, and
     more preferably approximately 60 percent, which can produce a high quality
     pulping product.
     [0123]     Where a dryer biomass is sought or a batch is inadvertently wetter
20   than normal, an adjustment to the indirect heat source duration can be
     made, which will extend the cool down period giving the contents additional
     drying time. For example, prior to the door removal the autoclave 100 has
     been in a pressure or vacuum cycle for about ninety minutes out of the two
     hours total, which in addition to drying the contents allows all of the
25   emissions during the treatment to be fully enclosed and vented through a
     filter system. In addition, the four-vessel layout provides for the operator to
     direct the heat energy of two vessels when combined with the eductor
     system to extract a larger amount of moisture than that added from steam
     transfer. The final drying through the eductor system preferably provides a
30   higher quality water than that added as a wetting agent a benefit that should
     not be overlooked when consideration of the total water demands of the
     process are made. An additional monitoring device is also preferred on the

WO 2013/116597                                                    PCT/US2013/024272
                                        46
     autoclave to signal the presence of undesirable emissions that may be
     present before the door is removed. Although, the probability of this
     occurring is very low due to the heterogeneous nature of municipal solid
     waste material (MSW) and its diverse sources. However, such precautions
 5   are prudent and provisions are desirable, and if this occurs, the load is
     preferably isolated for separate handling. In accordance with an exemplary
     embodiment, hoppers and conveyors receiving the treated waste are
     preferably equipped with covers to ventilate these materials as they are
     further processed in the plant in order to secure the working environment.
10   [0124]     The vessels 200 can also be designed to allow chemicals to be
     introduced into the interior of the respective vessels for purposes of treating
     the process material. For example, the rotary coupling at the rearward cone
     portion of the vessel 200 can be provided with another inlet to which is
     connected a line for introducing such chemicals into the vessel interior. The
15   chemicals would then be sprayed into the vessel interior by way of the jets or
     openings in the cantilevered shaft. In addition, chemicals can be introduced
     through the forward cone end of the vessel when the process material to be
     treated is being introduced into the interior of the vessel.
     [0125]     As noted above, the material that has been unloaded onto the
20   conveyor can be conveyed to a sorting and separating station where
     standard screening equipment can be employed to further separate and sort
     the various components using trommels, vibratory screens or other
     equipment. Through achievement of an optimum moisture condition in the
     biomass during the drying phase, it is possible to utilize such screens to
25    readily separate the organic biomass from the inorganic portion. Standard
     metal separation equipment such as cross belt magnets and eddy current
     separators combined with air density separators permits feedstock streams
     to be collected and stockpiled or baled for downstream use. This is
      particularly useful for the separated biomass, which can be further
30    processed for a number of uses, which may vary to suit various market
      needs. These varied market needs can include, among others, long fiber for
     the paper industry, a feedstock for glucose manufacture, a biofuel for steam

     can also be employed to utilize the significant food waste that is solubilized
     in the biomass moisture after the steam process. For example, one can use
     the treated material as a source of methane for boiler fuel use, for steam
 5   generation and/or for heat exchange liquids. Prior to the aforementioned
     separation methods, a suitable separating device providing three size
     distributions (e.g., over two inches, between two inches and one-half inch,
     and below one-half inch) can be employed to achieve an adequate size
     classification.
10   [0126]     FIG. 18 is a flow chart 1800 for a four-vessel system 1700 in
     operation. As shown in FIG. 18, the system 1700 includes at least four
     vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716, which are operating in a four-vessel heat
     cycle, wherein at least three of the four vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 are
     always under an operating pressure or vacuum, while one of the four vessels
15   1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 is being emptied or filled.
     [0127]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, as shown in FIG.
     18, in step 1810, the first vessel 1710 is filled with a process material such
     as municipal solid waste and the like, and a wetting agent (e.g., loading &
     wetting). The door to the vessel 200 is then closed. In step 1812, the
20   eductor system is connected to the filled vessel and entrapped air is
     evacuated from the vessel (e.g., air evacuation). Since air is a poor
     conductor, which slows down the heat transfer, and which inhibits the
     creation of the saturated steam condition required within the body of the first
     vessel 1710. In step 1814, after the eductor pulls a partial vacuum on the
25   vessel, steam and heat is added to the interior of the vessel to begin the
     cooling cycle (e.g., introduce steam & heat). In accordance with an
     exemplary embodiment, the steam is preferably introduced from at least one
     of the other vessels 1712, 1714, 1716 in a flashing mode and/or a cool down
     mode, which is transferred through the header system to the first vessel
30   1710. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the heat liquid or
     steam from each of the vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 can be released
     (flashed) one or more times depending on the desired temperature within the

WO 2013/116597                                                    PCT/US2013/024272
                                        48
     vessel 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716. For example, a desired temperature within
     each of the vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 may be obtain via one or more
     flashing of heated liquid or steam at duration of approximately 2 to 3 minutes
     followed by the addition of the indirect heat source for a duration of
 5   approximately 10 minutes. However, each of the processing recipes can be
     designed for the specific autoclave, type of process material or MSW, and
     the desired output in the form of biomass and uses associated with the
     produced biomass. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, each of
     the vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 will perform at least two flashings of
10   heated liquid or steam.
     [0128]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the heated liquid
     (i.e., steam) is readily absorbed in the first vessel now operating in the
     condensing mode (or cooking mode). In addition, the helices with their fins
     on the contact side mix and open up the process material to accept the
15   steam heat and converting it to high temperature water. In step 1816,
     through the use of a heated liquid or oil, which is conveyed through the
     interior of the vessel, desired levels for the temperature and pressure within
     the vessel are achieved, which cooks the process material (e.g., cooking).
     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, throughout much of the
20   vessel operation, the vessel is preferably rotated to break down the paper
     type products and facilitate cleaning of other materials (e.g., glass, metal
     objects, etc.). In step 1818, the vessel is then vented (i.e., steam is
     released) to one of other vessels 1712, 1714, 1716), in a flashing mode (or
     steam explosion) to begin the cooling and depressurization of the vessel
25   while at the same time reducing the moisture content of the material within
     the vessel (e.g., flash steam). In step 1820, the introduction of the indirect
     heat from the hot oil source continues, which allows the first vessel to reach
     its final cooking temperature (e.g., heat). In step 1822, the steam within the
     first vessel 1710 is released to the third of the four-vessels 1714 to begin the
30   cool down phase (e.g., cool down). In step 1824, once the moisture content
     and the temperature of the process material in the vessel 200 has been
     reduced to desired levels, the process material is emptied from the vessel so

WO 2013/116597                                                     PCT/US2013/024272
                                        49
     that the vessel is then ready to begin another treatment cycle (e.g., empty).
     The cycles for each of the second, third and fourth vessels 1712, 1714, 1716
     are shown in FIG. 18, wherein each of the vessels 1712, 1714, 1716
     proceeds through the following stages: loading and wetting stage 1830,
 5   1850, 1870, evacuate air 1832, 1852, 1872, introduce steam and heat 1834,
     1854, 1874, cook 1836, 1856, 1876, flash steam 1838, 1858, 1878, heat
     1840, 1860, 1880, cool down 1842, 1862, 1882, and empty 1844, 1864,
     1884.
     [0129]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, in order to further
10   optimize the mixing rate, each of the vessel 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716 are
     preferably placed in an automatic leveling mode, which distributes the
     tumbling contents or process material uniformly along the barrel of the
     vessel 200 by load balancing. As shown in FIG. 18, this interaction in a four
     vessel heat cycle illustrates the introduction of the third vessel 1714
15   transferring steam during its flashing mode and it being received by the first
     vessel 1710. This is also concurrent with the introduction of indirect heat
     from the hot oil source, which now allows the first vessel to reach its final
     cooking temperature and continue through the cooking, flashing, cool down
     and final emptying of the contents. It is important to ensure that when the
20   indirect heat is turned on the air has been fully removed from the autoclave
     using the eductor and a saturated steam environment exists. This
     assurance is readily accomplished with the four-vessel system (or four
     autoclave), which when carried out eliminates any sticking of the low melt
     point plastics to the heated surfaces.
25   [0130]    In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, to avoid the
     softening point of lignin present in mechanical pulp waste paper where the
     final pulp commodity could become excessively brown in color. Accordingly,
     in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the cooking temperature
     within each of the vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716, preferably does not
30   exceed approximately two hundred and seventy degrees Fahrenheit
     (272*F), and which is preferably controlled by limiting the maximum
     temperature during the cooking to approximately 272'F. However, the

WO 2013/116597                                                    PCT/US2013/024272
                                        50
     cooking temperatures and/or other variables within each of the vessels can
     be varied and/or set within the specified equipment and control mechanisms
     provided to accommodate variations in the process operation for different
     process materials and desired output.
 5   [0131]    As shown in FIG. 18, after the first vessel 1710 has passed through
     the cool down phase, which includes a drying phase, which is the last phase
     under pressure, the indirect heat can be cut off and the door removed to
     begin the emptying process 1824, 1844, 1864, 1884. In accordance with an
     exemplary embodiment, the four-vessel process flow diagram that the total
10   hot oil supply is kept very near to a constant flow rate, which improves the
     efficiency of the oil heater operation. Heat energy movement is of even
     greater import in varying the moisture content than it is in temperature
     change, which is addressed later particularly in the cooling and drying mode.
     Moisture movement is carried out using steam as the transport medium and
15   unlike the indirect heat source which remains in liquid form steam relies on
     the change of state to move large amounts of heat between autoclaves as it
     changes to high pressure water or in the reverse mode to steam. In
     accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the indirect heat source
     provides the vessel with the ability to extend the material drying phase
20   before the door removal. In addition, by extending the drying phase through
     the use of the indirect heat source, the four-vessel cycles offers the benefit
     of staying within the closed loop as long as possible and thus continuing to
     extract moisture through the eductor closed system and controlling
     emissions. This containment before emptying the autoclave in addition to
25   providing additional drying has dropped the temperature significantly such
     that when the contents are now in the open environment of the building they
     are stable having been extensively ventilated. In accordance with an
     exemplary embodiment, collection bins and conveyors are preferred to be
     hooded and/or tied in to the building ventilation system for the filtering of any
30   foul smelling odors that may infrequently occur allowing them to be routed
     through the filtered ventilation system.

     [0132]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the treatment of
     municipal solid waste (MSW) within a four-vessel plant and the vessels (or
     autoclaves) are approximately 2 to 20 feet in diameter, more preferably
     approximately 5 to 15 feet in diameter, and most preferably approximately
 5   ten (10) to twelve (12) feet in diameter with a length of approximately 10 to
      100 feet in length, more preferably approximately 25 to 75 feet in length, and
     most preferably approximately 50 to 60 feet in length. However, the length
     and diameter of the vessels 200 used are preferably selected to provide an
     average throughput that can be varied to suit specific field conditions. For
10   example, dimensional limitations for the upper size limits that would stay
     within the desired cycle time coupled with the throughput capacity being
     sought all limited to the indirect heat transfer that can be accomplished for
     treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW) having a length of approximately
     60 feet with a diameter of approximately 12 feet. The preferred size of the
15   vessel are preferably controlled by the heat exchange medium adopted and
     can be varied based on the different types and models of surfaces available
     that can be safely applied. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment,
     the ratio of the heated surface available versus the volume included in the
     vessel with the latter varying as the cube of the dimensions whereas the
20   surface areas varied as the square. For example, the mass of the municipal
     solid waste (MSW) with the added wetting agent dominated as the vessel
     dimensions increased, however, as described above the surface area
     available was significantly increased by adding the helice surfaces to the
     developed tube surface.
25   [0133]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the two-hour cycle
     time can be achieved with a maximum vessel diameter slightly larger than
     the twelve feet, which uses six helices to augment the available heated
     surface. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the vessel 200
     preferably has a length of approximately sixty (60) feet and a diameter of
30   approximately 12 feet (e.g., the length of the vessel is approximately five
     times the diameter of the vessel) was adopted and further examined related
     to the total configuration, and the structural adequacy of this tube supported

                                         52
     between two sets of flat wheel assemblies. For example, this offers a
     seventy-five ton batch, which in a four-vessel autoclave system provides a
     throughput of three thousand tons per day of municipal solid waste (MSW).
     [0134]     The supporting frame point of articulation can be relocated in order
 5   to reduce the loading height for the autoclave door with the wetting chamber
     and conveyor but still permitting a movement of the nose cone of the vessel
     200 to approximately 45 degrees. For example, existing buildings can be
     remodeled to accommodate the inclusion of autoclaves and roof clearances
     are not sufficient without major changes. At the same time, the nose cone of
10   the vessel 200 drops to approximately 25 degrees in the other direction,
     which improves unloading but more importantly creates the large cavity in
     the tail of the autoclave, which facilitates the steam removal during cool
     down. In accordance with an exemplary, the loading angle gives aid to the
     helices by the reduction in the sliding friction to the waste as it is compacted
15   into the body of the autoclave allowing the maximum weight of the contents
     to be included before the door is fastened. Furthermore, the ability to vary
     the rotational speed along with the filling rate provides operational flexibility
     in the sequence programming, which optimizes the autoclave treatment
     process.
20   [0135]     As set forth above, in collecting municipal solid waste, cities and
     municipalities often use packer trucks for the purpose of maximizing the load
     capacity of the truck during collection of the process material (e.g., municipal
     solid waste). In addition, similar packing devices are used to densify the
     municipal solid waste when railroad containers (or rail-haul) are used for
25   transportation of the waste (e.g., residuals) to remote landfills. In
     accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the system 1700 as described
     herein is designed to accommodate the need of municipalities to compact
     the material when introduced through the wetting chamber into the mouth of
     the vessel commingled with the liquid wetting agent (i.e., waste activated
30   sludge), which can be a low quality-water.
     [0136]     For example, at the filling stage of each of the vessels 1710, 1712,
      1714, 1716, the vessels are inclined at forty-five degrees and rotating such

WO 2013/116597                                                    PCT/US2013/024272
                                        53
     that the helices running the full length of the tube are compressing the
      contents (e.g., process material), which are further aided by the shear spline
      located in the base of the vessel. This shear spline does not rotate with the
     vessel but minimizes the probability that the municipal solid waste (MSW)
 5    mass lodges in the tail end of the vessel and be deprived of the mixing
     action essential to the process.
      [0137]    FIG. 19 is a chart showing the mode of operation of a four-vessel
     system 1900 illustrated in FIGS. 17 and 18. As shown in FIG. 19, the four
     vessel system 1900 includes four vessels 1710, 1712, 1714, 1716, which are
10   operating on a general two-hour cycle. Each of the vessels 1710, 1712,
      1714, 1716 goes through a series of phases, which includes the filling of the
     vessel with a process material and a wetting agent in step 1910. In step
      1912, the door of the vessel is closed and air within the vessel is removed
     from the vessel. In step 1914, the moisture content of the waste material is
15   then further increased through the introduction of steam, which also
     increases the temperature within the vessel as well as the temperature of the
     waste material itself. Through the use of a heated liquid, which is conveyed
     through the interior of the vessel, desired levels for the temperature and
     pressure within the vessel are achieved. Throughout much of the vessel
20   operation, the vessel is preferably rotated to break down the paper type
     products and facilitate cleaning of other materials (e.g., glass, metal objects,
     etc.). In step 1916, the vessel is then vented (flash mode) to one of the
     other vessels to begin the cooling and depressurization of the vessel while at
     the same time reducing the moisture content of the material within the
25   vessel. The venting of the vessel increases the temperature and moisture
     content within the receiving vessel. In step 1918, the heated liquid, which
     continues to be conveyed through the vessel, is then used to dry the material
     to a desired degree. Once the moisture content and the temperature of the
     material in the vessel has been reduced to desired levels, in step 1920, the
30   remaining steam is vented to another vessel within the system, which adds
     heat and moisture into the corresponding vessel. In step 1922, the

WO 2013/116597                                                     PCT/US2013/024272

     processed material is emptied from the vessel so that the vessel is then
      ready to begin another treatment cycle.
      [0138]     In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, as shown in FIG.
      19, the filling and loading of each of the vessels is preferably performed at
 5   between approximately 62'F to approximately 920 F, and the cooking of the
     process material is performed from approximately 262 F to approximately
     292*F depending on the process material and the desired output. For
     example, for pulping of paper products, the temperature within the vessel
     preferably does not exceed 272'F (e.g., melt point of lignin within the pulp
10   and/or paper). During the processing of the process material, the vessel is
     rotated about its longitudinal axis such that during the condensing mode the
     helice rotation allows the fins to break up the process material and
     accelerate the condensing as well as the dissolving of the tumbling mass
     fraction of carbohydrate materials.

25   [0144]      As can be appreciated from the foregoing description, the
     apparatus, system and method according to the present invention are quite
     advantageous as they allow a wide range of material to be treated. By
     simply changing the operational parameters, the apparatus, system and
     method can be specifically tailored to achieve particularized desired results
30   for different types of materials, thereby facilitating separation and sorting
     efforts.

      [0145]    The present invention is also highly desirable, as it does not require
      high quality water for treatment of the material. As set forth above, it is
      possible to employ water of low-grade quality, which, through operation of
     the apparatus and system, is actually increased in quality. In that way,
 5   wastewater, such as waste activated sludge (WAS) can be used as the
     water source and subsequently converted to water whose quality is useful
     for other purposes.
      [0146]    Energy and water conservation represent another advantage of the
      present invention. By maintaining the system so that heat and steam
10   generated in one of the vessels are subsequently used to heat and raise the
      moisture content of the process material in another vessel, the water and
     energy requirements for the system can be significantly reduced. Although
     the system requires the addition of steam from an external source (e.g., a
     steam generating device can be connected to the steam supply header), the
15   amount is significantly less than would otherwise be the case. In addition,
     the present invention also allows the material to be dried to the extent
     desired before it is emptied from the vessel. Thus, subsequent separation
     and sorting efforts can be made easier.
     [0147]     The principles, preferred embodiments and modes of operation of
20   the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification.
     However, the invention, which is intended to be protected, is not to be
     construed as limited to the particular embodiments disclosed. Further, the
     embodiments described herein are to be regarded as illustrative rather than
     restrictive. Variations and changes may be made by others, and equivalents
25   employed, without departing from the spirit of the present invention.
     Accordingly, it is expressly intended that all such variations, changes and
     equivalents, which fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention as
     defined in the claims be embraced thereby.
