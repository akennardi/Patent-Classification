10 production of drugs rivanol, as a mediator of rivanol, it can also be used as a
   preservative antiseptic. However, most of the existing synthetic methods are derived
   from p-nitrotoluene by chlorination, oxidation, it is complicated and the final yield is
   not very high. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new synthetic method for further
   improving the quality and yield of the product and reducing the byproduct content, it
15 has important economic significance.
