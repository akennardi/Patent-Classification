BIDIRECTIONAL DOWNHOLE ISOLATION VALVE
Cross-Reference to Related Application
[0001] The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent No. 2014207765,
the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
Field
[0002] The present disclosure generally relates to a bidirectional downhole isolation valve.
Background
[0003] A hydrocarbon bearing formation (i.e., crude oil and/or natural gas) is accessed by
drilling a wellbore from a surface of the earth to the formation. After the wellbore is drilled to a
certain depth, steel casing or liner is typically inserted into the wellbore and an annulus between
the casing/liner and the earth is filled with cement. The casing/liner strengthens the borehole,
and the cement helps to isolate areas of the wellbore during further drilling and hydrocarbon
production.
[0004] Once the wellbore has reached the formation, the formation is then usually drilled in an
overbalanced condition meaning that the annulus pressure exerted by the returns (drilling fluid
and cuttings) is greater than a pore pressure of the formation. Disadvantages of operating in the
overbalanced condition include expense of the weighted drilling fluid and damage to formations
by entry of the mud into the formation. Therefore, underbalanced or managed pressure drilling
may be employed to avoid or at least mitigate problems of overbalanced drilling. In
underbalanced and managed pressure drilling, a lighter drilling fluid is used so as to prevent or
at least reduce the drilling fluid from entering and damaging the formation. Since
underbalanced and managed pressure drilling are more susceptible to kicks (formation fluid
entering the annulus), underbalanced and managed pressure wellbores are drilled using a
rotating control device (RCD) (aka rotating diverter, rotating BOP, or rotating drilling head).
The RCD permits the drill string to be rotated and lowered therethrough while retaining a
pressure seal around the drill string.

                                                    2
[0005] An isolation valve as part of the casing/liner may be used to temporarily isolate a
formation pressure below the isolation valve such that a drill or work string may be quickly and
safely inserted into a portion of the wellbore above the isolation valve that is temporarily
relieved to atmospheric pressure. The isolation valve allows a drill/work string to be tripped
into and out of the wellbore at a faster rate than snubbing the string in under pressure. Since the
pressure above the isolation valve is relieved, the drill/work string can trip into the wellbore
without wellbore pressure acting to push the string out. Further, the isolation valve permits
insertion of the drill/work string into the wellbore that is incompatible with the snubber due to
the shape, diameter and/or length of the string.
[0006] Typical isolation valves are unidirectional, thereby sealing against formation pressure
below the valve but not remaining closed should pressure above the isolation valve exceed the
pressure below the valve. This unidirectional nature of the valve may complicate insertion of
the drill or work string into the wellbore due to pressure surge created during the insertion. The
pressure surge may momentarily open the valve allowing an influx of formation fluid to leak
through the valve.
[0007] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome, or at least ameliorate,
one or more of the above disadvantages.

Description of Embodiments
[0026] Figures 1A and lB illustrates operation of a terrestrial drilling system 1 in a drilling
mode, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The drilling system 1 may
include a drilling rig Ir, a fluid handling system If, and a pressure control assembly (PCA) Ip.
The drilling rig Ir may include a derrick 2 having a rig floor 3 at its lower end having an

                                                  6
opening through which a drill string 5 extends downwardly into the PCA lp. The PCA lp may
be connected to a wellhead 6. The drill string 5 may include a bottomhole assembly (BHA) 33
and a conveyor string. The conveyor string may include joints of drill pipe 5p (Figure 9A)
connected together, such as by threaded couplings. The BHA 33 may be connected to the
conveyor string, such as by threaded couplings, and include a drill bit 33b and one or more drill
collars 33c connected thereto, such as by threaded couplings. The drill bit 33b may be rotated 4r
by a top drive 13 via the drill pipe 5p and/or the BHA 33 may further include a drilling motor
(not shown) for rotating the drill bit. The BHA 33 may further include an instrumentation sub
(not shown), such as a measurement while drilling (MWD) and/or a logging while drilling
(LWD) sub.
[0027] An upper end of the drill string 5 may be connected to a quill of the top drive 13. The
top drive 13 may include a motor for rotating 4r the drill string 5. The top drive motor may be
electric or hydraulic. A frame of the top drive 13 may be coupled to a rail (not shown) of the
derrick 2 for preventing rotation of the top drive housing during rotation of the drill string 5 and
allowing for vertical movement of the top drive with a traveling block 14. The frame of the top
drive 13 may be suspended from the derrick 2 by the traveling block 14. The traveling block 14
may be supported by wire rope 15 connected at its upper end to a crown block 16. The wire
rope 15 may be woven through sheaves of the blocks 14, 16 and extend to drawworks 17 for
reeling thereof, thereby raising or lowering the traveling block 14 relative to the derrick 2.
[0028] Alternatively, the wellbore may be subsea having a wellhead located adjacent to the
waterline and the drilling rig may be a located on a platform adjacent the wellhead.
Alternatively, a Kelly and rotary table (not shown) may be used instead of the top drive.
[0029] The PCA lp may include a blow out preventer (BOP) 18, a rotating control device
(RCD) 19, a variable choke valve 20, a control station 21, a hydraulic power unit (HPU) 35h, a
hydraulic manifold 35m, one or more control lines 37o,c, and an isolation valve 50. A housing
of the BOP 18 may be connected to the wellhead 6, such as by a flanged connection. The BOP
housing may also be connected to a housing of the RCD 19, such as by a flanged connection.
The RCD 19 may include a stripper seal and the housing. The stripper seal may be supported for
rotation relative to the housing by bearings. The stripper seal-housing interface may be isolated
by seals. The stripper seal may form an interference fit with an outer surface of the drill string 5
and be directional for augmentation by wellbore pressure. The choke 20 may be connected to an

                                                   7
outlet of the RCD 19. The choke 20 may include a hydraulic actuator operated by a
programmable logic controller (PLC) 36 via a second hydraulic power unit (HPU) (not shown)
to maintain backpressure in the wellhead 6. Alternatively, the choke actuator may be electrical
or pneumatic.
[0030] The wellhead 6 may be mounted on an outer casing string 7 which has been deployed
into a wellbore 8 drilled from a surface 9 of the earth and cemented 10 into the wellbore. An
inner casing string 11 has been deployed into the wellbore 8, hung 9 from the wellhead 6, and
cemented 12 into place. The inner casing string 11 may extend to a depth adjacent a bottom of
an upper formation 22u. The upper formation 22u may be non-productive and a lower
formation 22b may be a hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir. Alternatively, the lower formation 22b
may be environmentally sensitive, such as an aquifer, or unstable. The inner casing string 11
may include a casing hanger 9, a plurality of casing joints connected together, such as by
threaded couplings, the isolation valve 50, and a guide shoe 23. The control lines 37o,c may be
fastened to the inner casing string 11 at regular intervals. The control lines 37o,c may be
bundled together as part of an umbilical.
[0031] The control station 21 may include a console 21c, a microcontroller (MCU) 21m, and a
display, such as a gauge 21g, in communication with the microcontroller 21m. The console 21c
may be in communication with the manifold 35m via an operation line and be in fluid
communication with the control lines 37o,c via respective pressure taps. The console 21c may
have controls for operation of the manifold 35m by the technician and have gauges for
displaying pressures in the respective control lines 37o,c for monitoring by the technician. The
control station 21 may further include a pressure sensor (not shown) in fluid communication
with the closing line 37c via a pressure tap and the MCU 21m may be in communication with
the pressure sensor to receive a pressure signal therefrom.
[0032] The fluid system If may include a mud pump 24, a drilling fluid reservoir, such as a pit
25 or tank, a degassing spool (not shown), a solids separator, such as a shale shaker 26, one or
more flow meters 27d,r, one or more pressure sensors 28d,r, a return line 29, and a supply line
30h,p. A first end of the return line 29 may be connected to the RCD outlet and a second end of
the return line may be connected to an inlet of the shaker 26. The returns pressure sensor 28r,
choke 20, and returns flow meter 27r may be assembled as part of the return line 29. A lower
end of the supply line 30p,h may be connected to an outlet of the mud pump 24 and an upper

                                                   8
end of the supply line may be connected to an inlet of the top drive 13. The supply pressure
sensor 28d and supply flow meter 27d may be assembled as part of the supply line 30p,h.
[0033] Each pressure sensor 28d,r may be in data communication with the PLC 36. The returns
pressure sensor 28r may be connected between the choke 20 and the RCD outlet port and may
be operable to monitor wellhead pressure. The supply pressure sensor 28d may be connected
between the mud pump 24 and a Kelly hose 30h of the supply line 30p,h and may be operable to
monitor standpipe pressure. The returns 27r flow meter may be a mass flow meter, such as a
Coriolis flow meter, and may each be in data communication with the PLC 36. The returns flow
meter 27r may be connected between the choke 20 and the shale shaker 26 and may be operable
to monitor a flow rate of drilling returns 31. The supply 27d flow meter may be a volumetric
flow meter, such as a Venturi flow meter, and may be in data communication with the PLC 36.
The supply flow meter 27d may be connected between the mud pump 24 and the Kelly hose 30h
and may be operable to monitor a flow rate of the mud pump. The PLC 36 may receive a
density measurement of drilling fluid 32 from a mud blender (not shown) to determine a mass
flow rate of the drilling fluid from the volumetric measurement of the supply flow meter 27d.
[0034] Alternatively, a stroke counter (not shown) may be used to monitor a flow rate of the
mud pump instead of the supply flow meter. Alternatively, the supply flow meter may be a
mass flow meter.
[0035] To extend the wellbore 8 from the casing shoe 23 into the lower formation 22b, the mud
pump 24 may pump the drilling fluid 32 from the pit 25, through standpipe 30p and Kelly hose
30h to the top drive 13. The drilling fluid 32 may include a base liquid. The base liquid may be
refined or synthetic oil, water, brine, or a water/oil emulsion. The drilling fluid 32 may further
include solids dissolved or suspended in the base liquid, such as organophilic clay, lignite,
and/or asphalt, thereby forming a mud.
[0036] Alternatively, the drilling fluid 32 may further include a gas, such as diatomic nitrogen
mixed with the base liquid, thereby forming a two-phase mixture. Alternatively, the drilling
fluid may be a gas, such as nitrogen, or gaseous, such as a mist or foam. If the drilling fluid 32
includes gas, the drilling system 1 may further include a nitrogen production unit (not shown)
operable to produce commercially pure nitrogen from air.

                                                   9
[0037] The drilling fluid 32 may flow from the supply line 30p,h and into the drill string 5 via
the top drive 13. The drilling fluid 32 may be pumped down through the drill string 5 and exit a
drill bit 33b, where the fluid may circulate the cuttings away from the bit and return the cuttings
up an annulus 34 formed between an inner surface of the inner casing 11 or wellbore 8 and an
outer surface of the drill string 10. The returns 31 (drilling fluid plus cuttings) may flow up the
annulus 34 to the wellhead 6 and be diverted by the RCD 19 into the RCD outlet. The returns
31 may continue through the choke 20 and the flow meter 27r. The returns 31 may then flow
into the shale shaker 26 and be processed thereby to remove the cuttings, thereby completing a
cycle. As the drilling fluid 32 and returns 31 circulate, the drill string 5 may be rotated 4r by the
top drive 13 and lowered 4a by the traveling block 14, thereby extending the wellbore 8 into the
lower formation 22b.
[0038] A static density of the drilling fluid 32 may correspond to a pore pressure gradient of the
lower formation 22b and the PLC 36 may operate the choke 20 such that an underbalanced,
balanced, or slightly overbalanced condition is maintained during drilling of the lower formation
22b. During the drilling operation, the PLC 36 may also perform a mass balance to ensure
control of the lower formation 22b. As the drilling fluid 32 is being pumped into the wellbore 8
by the mud pump 24 and the returns 31 are being received from the return line 29, the PLC 36
may compare the mass flow rates (i.e., drilling fluid flow rate minus returns flow rate) using the
respective flow meters 27d,r. The PLC 36 may use the mass balance to monitor for formation
fluid (not shown) entering the annulus 34 (some ingress may be tolerated for underbalanced
drilling) and contaminating the returns 31 or returns entering the formation 22b.
[0039] Upon detection of a kick or lost circulation, the PLC 36 may take remedial action, such
as diverting the flow of returns 31 from an outlet of the returns flow meter 27r to the degassing
spool. The degassing spool may include automated shutoff valves at each end, a mud-gas
separator (MGS), and a gas detector. A first end of the degassing spool may be connected to the
return line 29 between the returns flow meter 27r and the shaker 26 and a second end of the
degasser spool may be connected to an inlet of the shaker. The gas detector may include a probe
having a membrane for sampling gas from the returns 31, a gas chromatograph, and a carrier
system for delivering the gas sample to the chromatograph. The MGS may include an inlet and
a liquid outlet assembled as part of the degassing spool and a gas outlet connected to a flare or a
gas storage vessel. The PLC 36 may also adjust the choke 20 accordingly, such as tightening
the choke in response to a kick and loosening the choke in response to loss of the returns.

                                                 10
[0040] Figures 2A and 2B illustrate the isolation valve 50 in an open position. The isolation
valve 50 may include a tubular housing 51, an opener, such as flow sleeve 52, a piston 53, a
closure member, such as a flapper 54, and an abutment, such as a shoulder 59m. To facilitate
manufacturing and assembly, the housing 51 may include one or more sections 51 a-d each
connected together, such as fastened with threaded couplings and/or fasteners. The valve 50
may include a seal at each housing connection for sealing the respective connection. An upper
adapter 51 a and a lower adapter 51 d of the housing 51 may each have a threaded coupling
(Figures 3A and 4A), such as a pin or box, for connection to other members of the inner casing
string 11. The valve 50 may have a longitudinal bore therethrough for passage of the drill string
5.
[0041] The flow sleeve 52 may have a larger diameter upper portion 52u, a smaller diameter
lower portion 52b, and a mid portion 52m connecting the upper and lower portions. The flow
sleeve 52 may be disposed within the housing 51 and longitudinally connected thereto, such as
by entrapment of the upper portion 52u between a bottom of the upper adapter 51 a and a first
shoulder 55a formed in an inner surface of a body 5ib of the housing 51. The flow sleeve 52
may carry a seal for sealing the connection with the housing 51. The piston 53 may be
longitudinally movable relative to the housing 51. The piston 53 may include a head 53h and a
sleeve 53s longitudinally connected to the head, such as fastened with threaded couplings and/or
fasteners. The piston head 53h may carry one or more (three shown) seals for sealing interfaces
formed between: the head and the flow sleeve 52, the head and the piston sleeve 53s, and the
head and the body 5ib.
[0042] A hydraulic chamber 56h may be formed in an inner surface of the body 5ib. The
housing 51 may have second 55b and third 55c shoulders formed in an inner surface thereof and
the third shoulder may carry a seal for sealing an interface between the body 5 lb and the piston
sleeve 53s. The chamber 56h may be defined radially between the flow sleeve 52 and the body
5 lb and longitudinally between the second 55b and 55c third shoulders. Hydraulic fluid may be
disposed in the chamber 56h. Each end of the chamber 56h may be in fluid communication with
a respective hydraulic coupling 57o,c via a respective hydraulic passage 56o,c formed through a
wall of the body 5ib.
[0043] Figure 2D illustrates a hinge 58 of the isolation valve 50. The isolation valve 50 may
further include the hinge 58. The flapper 54 may be pivotally connected to the piston sleeve

                                                  11
53s, such as by the hinge 58. The hinge 58 may include one or more knuckles 58f formed at an
upper end of the flapper 54, one or more knuckles 58n formed at a bottom of the piston sleeve
53s, a fastener, such as hinge pin 58p, extending through holes of the knuckles, and a spring,
such as torsion spring 58s. The flapper 54 may pivot about the hinge 58 between an open
position (shown) and a closed position (Figure 4F). The flapper 54 may have an undercut
formed in at least a portion of an outer face thereof to facilitate pivoting between the positions
and ensuring that a seal is not unintentionally formed between the flapper and the shoulder 59m.
The torsion spring 58s may be wrapped around the hinge pin 58p and have ends in engagement
with the flapper 54 and the piston sleeve 53s so as to bias the flapper toward the closed position.
The piston sleeve 53s may also have a seat 53f formed at a bottom thereof. An inner periphery
of the flapper 54 may engage the seat 53f in the closed position, thereby isolating an upper
portion of the valve bore from a lower portion of the valve bore. The interface between the
flapper 54 and the seat 53f may be a metal to metal seal.
[0044] The flapper 54 may be opened and closed by longitudinal movement with the piston 53
and interaction with the flow sleeve 52. Upward movement of the piston 53 may engage the
flapper 54 with a bottom of the flow sleeve 52, thereby pushing the flapper 54 to the open
position and moving the flapper behind the flow sleeve for protection from the drill string 5.
Downward movement of the piston 53 may move the flapper 54 away from the flow sleeve 52
until the flapper is clear of the flow sleeve lower portion 52b, thereby allowing the torsion
spring 58s to close the flapper. In the closed position, the flapper 54 may fluidly isolate an
upper portion of the valve bore from a lower portion of the valve bore.
[0045] Figure 2C illustrates a linkage 60 of the isolation valve 50. The isolation valve 50 may
further include the linkage 60 and a lock sleeve 59. The lock sleeve 59 may have a larger
diameter upper portion 59u, a smaller diameter lower portion 59b, and the shoulder portion 59m
connecting the upper and lower portions. The lock sleeve 59 may interact with the housing 51
and the piston 53 via the linkage 60. A spring chamber 56s may also be formed in an inner
surface of the body 5ib. The linkage 60 may include one or more fasteners, such as pins 60p,
carried by the piston sleeve 53s adjacent a bottom of the piston sleeve 53s, a lip 60t formed in an
inner surface of the upper lock sleeve portion 59u adjacent a top thereof, and a linear spring 60s
disposed in the spring chamber 56s. An upper end of the linear spring 60s may be engaged with
the body 5 lb and a lower end of the linear spring may be engaged with the top of the lock sleeve

                                                  12
59 so as to bias the lock sleeve away from the body 5 1b and into engagement with the linkage
pin 60p.
[0046] Referring back to Figures 2A and 2B, the lock case 51c of the housing 51 may have a
landing profile 55d,e formed in a top thereof for receiving a lower face of the lock sleeve
shoulder 59m. The landing profile 55d,e may include a solid portion 55d and one or more
openings 55e. An upper face of the lock sleeve shoulder 59m may receive the closed flapper 54.
When the piston 53 is in an upper position (shown), the lock sleeve shoulder 59m may be
positioned adjacent the flow sleeve bottom, thereby forming a flapper chamber 56f between the
flow sleeve 52 and the lock sleeve upper portion 59u. The flapper chamber 56f may protect the
flapper 54 and the flapper seat 53f from being eroded and/or the linkage 60 fouled by cuttings in
the drilling returns 31. The flapper 54 may have a curved shape (Figure 4C) to conform to the
annular shape of the flapper chamber 56f and the flapper seat 53f may have a curved shape
(Figure 4E) complementary to the flapper curvature.
[0047] Figures 3A-3F illustrate closing of an upper portion of the isolation valve 50. Figures
4A-4F illustrate closing of a lower portion of the isolation valve 50. After drilling of the lower
formation 22b to total depth, the drill string 5 may be removed from the wellbore 8.
Alternatively, the drill string 5 may need to be removed for other reasons before reaching total
depth, such as for replacement of the drill bit 33b. The drill string 5 may be raised until the drill
bit 33b is above the flapper 54.
[0048] The technician may then operate the control station to supply pressurized hydraulic fluid
from an accumulator of the HPU 35h to an upper portion of the hydraulic chamber 53h and to
relieve hydraulic fluid from a lower portion of the hydraulic chamber 53h to a reservoir of the
HPU. The pressurized hydraulic fluid may flow from the manifold 35m through the wellhead 6
and into the wellbore via the closer line 37c. The pressurized hydraulic fluid may flow down
the closer line 37c and into the passage 56c via the hydraulic coupling 57c. The hydraulic fluid
may exit the passage 56c into the hydraulic chamber upper portion and exert pressure on an
upper face of the piston head 53h, thereby driving the piston 53 downwardly relative to the
housing 51. As the piston 53 begins to travel, hydraulic fluid displaced from the hydraulic
chamber lower portion may flow through the passage 56o and into the opener line 37o via the
hydraulic coupling 57o. The displaced hydraulic fluid may flow up the opener line 37o, through
the wellhead 6, and exit the opener line into the hydraulic manifold 35m.

                                                   13
[0049] As the piston 53 travels downwardly, the piston may push the flapper 54 downwardly
via the hinge pin 58p and the linkage spring 60s may push the lock sleeve 59 to follow the
piston. This collective downward movement of the piston 53, flapper 54, and lock sleeve 59
may continue until the flapper has at least partially cleared the flow sleeve 52. Once at least
partially free from the flow sleeve 52, the hinge spring 58s may begin closing the flapper 54.
The collective downward movement may continue as the lock sleeve shoulder 59m lands onto
the landing profile 55d,e. The landing profile opening 55e may prevent a seal from
unintentionally being formed between the lock sleeve 59 and the lock case 51c which may
otherwise obstruct opening of the flapper 54.
[0050] The linkage 60 may allow downward movement of the piston 53 and flapper 54 to
continue free from the lock sleeve 59. The downward movement of the piston 53 and flapper 54
may continue until the hinge 58 lands onto the upper face of the lock sleeve shoulder 53m.
Engagement of the hinge 58 with the lock sleeve 59 may prevent opening of the flapper 54 in
response to pressure in the upper portion of the valve bore being greater than pressure in the
lower portion of the valve bore, thereby allowing the flapper to bidirectionally isolate the upper
portion of the valve bore from the lower portion of the valve bore. This bidirectional isolation
may be accomplished using only the one seal interface between the flapper inner periphery and
the seat 53f
[0051] Once the hinge 58 has landed, the technician may operate the control station 21 to shut
in the closer line 37c or both of the control lines 37o,c, thereby hydraulically locking the piston
53 in place. Drilling fluid 32 may be circulated (or continue to be circulated) in an upper
portion of the wellbore 8 (above the lower flapper) to wash an upper portion of the isolation
valve 50. The RCD 19 may be deactivated or disconnected from the wellhead 6. The drill
string 5 may then be retrieved to the rig Ir.
[0052] Once circulation has been halted and/or the drill string 5 has been retrieved to the rig Ir,
pressure in the inner casing string 11 acting on an upper face of the flapper 54 may be reduced
relative to pressure in the inner casing string acting on a lower face of the flapper, thereby
creating a net upward force on the flapper which is transferred to the piston 53. The upward
force may be resisted by fluid pressure generated by the incompressible hydraulic fluid in the
closer line 37c. The MCU 21m may be programmed with a correlation between the calculated
delta pressure and the pressure differential 64u,b across the flapper 54. The MCU 21m may

                                                  14
then convert the delta pressure to a pressure differential across the flapper 54 using the
correlation. The MCU 21m may then output the converted pressure differential to the gauge
21 g for monitoring by the technician.
[0053] The correlation may be determined theoretically using parameters, such as geometry of
the flapper 54, geometry of the seat 53f, and material properties thereof, to construct a computer
model, such as a finite element and/or finite difference model, of the isolation valve 50 and then
a simulation may be performed using the model to derive a formula. The model may or may not
be empirically adjusted.
[0054] The control station 21 may further include an alarm (not shown) operable by the MCU
21m for alerting the technician, such as a visual and/or audible alarm. The technician may enter
one or more alarm set points into the control station 21 and the MCU 21m may alert the
technician should the converted pressure differential violate one of the set points. A maximum
set point may be a design pressure of the flapper 54.
[0055] If total depth has not been reached, the drill bit 33b may be replaced and the drill string 5
may be redeployed into the wellbore 8. Due to the bidirectional isolation by the valve 50, the
drill string 5 may be tripped without concern of momentarily opening the flapper 54 by
generating excessive surge pressure. Pressure in the upper portion of the wellbore 8 may be
equalized with pressure in the lower portion of the wellbore 8 and equalization may be
confirmed using the gauge 21g. The technician may then operate the control station 21 to
supply pressurized hydraulic fluid to the opener line 37o while relieving the closer line 37c,
thereby opening the isolation valve 50. Drilling may then resume. In this manner, the lower
formation 22b may remain live during tripping due to isolation from the upper portion of the
wellbore by the closed flapper 54, thereby obviating the need to kill the lower formation 22b.
[0056] Once drilling has reached total depth, the drill string 5 may be retrieved to the drilling rig
Ir as discussed above. A liner string (not shown) may then be deployed into the wellbore 8
using a work string (not shown). The liner string and workstring may be deployed into the live
wellbore 8 using the isolation valve 50, as discussed above for the drill string 5. Once deployed,
the liner string may be set in the wellbore 8 using the workstring. The work string may then be
retrieved from the wellbore 8 using the isolation valve 50 as discussed above for the drill string
5.   The PCA lp may then be removed from the wellhead 6. A production tubing string (not

                                                  15
shown) may be deployed into the wellbore 8 and a production tree (not shown) may then be
installed on the wellhead 6. Hydrocarbons (not shown) produced from the lower formation 22b
may enter a bore of the liner, travel through the liner bore, and enter a bore of the production
tubing for transport to the surface 9.
[0057] Alternatively, the piston sleeve knuckles 58n and flapper seat 53f may be formed in a
separate member (see cap 91) connected to a bottom of the piston sleeve 53s, such as fastened
by threaded couplings and/or fasteners. Alternatively, the flapper undercut may be omitted.
Alternatively, the lock sleeve 59 may be omitted and the landing profile 55d,e of the housing 51
may serve as the abutment.
[0058] Figures 5A-5C illustrate a modified isolation valve 50a having an abutment 78 for
peripheral support of the flapper 54, according to another embodiment of the present disclosure.
The isolation valve 50a may include the housing 51, the flow sleeve 52, the piston 53, the
flapper 54, the hinge 58, a linear guide 74, a lock sleeve 79, and the abutment 78. The lock
sleeve 79 may be identical to the lock sleeve 59 except for having a part of the linear guide 74
and having a socket formed in an upper face of the shoulder 79m for connection to the abutment
78. The linear guide 74 may include a profile, such as a slot 74g, formed in an inner surface of
the lock sleeve upper portion 79u, a follower, such as the pin 60p, and a stop 74t formed at
upper end of the lock sleeve upper portion 70u. Extension of the pin 60p into the slot 74g may
torsionally connect the lock sleeve 70 and the piston 53 while allowing limited longitudinal
movement therebetween.
[0059] The abutment 78 may be a ring connected to the lock sleeve 79, such as by having a
passage receiving a fastener engaged with the shoulder socket. The abutment 78 may have a
flapper support 78f formed in an upper face thereof for receiving an outer periphery of the
flapper 54 and a hinge pocket 78h formed in the upper face for receiving the hinge 60. The
flapper support 78f may have a curved shape (Figure 5A) complementary to the flapper
curvature. An upper portion of the abutment 78 may have one or more notches formed therein
to prevent a seal from unintentionally being formed between the abutment and the flapper 54
which may otherwise obstruct opening of the flapper 54. Outer peripheral support of the flapper
54 may increase the pressure capability of the valve 50a against a downward pressure
differential (pressure in upper portion of the wellbore greater than pressure in a lower portion of
the wellbore).

                                                  16
[0060] Alternatively, the abutment notches may be omitted such that the (modified) abutment
may serve as a backseat for sealing engagement with the flapper 54. Alternatively, the lock
sleeve 79 may be omitted and the abutment 78 may instead be connected to the lock case 51 c.
[0061] Figures 6A-6C illustrate a modified isolation valve 50b having a tapered flow sleeve 72
to resist opening of the valve, according to another embodiment of the present disclosure. The
isolation valve 50b may include the housing 51, the flow sleeve 72, a piston 73, the linear guide
74, a second linear guide 71b,g, the flapper 54, the hinge 60, and an abutment 70b. The flow
sleeve 72 may be identical to the flow sleeve 52 except for having a profile, such as a taper 72e,
formed in a bottom of the lower portion 72b and having part of the second linear guide 71b,g.
The piston 73 may be identical to the piston 53 except for having part of the second linear guide
71b,g. The lock sleeve 70 may be identical to the lock sleeve 79 except for having a modified
shoulder portion 70m. The shoulder portion 70m may have a taper 70s and the abutment 70b
formed in an upper face thereof for receiving the flapper 54. The second linear guide 71b,g may
include a profile, such as a slot 71g, formed in an inner surface of the piston sleeve 73s, and a
follower, such as a threaded fastener 71b, having a shaft portion extending through a socket
formed through a wall of the flow sleeve mid portion 72m. Extension of the fastener shaft into
the slot 71 g may torsionally connect the flow sleeve 72 and the piston 73 while allowing limited
longitudinal movement therebetween.
[0062] The tapered flow sleeve 72 may serve as a safeguard against unintentional opening of the
valve 50b should the control lines 37o,c fail. The tapered flow sleeve 72 may be oriented such
that the flapper 54 contacts the flow sleeve at a location adjacent the hinge 58, thereby reducing
a lever length of an opening force exerted by the flow sleeve onto the flapper. The linear guides
71b,g, 74 may ensure that alignment of the flow sleeve 72, flapper 54, and lock sleeve 59 is
maintained. The lock sleeve shoulder taper 70s may be complementary to the flow sleeve taper
72e for adjacent positioning when the valve 50b is in the open position. A portion of the flapper
54 distal from the hinge 58 may seat against the abutment 70b for bidirectional support of the
flapper 54.
[0063] Alternatively, the abutment 70b may be a separate piece connected to the lock sleeve 72
and having the taper 72e formed in an upper portion thereof.

                                                  17
[0064] Figure 6D illustrates a modified isolation valve 50c having a latch 77 for restraining the
valve in the closed position, according to another embodiment of the present disclosure. The
isolation valve 50c may include a tubular housing 76, the flow sleeve 52, the piston 53, the
flapper 54, the hinge 58, the abutment shoulder 59m, the linkage 60, and the latch 77. The
housing 76 may be identical to the housing 51 except for the replacement of lock case 76c for
lock case 51c. The lock case 76c may be identical to the lock case 51c except for the inclusion
of a recess having a shoulder 77s for receiving a collet 77b,f. The lock sleeve 75 may be
identical to the lock sleeve 59 except for the inclusion of a latch profile, such as groove 77g.
[0065] The latch 77 may include the collet 77b,f, the groove 77g, and the recess formed in the
lock case 71c. The collet 77b,f may be connected to the housing, such as by entrapment
between a top of the lower adapter 51d and the recess shoulder 77s. The collet 77b,f may
include a base ring 77b and a plurality (only one shown) of split fingers 77f extending
longitudinally from the base. The fingers 77f may have lugs formed at an end distal from the
base 77b. The fingers 77f may be cantilevered from the base 77b and have a stiffness biasing
the fingers toward an engaged position (shown). As the valve 50c is being closed the finger lugs
may snap into the groove 77g, thereby longitudinally fastening the lock sleeve 75 to the housing
76. The latch 73 may serve as a safeguard against unintentional opening of the valve 50c should
the control lines 37o,c fail. The latch 73 may include sufficient play so as to accommodate
determination of the differential pressure across the flapper 54 by monitoring pressure in the
closer line 37c, discussed above.
[0066] Alternatively, any of the other isolation valves 50b,d-g may be modified to include the
latch 77. Alternatively, the piston sleeve knuckles 58n and flapper seat 53f may be formed in a
separate member (see cap 91) connected to a bottom of the piston sleeve 53s, such as fastened
by threaded couplings and/or fasteners. Alternatively, the flapper undercut may be omitted.
[0067] Figure 6E illustrates another modified isolation valve 50d having a latch 82 for
restraining the valve in the closed position, according to another embodiment of the present
disclosure. The isolation valve 50d may include a tubular housing 81, the flow sleeve 52, a
piston 83, the flapper 54, the hinge 58, the abutment shoulder 59m, the linkage 60, the lock
sleeve 59, and the latch 82. The housing 81 may be identical to the housing 51 except for the
replacement of body 81b for body 51b. The body 81b may be identical to the body 51b except

                                                   18
for the inclusion of a latch profile, such as groove 82g. The piston 83 may be identical to the
piston 53 except for the sleeve 83s having a shouldered recess 82r for receiving a collet 82b,f.
[0068] The latch 82 may include the collet 82b,f, the groove 82g, the shouldered recess 82r, and
a latch spring 82s. The collet 82b,f may include a base ring 82b and a plurality (only one
shown) of split fingers 82f extending longitudinally from the base. The collet 82b,f may be
connected to the piston 83, such as by fastening of the base 82b to the piston sleeve 83s. The
fingers 82f may have lugs formed at an end distal from the base 82b. The fingers 82f may be
cantilevered from the base 82b and have a stiffness biasing the fingers toward an engaged
position (shown). The latch spring 82s may be disposed in a chamber formed between the lock
sleeve 59 and the lock case 51c. The latch spring 82s may be compact, such as a Belleville
spring, such that the spring only engages the lock sleeve shoulder 59m when the lock sleeve
shoulder is adjacent to the profile 55d,e. As the valve 50d is being closed and after closing of
the flapper 54, the lock sleeve shoulder 59m may engage and compress the latch spring 82s.
The finger lugs may then snap into the groove 82g, thereby longitudinally fastening the piston
82 to the housing 81. The finger stiffness may generate a latching force substantially greater
than a separation force generated by compression of the latch spring, thereby preloading the
latch 82. The latch 82 may serve as a safeguard against unintentional opening of the valve 50d
should the control lines 37o,c fail. The latch 82 may include sufficient play so as to
accommodate determination of the differential pressure across the flapper 54 by monitoring
pressure in the closer line 37c, discussed above.
[0069] Alternatively, the lock sleeve 70 may be omitted and the landing profile 55d,e of the
housing 51 may serve as the abutment. Alternatively, any of the other isolation valves 50b,c,e-g
may be modified to include the latch 82. Alternatively, the piston sleeve knuckles 58n and
flapper seat 53f may be formed in a separate member (see cap 91) connected to a bottom of the
piston sleeve 53s, such as fastened by threaded couplings and/or fasteners. Alternatively, the
flapper undercut may be omitted.
[0070] Figures 7A and 7B illustrate another modified isolation valve 50e having an articulating
flapper joint, according to another embodiment of the present disclosure. The isolation valve
50e may include the housing 51, the flow sleeve 52, a piston 93, a flapper 94, the linear guide
74, the lock sleeve 79, the articulating joint, such as a slide hinge 92, and an abutment 98. The
piston 93 may be longitudinally movable relative to the housing 51. The piston 93 may include

                                                   19
the head 53h and a sleeve 93s longitudinally connected to the head, such as fastened with
threaded couplings and/or fasteners.
[0071] The abutment 98 may be a ring connected to the lock sleeve 79, such as by having a
passage receiving a fastener engaged with the shoulder socket. The abutment 98 may have a
flapper support 98f formed in an upper face thereof for receiving an outer periphery of the
flapper 94 and a kickoff pocket 98k formed in the upper face for assisting the slide hinge in
closing of the flapper 94. The flapper support 98f may have a curved shape (Figure 7A)
complementary to the flapper curvature. The kickoff pocket 98k may form a guide profile to
receive a lower end of the flapper 94 and radially push the flapper lower end into the valve bore
(Figure 7A).
[0072] Figure 7C illustrates the slide hinge 92 of the modified valve 50e. The slide hinge 92
may link the flapper 94 to the piston 93 such that the flapper may be carried by the piston while
being able to articulate (pivot and slide) relative to the piston between the open (shown) and
closed (Figure 7B) positions. The slide hinge 92 may include a cap 91, a slider 95, one or more
flapper springs 96, 97 (pair of each shown), and a slider spring 92s. The piston sleeve 93s may
have a recess formed in an outer surface thereof adjacent the bottom of the piston sleeve for
receiving the slider 95 and slider spring 92s. The slider spring 92s may be disposed between a
top of the slider 95 and a top of the sleeve recess, thereby biasing the slider away from the
piston sleeve 93s.
[0073] The cap 91 may have a seat 91f formed at a bottom thereof. An inner periphery of the
flapper 94 may engage the seat 91f in the closed position, thereby isolating an upper portion of
the valve bore from a lower portion of the valve bore. The slider 95 may have a leaf portion 95f
and one or more knuckle portions 95n. The flapper 94 may be pivotally connected to the slider
95, such as by a knuckle 92f formed at an upper end of the flapper 94 and a fastener, such as
hinge pin 92p, extending through holes of the knuckles 92f, 95n. The cap 91 may be
longitudinally and torsionally connected to a bottom of the piston sleeve 93s, such as fastened
with threaded couplings and/or fasteners. The slider 95 may be linked to the cap 91, such as by
one or more (three shown) fasteners 92w extending through respective slots 95s formed through
the slider and being received by respective sockets (not shown) formed in the cap. The fastener
slot linkage 92w, 95s may torsionally connect the slider 95 and the cap 91 and longitudinally
connect the slider and cap subject to limited longitudinal freedom afforded by the slot.

                                                  20
[0074] The flapper 94 may be biased toward the closed position by the flapper springs 96, 97.
The springs 96, 97 may be linear and may each include a respective main portion 96a, 97a and
an extension 96b, 97b. The cap 91 may have slots formed therethrough for receiving the main
portions 96b, 97b. An upper end of the main portions 96b, 97b may be connected to the cap 91
at a top of the slots. The cap 91 may also have a guide path formed in an outer surface thereof
for passage of the extensions 96b, 97b to the flapper 94. Lower ends of the extensions 96b, 97b
may be connected to an inner face of the flapper 94. The flapper springs 96, 97 may exert
tensile force on the flapper inner face, thereby pulling the flapper 94 toward the seat 91 f about
the hinge pin 92p. The kickoff profile 92p may assist the flapper springs 96, 97 in closing the
flapper 94 due to the reduced lever arm of the spring tension when the flapper is in the open
position.
[0075] Alternatively, the flapper support 98f may be omitted and the kickoff profile 98k may
instead be formed around the abutment 98 and additionally serve as the flapper support.
Alternatively, the lock sleeve 79 may be omitted and the abutment 98 may instead be connected
to the lock case 51c. Alternatively, the flapper 94 may be undercut. Alternatively, a polymer
seal ring may be disposed in a groove formed in the flapper seat 91f (see Figure 12 of U.S. Pat.
No. 8,261,836, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) such that the interface
between the flapper inner periphery and the seat 91 f is a hybrid polymer and metal to metal seal.
Alternatively, the seal ring may be disposed in the flapper inner periphery.
[0076] Figures 8A-8C illustrate another modified isolation valve 50f having a combined
abutment 87f and kickoff profile 87k, according to another embodiment of the present
disclosure. The isolation valve 50f may include a tubular housing 86, the flow sleeve 52, the
piston 93, the flapper 94, a chamber sleeve 89, the slide hinge 92, the kickoff profile 87k, and
the abutment 87f. The housing 86 may be identical to the housing 51 except for the replacement
of lock case 86c for lock case 51c and modified lower adapter (not shown) for lower adapter
51d. The lock case 86c may be identical to the lock case 51c except for the inclusion of a guide
profile 86r. The chamber sleeve 89 may be may have a shouldered recess 82r for receiving a
collet 88.
[0077] The collet 88 may include a base ring 88b and a plurality of split fingers 87 extending
longitudinally from the base. The collet 88 may be connected to the chamber sleeve 89, such as
by fastening of the base 82b thereto. The fingers 87 may each have a shank portion 87s and a

                                                   21
lug 87fk,g, formed at an end of the shank portion 87s distal from the base 88b. The shanks 87s
may each be cantilevered from the base 88b and have a stiffness biasing the lug 87fk,g toward
an expanded position (Figures 8A and 8B). The abutment 87f may be formed in a top of the
lugs 87fk,s, the kickoff profile 87k may be formed in an inner surface of the lugs, and a sleeve
receiver 87g may also be formed in an inner surface of the lugs. A sleeve spring 85 may be
disposed in the guide profile 86r between the lock case 86c and the base ring 88b, thereby
biasing the chamber sleeve 89 toward the flow sleeve 52. The sleeve spring 85 may be compact,
such as a Belleville spring, and be capable of compressing to a solid position (Figure 8C). As
the valve 50f is being closed, the flapper 94 may push the collet 88 and chamber sleeve 89
downward. Once the flapper 94 clears the flow sleeve 52, the kickoff profile 87k may radially
push the flapper lower end into the valve bore. Once the flapper 94 has closed, the knuckles
92f, 95n may continue to push the collet 88 and chamber sleeve 89 until the collet is forced into
the guide profile 86r, thereby retracting the collet into a compressed position (Figure 8C) and
engaging the abutment 87f with a central portion of the flapper outer surface.
[0078] Alternatively, the flapper 94 may be undercut. Alternatively, the interface between the
flapper inner periphery and the seat 91 f is a hybrid polymer and metal to metal seal.
Alternatively, the seal ring may be disposed in the flapper inner periphery. Alternatively, collet
fingers 87 may have a curved shape complementary to the flapper curvature.
[0079] Figures 9A-9D illustrate operation of an offshore drilling system 101 in a tripping mode,
according to another embodiment of the present disclosure. The offshore drilling system 101
may include a mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) 101m, such as a semi-submersible, the
drilling rig Ir, a fluid handling system 10 1f, a fluid transport system 10 1t, and a pressure control
assembly (PCA) 101p.
[0080] The MODU 101m may carry the drilling rig Ir and the fluid handling system 101f
aboard and may include a moon pool, through which drilling operations are conducted. The
semi-submersible MODU 101m may include a lower barge hull which floats below a surface
(aka waterline) 102s of sea 102 and is, therefore, less subject to surface wave action. Stability
columns (only one shown) may be mounted on the lower barge hull for supporting an upper hull
above the waterline. The upper hull may have one or more decks for carrying the drilling rig Ir
and fluid handling system 101 h. The MODU 101 m may further have a dynamic positioning
system (DPS) (not shown) or be moored for maintaining the moon pool in position over a

                                                 22
subsea wellhead 110. The drilling rig Ir may further include a drill string compensator (not
shown) to account for heave of the MODU 101m. The drill string compensator may be disposed
between the traveling block 14 and the top drive 13 (aka hook mounted) or between the crown
block 16 and the derrick 2 (aka top mounted).
[0081] Alternatively, the MODU may be a drill ship. Alternatively, a fixed offshore drilling
unit or a non-mobile floating offshore drilling unit may be used instead of the MODU.
[0082] The fluid transport system 101t may include a drill string 105, an upper marine riser
package (UMRP) 120, a marine riser 125, a booster line 127, and a choke line 128. The drill
string 105 may include a BHA and the drill pipe 5p. The BHA may be connected to the drill
pipe 5p, such as by threaded couplings, and include the drill bit 33b, the drill collars 33c, a
shifting tool 150, and a ball catcher (not shown).
[0083] The PCA 101p may be connected to the wellhead 110 located adjacent to a floor 102f of
the sea 102. A conductor string 107 may be driven into the seafloor 102f. The conductor string
107 may include a housing and joints of conductor pipe connected together, such as by threaded
couplings. Once the conductor string 107 has been set, a subsea wellbore 108 may be drilled
into the seafloor 102f and a casing string 111 may be deployed into the wellbore. The wellhead
housing may land in the conductor housing during deployment of the casing string 111. The
casing string 111 may be cemented 112 into the wellbore 108. The casing string 111 may
extend to a depth adjacent a bottom of the upper formation 22u.
[0084] The casing string 111 may include a wellhead housing, joints of casing connected
together, such as by threaded couplings, and an isolation assembly 200o,c, 50g connected to the
casing joints, such as by threaded couplings. The isolation assembly 200o,c, 50g may include
one or more power subs, such as an opener 200o and a closer 200c, and an isolation valve 50g.
The isolation assembly 200o,c, 50g may further include a spacer sub (not shown) disposed
between the closer 200c and the isolation valve 50g and/or between the opener 200o and the
closer. The power subs 200o,c may be hydraulically connected to the isolation valve 50g in a
three-way configuration such that operation of one of the power subs 200o,c will operate the
isolation valve 50g between the open and closed positions and alternate the other power sub
200o,c. This three way configuration may allow each power sub 200o,c to be operated in only
one rotational direction and each power sub to only open or close the isolation valve 50g.

                                                  23
Respective hydraulic couplings (not shown) of each power sub 200o,c and the hydraulic
couplings 57o,c of the isolation valve 50g may be connected by respective conduits 245a-c, such
as tubing.
 [0085] The PCA 101p may include a wellhead adapter 40b, one or more flow crosses 41u,m,b,
one or more blow out preventers (BOPs) 42a,u,b, a lower marine riser package (LMRP), one or
more accumulators 44, and a receiver 46. The LMRP may include a control pod 116, a flex
joint 43, and a connector 40u. The wellhead adapter 40b, flow crosses 41u,m,b, BOPs 42a,u,b,
receiver 46, connector 40u, and flex joint 43, may each include a housing having a longitudinal
bore therethrough and may each be connected, such as by flanges, such that a continuous bore is
maintained therethrough. The bore may have drift diameter, corresponding to a drift diameter of
the wellhead 110.
 [0086] Each of the connector 40u and wellhead adapter 40b may include one or more fasteners,
such as dogs, for fastening the LMRP to the BOPs 42a,u,b and the PCA lp to an external profile
of the wellhead housing, respectively. Each of the connector 40u and wellhead adapter 40b may
further include a seal sleeve for engaging an internal profile of the respective receiver 46 and
wellhead housing. Each of the connector 40u and wellhead adapter 40b may be in electric or
hydraulic communication with the control pod 116 and/or further include an electric or
hydraulic actuator and an interface, such as a hot stab, so that a remotely operated subsea
vehicle (ROV) (not shown) may operate the actuator for engaging the dogs with the external
profile.
 [0087] The LMRP may receive a lower end of the riser 125 and connect the riser to the PCA
 101p. The control pod 116 may be in electric, hydraulic, and/or optical communication with the
PLC 36 onboard the MODU 101m via an umbilical 117. The control pod 116 may include one
or more control valves (not shown) in communication with the BOPs 42a,u,b for operation
thereof. Each control valve may include an electric or hydraulic actuator in communication with
the umbilical 117. The umbilical 117 may include one or more hydraulic or electric control
conduit/cables for the actuators. The accumulators 44 may store pressurized hydraulic fluid for
operating the BOPs 42a,u,b. Additionally, the accumulators 44 may be used for operating one
or more of the other components of the PCA 101p. The umbilical 117 may further include
hydraulic, electric, and/or optic control conduit/cables for operating various functions of the

                                                  24
PCA 101p. The PLC 36 may operate the PCA 101p via the umbilical 117 and the control pod
 116.
 [0088] A lower end of the booster line 127 may be connected to a branch of the flow cross 41u
by a shutoff valve 45a. A booster manifold may also connect to the booster line lower end and
have a prong connected to a respective branch of each flow cross 41m,b. Shutoff valves 45b,c
may be disposed in respective prongs of the booster manifold. Alternatively, a separate kill line
(not shown) may be connected to the branches of the flow crosses 41m,b instead of the booster
manifold. An upper end of the booster line 127 may be connected to an outlet of a booster
pump (not shown). A lower end of the choke line 128 may have prongs connected to respective
second branches of the flow crosses 41m,b. Shutoff valves 45d,e may be disposed in respective
prongs of the choke line lower end.
 [0089] A pressure sensor 47a may be connected to a second branch of the upper flow cross 41u.
Pressure sensors 47b,c may be connected to the choke line prongs between respective shutoff
valves 45d,e and respective flow cross second branches. Each pressure sensor 47a-c may be in
data communication with the control pod 116. The lines 127, 128 and umbilical 117 may
extend between the MODU Im and the PCA lp by being fastened to brackets disposed along
the riser 125. Each line 127, 128 may be a flow conduit, such as coiled tubing. Each shutoff
valve 45a-e may be automated and have a hydraulic actuator (not shown) operable by the
control pod 116 via fluid communication with a respective umbilical conduit or the LMRP
accumulators 44. Alternatively, the valve actuators may be electrical or pneumatic.
 [0090] The riser 125 may extend from the PCA 101p to the MODU 101m and may connect to
the MODU via the UMRP 120. The UMRP 120 may include a diverter 121, a flex joint 122, a
slip (aka telescopic) joint 123, a tensioner 124, and an RCD 126. A lower end of the RCD 126
may be connected to an upper end of the riser 125, such as by a flanged connection. The slip
joint 123 may include an outer barrel connected to an upper end of the RCD 126, such as by a
flanged connection, and an inner barrel connected to the flex joint 122, such as by a flanged
connection. The outer barrel may also be connected to the tensioner 124, such as by a tensioner
ring (not shown).
 [0091] The flex joint 122 may also connect to the diverter 121, such as by a flanged connection.
The diverter 121 may also be connected to the rig floor 3, such as by a bracket. The slip joint

                                                   25
 123 may be operable to extend and retract in response to heave of the MODU 101m relative to
the riser 125 while the tensioner 124 may reel wire rope in response to the heave, thereby
supporting the riser 125 from the MODU 101m while accommodating the heave. The flex
joints 123, 43 may accommodate respective horizontal and/or rotational (aka pitch and roll)
movement of the MODU 101m relative to the riser 125 and the riser relative to the PCA 101p.
The riser 125 may have one or more buoyancy modules (not shown) disposed therealong to
reduce load on the tensioner 124.
 [0092] The RCD 126 may include a housing, a piston, a latch, and a bearing assembly. The
housing may be tubular and have one or more sections connected together, such as by flanged
connections. The bearing assembly may include a bearing pack, a housing seal assembly, one or
more strippers, and a catch sleeve. The bearing assembly may be selectively longitudinally and
torsionally connected to the housing by engagement of the latch with the catch sleeve. The
housing may have hydraulic ports in fluid communication with the piston and an interface of the
RCD 126. The bearing pack may support the strippers from the sleeve such that the strippers
may rotate relative to the housing (and the sleeve). The bearing pack may include one or more
radial bearings, one or more thrust bearings, and a self contained lubricant system. The bearing
pack may be disposed between the strippers and be housed in and connected to the catch sleeve,
such as by threaded couplings and/or fasteners.
 [0093] Each stripper may include a gland or retainer and a seal. Each stripper seal may be
directional and oriented to seal against the drill pipe 5p in response to higher pressure in the riser
 125 than the UMRP 120. Each stripper seal may have a conical shape for fluid pressure to act
against a respective tapered surface thereof, thereby generating sealing pressure against the drill
pipe 5p. Each stripper seal may have an inner diameter slightly less than a pipe diameter of the
drill pipe 5p to form an interference fit therebetween. Each stripper seal may be flexible enough
to accommodate and seal against threaded couplings of the drill pipe 5p having a larger tool
joint diameter. The drill pipe 5p may be received through a bore of the bearing assembly so that
the stripper seals may engage the drill pipe. The stripper seals may provide a desired barrier in
the riser 125 either when the drill pipe 5p is stationary or rotating. The RCD 126 may be
submerged adjacent the waterline 102s. The RCD interface may be in fluid communication with
an auxiliary hydraulic power unit (HPU) (not shown) of the PLC 36 via an auxiliary umbilical
 118.

                                                 26
[0094] Alternatively, an active seal RCD may be used. Alternatively, the RCD may be located
above the waterline and/or along the UMRP at any other location besides a lower end thereof.
Alternatively, the RCD may be assembled as part of the riser at any location therealong or as
part of the PCA. Alternatively, the riser 125 and UMRP 120 may be omitted. Alternatively, the
auxiliary umbilical may be in communication with a control console (not shown) instead of the
PLC 36.
[0095] The fluid handling system 10If may include a return line 129, the mud pump 24, the
shale shaker 33, the flow meters 27d,r, the pressure sensors 28d,r, the choke 20, the supply line
30p,h, the degassing spool (not shown), a drilling fluid reservoir, such as a tank 25, a tag reader
132, and one or more launchers, such as tag launcher 13 It and ball launcher 13 lb. A lower end
of the return line 129 may be connected to an outlet of the RCD 126 and an upper end of the
return line may be connected to an inlet of the shaker 26. The returns pressure sensor 28r, choke
20, returns flow meter 27r, and tag reader 132 may be assembled as part of the return line 129.
A transfer line 130 may connect an outlet of the tank 25 to an inlet of the mud pump 24.
[0096] Each launcher 131b,t may be assembled as part of the drilling fluid supply line 30p,h.
Each launcher 13 1b,t may include a housing, a plunger, and an actuator. The tag launcher 13 It
may further include a magazine (not shown) having a plurality of radio frequency identification
(RFID) tags loaded therein. A chambered RFID tag 290 may be disposed in the plunger for
selective release and pumping downhole to communicate with one or more sensor subs 282u,b.
The plunger of each launcher 13 lb,t may be movable relative to the respective launcher
housing between a capture position and a release position. The plunger may be moved between
the positions by the actuator. The actuator may be hydraulic, such as a piston and cylinder
assembly and may be in communication with the PLC HPU. Alternatively, the actuator may be
electric or pneumatic.
[0097] Alternatively, the actuator may be manual, such as a handwheel. Alternatively, the tags
290 may be any other kind of wireless identification tags, such as acoustic.
[0098] Referring specifically to Figures 9C and 9D, each power sub 200o,c may include a
tubular housing 205, a tubular mandrel 210, a release sleeve 215, a release piston 220, a control
valve 225, hydraulic circuit, and a pump 250. The housing 205 may have couplings (not shown)
formed at each longitudinal end thereof for connection between the power subs 200o,c, with the

                                                 27
spacer sub, or with other components of the casing string 111. The couplings may be threaded,
such as a box and a pin. The housing 205 may have a central longitudinal bore formed
therethrough. The housing 205 may include two or more sections (only one section shown) to
facilitate manufacturing and assembly, each section connected together, such as fastened with
threaded connections.
[0099] The mandrel 210 may be disposed within the housing 205, longitudinally connected
thereto, and rotatable relative thereto. The mandrel 210 may have a profile 210p formed
through a wall thereof for receiving a respective driver 180 and release 175 of the shifting tool
150. The mandrel profile 210p may be a series of slots spaced around the mandrel inner surface.
The mandrel slots may have a length equal to, greater than, or substantially greater than a length
of a ribbed portion 155 of the shifting tool 150 to provide an engagement tolerance and/or to
compensate for heave of the drill string 105 for subsea drilling operations.
[0100] The release piston 220 may be tubular and have a shoulder (not shown) disposed in a
chamber (not shown) formed in the housing 205 between an upper shoulder (not shown) of the
housing and a lower shoulder (not shown) of the housing. The chamber may be defined radially
between the release piston 220 and the housing 205 and longitudinally between an upper seal
disposed between the housing 205 and the release piston 220 proximate the upper shoulder and a
lower seal disposed between the housing and the release piston proximate the lower shoulder. A
piston seal may also be disposed between the release piston shoulder and the housing 205.
Hydraulic fluid may be disposed in the chamber. A second hydraulic passage 235 formed in the
housing 205, may selectively provide (discussed below) fluid communication between the
chamber and a hydraulic reservoir 23 1r formed in the housing.
[0101] The release piston 220 may be longitudinally connected to the release sleeve 215, such
as by bearing 217, so that the release sleeve may rotate relative to the release piston. The
release sleeve 215 may be operably coupled to the mandrel 210 by a cam profile (not shown)
and one or more followers (not shown). The cam profile may be formed in an inner surface of
the release sleeve 215 and the follower may be fastened to the mandrel 210 and extend from the
mandrel outer surface into the profile or vice versa. The cam profile may repeatedly extend
around the sleeve inner surface so that the cam follower continuously travels along the profile as
the sleeve 215 is moved longitudinally relative to the mandrel 210 by the release piston 220.

                                                  28
[0102] Engagement of the cam follower with the cam profile may rotationally connect the
mandrel 210 and the sleeve 215 when the cam follower is in a straight portion of the cam profile
and cause limited relative rotation between the mandrel and the sleeve as the follower travels
through a curved portion of the profile. The cam profile may be a V-slot. The release sleeve
215 may have a release profile 215p formed through a wall thereof for receiving the shifting tool
release 175. The release profile 215p may be a series of slots spaced around the sleeve inner
surface. The release slots may correspond to the mandrel slots. The release slots may be
oriented relative to the cam profile so that the release slots are aligned with the mandrel slots
when the cam follower is at a bottom of the V-slot and misaligned when the cam follower is at
any other location of the V-slot (covering the mandrel slots with the sleeve wall).
[0103] The control valve 225 may be tubular and be disposed in the housing chamber. The
control valve 225 may be longitudinally movable relative to the housing 205 between a lower
position and an upper position. The control valve 225 may have an upper shoulder (not shown)
and a lower shoulder (not shown) connected by a control sleeve (not shown) and a latch (not
shown) extending from the lower shoulder. The control valve 225 may also have a port (not
shown) formed through the control sleeve. The upper shoulder may carry a pair of seals in
engagement with the housing 205. In the lower position, the seals may straddle a hydraulic port
236 formed in the housing 205 and in fluid communication with a first hydraulic passage 234
formed in the housing 205, thereby preventing fluid communication between the hydraulic
passage and an upper face of the release piston shoulder.
[0104] In the lower position, the upper shoulder 225u may also expose another hydraulic port
(not shown) formed in the housing 205 and in fluid communication with the second hydraulic
passage 235. The port may provide fluid communication between the second hydraulic passage
235 and the upper face of the release piston shoulder via a passage formed between an inner
surface of the upper shoulder and an outer surface of the release piston 220. In the upper
position, the upper shoulder seals may straddle the hydraulic port, thereby preventing fluid
communication between the second hydraulic passage 235 and the upper face of the release
piston shoulder. In the upper position, the upper shoulder may also expose the hydraulic port
236, thereby providing fluid communication between the first hydraulic passage 234 and the
upper face of the release piston shoulder via the ports 236.

                                                 29
[0105] The control valve 225 may be operated between the upper and lower positions by
interaction with the release piston 220 and the housing 205. The control valve 225 may interact
with the release piston 220 by one or more biasing members, such as springs (not shown) and
with the housing by the latch. The upper spring may be disposed between the upper valve
shoulder and the upper face of the release piston shoulder and the lower spring may be disposed
between the lower face of the release piston shoulder and the lower valve shoulder. The housing
205 may have a latch profile formed adjacent the lower shoulder. The latch profile may receive
the valve latch, thereby fastening the control valve 225 to the housing 205 when the control
valve is in the lower position. The upper spring may bias the upper valve shoulder toward the
upper housing shoulder and the lower spring may bias the lower valve shoulder toward the
lower housing shoulder.
[0106] As the release piston shoulder moves longitudinally downward toward the lower
shoulder, the biasing force of the upper spring may decrease while the biasing force of the lower
spring increases. The latch and profile may resist movement of the control valve 225 until or
almost until the release piston shoulder reaches an end of a lower stroke. Once the biasing force
of the lower spring exceeds the resistance of the latch and latch profile, the control valve 225
may snap from the upper position to the lower position. Movement of the control valve 225
from the lower position to the upper position may similarly occur by snap action when the
biasing force of the upper spring against the upper valve shoulder exceeds the resistance of the
latch and latch profile.
[0107] The pump 250 may include one or more (five shown) pistons each disposed in a
respective piston chamber formed in the housing 205. Each piston may interact with the
mandrel 210 via a swash bearing (not shown). The swash bearing may include a rolling element
disposed in an eccentric groove formed in an outer surface of the mandrel 210 and connected to
a respective piston. Each piston chamber may be in fluid communication with a respective
hydraulic conduit 233 formed in the housing 205. Each hydraulic conduit 233 may be in
selective fluid communication with the reservoir 23 1r via a respective inlet check valve 232i and
may be in selective fluid communication with a pressure chamber 23lp via a respective outlet
check valve 232o. The inlet check valve 232i may allow hydraulic fluid flow from the reservoir
23 1r to each piston chamber and prevent reverse flow therethrough and the outlet check valve
232o may allow hydraulic fluid flow from each piston chamber to the pressure chamber 23lp
and prevent reverse flow therethrough.

                                                  30
[0108] In operation, as the mandrel 210 is rotated 4r by the shifting tool driver 180, the
eccentric angle of the swash bearing may cause reciprocation of the pump pistons. As each
pump piston travels longitudinally downward relative to the chamber, the piston may draw
hydraulic fluid from the reservoir 23 Ir via the inlet check valve 232i and the conduit 233. As
each pump piston reverses and travels longitudinally upward relative to the respective piston
chamber, the piston may drive the hydraulic fluid into the pressure chamber 23lp via the
conduit 233 and the outlet check valve 232o. The pressurized hydraulic fluid may then flow
along the first hydraulic passage 234 to the isolation valve 50g via respective hydraulic conduit
245a,b, thereby opening or closing the isolation valve (depending on whether the power sub is
the opener 200o or the closer 200c). Alternatively, an annular piston may be used in the swash
pump 250 instead of the rod pistons. Alternatively, a centrifugal or another type of positive
displacement pump may be used instead of the swash pump.
[0109] Hydraulic fluid displaced by operation of the isolation valve 5Og may be received by the
first hydraulic passage 234 via the respective conduit 245a,b. The lower face of the release
piston shoulder may receive the exhausted hydraulic fluid via a flow space formed between the
lower face of the lower valve shoulder, leakage through the latch, and a flow passage formed
between an inner surface of the lower valve shoulder and an outer surface of the release piston
220. Pressure exerted on the lower face of the release piston shoulder may move the release
piston 220 longitudinally upward until the control valve 225 snaps into the upper position.
Hydraulic fluid may be exhausted from the housing chamber to the reservoir 23 1r via the second
hydraulic passage 235. When the other one of the power subs 200o,c is operated, hydraulic
fluid exhausted from the isolation valve 50g may be received via the first hydraulic passage 234.
As discussed above, the upper face of the release piston shoulder may be in fluid
communication with the first hydraulic passage 234. Pressure exerted on the upper face of the
release piston shoulder may move the release piston 220 longitudinally downward until the
control valve 225 snaps into the lower position. Hydraulic fluid may be exhausted from the
housing chamber to the other power sub 200o,c via a third hydraulic passage 237 formed in the
housing 205 and hydraulic conduit 245c.
[0110] To account for thermal expansion of the hydraulic fluid, the lower portion of the housing
chamber (below the seal of the valve sleeve and the seal of the release piston shoulder) may be
in selective fluid communication with the reservoir 23 1r via the second hydraulic passage 235, a
pilot-check valve 239, and the third hydraulic passage 237. The pilot-check valve 239 may

                                                   31
allow fluid flow between the reservoir 23 Ir and the housing chamber lower portion (both
directions) unless pressure in the housing chamber lower portion exceeds reservoir pressure by a
preset nominal pressure. Once the preset pressure is reached, the pilot-check valve 239 may
operate as a conventional check valve oriented to allow flow from the reservoir 23 1r to the
housing chamber lower portion and prevent reverse flow therethrough. The reservoir 231r may
be divided into an upper portion and a lower portion by a compensator piston. The reservoir
upper portion may be sealed at a nominal pressure or maintained at wellbore pressure by a vent
(not shown). To prevent damage to the power sub 200o,c or the isolation valve 50g by
continued rotation of the drill string 105 after the isolation valve has been opened or closed by
the respective power sub 200o,c, the pressure chamber 231p may be in selective fluid
communication with the reservoir 231r via a pressure relief valve 240. The pressure relief valve
240 may prevent fluid communication between the reservoir and the pressure chamber unless
pressure in the pressure chamber exceeds pressure in the reservoir by a preset pressure.
[0111] The shifting tool 150 may include a tubular housing 155, a tubular mandrel 160, one or
more releases 175, and one or more drivers 180. The housing 155 may have couplings (not
shown) formed at each longitudinal end thereof for connection with other components of the
drill string 110. The couplings may be threaded, such as a box and a pin. The housing 155 may
have a central longitudinal bore formed therethrough for conducting drilling fluid. The housing
155 may include two or more sections 155a,c. The housing section 155c may be fastened to the
housing section 155a. The housing 155 may have a groove 155g and upper (not shown) and
lower 155b shoulders formed therein, and a wall of the housing 155 may have one or more holes
formed therethrough.
[0112] The mandrel 160 may be disposed within the housing 155 and longitudinally movable
relative thereto between a retracted position (not shown) and an extended position (shown). The
mandrel 160 may have upper and lower shoulders 160u,b formed therein. A seat 185 may be
fastened to the mandrel 160 for receiving a blocking member, such as a ball 140, launched by
ball launcher 13 lb and pumped through the drill string 105. The seat 185 may include an inner
fastener, such as a snap ring or segmented ring, and one or more intermediate and outer
fasteners, such as dogs. Each intermediate dog may be disposed in a respective hole formed
through a wall of the mandrel 160. Each outer dog may be disposed in a respective hole formed
through a wall of cam 165. Each outer dog may engage an inner surface of the housing 155 and
each intermediate dog may extend into a groove formed in an inner surface of the mandrel 160.

                                                 32
The seat ring may be biased into engagement with and be received by the mandrel groove
except that the dogs may prevent engagement of the seat ring with the groove, thereby causing a
portion of the seat ring to extend into the mandrel bore to receive the ball 140. The mandrel 160
may also carry one or more fasteners, such as snap rings 161a,b. The mandrel 160 may also be
rotationally connected to the housing 155.
[0113] The cam 165 may be a sleeve disposed within the housing 155 and longitudinally
movable relative thereto between a retracted position (not shown), an orienting position (not
shown), an engaged position (shown), and a released position (not shown). The cam 165 may
have a shoulder 165s formed therein and a profile 165p formed in an outer surface thereof. The
profile 165p may have a tapered portion for pushing a follower 170f radially outward and be
fluted for pulling the follower radially inward. The follower 170f may have an inner tongue
engaged with the flute. The cam 165 may interact with the mandrel 160 by being longitudinally
disposed between the snap ring 161a and the upper mandrel shoulder 160u and by having a
shoulder 165s engaged with the upper mandrel shoulder in the retracted position. A spring 140c
may be disposed between a snap ring (not shown) and a top of the cam 165, thereby biasing the
cam toward the engaged position. Alternatively, the cam profile 165p may be formed by inserts
instead of in a wall of the cam 165.
[0114]   A longitudinal piston 195 may be a sleeve disposed within the housing 155 and
longitudinally movable relative thereto between a retracted position (not shown), an orienting
position (not shown), and an engaged position (shown). The piston 195 may interact with the
mandrel 160 by being longitudinally disposed between the snap ring 161b and the lower
mandrel shoulder 160b. A spring 190p, may be disposed between the lower mandrel shoulder
160b and a top of the piston 195, thereby biasing the piston toward the engaged position. A
bottom of the piston 195 may engage the snap ring 161b in the retracted position.
[0115] One or more ribs 155r may be formed in an outer surface of the housing 155. Upper and
lower pockets may be formed in each rib 155r for the release 175 and the driver 180,
respectively. The release 175, such as an arm, and the driver 180, such as a dog, may be
disposed in each respective pocket in the retracted position. The release 175 may be pivoted to
the housing by a fastener 176. The follower 170f may be disposed through a hole formed
through the housing wall. The follower 170f may have an outer tongue engaged with a flute
formed in an inner surface of the release 175, thereby accommodating pivoting of the release

                                                 33
relative to the housing 155 while maintaining radial connection (pushing and pulling) between
the follower and the release. One or more seals may be disposed between the follower 170f and
the housing 155. The release 175 may be rotationally connected to the housing 155 via capture
of the upper end in the upper pocket by the pivot fastener 176. Alternatively, the ribs 155r may
be omitted and the mandrel profile 210p may have a length equal to, greater than, or
substantially greater than a combined length of the release 175 and the driver 180.
[0116] An inner portion of the driver 180 may be retained in the lower pocket by upper and
lower keepers fastened to the housing 155. Springs 191 may be disposed between the keepers
and lips of the driver 180, thereby biasing the driver radially inward into the lower pocket. One
or more radial pistons 170p may be disposed in respective chambers formed in the lower pocket.
A port may be formed through the housing wall providing fluid communication between an
inner face of each radial piston 170p and a lower face of the longitudinal piston 195. An outer
face of each radial piston 170p may be in fluid communication with the wellbore. Downward
longitudinal movement of the longitudinal piston 195 may exert hydraulic pressure on the radial
pistons 170p, thereby pushing the drivers 180 radially outward.
[0117] A chamber 158h may be formed radially between the mandrel 160 and the housing 155.
A reservoir 158r may be formed in each of the ribs 155. A compensator piston may be disposed
in each of the reservoirs 158r and may divide the respective reservoir into an upper portion and a
lower portion. The reservoir upper portion may be in communication with the wellbore 108 via
the upper pocket. Hydraulic fluid may be disposed in the chamber 158h and the lower portions
of each reservoir 158r. The reservoir lower portion may be in fluid communication with the
chamber 158h via a hydraulic conduit formed in the respective rib. A bypass 156 may be
formed in an inner surface of the housing 155. The bypass 156 may allow leakage around seals
of the longitudinal piston 195 when the piston is in the retracted position (and possibly the
orienting position). Once the longitudinal 195 piston moves downward and the seals move past
the bypass 156, the longitudinal piston seals may isolate a portion of the chamber 158h from the
rest of the chamber.
[0118] A spring 190r may be disposed against the snap ring 161b and the lower shoulder 155b,
thereby biasing the mandrel 160 toward the retracted position. In addition to the spring 190r, a
bottom of the mandrel 160 may have an area greater than a top of the mandrel 160, thereby
serving to bias the mandrel 160 toward the retracted position in response to fluid pressure

                                                 34
(equalized) in the housing bore. The cam profiles 165p and radial piston ports may be sized to
restrict flow of hydraulic fluid therethrough to dampen movement of the respective cam 165 and
radial pistons 170p between their respective positions.
[0119] Figures 10A and lOB illustrate the isolation valve 50g. The isolation valve 5Og may
include a tubular housing 251, the flow sleeve 52, the piston 53, the flapper 54, the hinge 58, an
abutment, such as lock sleeve shoulder 259m, the linkage 60, and the one or more wireless
sensor subs, such as upper sensor sub 282u and lower sensor sub 282b. The housing 251 may
be identical to the housing 51 except for the replacement of upper sensor sub housing 25 1a for
upper adapter 51a the replacement of lower sensor sub housing 251d for lower adapter 51d. The
lock sleeve 259 may be identical to the lock sleeve 59 except for the inclusion of a target 289t in
a lower face of the shoulder 259m.
[0120] Figure 1OC illustrates the upper wireless sensor sub 282u. The upper sensor sub 282u
may include the housing 25 1a, a pressure sensor 283, an electronics package 284, one or more
antennas 285r,t, and a power source, such as battery 286. Alternatively, the power source may
be capacitor (not shown). Additionally, the upper sensor sub 282u may include a temperature
senor (not shown).
[0121] The components 283-286 may be in electrical communication with each other by leads
or a bus. The antennas 285r,t may include an outer antenna 285r and an inner antenna 285t.
The housing 251 a may include two or more tubular sections 287u,b connected to each other,
such as by threaded couplings. The housing 251 a may have couplings, such as threaded
couplings, formed at a top and bottom thereof for connection to the body 5 lb and another
component of the casing string 111. The housing 251 a may have a pocket formed between the
sections 287u,b thereof for receiving the electronics package 284, the battery 286, and the inner
antenna 285t. To avoid interference with the antennas 285r,t, the housing 251a may be made
from a diamagnetic or paramagnetic metal or alloy, such as austenitic stainless steel or
aluminum. The housing 251 a may have a socket formed in an inner surface thereof for receiving
the pressure sensor 283 such that the sensor is in fluid communication with the valve bore upper
portion.
[0122] The electronics package 284 may include a control circuit 284c, a transmitter circuit
284t, and a receiver circuit 284r. The control circuit 284c may include a microprocessor

                                                 35
controller (MPC), a data recorder (MEM), a clock (RTC), and an analog-digital converter
(ADC). The data recorder may be a solid state drive. The transmitter circuit 284t may include
an amplifier (AMP), a modulator (MOD), and an oscillator (OSC). The receiver circuit 284r
may include the amplifier (AMP), a demodulator (MOD), and a filter (FIL). Alternatively, the
transmitter 284t and receiver 284r circuits may be combined into a transceiver circuit.
[0123] The lower sensor sub 282b may include the housing 25 1d having sections 288u,b, the
pressure sensor 283, an electronics package 284, the antennas 285r,t, the battery 286, and a
proximity sensor 289s. Alternatively, the inner antenna 285t may be omitted from the lower
sensor sub 282b.
[0124] The target 289t may be a ring made from a magnetic material or permanent magnet and
may be connected to the lock sleeve shoulder 259m by being bonded or press fit into a groove
formed in the shoulder lower face. The lock sleeve may be made from the diamagnetic or
paramagnetic material. The proximity sensor 289s may or may not include a biasing magnet
depending on whether the target 289t is a permanent magnet. The proximity sensor 289s may
include a semiconductor and may be in electrical communication with the bus for receiving a
regulated current. The proximity sensor 289s and/or target 289t may be oriented so that the
magnetic field generated by the biasing magnet/permanent magnet target is perpendicular to the
current. The proximity sensor 289s may further include an amplifier for amplifying the Hall
voltage output by the semiconductor when the target 289t is in proximity to the sensor.
Alternatively, the proximity sensors may be inductive, capacitive, optical, or utilize wireless
identification tags. Alternatively, the target may be embedded in an outer face of the flapper 54.
[0125] Once the casing string 111 has been deployed and cemented into the wellbore 108, the
sensor subs 282u,b may commence operation. Raw signals from the respective sensors 283,
289s may be received by the respective converter, converted, and supplied to the controller. The
controller may process the converted signals to determine the respective parameters, time stamp
and address stamp the parameters, and send the processed data to the respective recorder for
storage during tag latency. The controller may also multiplex the processed data and supply the
multiplexed data to the respective transmitter 284t. The transmitter 284t may then condition the
multiplexed data and supply the conditioned signal to the antenna 285t for electromagnetic
transmission, such as at radio frequency. Since the lower sensor sub 282b is inaccessible to the
tag 290 when the flapper 54 is closed, the lower sensor sub may transmit its data to the upper

                                                   36
sensor sub 282a via its transmitter circuit and outer antenna and the sensor sub 282a may receive
the bottom data via its outer antenna 285r and receiver circuit 284r. The sensor sub 282a may
then transmit its data and the bottom data for receipt by the tag 290.
[0126] Alternatively, any of the other isolation valves 50b-f may be modified to include the
wireless sensor subs 282u,b. Alternatively, any of the other isolation valves 50a-f may be
assembled as part of the casing string 111 instead of the isolation valve 50g.
[0127] Figure 1OD illustrates the RFID tag 290 for communication with the upper sensor sub
282u. The RFD tag 290 may be a wireless identification and sensing platform (WISP) RFID
tag. The tag 290 may include an electronics package and one or more antennas housed in an
encapsulation. The tag components may be in electrical communication with each other by
leads or a bus. The electronics package may include a control circuit, a transmitter circuit, and a
receiver circuit. The control circuit may include a microcontroller (MCU), the data recorder
(MEM), and a RF power generator. Alternatively, each tag 290 may have a battery instead of
the RF power generator.
[0128] Once the lower formation 22b has been drilled to total depth (or the bit requires
replacement), the drill string 105 may be removed from the wellbore 108. The drill string 105
may be raised until the drill bit is above the flapper 54 and the shifting tool 150 is aligned with
the closer power sub 200c. The PLC 36 may then operate the ball launcher 131b and the ball
140 may be pumped to the shifting tool 150, thereby engaging the shifting tool with the closer
power sub 200c. The drill string 105 may then be rotated by the top drive 13 to close the
isolation valve 50g. The ball 140 may be released to the ball catcher. An upper portion of the
wellbore 108 (above the flapper 54) may then be vented to atmospheric pressure. The PLC 36
may then operate the tag launcher 13 It and the tag 290 may be pumped down the drill string
105.
[0129] Once the tag 290 has been circulated through the drill string 105, the tag may exit the
drill bit in proximity to the sensor sub 282u. The tag 290 may receive the data signal
transmitted by the sensor sub 282u, convert the signal to electricity, filter, demodulate, and
record the parameters. The tag 290 may continue through the wellhead 110, the PCA 101p, and
the riser 125 to the RCD 126. The tag 290 may be diverted by the RCD 236 to the return line
129. The tag 290 may continue from the return line 129 to the tag reader 132.

                                                  37
[0130] The tag reader 132 may include a housing, a transmitter circuit, a receiver circuit, a
transmitter antenna, and a receiver antenna. The housing may be tubular and have flanged ends
for connection to other members of the return line 129. The transmitter and receiver circuits
may be similar to those of the sensor sub 282u. Alternatively, the tag reader 132 may include a
combined transceiver circuit and/or a combined transceiver antenna. The tag reader 132 may
transmit an instruction signal to the tag 290 to transmit the stored data thereof. The tag 290 may
then transmit the data to the tag reader 132. The tag reader 132 may then relay the data to the
PLC 36. The PLC 36 may then confirm closing of the valve 50g. The tag 290 may be
recovered from the shale shaker 26 and reused or may be discarded. Additionally, a second tag
may be launched before opening of the isolation valve 57c to ensure pressure has been equalized
across the flapper 54.
[0131] Alternatively, the tag reader 132 may be located subsea in the PCA 101p and may relay
the data to the PLC 36 via the umbilical 117.
[0132] Once the isolation valve 50g has been closed, the drill string 105 may be raised by
removing one or more stands of drill pipe 5p. A bearing assembly running tool (BART) (not
shown) may be assembled as part of the drill string 105 and lowered into the RCD 126 by
adding one or more stands to the drill string 105. The (BART) may be operated to engage the
RCD bearing assembly and the RCD latch operated to release the RCD bearing assembly. The
RCD bearing assembly may then be retrieved to the rig Ir by removing stands from the drill
string 105 and the BART removed from the drill string. Retrieval of the drill string 105 to the
rig Ir may then continue.
[0133] Figures 11 A-1 IC illustrate another modified isolation valve 5Oh having a pressure relief
device 300, according to another embodiment of the present disclosure.       The isolation valve
50h may include the housing 51, the flow sleeve 52, a piston 353, the flapper 54, the hinge 58,
the linear guide 74, the lock sleeve 79, an abutment 378, and the pressure relief device 300. The
piston 353 may be longitudinally movable relative to the housing 51. The piston 353 may
include the head 53h and a sleeve 353s longitudinally connected to the head, such as fastened
with threaded couplings and/or fasteners. The piston sleeve 353s may also have a flapper seat
formed at a bottom thereof. The abutment 378 may be a ring connected to the lock sleeve 79,
such by one or more fasteners. The abutment 378 may have a flapper support 378f formed in an
upper face thereof for receiving an outer periphery of the flapper 54 and a hinge pocket 378h

                                                  38
formed in the upper face for receiving the hinge 60. The flapper support 378f may have a
curved shape complementary to the flapper curvature.
[0134] The pressure relief device 300 may include a relief port 301, a relief notch 378r, a
rupture disk 302, and a pair of flanges 303, 304. The relief port 301 may be formed through a
wall of the piston sleeve 353s adjacent to the flapper seat. The relief notch 378r may be formed
in an upper portion of the abutment 378 to ensure fluid communication between the relief port
301 and a lower portion of the valve bore. The relief port 301 may have a shoulder formed
therein for receiving the outer flange 304. The outer flange 304 may be connected to the piston
sleeve 353s, such as by one or more fasteners. The rupture disk 302 may be metallic and have
one or more scores 302s formed in an inner surface thereof for reliably failing at a
predetermined rupture pressure. The rupture disk 302 may be disposed between the flanges 303,
304 and the flanges connected together, such as by one or more fasteners. The flanges 303, 304
may carry one or more seals for preventing leakage around the rupture disk 302. The rupture
disk 302 may be forward acting and pre-bulged.
[0135] The rupture pressure may correspond to a design pressure of the flapper 54. The design
pressure of the flapper 54 may be based on yield strength, fracture strength, or an average of
yield and fracture strengths. The disk 302 may be operable to rupture 302r in response to an
upward pressure differential (lower wellbore pressure 31 Of greater than upper wellbore pressure
310h) equaling or exceeding the rupture pressure, thereby opening the relief port 301. The open
relief port 301 may provide fluid communication between the valve bore portions, thereby
relieving the excess upward pressure differential which would otherwise damage the flapper 54.
The rupture disk 302 may also be capable of withstanding a downward pressure differential
(upper wellbore pressure greater than lower wellbore pressure) corresponding to the downward
pressure differential capability of the valve 50.
[0136] Alternatively, the rupture disk 302 may be reverse buckling. Alternatively, the rupture
disk 302 may be flat. Alternatively, the rupture disk 302 may be made from a polymer or
composite material. Alternatively, the pressure relief device 300 may be a valve, such as a relief
valve or rupture pin valve. Alternatively, the pressure relief device 300 may be a weakened
portion of the piston sleeve 353s operable to rupture and open a relief port or deform away from
engagement with the flapper 54, thereby creating a leak path. Alternatively, the pressure relief
device 300 may be located in the flapper 54. Alternatively, the isolation valve 50h may include

                                                 39
a second pressure relief device arranged in a series or parallel relationship to the device 300 and
operable to relieve an excess downward pressure differential. Alternatively, any of the other
isolation valves 50a-g may be modified to include the pressure relief device 300.
[0137] While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present disclosure, other and
further embodiments of the disclosure may be devised without departing from the basic scope
thereof, and the scope of the invention is determined by the claims that follow.
