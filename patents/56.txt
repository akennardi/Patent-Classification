 5 No. 2014253214 as originally filed is incorporated herein by reference.
   DESCRIPTION
   Technical field
                The present invention relates to a process and system of supplying film sheets to a
   packaging assembly of a packaging apparatus. The packaging apparatus may be of the type
10 for packaging a product under a controlled atmosphere or under vacuum, for example for
   skin packaging of a product.
   Background art
                Plastic containers are commonly used for the packaging of food and for a wide
   variety of other items wherein a plastic lid is bonded to the container e.g. by the
15 application of heat.
                One method of bonding the lid to the tray involves use of a laminated plastic lid
   having a layer of metal foil: a power supply provides an electrical current to a nearby
   induction coil which induces an electrical current into the metal foil to develop heat which
   melts portions of the lid and container and fuses the lid to the container lip. For example,
20 EP0469296 discloses an induction sealing assembly using a single turn coil to seal a plastic
   lid a plastic container. The assembly includes a nest having a recess for holding a container
   to be sealed, and a movable sealing head for holding a lid or foil membrane and for
   positioning the lid relative to an opening in the container. Means are provided to secure a
   portion of the sealing head against a portion of the nest to form an air-tight chamber
25 between a lower portion of the sealing head and an upper portion of the nest. The induction
   sealing assembly uses a vacuum source and a source of inert gas to flush air from the

   H:\ejl\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\EJL\15916247_l.docx-09 It 2017
                                                                 -2
   container prior to sealing. An induction coil mounted in the sealing head induces a heating
   electrical current in the lid to seal the lid to the container. This solution uses a precut lid:
   thus the process efficiency is compromised as there must be provision of means for
   transporting and loading the lead in proper position. Moreover, EP0469296 suggests using
 5 a roll stock foil membrane to seal the container. In this case, however, there is no
   disclosure at all as to how and where the membrane should be cut to form the tray lid.
                    In order to package products, in particular food products, vacuum packaging have
   been developed in the past.
                    Among the known vacuum packaging processes, vacuum skin packaging is
10 commonly employed for packaging food products such as fresh and frozen meat and fish,
   cheese, processed meat, ready meals and the like. Vacuum skin packaging is described for
   instance in FR 1 258 357, FR 1 286 018, AU 3 491 504, US RE 30 009, US 3 574 642, US
   3 681 092, US 3 713 849, US 4 055 672, and US 5 346 735.
                    Vacuum skin packaging is basically a thermoforming process. In particular, the
15 product is typically placed on a rigid or semi-rigid support (such as a tray, a bowl or a
   cup). The support with the product placed thereon is put in a vacuum chamber, where a
   film of thermoplastic material, held by vacuum in a position above the product placed on
   the support, is heated to soften it. The space between the support and the film is then
   evacuated and finally vacuum above the film is released to cause the film to drape down all
20 around the product and seal to the surface of the support not covered by the product, thus
   forming a tight skin around the product and on the support.
                    US 2007/0022717 discloses a machine for gastight packaging an object using a film
   material. The machine has a lower tool for supporting two trays and an upper tool having
   cutting devices housed inside the upper tool and facing the lower tool. A film is interposed
25 between the upper tool and the lower tool. The upper and lower tools are first closed the
   one against the other and then the film is cut to the size of the peripheral rims of the trays
   by the cutting devices operative inside the upper tool. Sealing tools heat seal the cut
   regions of the film to the peripheral rim of the tray. A vacuum is situated in the

   H:\ejl\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\EJL\15916247_1.docx-09 It 2017
                                                                 -3
   surrounding region of the tray to cause deep-drawing of the film. This reference also
   mentions that the same device can be used for sealing trays with films that are not deep
   drawn to form a skin over the product.
                    US 2005/0257501 discloses a machine for packaging a product arranged in a tray.
 5 The machine has a lower tool for supporting the tray and an upper tool with a cutting
   device. During operation, the film is clamped along an edge surrounding the tray and is
   deformed by the upper tool in a direction extending away the product. The space
   surrounding the product is then evacuated, the film and the edge of the tray are sealed and
   the film is then cut by the cutting device.
10                  As to the machines disclosed by US 2007/0022717 and US 2005/0257501, the film
   is cut to the size of the tray within the chamber formed by the upper tool and the lower
   tool, by means of the cutting devices provided on the upper tool. First of all, this
   disadvantageously requires providing a rather complex and bulky upper tool. Besides, this
   disadvantageously requires providing an excess film with respect to the size of the support,
15 which excess film is cut from the package and scrapped during or at the end of the
   packaging process. Indeed, the film is in the form of a continuous sheet wound on a roll (as
   shown e.g. in Figure 3 of US 2005/0257501 ). Therefore, an excess film is required to
   allow the film to be pulled from the roll and to be held in place above the supported
   product. Further, in US 2007/0022717 more than one product loaded support (namely two)
20 is packaged at each cycle, so that an excess film is also present between adjacent supports.
                    W02011/012652 shows an apparatus for packaging a product in a tray. The
   machine comprises a first film transfer plate configured for holding a film sheet, heating
   the film sheet, bringing the film sheet to a position above a tray with the product arranged
   thereon and air tightly fixing the film sheet to the tray. A second film transfer plate is also
25 present. As for the first film transfer plate also the second film transfer plate is configured
   for holding a film sheet, heating the film sheet, bringing the film sheet to a position above
   a tray with the product arranged thereon and air tightly fixing the film sheet to the tray.
   During a first operating step of the machine, the first film transfer plate holds a first film
   sheet and heats the first film sheet, while the second film transfer plate releases a second

   H:\ejl\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\EJL\15916247_1.docx-09 It 2017
                                                                 -4
   film sheet thereby allowing the second sheet to be drawn into a first tray; and during a
   second operating step of the machine, the second film transfer plate holds a third film sheet
   and heats the third film sheet, while the first film transfer plate releases the first film sheet
   thereby allowing the first film sheet to be drawn into a second tray. The machine further
 5 comprises a rotating cylinder suitable for rotating about its axis X, the first film transfer
   plate and the second film transfer plate being connected to the rotating cylinder so that,
   when the rotating cylinder rotates about its axis X, the positions of the first film transfer
   plate and the second film transfer plate are exchanged. A vacuum arrangement allows
   removing air from within the tray underneath the film sheet (positioned either by the first
10 or by the second film transfer plate) through the at least one hole present in the tray. The
   film transfer plates are configured to release the film sheet thereby allowing the film sheet
   to be drawn into the tray while the vacuum arrangement is removing air from within the
   tray.
                    Although the above solution improved previously known techniques, it should be
15 noted that the apparatus and method disclosed in W02011/012652 have been mainly
   conceived and optimized for skin packaging: in other words there is a need for a solution
   of maintaining all positive aspects relating to reduction of waste material while at the same
   time being adapted for packaging of products under controlled atmosphere.
                    Thus it is an object of the invention conceiving a process and an apparatus which
20 can flexibly operate both for skin packaging and for modified atmosphere packaging and
   which can be capable of reducing as much as possible consumption of plastic film.
                    It is a further aim of the invention that of conceiving a process and an apparatus for
   packaging products using either heat shrinkable films or non-heat shrinkable films.
                    Another object is that of offering a process and an apparatus capable of increasing
25 productivity and of avoiding as possible problems of mis-positioning of the film lid or of
   the film skin onto the support or tray.

   shown in the various figures are indicated with the same reference numeral through the
   figures. Note that the figures are not in scale and thus the parts and components shown
   therein are schematic representations.
                     In the following description and claims the apparatus and process refer to
20 packaging of a product inside a support: the product may be a food product or not.
                     As used herein support 4 means a container of the type having a base wall 4a, a side
   wall 4b and optionally a top rim 4c radially emerging from the side wall 4b; also note for
   the purpose of the present description tray and support have the same meaning and are
   interchangeably used. The tray or supports 4 may have a rectangular shape or any other
25 suitable shape, such as round, square, elliptical etc.. Trays may be manufactured by
   thermoforming or injection molding.

                                                                 - 23
   The trays or supports
                    The trays or supports 4 described and claimed herein may be made of a single layer
   or, preferably, of a multi-layer polymeric material.
                    In case of a single layer material suitable polymers are for instance polystyrene,
 5 polypropylene, polyesters, high density polyethylene, poly(lactic acid), PVC and the like,
   either foamed or solid.
                    Preferably the tray 4 is provided with gas barrier properties. As used herein such
   term refers to a film or sheet of material which has an oxygen transmission rate of less than
   200 cm3 /m2-day-bar, less than 150 cm3 /m2-day-bar, less than 100 cm3 /m2-day-bar as
10 measured according to ASTM D-3985 at 23'C and 0% relative humidity.
                    Suitable materials for gas barrier monolayer thermoplastic trays 4 are for instance
   polyesters, polyamides and the like.
                    In case the tray 4 is made of a multi-layer material, suitable polymers are for
   instance ethylene homo- and co-polymers, propylene homo- and co-polymers, polyamides,
15 polystyrene, polyesters, poly(lactic acid), PVC and the like. Part of the multi-layer material
   can be solid and part can be foamed.
                    For example, the tray 4 may comprises at least one layer of a foamed polymeric
   material chosen from the group consisting of polystyrene, polypropylene, polyesters and
   the like.
20                  The multi-layer material may be produced either by co-extrusion of all the layers
   using co-extrusion techniques or by glue- or heat-lamination of, for instance, a rigid
   foamed or solid substrate with a thin film, usually called "liner".
                    The thin film may be laminated either on the side of the tray 4 in contact with the
   product P or on the side facing away from the product P or on both sides. In the latter case
25 the films laminated on the two sides of the tray 4 may be the same or different. A layer of
   an oxygen barrier material, for instance (ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) copolymer, is

   H:\ejl\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\EJL\15916247_1.docx-09 It 2017
                                                                 - 24
   optionally present to increase the shelf-life of the packaged product P.
                    Gas barrier polymers that may be employed for the gas barrier layer are PVDC,
   EVOH, polyamides, polyesters and blends thereof. The thickness of the gas barrier layer
   will be set in order to provide the tray with an oxygen transmission rate suitable for the
 5 specific packaged product.
                    The tray may also comprise a heat salable layer. Generally, the heat-sealable layer
   will be selected among the polyolefins, such as ethylene homo- or co-polymers, propylene
   homo- or co-polymers, ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers, ionomers, and the homo- and
   co-polyesters, e.g. PETG, a glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate.
10                  Additional layers, such as adhesive layers, to better adhere the gas-barrier layer to
   the adjacent layers, may be present in the gas barrier material for the tray and are
   preferably present depending in particular on the specific resins used for the gas barrier
   layer.
                    In case of a multilayer material used to form the tray 4, part of this structure may be
15 foamed and part may be un-foamed. For instance, the tray 4 may comprise (from the
   outermost layer to the innermost food-contact layer) one or more structural layers,
   typically of a material such as foam polystyrene, foam polyester or foam polypropylene, or
   a cast sheet of e.g. polypropylene, polystyrene, poly(vinyl chloride), polyester or
   cardboard; a gas barrier layer and a heat-sealable layer.
20                  The tray 4 may be obtained from a sheet of foamed polymeric material having a
   film comprising at least one oxygen barrier layer and at least one surface sealing layer
   laminated onto the side facing the packaged product, so that the surface sealing layer of the
   film is the food contact layer the tray. A second film, either barrier or non-barrier, may be
   laminated on the outer surface of the tray.
25                  Specific tray 4 formulations are used for food products which require heating in
   conventional or microwave oven before consumption. The surface of the container in
   contact with the product, i.e. the surface involved in the formation of the seal with the

   lidding film, comprises a polyester resin. For instance the container can be made of a
   cardboard coated with a polyester or it can be integrally made of a polyester resin.
   Examples of suitable containers for the package of the invention are CPET, APET or
   APET/CPET containers. Such container can be either foamed or not-foamed.
 5                  Trays 4 used for lidding or skin applications containing foamed parts, have a total
   thickness lower than 8 mm, and for instance may be comprised between 0.5 mm and 7.0
   mm and more frequently between 1.0 mm and 6.0 mm.
                    In case of rigid tray not containing foamed parts, the total thickness of the single
   layer or multi-layer thermoplastic material is preferably lower than 2 mm, and for instance
10 may be comprised between 0.1 mm and 1.2 mm and more frequently between 0.2 mm and
    1.0 mm.
   The film or film material
                    The film or film material 10a described and claimed herein may be applied to the
   tray or support 4 to form a lid onto the tray (e.g. for MAP - modified atmosphere
15 packaging) or a skin associated to the tray and matching the contour of the product.
                    The film for skin applications may be made of a flexible multi-layer material
   comprising at least a first outer heat-sealable layer, an optional gas barrier layer and a
   second outer heat-resistant layer. The outer heat-sealable layer may comprise a polymer
   capable of welding to the inner surface of the supports carrying the products to be
20 packaged, such as for instance ethylene homo- or co-polymers, like LDPE, ethylene/alpha
   olefin             copolymers,                    ethylene/acrylic acid  copolymers, ethylene/methacrylic acid
   copolymers, and ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers, ionomers, co-polyesters, e.g. PETG.
   The optional gas barrier layer preferably comprises oxygen impermeable resins like
   PVDC, EVOH, polyamides and blends of EVOH and polyamides. The outer heat-resistant
25 layer may be made of ethylene homo- or copolymers, ethylene/cyclic-olefin copolymers,
   such as ethylene/norbornene copolymers, propylene homo- or co-polymers, ionomers,
   (co)polyesters, (co)polyamides. The film may also comprise other layers such as adhesive
   layers or bulk layers to increase thickness of the film and improve its abuse and deep

                                                                 -26
   drawn properties. Particularly used bulk layers are ionomers, ethylene/vinyl acetate
   copolymers, polyamides and polyesters. In all the film layers, the polymer components
   may contain appropriate amounts of additives normally included in such compositions.
   Some of these additives are preferably included in the outer layers or in one of the outer
 5 layers, while some others are preferably added to inner layers. These additives include slip
   and anti- block agents such as talc, waxes, silica, and the like, antioxidants, stabilizers,
   plasticizers, fillers, pigments and dyes, cross-linking inhibitors, cross-linking enhancers,
   UV absorbers, odour absorbers, oxygen scavengers, bactericides, antistatic agents and the
   like additives known to those skilled in the art of packaging films.
10                  One or more layers of the film can be cross- linked to improve the strength of the
   film and/or its heat resistance. Cross-linking may be achieved by using chemical additives
   or by subjecting the film layers to an energetic radiation treatment. The films for skin
   packaging are typically manufactured in order to show low shrink when heated during the
   packaging cycle. Those films usually shrink less than 15% at 160'C, more frequently
15 lower than 10%, even more frequently lower than 8% in both the longitudinal and
   transversal direction (ASTM D2732). The films usually have a thickness comprised
   between 20 microns and 200 microns, more frequently between 40 and 180 microns and
   even more frequently between 50 microns and 150 microns.
                    The skin packages are usually "easy-to-open", i.e. they are easily openable by
20 manually pulling apart the two webs, normally starting from a point like a comer of the
   package where the upper web has purposely not been sealed to the support. To achieve
   this feature, either the film or the tray can be provided with a suitable composition,
   allowing easy opening of the package, as known in the art. Typically, the sealant
   composition and/or the composition of the adjacent layer of the tray and/or the film are
25 adjusted in order to achieve the easy opening feature.
                    Various mechanisms can occur while opening an easy-to-open package.
                    In the first one ("peelable easy opening") the package is opened by separating the
   film and the tray at the seal interface.

   H:\ejl\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\EJL\15916247_l.docx-09 It 2017
                                                                 - 27
                    In the second mechanism ("adhesive failure") the opening of the package is
   achieved through an initial breakage through the thickness of one of the sealing layers
   followed by delamination of this layer from the underlying support or film.
                    The third system is based on the "cohesive failure" mechanism: the easy opening
 5 feature is achieved by internal rupture of a seal layer that, during opening of the package,
   breaks along a plane parallel to the layer itself.
                    Specific blends are known in the art to obtain such opening mechanisms, ensure the
   peeling of the film from the tray surface, such as those described in EP1084186.
                    On the other hand, in case the film 10a is used for creating a lid on the tray or
10 support 4, the film material may be obtained by co-extrusion or lamination processes. Lid
   films may have a symmetrical or asymmetrical structure and can be monolayer or
   multilayer.
                    The multilayer films have at least 2, more frequently at least 5, even more
   frequently at least 7 layers.
15                  The total thickness of the film may vary frequently from 3 to 100 micron, in
   particular from 5 to 50 micron, even more frequently from 10 to 30 micron.
                      The films may be optionally cross-linked. Cross-linking may be carried out by
   irradiation with high energy electrons at a suitable dosage level as known in the art. The lid
   films described above may be heat shrinkable or heat-set. The heat shrinkable films
20 typically show free shrink value at 120'C measured according to ASTM D2732 in the
   range of from 2 to 80%, more frequently from 5 to 60%, even more frequently from 10 to
   40% in both the longitudinal and transverse direction. The heat-set films usually have free
   shrink values lower than 10% at 120'C, preferably lower than 5% in both the longitudinal
   and transversal direction (ASTM D 2732). Lid films usually comprise at least a heat
25 salable layer and an outer skin layer, which is generally made up of heat resistant
   polymers or polyolefin. The sealing layer typically comprises a heat-sealable polyolefin
   which in turn comprises a single polyolefin or a blend of two or more polyolefins such as

   H:\ejl\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\EJL\15916247_l.docx-09 It 2017
                                                                 -28
   polyethylene or polypropylene or a blend thereof. The sealing layer can be further
   provided with antifog properties by incorporating one or more antifog additives into its
   composition or by coating or spraying one or more antifog additives onto the surface of the
   sealing layer by technical means well known in the art. The sealing layer may further
 5 comprise one or more plasticisers. The skin layer may comprises polyesters, polyamides or
   polyolefin. In some structures, a blend of polyamide and polyester can advantageously be
   used for the skin layer. In some cases, the lid films comprise a barrier layer. Barrier films
   typically have an OTR (evaluated at 23'C and 0 % R.H. according to ASTM D-3985)
   below 100 cm 3/(m 2 -day- atm) and more frequently below 80 cm 3/(m 2 -day- atm). The barrier
10 layer is usually made of a thermoplastic resin selected among a saponified or hydrolyzed
   product of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVOH), an amorphous polyamide and a
   vinyl-vinylidene chloride and their admixtures. Some materials comprise an EVOH barrier
   layer, sandwiched between two polyamide layers. The skin layer typically comprises
   polyesters, polyamides or polyolefin.
15                  In some packaging applications, the lid films do not comprise any barrier layer.
   Such films usually comprise one or more polyolefin are herein defined.
                    Non-barrier films typically have an OTR (evaluated at 23'C and 0 % R.H.
   according to ASTM D-3985) from 100 cm 3/(m 2 -day- atm) up to 10000 cm 3/(m 2 -day- atm),
   more typically up to 6000 cm 3/(m 2 -day-atm).
20                  Peculiar compositions polyester-based are those used for tray lidding of ready
   meals packages. For these films, the polyester resins can make up at least 50%, 60%, 70%,
   80%, 90% by weight of the film. These films are typically used in combination with
   polyester-based supports.
                    For instance the container can be made of a cardboard coated with a polyester or it
25 can be integrally made of a polyester resin. Examples of suitable containers for the
   package are CPET, APET or APET/CPET containers, either foamed or not-foamed.
                    Usually, biaxially oriented PET are used as the lid film due to its high thermal

   films are heat-set, i.e. non-heat-shrinkable. To improve the heat-sealability of the PET
   lidding film to the container a heat-sealable layer of a lower melting material is usually
   provided on the film. The heat-sealable layer may be coextruded with the PET base layer
   (as disclosed in EP-A- 1 ,529,797 and W02007/093495) or it may be solvent- or
 5 extrusion-coated over the base film (as disclosed in US 2,762,720 and EP-A- 1 ,252,008).
                    Particularly in the case of fresh red meat packages, twin lidding film comprising an
   inner, oxygen-permeable, and an outer, oxygen-impermeable, lidding film are
   advantageously used. The combination of these two films significantly prevents the meat
   discoloration also when the packaged meat extends upwardly with respect to the height of
10 the tray walls, which is the most critical situation in barrier packaging of fresh meat.
                    These films are described for example in EP1848635 and EP0690012, the
   disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.
                    The lid film can be monolayer. Typical composition of monolayer films comprise
   polyesters as herein defined and their blends or polyolefins as herein defined and their
15 blends.
                    In all the film layers herein described, the polymer components may contain
   appropriate amounts of additives normally included in such compositions. Some of these
   additives are preferably included in the outer layers or in one of the outer layers, while
   some others are preferably added to inner layers. These additives include slip and anti
20 block agents such as talc, waxes, silica, and the like, antioxidants, stabilizers, plasticizers,
   fillers, pigments and dyes, cross-linking inhibitors, cross-linking enhancers, UV absorbers,
   odor absorbers, oxygen scavengers, bactericides, antistatic agents, anti-fog agents or
   compositions, and the like additives known to those skilled in the art of packaging films.
                    The films suitable for lidding application can advantageously be perforated, in
25 order to allow the packaged food to breath.
                    Those films may be perforated by using different technologies available in the art,
   through laser or mechanical means such as rolls provided with several needles.

                    The number of perforations per unit area of the film and their dimensions affect the
   gas permeability of the film.
                    Microperforated films are usually characterized by OTR value (evaluated at 23'C
   and 0 % R.H. according to ASTM D-3985) from 2500 cm 3/(m 2 -day-atm) up to 1000000
 5 cm 3/(m 2 -day-atm).
                    Macroperforated films are usually characterized by OTR (evaluated at 23'C and 0
   % R.H. according to ASTM D-3985) higher than 1000000 cm 3/(m 2 -day-atm).
                    Furthermore, the films herein described for lidding applications can be formulated
   to provide strong or peelable sealing onto the support. A method of measuring the force of
10 a peelable seal, herein referred to as "peel force" is described in ASTM F-88-00.
   Acceptable peel force values fare in the range from 100 g/25 mm to 850 g/25 mm, from
    150 g/25 mm to 800 g/25 mm, from 200 g/25 mm to 700 g/25 mm.
                    The desired seal strength is achieved specifically designing the tray and the lid
   formulations.
15                  In general, one or more layers of the lid film can be printed, in order to provide
   useful information to the consumer, a pleasing image and/or trademark or other advertising
   information to enhance the retail sale of the packaged product.
                    The film may be printed by any suitable method, such as rotary screen, gravure or
   flexographic techniques mas known in the art.

                    As used herein, the term EVOH includes saponified or hydrolyzed ethylene-vinyl
   acetate copolymers, and refers to ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymers having an ethylene
   comonomer content preferably comprised from about 28 to about 48 mole %, more
   preferably, from about 32 to about 44 mole % ethylene, and even more preferably, and a

   more comonomers selected from alpha-olefins having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms, such as
    1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 4-methyl-1-pentene and the like.
20                  Ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymers generally have a density in the range of from
   about 0.86 to about 0.94 g/cm3. The term linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) is
   generally understood to include that group of ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymers which fall
   into the density range of about 0.915 to about 0.94 g/cm3 and particularly about 0.915 to
   about 0.925 g/cm3. Sometimes linear polyethylene in the density range from about 0.926

                    Another useful ethylene copolymer is an ethylene/unsaturated ester copolymer,
   which is the copolymer of ethylene and one or more unsaturated ester monomers. Useful
   unsaturated esters include vinyl esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids, where the esters have
   from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, such as vinyl acetate, and alkyl esters of acrylic or methacrylic
 5 acid, where the esters have from 4 to 12 carbon atoms.
                    Ionomers are copolymers of an ethylene and an unsaturated monocarboxylic acid
   having the carboxylic acid neutralized by a metal ion, such as zinc or, preferably, sodium.
                    Useful propylene copolymers include propylene/ethylene copolymers, which are
   copolymers of propylene and ethylene having a majority weight percent content of
10 propylene,                  and propylene/ethylene/butene          terpolymers, which   are  copolymers  of
   propylene, ethylene and 1-butene.
                    As used herein, the term "polyolefin" refers to any polymerized olefin, which can
   be linear, branched, cyclic, aliphatic, aromatic, substituted, or unsubstituted. More
   specifically, included in the term polyolefin are homo-polymers of olefin, co-polymers of
15 olefin, co-polymers of an olefin and an non-olefinic co-monomer co-polymerizable with

   acrylate co-polymer, ethylene-methyl acrylate co-polymer, ethylene-acrylic acid co
   polymer, and ethylene-methacrylic acid co-polymer), ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer,
   ionomer resin, polymethylpentene, etc.
                    The term " polyester" is used herein to refer to both homo-and co- polyesters,
25 wherein homo-polyesters are defined as polymers obtained from the condensation of one
   dicarboxylic acid with one diol and co- polyesters are defined as polymers obtained from

   ethylene units and include, based on the dicarboxylate units, at least 90 mol %, more
   preferably at least 95 mol %, of terephthalate units. The remaining monomer units are
   selected from other dicarboxylic acids or diols. Suitable other aromatic dicarboxylic acids

 5 Detailed description
   First embodiment of the apparatus 1
                     Figures 1-8 show an apparatus 1 for packaging of a product P arranged on a support
   or tray 4 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus 1 is adapted
   for modified atmosphere packaging, where a plastic film, such as film sheet 18 described
10 below, is applied to the top rim 4c of a support or tray 4 after a modified gas atmosphere
   has been created inside the support 4, and/or for vacuum skin packaging of the product P,
   where a thin film of plastic material, such as film sheet 18 described below, is draped
   down on the product and intimately adheres to a top rim and to the inner surface of the
   support as well as to the product surface thus leaving a minimum, if any, amount of air
15 within the packaging. The apparatus 1 may also be used in case a film sheet applied to a
   tray or support and neither vacuum nor modified atmosphere is created.
                     The apparatus 1 comprises a frame 2, a transport assembly 3 for displacing the
   support or tray 4, a film supplying assembly 5, a film cutting assembly 6, a transfer device
   7 and a packaging assembly 8.
20                   The tray 4 shown in the enclosed figures presents a base wall 4a, a side wall 4b
   emerging from the base wall and delimiting a space where a product P can be housed, and
   a top rim 4c radially protruding from the side wall 4b: in the example shown the top rim 4c
   has a horizontal flat portion defining an optimal sealing surface for tightly fixing a plastic
   film.
25                   The frame 2 defines a base body of the apparatus 1 and serves to carry and support
   various parts of the apparatus 1 as herein described.

                                                                 - 35
                    The transport assembly 3 comprises a displacement plane 20 (which may be a
   physical plane where the trays or support are lying and slide or an ideal plane along which
   the trays are guided e.g. by means of railways or guides). The plane 20 is defined on a top
   area of the frame and a conveyor 46 is arranged in correspondence of the sliding plane 20.
 5 In the example shown, the transport assembly 3 is carried by, e.g. fixed to, the frame 2 so
   that the sliding plane 20 is substantially horizontal and the conveyor 46moves the trays or
   supports 4 according to the horizontal direction indicated by the arrow Al shown in Figure
    1. The transport assembly 3 arranged on the frame 2 is configured for displacing the
   support or tray 4 along a predefined path from a loading station, where supports or trays 4
10 which may already be filled with the respective product(s) P are positioned, to the
   packaging assembly 8 where a film sheet 18 is tightly fixed to each support or tray 4, as it
   will be explained here below in detail. The conveyor 46 displaces the trays, e.g. a prefixed
   number of tray per time, inside the packaging chamber in proper position for receiving the
   cut film sheets. For instance, a control unit 100 (which will be further described herein
15 after) may control the conveyor 46 to displace a prefixed number of trays or supports 4 per
   time from a region outside the packaging assembly, to a region inside the packaging
   assembly where the tray or trays are in vertical alignment to the film sheets. The conveyor
   may for instance include a first transfer device 46a (such as the belt shown in figure 1)
   configured for bringing the trays in close proximity to the packaging assembly and a
20 second transfer device 46b adapted to pick one or more of said trays and bring them into
   the packaging station. The second transfer device may for instance include arms acting on
   the sides of the trays or supports such as to pick the supports from the first transfer device,
   bring them into the packaging station and then return to the first transfer devise to pick a
   new set of trays or supports 4. Alternatively, the conveyor 46 may include pushers (e.g. in
25 the form of bars extending transverse to said direction Al) acting on the trays and pushing
   the trays inside the packaging assembly. The pushers may be moved by chains or belts and
   may be moved into the packaging assembly to properly position a number of trays, and
   then be retracted from the packaging assembly, once the trays have reached their proper
   position inside this latter. According to a further alternative, the conveyor 46 may include
30 housings (e.g. in the form of plates provided with cavities for receiving a number of trays)

   H:\ejl\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\EJL\15916247_l.docx-09 It 2017
                                                                 - 36
   which are moved along said direction Al and which are moving inside the packaging
   station together with the supports or trays 4: according to this last alternative the housings
   are properly shaped in order to be hosted inside the packaging station during the
   application of the film 10a to the tray or support 4.
 5                  Note that the products P may be positioned on the support or tray 4 either upstream
   the loading station or in any location between the loading station and the packaging
   assembly 8. The transport assembly 3 further comprises a motor 9, e.g. a stepping motor
   unit, for operating the conveyor belt 46 with step-by-step movement.
                    The film supply assembly 5 may comprise a film roll 10 which supplies a
10 continuous film 10a. The film supplying assembly 5 may further comprise an arm 11
   (represented in dashed lines in figure 1) fixed to the frame 2 and suitable for supporting the
   roll 10. Further, the film supplying assembly 5 may comprise film punching devices (not
   show as per se known) configured essentially to provide the correct profile to the film
   edges to match, when transversally cut in the cutting assembly 6, the shape of the tray 4
15 mouth with rounded corners. The punching devices may also help to keep an unrolled
   portion of film pulled from the film roll 10 aligned according to a prefixed direction. The
   film supplying assembly 5 also comprises pinch rollers 12 and/or other means for pulling
   the film from the roll 10 and properly position it in correspondence of the film cutting
   assembly 6 (for instance said means may comprise pincers acting on the side of the film
20 and/or pincers acting on the front edge of the film and configured to pull the film).
                    The film 10a rolled on the film roll 10 may be made as disclosed above depending
   upon the specific need.
                    The film cutting assembly 6 comprises a cutting device 13 with a blade 14 and a
   blade piston 15. This piston 15 may be replaced by any other kind of electric, pneumatic
25 or hydraulic linear actuator. The blade piston 15 is preferably fixed to the frame 2 and is
   connected to the cutting device 13 so as to push and pull it in a direction transverse to the
   unrolled portion of the film 10a, as indicated by the double arrow A2 shown in Figure 1.
                    The apparatus packaging assembly 8 is configured for tightly fixing the film sheets

                                                                 - 37
    18 to said supports 4; the packaging assembly 8 includes a lower tool 22 and an upper tool
   21. The lower tool 22 has a number of inner walls 23 defining a prefixed number of seats
   23b. In a embodiment the lower tool 22 is provided with multiple seats 23b each for
   hosting a corresponding support 4; in this case the upper tool 21 is provided with a
 5 corresponding plurality of holding plates 36 each for holding a respective film sheet 18.
                    Each of seats 23b is configured for receiving one support 4. For instance in the
   example of figures 2-8 the seat 23b is peripherally delimited by inner wall 23 and the
   support or tray 4 is received within the seat 23b such that the top rim 4c may rest above the
   end surface 23a of the inner wall 23. The upper tool 21 faces the lower tool 22 and is
10 configured for holding one or more of said film sheets 18: in the example shown in figures
   2-8 the upper tool 21 is configured for holding one cut film sheet 18. As shown in figures
   2-8 the upper and lower tools 21, 22 cooperate to define a packaging chamber 24: in a first
   operating condition of the packaging assembly 8 - shown in figures 2 and 3,8 - the upper
   and lower tools 21 and 22 are space apart and the packaging chamber 24 is open thereby
15 allowing one or more of said film sheets 18 to move from the cutting assembly 6 to the
   inside of the packaging chamber 24, as it will be further detailed herein below. In a second
   operating condition of the packaging assembly 8 - shown in figures 4-7 the packaging
   chamber 24 is preferably hermetically closed with respect to an atmosphere outside the
   apparatus 1.
20                  Note that by hermetically closed it is meant that the packaging chamber 24 cannot
   freely communicate with the atmosphere outside the same chamber as gas may be supplied
   or withdrawn from the chamber only via supply or discharge channels under the control of
   the apparatus 1.
                    The above mentioned transfer device 7 is configured for positioning the cut film
25 sheets 18 inside the packaging chamber 24 and above the respective support 4. The transfer
   device 7 includes a backing structure 16 having a flat holding surface 17 adapted for
   receiving the at least one or more film sheets 18 cut by blade 14: figure 1 shows that the
   blade 14 has cut the continuous film 10a and one film sheet 18 is positioned in
   correspondence of the flat holding surface 17. The backing structure 16 may hold the cut

                     associated to the holding surface 17,
                                   -              heating         systems, for instance comprising  heatable portions
                     (controlled by control unit 100) associated to the backing structure causing heating
                     of the holding surface 16 and thus of the film sheet 18 in order to increase
10                   stickiness of the film sheet to the holding surface 17,
                                   -              electric systems, for instance the holding surface may be charged
                     with a polarity different from that typical of the plastic sheet 18. In this case the
                     control unit may be connected to a voltage generator and may control the electric
                     charging of surface 17.
15                   The transfer device 7 also includes a mechanism 19, e.g. carried by frame 2, active
    on the backing structure 16 and configured for relatively moving the backing structure 16
   with respect to the packaging assembly 8 between a first position, shown in figure 2, where
   the baking structure 16 is positioned by the cutting device e.g. immediately downstream
   the blade 14 with respect to the movement imposed to film 10a, and at least a second
20 position, where the backing structure 16 is positioned inside a packaging chamber 24. In
   the examples shown in the enclosed figures, the mechanism 19 includes a transfer actuator
   47 active on the backing structure 16 and configured for pushing and pulling the backing
    structure 16 along a path suitable for achieving the displacement between said first and
    second positions: for example, the mechanism and transfer actuator may displace the
25 backing structure along a direction parallel to said horizontal direction Al as indicated by
    double arrow A3 in figure 1. The transfer actuator 47 stroke is such that the backing
    structure positions at least one film sheet 18 above said support 4 inside the chamber 24,
   just in front of a central portion of the upper tool 21, as shown in figure 3. Although the
   transfer actuator 47 shown e.g. in figure 1 is a piston, it may be replaced by any other kind
30  of electric, pneumatic or hydraulic linear actuator.

                                                                 - 39
                    To summarize, the control unit 100 is configured for activating the film cutting
   assembly 6 for cutting, outside the packaging chamber, the continuous film 10a into the cut
   film sheet(s) 18 and for then activating the transfer device 7 for positioning the cut film
   sheet(s) 18 inside the packaging chamber 24 and above the respective support 4: the film
 5 sheets will then be further processed as disclosed below. Advantageously, the control unit
    100 may be further configured for synchronizing activation of the transfer device 7 with
   passage of the packaging assembly 8 from the first to the second operating condition, such
   as to optimize timing of the process. In any case the control unit 100 is configured for
   leaving the packaging assembly 8 in the first operating condition a time sufficient for the
10 backing structure 16 of transfer device to position inside the packaging chamber 24 an
   above the respective support 4 the cut film sheet(s) 18 which have/has been cut outside the
   packaging chamber 24 by the cutting assembly. The time shall also be sufficient for the
   backing structure to exit from packaging chamber 24, which can then be closed again
   under the control of unit 100. The backing structure and the cutting assembly are then
15 controlled by the control unit which is configured to command the backing structure to
   take again the position at the cutting assembly where the backing structure receives one or
   more newly cut film sheet(s). The backing structures serves both film sheet support during
   cutting at the cutting station and as support during transportation of the cut film sheets
   inside the packaging chamber.
20                  As an alternative, instead of moving the backing structure 16, the upper tool 21
   may be mobile with respect to frame 2 and be configured to pick the cut film sheets 18
   from the area immediately downstream the cutting device 13. In this case the transfer
   device 7 would include a mechanism 25, e.g. carried by frame 2, active on the packaging
   assembly 8 and configured for displacing the upper tool 21 between a first position, where
25 the upper tool 21 is positioned in correspondence of the backing structure 16 and
   configured to pick up from the backing structure 16 the one or more cut film sheets 18, and
   at least a second position, where the upper tool 21 is aligned to the lower tool 22 and
   configured to position at least one film sheet 18 above said support 4. In order to achiever
   the above movement the mechanism may displace the upper tool 21 along any suitable
30 path: for example in the attached figure 1 it is schematically shown that the mechanism 25

   H:\ejl\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\EJL\15916247_l.docx-09 It 2017
                                                                 - 40
   may include a transfer actuator 26 configured for pushing and pulling the upper tool 21
   along a direction parallel to said horizontal direction Al as indicated by double arrow A4
   in figure 1. As an alternative the mechanism 29 may cause rotation of the upper tool
   around a pivoting axis; as a further alternative the mechanism 29 may cause both a
 5 pivoting movement and a translational displacement in order to move the upper tool from
   seid respective first and second positions. The transfer actuator 26 may be in the form of a
   piston: it may be replaced by any other kind of electric, pneumatic or hydraulic linear
   actuator. In figure 1 the apparatus 1 includes both the mechanism 19 and the mechanism
   25 described above.
10                  The apparatus 1 also includes at least one control unit 100 which is connected to the
   transport assembly 3, to the film supplying assembly 5, to the film cutting assembly 6, to
   the transfer device 7 and to the packaging assembly 8. The control unit 100, which is
   schematically represented in figure 1 is configured for activating the transfer device 7 so as
   to animate motion of the backing structure 16 or of the upper tool 21, as the case may be,
15 in the positions described above. The control unit 100 is also configured for synchronizing
   activation of the transfer device 7 with passage of the packaging assembly 8 from the first
   to the second operating condition so that the movement of the backing structure 16 is
   caused to take place when the packaging chamber 24 is open while the packaging chamber
   24 is closed only once the backing structure 16 has transferred the cut film sheet 18 to the
20 upper tool 21 and has left the packaging chamber 24. The control unit may also be
   configured for synchronizing the conveyor 46 such that movement of a prefixed number of
   trays or supports 4 from a region outside the packaging chamber 24 to a region inside the
   packaging chamber 24 is caused to take place when the packaging chamber 24 is open
   while the packaging chamber 24 is closed only once said prefixed number of trays or
25 supports 4 is in proper position relative to the upper tool 21.
                    The apparatus 1 may also comprise a vacuum arrangement 27 connected to the
   packaging chamber 24 and configured for removing gas from inside said packaging
   chamber; the vacuum arrangement comprises at least one vacuum pump 28 and at least one
   evacuation pipe 29 connecting the inside of said chamber 24 to the vacuum pump; the

   control unit 100 controls the vacuum pump 28 to withdraw gas from said packaging
   chamber 24 at least when the packaging assembly is in said second operating condition, i.e.
   with said packaging chamber hermetically closed.
                    The apparatus 1 may also or may alternatively include a controlled atmosphere
 5 arrangement 30 connected to the packaging chamber 24 and configured for injecting a gas
   stream into said packaging chamber; the controlled atmosphere arrangement comprises at
   least one injection device including an injection pump and/or one injection valve 31 acting
   on at least one injection pipe 32 connecting the inside of said chamber to the a source of
   gas (not shown) which may be located remotely from the apparatus 1; the control unit 100
10 may be configured to control opening and closing of the injection valve (or activation of
   the injection pump) 31 to inject said stream of gas at least when the packaging assembly 8
   is in said second operating condition, i.e. with said packaging chamber 24 hermetically
   closed.
                    The control unit 100 may also be configured to control the composition of the
15 modified atmosphere generated inside the chamber 24. For instance the control unit 100
   may regulate the composition of the gas stream injected into the packaging chamber. The
   gas mixtures injected into the packaging chamber to generate a modified atmosphere may
   vary depending upon the nature of product P. In general modified atmosphere mixtures
   include a volumetric quantity of one or more of N 2 , 02 and CO 2 which is different from the
20 quantity of these same gases as present in the atmosphere at 20'C and sea level (1
   atmosphere pressure). If product P is a produce such as meat, poultry, fish, cheese, bakery
   or pasta the following gas mixtures may be used (quantities are expressed in volume
   percentages at 20'C, latm of pressure):
                    - Red meats, Poultry skinless:                          02=70%, C0 2 =30%
25                  - Poultry with skin on, Cheese, Pasta, Bakery products: C0 2=50%, N 2 =50%
                    - Fish                                                  C0 2=70%,   N2=30%   or
                                                                            C0 2=40%,       N2=30%,

                                                                 - 42
                    According to one aspect the control unit 100 may be configured to control said
   injection pump or said injection valve 31 to start injecting said stream of gas either after a
   prefixed delay from activation of said vacuum pump 28 or after a prefixed level of vacuum
   has been reached inside said packaging chamber 24. In a further aspect the control unit 100
 5 may cause the start of the injecting of said stream of gas for creating a modified
   atmosphere while said vacuum pump 28 is still active so as to shorten the time for creating
   the modified atmosphere. Moreover as it is preferable to avoid having very strong vacuum
   in the packaging chamber 24 and at the same time                    it is desirable to ensure a proper
   atmosphere inside the chamber it is advantageous stopping the vacuum pump after opening
10 the gas injection. In this way pressure inside the chamber never goes below a desired
   value. During the overlap the gas injected is mixed with residual air and continuing to pull
   vacuum the mix air-modified atmosphere continues to be removed so that the amount of
   initial air is decreased.
                    According to a further aspect, it is noted that the control unit 100 is configured to
15 control said injection pump 31 such that
                    gas flow is not injected at a too high speed which may damage the firm holding of
   the cut film by the upper tool. Control unit 100 may control gas injection at a gas pressure
   set below a limit to prevent film detachment from or film mis-positioning in
   correspondence of upper tool 21 (injection pressure is kept between 1.3 and 4.0 bar
20 optionally or between 1.5 and 3.0 bars).
                    Note that in the examples shown the evacuation pipe 29 and the injection pipe 32
   communicate with a lower portion of the packaging chamber which is separated from an
   upper portion of the packaging chamber due to the presence of said inner wall or walls 23
   which define a sort of separation septum. In order to allow proper circulation of gas within
25 the entire packaging chamber the upper and lower portions of packaging chamber 8 are
   fluidly connected by apertures or channels located in proximity or at the inner wall 23.
   These apertures or channels (see e.g. figures 3-5) are positioned such as not to be occluded
   by the tray walls when the tray is positioned in the seats 23b.

                                                                 - 43
                    Although the apparatus 1 may have one or both the vacuum arrangement 27 and the
   controlled atmosphere arrangement 30, it is to be understood that the control unit 100 of
   the apparatus 1 may also be configured to tightly engage the film sheets 18 to the trays
   without activating the vacuum arrangement or the controlled atmosphere arrangement and
 5 thus leaving the normal environment atmosphere within the tray. This may be for instance
   the case for non perishable products. In a more simple version the apparatus 1 may be
   designed without vacuum arrangement and without modified atmosphere arrangement.
                    Entering now into a more detailed description of the packaging assembly 8, it
   should be noted that this latter further comprises a main actuator 33 active on at least one
10 of said upper and lower tool 21, 22: in the example of figures 2-8, the first actuator 33 is
   carried by frame 2 and acts onto the lower tool 22 under the control of control unit 100; in
   practice the main actuator 33 may include a piston (the piston may be replaced by any
   other kind of electric, pneumatic or hydraulic linear actuator) configured for lifting and
   lowering the lower tool 22 along a direction transverse to said horizontal direction Al: in
15 the example of figures 1-8 the lower tool can be vertically lifted and lowered by main
   actuator 33 as indicated by the double arrow A5 shown in Figure 1. The control unit 100 is
   configured for acting on the main actuator 33 and causing movement of lower tool 22,
   along the prefixed main direction indicated by arrow A5, between said first operating
   condition (figures 2 and 3), where the upper tool 21 is spaced apart from the lower tool 22
20 and said packaging chamber 24 is open to receive one or more of said film sheets 18, and
   said second operating condition (figure 4), where a closure surface 34 of the upper tool 21
   tightly abuts against a closure surface 35 of the lower tool 22 to hermetically close said
   packaging chamber 24 with respect to an atmosphere outside the apparatus; at said closure
   surfaces 34 and 35 a gasket or other element for facilitating a gas tight closure may be
25 positioned. As above mentioned, the control unit synchronizes opening and closure of the
   packaging chamber with movement of the backing structure 16.
                    Once the chamber 24 has been closed, and after operation of the vacuum and/or
   controlled atmosphere arrangement, the control unit is configured to act on main actuator
   33 to impose a further vertical movement to the lower tool and thus also to the upper tool

   H:\ejl\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\EJL\15916247_l.docx-09 It 2017
                                                                 - 44
   as this latter abuts now against the lower tool (figure 6) such that the film sheet 18 is
   brought into contact with the rim 4c of tray 4. Note that elastic elements 55 may be
   interposed between the upper tool and the frame (such as one or more compression springs
   and/or one or more pneumatic actuators) to elastically push the upper tool against the
 5 lower tool.
                    Also note that at each seat 23b operates at least one inner element 50, which in the
   apparatus of figures 1-8 includes a stem 51 and a terminal plate 52, configured for
   supporting at least the base 4a the tray or support 4. The inner element is movable relative
   to the lower tool 22 at least along the main direction of double arrow A5 direction: in the
10 embodiment shown (see e.g. figure 9) the stem 51 may slide through an opening 53 on the
   bottom 54 of the lower tool 22 in order to allow relative movement between said inner
   element 50 and lower tool 22. Note that the inner element may be controlled by a
   respective actuator (not shown) or it may be directly carried by frame 2. In the examples
   shown case where the lower tool is mobile up and down as above described, the inner
15 element 50 may remain vertically fixed at least until the terminal plate reaches bottom 54
   of the lower tool (see figures 4-7).
                    Going in further detail the upper tool 21 has at least one holding plate 36 having a
   respective active surface 37 configured for receiving the one or more film sheets 18 and
   means 38 for holding the one or more film sheets 18 in correspondence of said active
20 surface 37. The means 38 for holding may comprise a vacuum source 39, e.g. in the form
   of a pump, controlled by the control unit 100 and connected to a plurality of suction holes
   48 present in correspondence of the active surface 37: the control unit 100 may be
   configured for activating the vacuum source 39 and causing the film holding plate 36 to
   receive and hold said one or more film sheets 18 in correspondence of the active surface
25 37. In particular, the control unit 100 may be configured for coordinating activation of
   vacuum source 39 with proper positioning of the cut film sheet 18 by the backing plate 16:
   for instance the control unit 100 may activate the vacuum source 39 and cause the film
   holding plate 36 to receive and hold said one or more film sheets 18 in correspondence of
   the active surface 37, when the backing structure 16 carrying the cut film 18 is properly

   positioned within the packaging chamber underneath the holding plate 36. Note that in
   addition or in alternative to vacuum source 39 the means for holding 38 may include one
   or more of the following:
                                   -              mechanical holders, such as pincers, clamps or the like,
 5                                 -              adhesive       systems,   for instance   comprising adhesive  portions
                     associated to the active surface 37,
                                   -              heating systems, for instance          comprising heatable portions
                     controlled by control unit 100 - associated to the holding plate for causing heating
                     of the active surface 37 and thus of the film sheet 18 in order to increase stickiness
10                   of the film sheet to the active surface 37,
                                   -              electric systems, for instance the active surface 37 may be charged
                    with a polarity different from that typical of the plastic sheet 18. In this case the
                     control unit may be connected to a voltage generator and may control the electric
                     charging of surface 37.
15                  As it will be further disclosed herein below when describing the operation of the
   apparatus 1, the control unit may be configured to create a vacuum in the packaging
   chamber 24 (by controlling the vacuum pump 28 to withdraw gas from said packaging
   chamber 24) until a pressure comprised between 100 and 300 mbar, optionally between
    150 and 250 mbar, is reached. This pressure level is sufficiently low but not too low so that
20 detachment of the film sheet from the holding plate 36 is avoided as the control unit also
   creates a pressure level in correspondence of the suction holes 48, by acting on vacuum
   source 39, below the pressure level in the packaging chamber.
                    As shown in figures 2-8 the packaging assembly 8 has a heating structure 40
   peripherally associated to the film holding plate 36 and having a respective heating surface
25 41 which extends radially outside with respect to the active surface 37 of the holding plate
   36. In practice the holding plate 36 is sized to cover only a central portion 18a of the cut
   film sheet 18 while the heating surface 41 of the heating structure 40 is designed to heat a
   peripheral portion 18b of the cut film sheet 18 surrounding said central portion. The
   packaging assembly 8 and particularly the heating structure 40 is positioned and

   H:\ejl\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\EJL\15916247_l.docx-09 It 2017
                                                                 - 46
   configured such that at least when the packaging assembly 8 is in said second operating
   condition, the heating surface 41 of the heating structure 40 faces the end surface 23a of
   said inner wall 23 delimiting one of said seats 23b in the lower tool 22. Note that in the
   example of figures 2-8 the heating structure 40 and film holding plate 36 are initially
 5 positioned such that heating surface 41 is retracted with respect to active surface 37
   (figures 2-6); on the other hand, also the heating structure 40 and the holding plate 36 are
   relatively movable the one with respect to the other along said main (vertical) direction
   represented by double arrow A5. More in detail the holding plate 36 is terminally carried
   by a shaft 36a slidably coupled relative to the heating structure 40 and having an abutting
10 portion 36b designed to cooperate with the upper tool and with the heating structure as it
   will be here below explained. An elastic element 60 (which may be e.g. a spring or a
   pneumatic actuator) may be interposed between the holding plate and the heating structure:
   the elastic element 60 allows the positioning of the holding plate 36 as shown in figures 4
   6 since the elastic element 60 tends to push the holding plate downwards (the downward
15 stroke of the holding plate 36 relative to the heating structure 40 is limited by abutting
   portion 36a interfering with the heating structure 40). The control unit 100 is connected to
   the heating structure 40 and configured for controlling heating of the heating structure 40
   such that the heating surface 41 is brought at least to a first temperature (selected based on
   the materials used for the film sheet 18 and the tray 7 to be adequate for sealing at least the
20 peripheral portion of the cut film sheet to the tray rim).
                    Note that according to a variant, heating means may be integrated in the film
   holding plate 36 which may be configured to heat the active surface 37 such a way to bring
   it at least to a second temperature. The heating means can be connected with the control
   unit 100 and the control unit be configured for controlling the heating means such that the
25 active surface 37 of the film holding plate 36 is brought at least to said second temperature.
   Depending upon the circumstances the first and second temperatures may be equal or
   different. Advantageously, the control unit 100 is configured for independently controlling
   the heating means and the heating structure 40 and to independently set the first and
   second temperatures. In this way, the control unit 100 may allow an operator to properly
30 set the temperature of the heated parts of the upper tool 21 (active surface 37 and heating

   the bond between film sheet 18 and support or tray 7. In particular: the control unit 100
   may be configured to control the first and second temperatures as follows:
                      - in case of shrinkable films 10 being used, then the control unit may only cause
 5 heating of the heating surface 41, optionally only when this latter is pressed against the rim
   4c of tray 4,
                    - in case of non heat shrinkable films 10 being used, then the control unit may cause
   heating of the entire film sheet with the first and second temperatures being e.g. equal,
                    - in case of skin packaging then the control unit may cause heating of the entire
10 film sheet, e.g. with the second temperature being higher than the first temperature.
                    Under a constructional point of view, as shown in figures 20-22, the heating
   structure 40 may include a metallic body embedding at least one resistive and/or inductive
   element 70 connected to a power supply; in this case the control unit 100 is configured for
   controlling the power supply to continuously supply current to the resistive or inductive
15 element 70 such as to keep the temperature of the heating surface 41 within a prefixed
   range around said first temperature.
                    In addition to or independently of the latter, the heating structure 40 may include at
   least one metallic wire 71 directly carried by the heating surface 41 of the heating structure
   40; the metallic wire is connected to a power supply and to the control unit 100 which is
20 configured for controlling the power supply to supply current to the metallic wire during
   discrete time intervals. In practice the thermal inertia of wire 71 is so small that the control
   unit may be programmed cause the power supply to provide current for short time
   intervals, e.g. when sealing of the film sheet 18 to the support needs to take place. During
   the rest of the cycle described above, the power supply does not feed current to wire 71
25 which is basically at ambient temperature. This is useful when dealing with shrinkable
   films.
                    Alternatively or in addition of the latters, the heating structure 40 may include a
   printed circuit 72 formed onto said heating surface 41 of the heating structure 40; the
   printed circuit is connected to a power supply and to the control unit 100 which is

   configured for controlling the power supply to supply current to the printed circuit for
   short time intervals , e.g. when sealing of the film sheet 18 to the support needs to take
   place. During the rest of the cycle described above, the power supply does not feed current
   to wire 71 which is basically at ambient temperature. This is useful when dealing with
 5 shrinkable films.
                    As to the heating means which may be associated to the holding plate 36, also the
   heating means may include at least one resistive and/or inductive element embedded in the
   body of the holding plate and connected to a power supply; in this case the control unit 100
   is configured for controlling the power supply to supply current to the resistive or
10 inductive element such as to keep the temperature of the active surface 37 of the holding
   plate 36 within a prefixed range around said second temperature.
                    In addition to or independently of the latter, the holding plate may include at least
   one metallic wire directly carried by the active surface 37 of the holding plate 36 and
   connected to a power supply and to the control unit 100 which is configured for controlling
15 the power supply to supply current to the metallic wire during discrete time intervals. In
   practice the thermal inertia of wire is so small that the control unit may be programmed to
   cause the power supply to provide current for short time. During the rest of the cycle
   described above, the power supply does not feed current to wire which is basically at

25 ambient temperature.
                    Note that, when the film is heat shrinkable, using the heating means may serve to
   tension the central portion of the film 18, after having fixed the film perimeter to the
   rim 4c.

                    As a further variant an ultrasound generator may be used in place of or in addition
   to the heating structure and/or heating means; the ultrasound generator - if present - is
   configured to convey pressure energy (in the form of high frequency acoustic waves) in
   correspondence of the area occupied by the peripheral surface 18b of the film sheet 18 and
 5 by the rim 4c of support 4. The control unit may be programmed to control the ultrasound
   generator to cause emission of acoustic waves at least when the film sheet and the tray 4
   are brought in mutual contact as shown in figure 7.
                    As another variant a generator of electromagnetic waves may be used in place of or
   in addition to the heating structure and/or heating means; the electromagnetic generator - if
10 present - is configured to focus electromagnetic energy (in the form of high frequency
   electromagnetic waves) in correspondence of the area occupied by the peripheral surface
    18b of the film sheet 18 and by the rim 4c of support 4. The control unit may be
   programmed to control the generator to cause emission of electromagnetic waves at least
   when the film sheet and the tray 4 are brought in mutual contact as shown in figure 7.
15                  After the above structural description of the first embodiment of apparatus 1 here
   below operation of the first embodiment is disclosed. The operation takes place under
   control of control unit 100 and achieves a process of packaging a product in a tray. In this
   case the described process allows packaging under modified atmosphere. In any case the
   apparatus 1 is also capable of making a skin packaging of the product. Moreover, the
20 apparatus 1 may be used for applying a lid to a tray and thus packaging in normal ambient
   atmosphere.
                    The trays are progressively moved to the packaging assembly 8 by transport
   assembly 3. At the same time the pinch rolls allow unrolling of film from roll 10 and the
   cutting assembly prepares the cut film sheets in number and size corresponding exactly to
25 the trays to be closed. In practice the film sheets may be cut to a size copying that of the
   outer border of the rim 4c or they may be cut to a size radially smaller than the outer edge
   of rim 4c but sufficient to tightly close the mouth of the tray 4 and sealingly engage the rim
   4c top surface.

                                                                       - 50
                    In the apparatus 1 of figures 2-8 the packaging assembly includes, as described
   above, a main actuator 33. The main actuator is in the example shown carried by frame 2
   and acts on lower tool 22 under the control of control unit 100 for lifting and lowering the
   lower along main direction A5, which is basically a vertical direction. In practice after the
 5 transfer device 7 has moved the cut film sheet 18 into the packaging chamber 24 and the
   holding plate 36 has received the cut film sheet (see figures 2 and 3), the control unit 100
   controls the main actuator 33 to close the packaging chamber 24 (figure 4) by lifting the
   lower tool 22 such that inner wall 33 intercepts the support 4 which is lifted and separated
   from inner element 50. Also note that during the phases depicted in figures 2-4 the abutting
10 portion 36b interferes with a part integral with the heating structure so that the elastic bias
   exerted by element 60 may cause only a limited relative downward stroke of the holding
   plate relative to the heating structure. At this point, the packaging chamber is hermetically
   closed and film sheet is hold by holding plate 36 at a certain distance from the mouth of
   the tray or support 4: as shown in figure 4 the vacuum arrangement is activated and a
15 certain degree of vacuum created. Then, immediately after or during vacuum creation, the
   controlled atmosphere arrangement is actuated (figure 5) and a controlled atmosphere
   created inside the packaging chamber. In certain variants only the vacuum arrangement or
   only the controlled atmosphere arrangement may be actuated. Note that in case one wants
   to operate the apparatus 1 to simply apply a lid to a tray 4, then the vacuum arrangement
20 and the modified atmosphere arrangement may not be activated. A further vertical
   movement imposed onto the lower tool 22 by main actuator 33 wins the reaction of the
   elastic elements 55 (see figure 6) and brings the film sheet hold by holding plate in contact
   to the rim 4c of the support 4. In this position the upper tool 21 interferes with the
   abutment portion 36b: in the example of figures 2-8 a protrusion 21a fixed to the upper
25 tool touches the abutting portion 36b so that further vertical movement of the lower tool
   would cause vertical movement of the upper tool, of the abutting portion 36b and thus of
   the holding plate 36. The control unit 10 is then configured to operate the main actuator 33
   to further lift the lower tool 22,                            winning the reaction of elastic element 60 and thus
   causing the holding plate 36 to lift and the active surface 37 and heating surface 41 to
30 perfectly align (figure 7). At this point, when the heating surface 41 of the heating structure

                                                                 -51
   40 contacts the peripheral portion 18b of the film sheet 18 positioned above a support 4,
   the control unit 100 causes heating of the heating structure 40 such that the heating surface
   41 at least partially fuses plastic material of the peripheral portion of the film sheet 18
   and/or of the rim 4c thereby sealing the cut film sheet to the tray. Then the control unit
 5 lowers the lower tool 22, and thus the packaging chamber 24 may be opened to allow the
   tray to proceed downstream the packaging assembly. The cycle may then be repeated.
   Second embodiment of the apparatus 1
                    In figures 9-12 a second embodiment of apparatus 1 is shown. The general structure
   of figure 1 may also apply to this second embodiment. For sake of conciseness only the
10 aspects and components of this second embodiment differing from those of the first
   embodiment will be described; the remaining aspects and components are the same as in
   the first embodiment and have been identified with same reference numerals. The
   differences with respect to the first embodiment concern the packaging assembly: in the
   case of figures 9-11 the packaging assembly 8 comprises at least a side wall 42 movably
15 associated to one of the upper tool 21 or lower tool 22. In the example illustrated in figure
   9, the side wall 42 is associated to lower tool 22 and tightly slides along direction A5 (e.g.
   vertically) in correspondence of the lateral surface of the lower tool. The side wall may be
   a single side wall or may be formed by a plurality of side walls, each one acting on a
   respective side of the lower tool 22 and normally pushed upwards by the action of a
20 respective elastic element 80 (such as e.g. a spring or a pneumatic actuator). In the case of
   figures 9-11 the main actuator 33 carried by frame 102 acts onto the lower tool 22 under
   the control of control unit 100 and vertically lifts and lowers the lower tool as indicated by
   the double arrow A5. The control unit 100 is configured for moving lower tool 22 between
   said first operating condition, where the upper tool 21 is spaced apart from the lower tool
25 22 and the side wall 42 is at a distance from the lower surface of the upper tool (figure 9
   with packaging chamber open), and said second operating condition, where the surface 43a
   of the side wall 42 tightly abuts against abutment surface, e.g. lower surface, 43b of the
   upper tool (figure 10 with packaging chamber 24 closed with respect to an atmosphere
   outside the apparatus).

                                                                 - 52
                    As above mentioned, the control unit 100 synchronizes opening and closure of the
   packaging chamber with movement of the backing structure 16 of transfer device 7 which
   is structured and operates as in embodiment 1.
                    In the second condition shown in figure 10, the packaging chamber is hermetically
 5 closed but the film sheet is maintained at a distance from the rim 4c so that the vacuum
   arrangement and/or the controlled atmosphere arrangement may be operated as described
   for embodiment 1. The control unit may then operate the main actuator 33 to cause a
   further upward movement of the lower tool such that the film sheet held in position by the
   holder plate 36 is pressed against rim 4c of support 4. This further stroke of the lower tool
10 causes a retraction (i.e. a downward movement) of the side wall(s) 42 winning the reaction
   of element(s) 80. Thanks to the presence of the side wall(s) 42, the upper tool may present
   a completely flat lower surface as shown in figures 9-11.
                    Also note that, in a manner similar to embodiment 1, at each seat 23b operates at
   least one inner element 50, which includes a stem 51 and a terminal plate 52, configured
15 for supporting at least the base 4a the tray or support 4. The inner element is movable
   relative to the lower tool 22 at least along the direction of double arrow A5 direction: the
   stem 51 may slide through an opening 53 on the bottom 54 of the lower tool 22 in order to
   allow relative movement between said inner element 50 and lower tool 22. Note that the
   inner element may be controlled by a respective actuator (not shown) or it may be directly
20 carried by frame 2. In the examples shown case where the lower tool is mobile up and
   down as above described, the inner element 50 may remain vertically fixed at least until
   the terminal plate reaches bottom 54 of the lower tool (see figure 11).
                    Going in further detail the upper tool 21 has at least one holding plate 36 having a
   respective active surface 37 which is flush to the bottom surface of the lower tool and
25 which is sufficiently sized to contain the entire film sheet 18. In other words, the holding
   plate covers the entire radial span of the end surface 23a and thus also of rim 4c. The
   holding plate 36 is rigidly coupled to the upper tool 21 such that the film holding plate 36
   is not relatively movable with respect to the upper tool 21 at least along a direction A5
   transverse to the horizontal direction Al. The means 38 for holding may comprise a

                                                                           -  53
   vacuum source 39, e.g. in the form of a pump, controlled by the control unit 100 and
   connected to a plurality of suction holes 48 present in correspondence of the active surface
   37. Note that in addition or in alternative to vacuum source 39 the means for holding 38
   may include one or more of the following:
 5                                 -              mechanical holders, such as pincers, clamps or the like,
                                   -              adhesive        systems,   for instance comprising adhesive portions
                     associated to the active surface 37,
                                   -              heating        systems,  for   instance comprising heatable portions
                     associated to the holding plate for causing heating of the active surface 37 and thus
10                   of the film sheet 18 in order to increase stickiness of the film sheet to the active
                     surface 37,
                                   -              electrostatic systems, for instance the active surface 37 may be
                     charged with a polarity different from that typical of the plastic sheet 18.
                    The control unit 100 may be configured for controlling the means 38, e.g. for
15 activating the vacuum source 39, and causing the film holding plate 36 to receive and hold
   said one or more film sheets 18 in correspondence of the active surface 37. In particular,
   the control unit 100 may be configured for coordinating activation of the means 38, e.g. the
   vacuum source 39, with proper positioning of the cut film sheet 18 by the backing plate 16:
   for instance the control unit 100 may activate the means 38, e.g. the vacuum source 39, and
20 cause the film holding plate 36 to receive and hold said one or more film sheets 18 in
   correspondence of the active surface 37, when the backing structure 16 carrying the cut
   film 18 is properly positioned within the packaging chamber underneath the holding plate
   36. Heating means may be integrated in the film holding plate 36 which may be configured
   to heat the active surface 37. The heating means can be connected with the control unit 100
25 and the control unit be configured for controlling the heating means such that the active
   surface 37 of the film holding plate 36 is brought to the desired temperature. The heating
   means may be of the type described for embodiment 1. The control unit may control the
   heating means to generate a first temperature in the peripheral portion of the surface 37 and
   a second temperature in the central portion of the surface 37. The first and second

   second temperatures as follows:
                      - in case of shrinkable films 10 being used, then the control unit may only cause
   heating of the peripheral portion of the active surface 37, optionally only when this latter is
   pressed against the rim 4c of tray 4,
 5                  - in case of non heat shrinkable films 10 being used, then the control unit may cause
   heating of the entire surface 37 and thus of the entire film sheet with the first and second
   temperatures being e.g. equal,
                    - in case of skin packaging then the control unit may cause heating of the entire
   active surface 37 and thus of the entire film sheet, e.g. with the second temperature being
10 higher than the first temperature.
                    After the above structural description of the second embodiment of apparatus 1
   here below operation of the second embodiment is disclosed. The operation takes place
   under control of control unit 100 and achieves an alternative process of packaging a
   product in a tray. In this case the described process allows packaging under modified
15 atmosphere. In any case the apparatus 1 is also capable of making a skin packaging of the
   product. The apparatus may also be used for applying a lid to a tray with normal ambient
   atmosphere.
                    After the transfer device 7 has moved the cut film sheet 18 into the packaging
   chamber 24 and the holding plate 36 has received the cut film sheet (see figure 9), the
20 control unit 100 controls the main actuator 31 to close the packaging chamber 24 (figure
    10) by lifting the lower tool 22 such that inner wall 33 intercepts the support 4 and the side
   wall 42 abuts against the upper tool 21. At this point the packaging chamber is
   hermetically closed by the side walls acting against lower surface 43b of the upper tool 21
   and film sheet 4 is hold by holding plate 36 at a certain distance from the mouth of the tray
25 or support 4: the vacuum arrangement may be activated and a certain degree of vacuum
   created. Then, immediately after or during vacuum creation, the controlled atmosphere
   arrangement may be actuated and a controlled atmosphere created inside the packaging
   chamber. A further vertical movement imposed onto the lower tool by main actuator 33
   wins the reaction of the elastic element 80 and allows the holding plate 36 to bring the cut

   film sheet into contact with the rim 4c; the control unit 100 causes heating of the heating
   means and sealing of the peripheral portion of the cut film sheet to the tray rim. Then the
   control unit lowers the lower unit, and thus the packaging chamber 24 may be opened to
   allow the tray to proceed downstream the packaging assembly. The cycle may then be
 5 repeated.
   Third embodiment of the apparatus 1
                    In figures 12-16 a third embodiment of apparatus 1 is shown. For sake of
   conciseness only the aspects and components of this second embodiment differing from
   those of the first embodiment will be described; the remaining aspects and components are
10 the same as in the first embodiment and have been identified with same reference
   numerals. The differences with respect to the first embodiment concern the packaging
   assembly: in the case of figures 12-16 the upper tool 21 has at least one holding plate 36
   having a respective active surface 37: the holding plate 36 is terminally carried by shaft
   36a and covers the entire radial span of the end surface 23a and thus also of rim 4c. The
15 holding plate shaft is coupled to the upper tool 21 to allow at least movement along
   direction of double arrow A5 as it will be explained herein below. The means 38 for
   holding may comprise a vacuum source 39, e.g. in the form of a pump, controlled by the
   control unit 100 and connected to a plurality of suction holes 48 present in correspondence
   of the active surface 37. Note that in addition or in alternative to vacuum source 39 the

                    The control unit 100 may be configured for activating the means 28, e.g. vacuum
   source 39, and causing the film holding plate 36 to receive and hold said one or more film
   sheets 18 in correspondence of the active surface 37. In particular, the control unit 100 may
   be configured for coordinating activation of the means 28, e.g. of vacuum source 39, with
 5 proper positioning of the cut film sheet 18 by the backing plate 16: for instance the control
   unit 100 may activate the means 28, e.g. vacuum source 39, and cause the film holding
   plate 36 to receive and hold said one or more film sheets 18 in correspondence of the
   active surface 37, when the backing structure 16 carrying the cut film 18 is properly
   positioned within the packaging chamber underneath the holding plate 36. Heating means
10 may be integrated in the film holding plate 36 which may be configured to heat the active
   surface 37. No heating structure 40 analogous to that of embodiment 1 is present in
   embodiment 3. The heating means can be connected with the control unit 100 and the
   control unit be configured for controlling the heating means such that the active surface 37
   of the film holding plate 36 is brought to the desired temperature. The heating means may
15 be of the type described for embodiment 2.
                    After the above structural description of the third embodiment of apparatus 1 here
   below operation of the third embodiment is disclosed. The operation takes place under
   control of control unit 100 and achieves a process of packaging a product in a tray. In this
   case the described process allows a skin packaging of the product. In any case the
20 apparatus 1 is also capable of making a packaging under modified atmosphere.
   Furthermore, the apparatus may be used to apply a film lid with normal ambient
   atmosphere remaining in the tray or support 4.
                    In the apparatus 1 of figures 12-16 after the transfer device 7 has moved the cut
   film sheet 18 into the packaging chamber 24 and the holding plate 36 has received the cut
25 film sheet (see figure 12), the control unit 100 controls the main actuator 33 to close the
   packaging chamber 24 (figure 13) by lifting the lower tool 22 such that inner wall 33
   intercepts the support 4. At this point, the packaging chamber is hermetically closed and
   film sheet is hold by holding plate 36 at a certain distance from the mouth of the tray or
   support 4: as shown in figure 13 the vacuum arrangement may be activated and a certain

                                                                 - 57
   degree of vacuum created. A further vertical movement imposed onto the lower tool 22 by
   main actuator 33 wins the reaction of the elastic elements 55 (see figure 14) and brings the
   film sheet hold by holding plate in contact to the rim 4c of the support 4. The heating
   means cause a heating of the film sheet 18 positioned above a support 4: the film sheet is
 5 selected to be adequate for vacuum packaging and the heating surface is heated to a
   temperature allowing facilitating subsequent deformation of the film sheet central portion
    18a film. Then the control unit causes the pump 39 to pump gas (instead of operating as a
   vacuum source) and thereby cause the draping down of the film sheet onto the product.
   Note that alternatively the control unit may simply connect the suction holes 48 to the
10 atmosphere as atmospheric pressure is in most of the case sufficient. Further heating
   generated by the heat means may facilitate sealing of the peripheral portion of the film
   sheet to rim 4c (see figure 15). The control unit 100 operates the main actuator to lower the
   lower tool 22, and thus the packaging chamber 24 may be opened to allow the tray to
   proceed downstream the packaging assembly. The cycle may then be repeated.
15 Further variants
                    In the case of figures 17-19 (which may be applied to any one of the embodiments
   described above or claimed), in which the lower tool 22 is provided with multiple seats
   23b, the apparatus comprises a plurality of distinct backing structures 16 each comprising a
   flat holding surface 17 adapted for receiving one respective of said film sheets 18; each of
20 the backing structures 16 is movable between at least the cutting assembly 6, to pick up the
   respective film sheet 18, and the inside of the chamber 24, to position the cut film sheet 18
   in correspondence of the respective upper tool 21 holding plate 36. In this case, one or
   more transfer actuators 47 would be active on the backing structures 16: there may be one
   transfer actuator dedicated to each structure 16 or one actuator dedicated to a move a set of
25 said structures (e.g. all structures on the same row) or one single transfer actuator
   configured for contemporaneously move all structures 16. The transfer actuator or
   actuators 47 are configured for allowing movement of the backing structures 16 and thus
   of cut film sheets 18 from the cutting assembly 6 to inside of the packaging chamber 24.
   The transfer actuator or actuators 47 is/are controlled by the control unit 100 such that to

   mutually space apart the backing structures 16 before, when or subsequent to moving the
   backing structures 16 from the cutting assembly 6 to the inside the packaging chamber 24.
   This is shown in figures 18 and 19 schematically representing an example where a
   plurality of backing structures 16 - before, or when moving into the chamber, or
 5 subsequent to movement into the chamber, are                                further spaced apart in both X and Y
   directions (X and Y directions are two mutually perpendicular and reference directions
   parallel to the lying plane of the cut film sheets in correspondence of the cutting station).
   The transfer actuators may in this case include one or more pistons: any combination of
   electric, pneumatic or hydraulic actuators may be adopted.
10                  Finally, as shown in the figure from 23 to 31, the packaging assembly 8 may
   include a number of pusher elements 44 useful to support the means 38 for fixing sheet 18
   on the active surface 37. This aspect too may be applied to any one of the embodiments
   described above or claimed.
                    In particular, pusher elements 44 are adapted to move from a release position,
15 where active portions 45 of the pusher elements 44 are spaced from the active surface 37
   (see figures 25 and 31) of the holding plate 36, to an engage position (see figures 24, 27,
   and 30), where active portions 45 of the pusher elements 44 press the cut film sheet 18
   border portions against said active surface 37 of the holding plate 36.
                    Pusher elements 44 may include one selected in the group of:

                Processes of packaging in accordance with aspects of the invention are now

                The following processes may be executed by the apparatus according to any one of

   one of the above embodiments or as claimed in any one of the appended claims.
                    The trays (or supports) 4 are progressively moved to the packaging assembly 8, e.g.
   by transport assembly 3. At the same time the film 1Oa is unrolled from roll 10 and the
 5 cutting assembly 6 acting outside packaging chamber 8 prepares the cut film sheets 18 in
   number and size corresponding exactly to the trays to be closed. In practice the film sheets
   may be cut to a size copying that of the outer border of the rim 4c (e.g. exactly identical or
   slightly larger than that of the outer border of rim 4c) or they may be cut to a size radially
   smaller than the outer edge of rim 4c but sufficient to tightly close the mouth of the tray 4
10 and sealingly engage the rim 4c top surface. In other words the radial width of the cut film
   sheets may be comprised between the maximum radial width and the minimum radial
   width of the rim 4c of tray or support 4.
                    The tray preparation may be made beforehand or the trays may be formed online at
   a forming station during the cutting of film sheets. The cutting of the film 10a into film
15 sheets 18 takes place at a station remote from the location where the film sheets are
   coupled to the tray. The cut film sheet or - in case a plurality of trays are treated at a time
   a plurality of cut film sheets are moved to the packaging assembly 8. As just described the
   film sheet(s) are/is cut from the continuous film before being moved inside the packaging
   chamber. The packaging assembly 8 is left open for a time sufficient for a number of trays
20 4 and for a corresponding number of film sheets 18 to properly position inside the
   packaging chamber 24 defined in the packaging assembly. The transfer device 7 may be
   used as described above in order to move inside the packaging chamber 24 the film sheets
   which have been cut outside the packaging assembly 8. Basically the film sheet laying on
   the backing structure 16, once cut, is carried by the backing structure inside the chamber
25 24 in front of the upper tool which is configured to pick the cut film sheet8s) from the
   backing structure 16. The backing structure 16 releases the cut film sheet to the upper tool
   and returns back outside the packaging chamber. Then the packaging assembly 8 is closed
   and the film sheets are held above the respective tray but at a distance sufficient to allow
   gas circulation inside the tray. The packaging chamber is hermetically closed in the sense

                                                                 - 62
   that only controlled streams of gas may be withdrawn and/or injected into the chamber 24
   under the supervision of apparatus 1 (note that in case the closure of the tray need no
   vacuum and or no controlled atmosphere then the packaging chamber may be simply
   closed without an hermetical closure). At this point, the packaging process may vary
 5 depending upon the type of packaging and depending upon the type of film sheet available.
                    If, e.g. a non heat shrinkable film sheet is being used as tray lid, and if it is intended
   to create a modified atmosphere packaging, then a partial vacuum is created inside the
   packaging chamber and a gas for modified atmosphere contemporaneously or subsequently
   injected. When a partial vacuum is formed in the packaging chamber 24 (e.g. by the
10 control unit 100 controlling the vacuum pump 28 to withdraw gas from said packaging
   chamber 24) gas is withdrawn until a pressure comprised between 100 and 300 mbar,
   optionally between 150 and 250 mbar, is reached inside the packaging chamber 24. This
   pressure level is sufficiently low but not too low, so that detachment of the film sheet from
   the holding plate 36 is avoided as a pressure level is formed in correspondence of the
15 suction holes 48 which is below the pressure level in the packaging chamber. In this phase
   the film sheet(s) is kept by the holding plate which may be provided with means for
   holding the film in proper position as described above. Then, after a prefixed delay from
   start of gas withdrawal (e.g. after a prefixed delay from activation of said vacuum pump
   28) or after a prefixed level of vacuum has been reached inside said packaging chamber
20 24, a modified atmosphere gas in injected into the packaging chamber 8. The injecting of
   said stream of gas for creating a modified atmosphere may be started even while gas
   withdrawal is still ongoing so as to shorten the time for creating the modified atmosphere.
   Moreover as it is preferable to avoid having very strong vacuum in the packaging chamber
   and at the same time it is desirable to ensure a proper atmosphere inside the chamber it is
25 advantageous stopping the vacuum generation after the gas injection has already started. In
   this way pressure inside the chamber never goes below a desired value. During the overlap,
   the gas injected is mixed with residual air and continuing to pull vacuum the mix air
   modified atmosphere gas continues to be removed so that the amount of initial air is in any
   case decreased.

   peripheral film portion 18b and of the rim 4c is brought to a temperature allowing the heat
 5 bonding of the film peripheral portion 18b to the tray 7 rim and a tight closure of the tray
   7. Then, or contemporaneously to heating, the film sheet is lowered and tightly bond to the
   tray. In case ultrasonic or microwave based heaters are used they are operated at this stage
   and also the tray rim 4c may be contemporaneously heated. Once the bonding has been
   completed, the packaging chamber may be opened and the tray provide with a tight lid

   holding the film in proper position as described above. Heat shrinkable films may be very
   thin (e.g. the thickness may go down to a range of 20-40micron) and their handling after
   cutting is difficult so it is relevant that the pressure levels in the packaging chamber and at
25 the holding plate are properly controlled. After a prefixed delay from start of gas
   withdrawal (e.g. after a prefixed delay from activation of said vacuum pump 28) or after a

   operated at this stage and also the tray rim 4c may be contemporaneously heated. The
   holding plate releases the film sheet and normal atmosphere pressure is created above the
   film sheet which thus drapes down and matches the shape of the product P and of the
   inside walls of the tray crating a plastic film skin around the product and on the surfaces of
30 the tray not occupied by product P. In other words, when a predefined low pressure is

                                                                  - 65
   reached within packaging chamber and thus within the tray or support 4 underneath the
   film sheet 18, the film sheet 18 is released and is drawn downwardly by the vacuum within
   the support 4. Since the film sheet 4 is heated (and then softened), under effect of the
   vacuum within the support 4 it deforms so as to adhere to the product P and to the inner
 5 surface of the support 4 (see figures 15 and 16). In practice the film is at least bonded to
   the rim 4c and to portions of the inner surface of the support 4. Once the bonding has been
   completed the packaging chamber may be opened and the tray provided with a tightly
   associate skin formed by film sheet 18 may move out of the packaging chamber.
                    Alternatively, no vacuum may be created and the film is bonded to the tray thus
10 creating a sealed tray with ambient atmosphere at the inside.
                     While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently
   considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that
   the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments, but on the contrary, is
   intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the
15 spirit and the scope of the appended claims.
                     For instance, the elastic elements 55, 60, 80 may be substituted by linear actuators
   controlled by control unit 100.
                     The specific nature of the actuators described is exemplificative and alternative
   types of actuators may be used provided the type of motion imposed to the mobile parts on
20 which said actuators are operating is the same.
                     Also note that although the described embodiments show a single packaging
   assembly 8, multiple packaging assemblies may be used in parallel together with multiple
   transfer devices 7, in order to optimize productivity.
                     While various embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it
25 should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not by
   way of limitation. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the relevant art that various
