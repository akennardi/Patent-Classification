The invention is described in the following statement:

                                           2
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   This invention relates to a method of retrofitting a chassis door to a gaming
   machine.
 5
   BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
   A typical gaming machine includes a chassis, typically of metal, in which is
   contained various componentry of the machine. The componentry usually
10 includes electronics, means for controlling the display of at least one gaming
   machine monitor, which may be located within the chassis or outside the
   chassis on the door of the chassis, components for receiving monetary payment
   such as note feeders and receptacles, slots, hoppers and receptacles for
   receiving coins or other tokens, or other forms of payment receipt components.
15
   The machine typically includes a chassis door mounted on the chassis and
   adapted to open or close, to allow or prevent access to the components within
   the chassis. Because the door is usually on the front of the machine the side
   where a player accesses the machine, a door typically includes formations,
20 openings, slots or the like, which line up with various components of the
   machine, for example to allow the insertion of payments into the machine; to
   provide access to control buttons or levers of the machine; to provide visual
   access to monitors that may be located within the chassis; or that may allow
   the passage of cables, brackets, or the like, for enabling electrical connection
25 to, or attachment of, other components that may be located outside the
   machine, such as externally mounted monitors.
   Such doors are subject to wear as a result of use. For example, the doors are
   often opened to allow repair of components within the machine, to allow
30 removal of payments made into the machine, and to permit general servicing
   and cleaning of the interior of the chassis and components therein.
   The doors are typically of plastic. They are usually relatively cheap when made
   from this material, as they can be moulded on a relatively large scale. However,

                                               3
   a disadvantage of doors of plastic is that they lack inherent strength. As a result,
   they can become easily damaged through use, for example by way of cracking.
   In addition, it is often desirable to replace existing monitors on gaming machines
 5 with new monitors which often have improved performance characteristics, but
   which are often also heavier than the monitors that are being replaced. Because
   of the inherent lack of strength of such plastic doors, they are often not suitable
   for use with heavier monitors.
10 It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate disadvantages
   of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative thereto.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   Gaming machine and the existing door
   Referring to Figures 1 to 3, there is shown an existing gaming machine 10. The
30 gaming machine 10 includes a cabinet 12 having an interior space 14, an

                                             6
   opening 16 to the interior space, and an existing door 18 of plastics material
   mounted to the cabinet by hinge assemblies 20.
   As described further below, the existing door 18 is rotatably movable on the
 5 hinge assemblies 20 between an open position in which the door extends away
   from the opening 16 as shown in Figure 3, and a closed position in which the
   door extends over the opening so as to effectively close the opening, as shown
   in Figure 1.
10 The existing door 18 has a front side 22 which faces away from the interior
   space 14 and the opening 16 when the door in its closed position, and a rear
   side 24 that faces into the interior space when the door is in this closed position.
   There are various gaming machine components within or adjacent to the interior
15 space 14 or on the existing door 18. These are described below.
   Door lock
   Mounted on the existing door 18 is a door lock mechanism 26 (see Figures 3
   and 12). The mechanism 26 includes an elongate slider 28 and a door lock
20 base 30, and a pair of catches 32 rotatably mounted on the slider by a rotatable
   connection 34. The slider 28 is slidably connected to the door lock base 30 and
   is spring-loaded by a spring (not shown) urging the slider downwards relative
   to the door lock base.
25 Each catch 32 includes a slot 36, a lock detent 38, and a catch detent 40. Each
   catch 32 is spring-loaded by a spring (not shown) to the unlocked position
   shown in Figure 12, but is rotatable about the rotatable connection 34 in the
   direction of the arrow 42.
30 When each catch 32 has rotated sufficiently in this direction to a locked position,
   the catch detent 40 of the respective catch engages and travels over a base
   locking pin 44 mounted on the door lock base 30. The part of the catch 32 that
   first engages the base locking pin 44 serves as a cam, forcing the slider to move
   upwards against the force of the biasing spring.

                                            7
   As the catch detent 38 passes the base locking pin 44, the base locking pin
   snaps into place on the trailing side 46 of the catch detent 38, by means of the
   slider 28 moving downwards relative to the door lock base 30.
 5
   The operation of each catch 32 is as follows. There are provided locking pins
   50 on the cabinet 12 (see Figure 3) for engaging with the door lock mechanisms
   26. As the existing door 18 is moved to the closed position, the cabinet locking
   pins 50 enter the slots 36 of the respective catches 32. As each cabinet locking
10 pin 50 enters a respective slot 36, it engages a lower surface 52 of the slot
   thereby forcing the catch 32 in the direction of the arrow 42, until the catch is
   locked in place by the base locking pin 44. As the catch 32 rotates in this
   manner, the angle of the slot 36 rotates accordingly, so that the cabinet locking
   pin 50 is held captive in the slot by the lock detent 40, thereby locking the
15 existing door 18 in the closed position.
   Each catch 32 and hence the existing door 18, can be released by forcing the
   slider 28 upwards relative to the door lock base 30 against its spring loading,
   so that the catch detent 40 of each catch moves clear of the respective cabinet
20 locking pin 50. In this manner, the catch detent 38 is also moved clear of the
   base locking pin 44, so that the spring that operates on the catch 32 causes the
   catch to rotate in a direction opposite to the arrow 42.
   Hinges
25 The hinge assemblies 20 include hinge formations on the existing door,
   complementary hinge formations on the cabinet, and hinge pins for connecting
   the respective hinge formations to each other (these formations and the pins
   not being shown in detail).
30 Display
   The gaming machine 10 includes a display monitor 54 mounted to the cabinet
   12 within the interior space 14, for displaying game images during the playing
   of games, and when the machine is idle between games.

                                            8
   The existing door 18 includes a display aperture 56 through which the monitor
   54 is visible, when the existing door is in its closed position as shown in Figure
   1.
 5 Keyboard
   A keyboard 58 is provided, which includes various buttons 60 for use by a player
   in controlling a game being played on the gaming machine 10. The buttons 60
   are mounted on a support plate 62 which in turn is mounted so as to extend
   over a keyboard and slot aperture 64 in the existing door.
10
   Connection lugs 66 (see Figure 3) for connecting the buttons 60 to the
   electronic circuitry of the gaming machine 10 extend from the rear side of the
   support plate 62. Wires connecting these lugs 66 to the circuitry, as well as
   other wiring forming part of the gaming machine, and the circuitry itself, is not
15 shown.
   Payment receipt means
   The support plate 62 supports a monetary note formation 68 and a coin receipt
   formation 70.
20
   The monetary note formation 68 defines a note receipt slot 72 and the coin
   receipt formation 70 defines a coin receipt slot 74.
   The monetary note slot 72 is positioned so that when the existing door 18 is in
25 the closed position, the monetary note slot is adjacent to a note acceptor 76
   mounted in place in the interior space 14 of the cabinet 12.
   On the rear side of the existing door 18 there is mounted a coin feed mechanism
   78, which has an upper end 80 adjacent a feed formation 81 extending from the
30 coin slot 74. The coin feed mechanism 78 is adapted to receive coins inserted
   through the coin slot 74, and to guide the coins to a coin feed mechanism outlet
   82.

                                              9
   When the existing door 18 is in the closed position, the coin feed mechanism
   outlet 82 is disposed adjacent to a coin receipt chute 84 in the space 14. The
   coin receipt chute 84, in turn defines a path for the coins then to travel into a
   cash box 86 mounted in place in the interior space 14.
 5
   Ticket printer
   A ticket printer 88 is mounted in place in the interior space 14, and is adapted
   to print tickets relating to the playing of a game, for example for representing a
   monetary award that can be redeemed for cash.
10
   Jackpot tray
   Mounted on the front side 22 of the existing door 18 is a jackpot tray 90. The
   existing door 18 includes a coin issue aperture 92 which is adjacent to the cash
   box 86 when the existing door is in the closed position. This allows coins issued
15 by the gaming machine 10 as part of a jackpot payout, to slide from the cash
   box 86 into the jackpot tray 90.
   In addition, the coin issue aperture 92 serves as a ticket slot which is adjacent
   to the ticket printer 88 when the existing door 18 is in the closed position. This
20 allows tickets issued by the gaming machine 10 to drop into the jackpot tray 90.
   Speakers
   The existing door 18 includes speaker apertures 94, with speaker mesh (not
   shown) extending over them. In one embodiment, the speaker apertures 94
25 open through the existing door 18 behind the jackpot tray 90. Speakers 96 are
   mounted to the existing door 18 so as to extend over the speaker apertures 94.
   The speakers 96 are for enabling the generating of sound by the gaming
   machine 10 during the playing of games.
30 Belly area
   The existing door 18 includes a belly area 98 for displaying artwork or
   advertising material (not shown). According to a preferred embodiment, such
   material is provided on a plastic sheet or a sheet of another material covered
   by a transparent plastic sheet.

                                           10
   Replacement door
   Referring to Figures 4 to 12, the present invention relates to a method of
   retrofitting a replacement door 100, of metal, to the cabinet 12, in place of the
 5 existing plastic door 18, as described in more detail below. Components or
   features of the replacement door 100 corresponding to components or features
   of the existing door have the same reference numerals as those items but with
   the addition of the suffix ".1".
10 As can be seen, the replacement door 100 is in the form of a frame having
   various apertures generally designated 102. These are discussed in more detail
   below.
   Door lock
15 The method includes removing the door lock mechanism 26 from the existing
   door 18 by detaching the fasteners (not shown) attaching the door lock
   mechanism to the existing door, and mounting the door lock mechanism on the
   replacement door 100. The method of mounting the door lock mechanism 26 to
   the replacement door 100 is essentially the reverse of that for removing it from
20 the existing door 18, using similar, or even the same, fasteners.
   The lock mechanism 26 is positioned on the replacement door 100 so as to be
   similarly aligned with the cabinet locking pins 50 as the mechanism was when
   mounted on the existing door 18.
25
   Hinge assemblies
   The method of the invention includes removing the existing door 18 from the
   cabinet 12, by disassembling the hinge assemblies 20 holding the door in place
   on the cabinet. This is achieved by removing the existing hinge pins of the hinge
30 assemblies 20.
   Because the replacement door 100 is of metal as compared with the plastics
   material of which the existing door 18 is made, the replacement door is heavier

                                          11
   than the replaced door. Thus, the existing hinge assemblies 20 are not suitable
   for supporting the weight of the replacement door 100.
   Accordingly, the method includes substituting the hinge assemblies 20 of the
 5 existing door 18 with new hinge assemblies 20.1, different parts of which are
   shown in Figures 10 and 11.
   This involves removing the parts of the hinge assemblies 20 mounted on the
   cabinet 12. These may be secured to the cabinet 12 by screws, bolts or other
10 means of fastening such as rivets, and the removal of these parts of the hinge
   assemblies 20 includes removal of these fastening means.
   Parts 104 of the replacement hinge assemblies 20.1 that are to be mounted on
   the cabinet 12 (cabinet parts) are secured to the cabinet by screws 106.
15
   Depending on the particular embodiment of the invention, the cabinet parts 104
   are mounted to the cabinet 12 in different locations to those of the removed
   original hinge assemblies 20.
20 Parts 106 of the replacement hinge assemblies 20.1 that are to be mounted on
   the replacement door 100 are secured to the door by also by screws 106.
   Each of the door parts 106 includes a base portion 110 and a hinge protrusion
   portion 112 having a replacement hinge pin aperture 114 therein.
25
   Each of the cabinet parts 104 includes a body 116 that defines a recess 118,
   with a removable replacement hinge pin 120 extending across the recess.
   Each recess 118 is adapted to enable the hinge protrusion portion 112 of a
30 respective corresponding door part 106 to be accommodated in the recess so
   that the replacement hinge pin 120 can pass through the replacement hinge pin
   aperture 114.

                                           12
   Once the replacement door 100 is mounted on the cabinet 12 using the
   replacement hinge assemblies 20.1, the assembled hinge assembly parts 104,
   106, allow the replacement door to rotate between an open position
   corresponding to the position of the existing door 18 shown in Figure 3, and a
 5 closed position corresponding to the position of the existing door as shown in
   Figure 1.
   Display
   The replacement door 100 includes an upper frame part 122 defining a display
10 aperture , and a protruding portion 126 which protrudes forwards, at the front
   side 22.1 of the door.
   According to one embodiment, the method includes removing the monitor 54
   from the interior space 14 of the cabinet 12 and securing the monitor to the front
15 side 22.1 of the replacement door 100 so that the monitor is substantially
   aligned with the display aperture 124.
   According to another embodiment, the method includes replacing the existing
   monitor 54 with another monitor (not shown).
20
   As the monitor is to be mounted to the front side 22.1 of the replacement door
   100, the original monitor 54 can be replaced by a larger monitor even if the
   lateral dimensions of the replacement monitor exceed the lateral internal
   dimensions of the interior space 14.
25
   For example if the original monitor 54 is a 19 inch monitor, the replacement
   monitor may be a 22 inch monitor.
   Keyboard and payment receipt means
30 The protruding portion 126 is for supporting the keyboard 58 on the replacement
   door 100. The protruding portion 126 defines a keyboard and payment aperture
   64.1.

                                           13
   As part of the method, the support plate 62 is detached from the cabinet 12.
   According to an embodiment of the method, this detachment includes detaching
   the button connection lugs 66 from the gaming machine 10 and wires to which
   the lugs are attached.
 5
   The support plate 62 is secured to the replacement door 100 so as to extend
   over the keyboard and payment aperture 64.1, so as to provide the replacement
   door with the buttons 60, coin slot 74 and monetary note slot 72.
10 In addition, the coin feed mechanism 78 is removed from the existing door 18
   and mounted on the replacement door 100, so that the upper end 80 of the feed
   mechanism is aligned with the coin slot 74 in a similar manner in which it was
   aligned when mounted in the existing door.
15 When the replacement door 100 is in the closed position, the note slot 72 is
   aligned with and adjacent to the note acceptor 76, while the outlet 82 of the coin
   feed mechanism 78 is aligned with and adjacent to the coin receipt chute 84.
   As in the case of the existing door 18, the keyboard 58 can be mounted so that
20 the buttons 60 are accessible from the front side 22.1 of the replacement door
   100, while the lugs 66 extending from the rear of the keyboard are accessible
   from the rear side 24.1 of the replacement door.
   A strengthening bracket 128 is provided to provide support to the protruding
25 portion 126 and hence to the keyboard 58 once it is mounted thereon.
   Ticket printer, jackpot tray and speakers
   The jackpot tray 90 is detached from the existing door and attached to the
   replacement door 100 in a reverse manner to that in which it was removed from
30 the existing door.
   The method also includes detaching the speakers 96 from the existing door 18
   and mounting these on the replacement door 100 so as to extend over speaker
   apertures 94.1 in the replacement door corresponding to the speaker apertures

                                            14
   94 of the existing door. As in the case of the existing door 18, the speaker
   apertures 94.1 of the replacement door 100 are behind the jackpot tray 90 when
   that is mounted on the replacement door 100.
 5 The replacement door 100 also includes ticket slot 92.1 which is positioned so
   as to be adjacent to the ticket printer 88 when the replacement door is in its
   closed position, so that printed tickets can fall into the jackpot tray 90 when that
   is mounted on the replacement door 100, in a similar manner to that in relation
   to the existing door.
10
   Belly area
   The method includes removing the display material located on the belly area
   98 of the existing door 18 and attaching this to the belly area 98.1 of the
   replacement door 100. According to a preferred embodiment, suitable slots (not
15 shown) are provided on the replacement door 100 to locate and support the
   sheets on which the display material is located.
   Although the invention is described above in relation to preferred embodiments,
   it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that it is not limited to those
20 embodiments, but may be embodied in many other forms.
