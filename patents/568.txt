FUNERARY CONSTRUCTION FOR CONTAINING FUNERARY
OBJECTS
[0001]    The present invention relates to a funerary construction for containing funerary
objects.
[0002]    Funerary containment constructions are known, for example, columbaria or crypts, in
which funerary objects of various types are placed, such as urns, coffins, photograph frames and
so on.
[0003]    Typically, these constructions have a supporting structure, which can be made of
concrete or of metallic material, in which at least one cavity is defined for accommodating the
funerary objects, which has an access opening, which is usually closed by a metallic plate
which in turn is covered with a covering slab made of stone-like material, such as marble or the
like.
[0004]    As is known, anchoring the covering slab to the supporting structure of the
construction can be done by way of mounting devices that are hidden behind the body of the
covering plate so as not to be visible from outside.
[0005]    In particular, from US patent no. 8,438,794 a columbarium is known which is
constituted by a framework composed of uprights and horizontal members, which define a
plurality of niches, in front of which respective covering slabs of stone are arranged which are
removably coupled to the horizontal elements of the framework by way of a hidden mounting
system supported by the framework proper.
[0006]    More specifically, the solution disclosed in the above mentioned patent entails that the
hidden mounting system used for each niche is composed of an upper retention element,
supported by an upper horizontal member, and of at least one lower coupling support, supported
by a lower horizontal member, which cooperate respectively with an upper clip and with at least
one lower hook which are associated with the rear face of the covering slab so as to allow an
adjustment of the position of the covering slab with respect to the horizontal members.

                                                   2
[0007]     Such solution has the disadvantage of requiring a laborious manual intervention by
workmen in order to mount each covering slab and adjust it in position.
[0008]     Furthermore, it requires that the operators carry out the adjustment of one covering
slab at a time, which entails long execution times.
[0009]     The aim of the present invention is to provide a funerary construction for containing
funerary objects which is capable of improving the known art in one or more of the above
mentioned aspects.
[0010]     Within this aim, an object of the invention is to provide a funerary construction for
containing funerary objects that enables an easy, convenient and rapid mounting of covering
slabs.
[0011]     Another object of the invention is to provide a funerary construction for containing
funerary objects that makes it possible to perform, simply and extremely easily, the adjustment
of the position of the covering slabs to be mounted.
[0012]     Another object of the invention is to provide a funerary construction for containing
funerary objects, which is provided with means of mounting that make it possible to obtain a
high level of precision in the positioning of the covering slabs, but requiring reduced installation
times with respect to conventional systems.
[0013]     Another object of the present invention is to provide a funerary construction for
containing funerary objects that is capable of offering the highest guarantees of safety and
reliability in use.
[0014]     Furthermore, another object of the present invention is to overcome the drawbacks of
the known art in a different manner to any existing solutions.
[0015]     Another object of the invention is to provide a funerary construction that is relatively
easy to implement and which can be made at low cost.

                                                  3
[0016]   This aim and these and other objects which will become better apparent hereinafter are
achieved by a funerary construction for containing funerary objects according to claim 1.

[0036]   Figure 21 is a cross-sectional view of a second mounting element of the second
embodiment of the funerary construction according to the invention.
[0037]   With reference to the figures, the funerary construction for containing funerary objects
according to the invention, generally designated by the reference numeral 1, comprises a
supporting structure 2 which is provided with at least one cavity 3 or niche for accommodating

                                                     5
at least one funerary object, such as, for example, a funerary urn, a coffin, a photograph frame
and so on.
[0038]    The accommodation cavity 3 has at least one access opening 3a which is defined on at
least one side of the supporting structure 2.
[0039]    For example, the supporting structure 2 can be provided by way of a plurality of box
like enclosures 4, each one of which internally defines a respective accommodation cavity 3 and
which are mutually arranged in vertical columns and horizontal rows, as illustrated, for example,
in Figures 1 and 9. Conveniently, the box-like enclosures 4 can be made of sheet metal and can
be mutually interconnected by corner join elements 5, substantially right-angled or L-shaped, or
cross-shaped, or T-shaped, and fixed to the comers of the box-like enclosures 4 by way of screw
elements or the like.
[0040]    Alternatively, the supporting structure 2 can be made of concrete or masonry or other
suitable materials.
[0041]    The access opening 3a of the, or each, accommodation cavity 3 is closed by way of at
least one closing plate 6 which is fixed to the supporting structure 2.
[0042]    The fixing of the closing plate 6 to the supporting structure 2 can be performed by way
of screws 7 that engage respective through holes 8, which are defined in the closing plate 6, and
corresponding screwing seats 9, which are defined, for example, in the box-like enclosures 4 or,
as in the figures, in the corner join elements 5 or in anchoring blocks inserted into the supporting
structure 2, if the latter is made, in particular, of concrete or masonry.
[0043]    Facing the closing plate 6 is at least one covering slab 10 which is made, for example,
of stone-like material, such as marble, granite or the like, and which is coupled or in any case
connected, in general, to the supporting structure 2 by way of means of mounting.
[0044]    According to the invention, the means of mounting comprise one or more mounting
elements 11, which are supported by the closing plate 6 and which define at least one respective
region 12 for resting the covering slab 10.

                                                    6
[0045] Advantageously, the mounting elements 11 have means of adjusting the position of the
corresponding resting region 12 along at least one direction, in order to be capable of varying,
during the installation, the position of the covering slab 10 with respect to the supporting
structure 2.
[0046]    Optionally, it is possible for the mounting means to also comprise one or more
anchoring elements 13, which are associated with the face of the covering slab 10 that is directed
toward the closing plate 6 and which interact with the regions 12 for resting the mounting
elements 11.
[0047]    Descending into the details, the mounting means can, conveniently, comprise at least
one first mounting element 11 a, which can be arranged proximate to an edge 6a of the closing
plate 6, and at least one second mounting element 11 b, which can be, advantageously, positioned
proximate to the opposite edge 6b of the closing plate 6 with respect to the edge proximate to
which the first mounting element 11 a is arranged.
[0048]    For example, according to a possible embodiment, there can be at least two second
mounting elements 1lb arranged mutually spaced apart along the edge 6b of the closing plate 6.
[0049]    Alternatively, there can be a plurality of second mounting elements 1lb arranged at
corner areas of the closing plate 6.
[0050]    Conveniently, there are further retention means, the function of which is to immobilize
the covering slab 10, with respect to the closing plate 6, in the desired position, as will be better
described below.
[0051]    With reference to a first embodiment, shown in Figures 1-8, the first mounting element
11 a can be constituted by a tab 14 that protrudes substantially at right angles from an edge 6a of
the closing plate 6 and which defines, with its face 14a directed toward the closing plate 6, the
region 12 for resting the first mounting element 11 a for the covering slab 10.
[0052]    In particular, the tab 14 is preferably protruding from the lower edge of the closing plate
6 and the covering slab 10 is, conveniently, placed to rest against the face 14a of the tab 14, with

                                                   7
its lower edge, so as to be movable, in one direction or in the other direction, along at least one
direction substantially parallel to the face 14a of the tab 14.
[0053]    As shown in the figures, in this first embodiment, there are advantageously multiple
second mounting elements 1 lb arranged in the corner areas of the closing plate 6, and each
second mounting element 1 lb comprises, in this case, elastic means 15 which act between the
closing plate 6 and the corresponding region 12 for resting the covering slab 10.
[0054]    More specifically, the elastic means 15 of each second mounting element 1 lb can be
constituted by a helical spring 15a, which is coupled, at one end, to the closing plate 6 and which
defines, at the other end, the resting region 12 against which the face of the covering slab 10
directed toward the closing plate 6 rests.
[0055]    Alternatively, the elastic means 15 can be provided by elastic laminas 15b, which are
coupled, with at least one end thereof, to the closing plate 6 and which define with a portion
thereof the region 12 for resting the face of the covering slab 10 directed toward the closing plate
6.
[0056]    In this first embodiment, the covering slab 10, which is kept resting against the resting
regions 12 defined by the elastic means 15 and by the face 14a of the tab 14, can be moved, in
order to adjust its position, along a direction perpendicular to the closing plate 6, in contrast with
or by the action of the elastic means 15 of the second mounting elements 11 b, and along a
direction parallel to the face 14a of the tab 14 and parallel to the closing plate 6.
[0057]    Also in the first embodiment, the retention means can comprise abutment elements 16,
constituted for example by washers or the like, which are adapted to engage the face of the
covering slab 10 that is on the opposite side with respect to the closing plate 6, preferably, but
not necessarily, at its comers, and which are connected, by way of respective threaded elements
17, to the supporting structure 2.
[0058]    In particular, the threaded elements 17 are coupled to respective engagement holes 17a
that are defined in the supporting structure 2, for example at the comer join elements 5 or at
anchoring blocks inserted into holes provided in the supporting structure 2, if the latter is made
of concrete or masonry.

                                                   8
[0059]    In this manner, by screwing or unscrewing the threaded elements 17 in the
corresponding engagement seats 17a, it is possible to produce, at least in the various points
where the abutment elements 16 are present, a variation of the position of the covering slab 10
along a direction substantially perpendicular to the closing plate 6, in contrast with or in
agreement with the action of the elastic means 15 on which the covering slab 10 rests, so as to
obtain the desired arrangement of the covering slab 10.
[0060]    In a second embodiment, shown in Figures 9-21, there is at least one first mounting
element 11 a arranged proximate to an edge 6a of the closing plate 6, while proximate to the
opposite edge 6b of the closing plate 6 with respect to the edge 6a there is at least one second
mounting element 1lb and, more preferably, there are at least two second mounting elements
1lb which are mutually spaced apart along the edge 6b.
[0061]    Conveniently, in this second embodiment, the first mounting element 11a can be
arranged proximate to the upper edge of the closing plate 6, and there can be two second
mounting elements 1lb arranged proximate to the lower edge of the closing plate 6.
[0062]    Also with reference to the second embodiment, the first mounting element 11a
comprises a supporting body 18, which is fixed to the closing plate 6, and at least one first
adjustment element 19 which is associated with the supporting body 18 and which defines the
region 12 for resting the covering slab 10 of the first mounting element 11 a.
[0063]    In particular, the first adjustment element 19 is adjustably movable along a direction
100a substantially perpendicular to the closing plate 6, in order to make it possible to vary,
during the installation, the distance of the corresponding resting region 12 and, therefore, of the
covering slab 10, from the closing plate 6.
[0064]    As illustrated, the first adjustment element 19 can comprise a threaded shaft 20, which
is coupled to a threaded seat 20a defined in the supporting body 18 and is arranged with its axis
substantially at right angles to the closing plate 6. The threaded shaft 20 has, at one end, a head
20b that defines the region 12 for resting the first mounting element 11 a for the covering slab 10,
so that, by screwing or unscrewing it in the threaded seat 20a, it is possible to vary the position
of the covering slab 10 along the direction 100a substantially perpendicular to the closing plate
6.

                                                    9
[0065]    In the second embodiment, the (or each) second mounting element 1lb comprises a
base 21, which is fixed to the closing plate 6, and at least one corresponding second adjustment
element 22 which defines the corresponding region 12 for resting the covering slab 10. The
second adjustment element 22 is slideably movable with respect to the base 21 along at least two
directions of adjustment 100b and 100c, which are mutually perpendicular and are parallel to the
closing plate 6.
[0066]    As illustrated, the second adjustment element 22 of each second mounting element 1lb
comprises, advantageously, a plate-like slider coupled slideably on the base 21, and the base 21
defines, for the second adjustment element 22, a plurality of engagement regions 23a, 23b, 23c
which are mutually spaced apart along at least one of the two directions of adjustment 100b and
100c.
[0067]    The engagement regions 23a, 23b and 23c are, for example, provided by a toothed rack,
defined on the face of the base 21 directed toward the covering slab 10, which extends along one
of the two directions of adjustment, for example the one designated with 100c, with an
alternation of teeth and grooves that are removably engageable in sequence by a corresponding
toothing 22a, integrally defined on the second adjustment element 22, upon its sliding along the
direction of adjustment 100c, while the second adjustment element 22 is substantially free to
slide in the other direction of adjustment 100b, thanks to the sliding of the teeth of the toothing
22a of the second adjustment element 22 along the longitudinal extension of the grooves of the
toothed rack of the base 21.
[0068]    Conveniently, the second adjustment element 22 can be blocked with respect to the
base 21 by way of a screw 24 coupled to a female thread seat 24a defined in the base 21 and
passing through a slot 25 that is defined in the second adjustment element 22 and which extends
for example along the adjustment direction designated with 100c. In particular, the screw 24
passes through the slot 25 with play both in the direction of longitudinal extension of the slot
proper and in its direction of transverse extension and it has, at one end, a tightening head 24b
that engages the face of the second adjustment element 22 directed away from the base 21 along
the longitudinal edges of the slot 25. Screwing the screw 24 in its female thread seat 24a makes
it possible to block, in the desired position, the second adjustment element 22 with respect to the
base 21, while unscrewing it makes it possible to free the second adjustment element 22 from

                                                   10
the clamping of the screw 24 and to consequently release its possibility to slide along the two
directions of adjustment 100b, 100c, by virtue of the play present between the screw 24 and the
slot 25, so as to be able to vary the position of the corresponding region 12 for resting the
covering slab 10.
[0069]    Conveniently, on the base 21 there can be notches 26 for indicating the position of the
second adjustment element 22 with respect to the base 21 along at least one of the two directions
of adjustment 100b, 100c.
[0070]    In the second embodiment, there are, furthermore, one or more anchoring elements 13
associated with the covering slab 10, which comprise, respectively, at least one engagement pin
27, which is constituted, for example, by a latch, and which is arranged, with its axis,
substantially at right angles with respect to the covering slab 10, and which is adapted to engage
a respective second mounting element 1 lb.
[0071]    In particular, in the second embodiment, in each second adjustment element 22 an
accommodation recess 28 is defined which is capable of receiving in engagement a
corresponding engagement pin 27 and which basically provides the region 12 for resting the
covering slab 10 of the corresponding second mounting element 11 b.
[0072]    More specifically, as in the example shown, the accommodation recess 28 is defined at
an upper end of the second adjustment element 22 of each second mounting element 1 lb.
[0073]    Conveniently, each engagement pin 27 is provided with a pair of abutment shoulders
27a, 27b for the corresponding second adjustment element 22. The abutment shoulders 27a, 27b
are mutually facing and mutually spaced apart along the axis of the corresponding engagement
pin 27.
[0074]    In particular, each second adjustment element 22 is adapted to engage, with its
accommodation recess 28, the corresponding engagement pin 27 along a portion 27c of the
engagement pin 27 comprised between the abutment shoulders 27a and 27b.
[0075]    Advantageously, each engagement pin 27 axially presents a threaded seat coupled to a
threaded rod 29 that is integral with the covering slab 10 and which extends substantially at right

                                                    11
angles to that covering slab, so that, by screwing or unscrewing it along the threaded rod 29, it is
possible to adjust the extent of its protrusion from the covering slab 10 and, therefore, to adjust
the distance between the covering slab 10 and the closing plate 6, in the region in which it
interacts with the corresponding second mounting element 1 lb.
[0076]    Still with reference to the second embodiment, the means of retaining the covering slab
10 can, in this case, comprise at least one hook element 30 which is integral with the covering
slab 10 and at least one retention element 31, which is supported by the closing plate 6 and is
adapted to interact with the hook element 30.
[0077]    In particular, the retention element 31 can comprise, conveniently, a screw element 32
arranged substantially parallel to the closing plate 6 and engaged with a threaded hole defined in
the supporting body 18.
[0078]    The screw element 32 is adapted to interact with the hook element 30 by way of a
conveniently contoured end 32a thereof, and can, advantageously, have, at its other end, a
polygonal head 32b, which can be engaged by a suitable instrument in order to allow, by
screwing or unscrewing it in the corresponding threaded hole, the engagement or the
disengagement of its end 32a with the hook element 30, with consequent blocking or release of
the covering slab with respect to the closing plate 6.
[0079]    Use of the funerary construction, according to the invention, is evident from the
foregoing description and explanation.
[0080]    In particular, with reference to the first embodiment, it is evident that, once the access
opening 3a of an accommodation cavity 3 is closed by fixing a closing plate 6 to the supporting
structure 2, by way of the screws 7, with the tab 14 of the closing plate 6 arranged, for example,
in a lower region, the operator can arrange a covering slab 10 in front of the closing plate 6,
resting its lower edge against the tab 14, which acts, therefore, as a locator for the subsequent
adjustment of its positioning, and its face directed toward the closing plate 6 against the elastic
means 15.
[0081]    The operator will then adjust the position of the covering slab 10 by making it slide on
the tab 14 along a direction that is substantially parallel to the closing plate 6, in one direction or

                                                      12
the other, i.e. to the right or to the left, and/or along a direction substantially perpendicular to the
closing plate 6, in order to vary its distance from the latter.
[0082]     Once the covering slab 10 is arranged in the desired position, the operator will block
the covering slab 10 by way of the abutment elements 16 and, by screwing or unscrewing the
corresponding threaded elements 17, the operator can also locally adjust its distance from the
closing plate 6.
[0083]     In the same way, the operator can mount covering slabs 10 at other accommodation
cavities 3 of the funerary construction.
[0084]     With reference to the second embodiment, the operator begins the operation of closing
an accommodation cavity 3 by fixing a closing plate 6 to its access opening 3a, screwing the
screws 7 into the screwing seats 9 defined in the supporting structure 2.
[0085]     At this point, by way of the first and the second mounting elements 1 la, 11 b, the
operator will couple a covering slab 10 to the closing plate 6 and adjust its position by way of
the first adjustment element 19 and the second adjustment elements 22, and will also adjust the
position of the engagement pins 27.
[0086]     The covering slab 10 is then blocked by engaging the retention element 31 with the
hook element 30.
[0087]     The same adjustment of the first and second adjustment elements 1 la, 1 lb can be used
on the closing plates 6 of all the other accommodation cavities 3, with a consequent considerable
