   The present application is a divisional of AU 2013256724, which is the national phase
   entry of PCT/US2013/038109, the entire specifications of which are incorporated herein
 5 by cross-reference.
   Technical Field of the Invention
   This   invention generally relates to anti-IL-23p19        antibodies for diagnostic and
   therapeutic use. More specifically, humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibodies and methods of
   use for the treatment of various diseases or disorders are disclosed. Pharmaceutical
10 compositions and kits comprising such compounds are also disclosed.
   Background of the Invention
   Higher eukaryotes have evolved an intricate response to pathogens that is initiated by
   the innate immune response and followed by the adaptive immune response. Together
   these two mechanisms not only eradicate pathogens that infect the organism but also
15 establish a long term immunological response against future exposures. Deficiencies in
   these responses can result in increased susceptibility to infections and/or alterations of
   the adaptive immune response leading to chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. IL-12,
   a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of a p40 and a p35 protein subunit, has long been
   considered the hallmark cytokine of the innate immune response with major influence on
20 adaptive immunity. However, data from investigation of this cytokine's biological role led
   to confusing results. For example, while p40-deficient mice were resistant to Collagen
   Induced Arthritis (CIA) and Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), p35
   deficient mice were susceptible to both and even displayed exacerbated disease. Such
   conundrums began to be resolved with the discovery in the late 1990's of a new
25 member of the IL-1 2 cytokine family with a distinct role in the immune response - IL-23.
   IL-23 is composed of a common subunit (p40) with IL-1 2 and a unique p19 subunit.
   Despite this shared p40 subunit, the roles for IL-23 and IL-1 2 are quite different. IL-1 2 is
   important for Th1 responses via promotion of Th1 cell differentiation, proliferation and
   activation. In contrast, IL-23 supports the development and maintenance of a recently
30 defined set of CD4* T helper cells termed Th1 7 cells due to their ability to produce IL-1 7
   and related cytokines. There is mounting evidence that IL-23 is involved

                                                2
   in chronic autoimmune inflammation and the modulation of IL-23 activity could provide
   promising therapies against autoimmune diseases.
   There is therefore a need for antagonist molecules against IL-23 with beneficial
   pharmacological properties, which can be used as therapeutic agents to treat
 5 diseases, in particular immunological and autoimmune diseases in humans.
   Accordingly, one aim of the present invention is to provide anti-IL-23 antagonist
   molecules, in particular anti-IL-23 antagonist molecules which have high binding
   affinity to IL-23.
   A further aim of the present invention is to provide anti-IL-23 antagonist molecules,
 0 which have high specificity for IL-23.
   A further aim of the present invention is to provide anti-IL-23 antagonists, which have
   high blocking activity for the association of IL-23 and its receptor.
   A further aim of the present invention is to provide anti-IL-23 antagonists, which have
   potent cellular activity.
 5 A further aim of the present invention is to provide anti-IL-23 antagonists, which have a
   favorable bioavailability.
   A further aim of the present invention is to provide anti-IL-23 antagonists, which have
   favorable biophysical properties.
   A further aim of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions for
 0 antibody molecules, in particular for anti-IL23p1 9 antibodies. A particular aim of the
   present invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions for antibody molecules
   with favorable stability and storability.
   Further aims of the present invention include combinations of any of the aims set forth
   above.

   antibodies, for example humanized monoclonal anti-IL-23p1 9 antibodies, for example
   full length humanized monoclonal anti-IL-23p19 antibodies. In one aspect, a
   humanized antibody of the present invention binds to human IL-23 with high affinity. In
 0 another aspect, a humanized antibody of the present invention also binds to
   cynomolgus IL-23 with high affinity. In a further aspect, a humanized antibody of the
   present invention inhibits IL-23-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in DB cells. In another
   aspect, a humanized antibody of the present invention antagonizes the action of IL-23
   by binding to the p19 subunit of IL-23, for example as measured by the inhibition of
 5 cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22, whose production is stimulated by IL-23. In a
   further aspect, a humanized antibody of the present invention has a favorable
   pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. In a further aspect, a humanized antibody of the present
   invention has favorable biophysical properties, such as quality, stability or solubility, for
   example as defined by the percentage of antibody in monomer form.

   Detailed Description
   The p19 subunit of IL-23 (also referred to herein as "IL-23p19" and "p19 subunit") is a
   189 amino acid polypeptide containing a 21 aa leader sequence (Oppmann et al.
 o Immunity 13:715 (2000), SEQ ID NO: 181). The biological activity of the molecule is
   only detected when it is partnered with the IL-12p40 subunit to form IL-23. IL-23 is
   predominantly expressed by activated dendritic cells (DCs) and phagocytic cells. The
   receptor for IL-23 was found to be composed of the IL-12RP1 subunit of IL-12 receptor
   partnered with a unique subunit called IL-23R (Parham et al. J. Immunol. 168:5699
?5 (2002)). Expression of the receptor is detected primarily on memory T cells and NK
   cells.    Thus, expression of this cytokine:receptor pair appears to be restricted to
   specific populations of immune cells. While it was first thought that IL-12 and IL-23
   would share many functions, the data has shown the picture to be different. Whereas
   IL-12 has a predominant role in the production of Th1 cells, IL-23 was found to be
30 critically involved in the production and maintenance of a recently recognized Th cell

                                                25
   subset termed Th17 (Kikly et al. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 18:670 (2006), Kastelein et al.
   Ann. Rev. Immunol. 25:221 (2007)). These cells produce IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22 and
   other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-ax. As described below, animal
   model studies on the role of these Thl7 cells show their importance as a driving force
 5 in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity.
   The present invention provides antibodies that bind to the p19 subunit of the IL-23, in
   particular human IL-23p19. The present invention also relates to humanized antibodies
   that recognize the p19 subunit of IL-23. In specific embodiments, the sequence of
 0 these humanized antibodies has been identified based on the sequences of certain
   lead mouse antibodies.
   The lead mouse antibodies of the present invention were derived from mouse
   hybridomas. The immunization of the mice is carried out using different techniques.
   For example, antibodies that are specific for human IL-23p1 9 proteins or fragments
 5 thereof can be raised against an immunogenic antigen such as an isolated IL-23p19
   protein, an isolated IL-23 protein, an isolated hybrid IL-23 protein, and/or a portion
   thereof of any of the above (including synthetic peptides). For example, a hybrid IL-23
   protein comprising a mouse IL-23p40 subunit and a human IL-23p19 subunit is used
   to immunize mice. Preparation of immunogenic antigens and monoclonal antibody
 0 production can be performed using any suitable technique known in the art.
   The lead mouse antibodies were selected based on their high affinity to human IL-23.
   Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides an antibody that binds to
   human IL-23 with high affinity. Selected mouse antibodies were humanized to result in
   humanized antibodies. The humanized antibodies of the present invention bind to
?5 human IL-23 with high affinity. Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention
   provides a humanized antibody that binds to human IL-23 with high affinity.
   Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an anti-IL-23p19
   antibody having a K0 of less than 40pM. In a further embodiment, the present
   invention provides an anti-IL-23p19 antibody having a K0 of less than 20pM. In a
30 further embodiment, the present invention provides an anti-IL-23p1 9 antibody having a

                                                  26
   K0 less than 10pM. In a further embodiment, the present invention provides an anti-IL
   23p1 9 antibody having a K0 less than 1pM.
   In another aspect, an antibody of the present invention binds to IL-23p19 with high
   affinity in the absence of human serum or in the presence of 50% human serum.
 5 In a further aspect, a humanized antibody of the present invention also binds to
   cynomolgus monkey IL-23 with high affinity.
   In another aspect, an antibody of the present invention binds to IL-23, but does not
   bind to IL-1 2. In a further aspect, an antibody of the present invention does not
   interfere with the biological activity of IL-1 2, which is a closely related family member
 0 to IL-23.
   In another aspect, an antibody of the present invention inhibits the IL-23 stimulated
   production of IL-17 from mouse splenocytes.
   In a further aspect, a humanized antibody of the present invention inhibits IL-23
   induced STAT3 phosphorylation in DB cells.
 5 In a further aspect, a humanized antibody of the present invention antagonizes the
   action of IL-23 by binding to the p19 subunit of IL-23, as measured by the inhibition of
   cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22, whose production is stimulated by IL-23, and
   detected by the reduction in the levels of these cytokines.
   In a further aspect, a humanized antibody of the present invention has a favorable
 0 pharmacokinetic profile (PK) profile, as exemplified by in vivo half life in cynomolgus
   monkeys.
   In a further aspect, a humanized monoclonal anti-IL-23p1 9 antibody of the present
   invention has favorable biophysical properties, for example quality, stability, or
   solubility.
?5 In one aspect, the anti-IL-23p19 antibody is a humanized antibody. In one aspect, the
   anti-IL-23p19 antibody is a monoclonal antibody. In one aspect, the anti-IL-23p19
   antibody is a full length antibody. In one aspect, the anti-IL-23p1 9 antibody is a
   humanized monoclonal antibody, for example a full length humanized monoclonal
   antibody.

                                                27
   An antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention recognizes
   specific "IL-23p1 9 antigen epitope" or " IL-23p1 9 epitope". As used herein these terms
   refer to a molecule (e.g., a peptide) or a fragment of a molecule capable of
   immunoreactivity with an anti-IL-23p1 9 antibody and, for example, include an IL-23p1 9
 5 antigenic determinant recognized by the any of the antibodies having a light
   chain/heavy chain sequence combination of SEQ ID NO:84/121, 86/123, 88/125,
   90/127, 91/128, 93/130, 95/132, 97/134, 99/136, 101/138, 103/140, 105/142, 107/144,
   109/146, 111/148, 113/150, 115/152, 117/154, 119/156, 160/166, 160/168, 158/166 or
   158/168. IL-23p1 9 antigen epitopes can be included in proteins, protein fragments,
 0 peptides or the like. The epitopes are most commonly proteins, short oligopeptides,
   oligopeptide mimics (i.e., organic compounds that mimic antibody binding properties of
   the IL-23p1 9 antigen), or combinations thereof. The minimum size of a peptide or
   polypeptide epitope for an antibody is thought to be about four to five amino acids.
   Peptide or polypeptide epitopes contain for example at least seven amino acids or for
 5 example at least nine amino acids or for example between about 15 to about 20 amino
   acids. Since an antibody can recognize an antigenic peptide or polypeptide in its
   tertiary form, the amino acids comprising an epitope need not be contiguous, and in
   some cases, may not even be on the same peptide chain. Epitopes may be
   determined by various techniques known in the art, such as X-ray crystallography,
 0 Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HXMS), site-directed
   mutagenesis, alanine scanning mutagenesis, and peptide screening methods.
   The generalized structure of antibodies or immunoglobulin is well known to those of
   skill in the art. These molecules are heterotetrameric glycoproteins, typically of about
   150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H)
?5 chains and are typically referred to as full length antibodies.       Each light chain is
   covalently linked to a heavy chain by one disulfide bond to form a heterodimer, and the
   heterotrameric molecule is formed through a covalent disulfide linkage between the
   two identical heavy chains of the heterodimers. Although the light and heavy chains
   are linked together by one disulfide bond, the number of disulfide linkages between the
30 two heavy chains varies by immunoglobulin isotype. Each heavy and light chain also
   has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at the amino-

                                                   28
   terminus a variable domain       (VH), followed by three or four constant domains  (CH1, CH2,
   CH3,  and   CH4), as well as a hinge region between       CH1  and CH2. Each light chain has
   two domains, an amino-terminal variable domain (VL) and a carboxy-terminal constant
   domain (CL). The VL domain associates non-covalently with the           VH domain, whereas
 5 the CL domain is commonly covalently linked to the          CH1 domain via a disulfide bond.
   Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light and
   heavy chain variable domains (Chothia et al., 1985, J. Mol. Biol. 186:651-663).
   Variable domains are also referred herein as variable regions.
   Certain domains within the variable domains differ extensively between different
 0 antibodies i.e., are "hypervariable."        These hypervariable domains contain residues
   that are directly involved in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its
   specific antigenic determinant. Hypervariability, both in the light chain and the heavy
   chain variable domains, is concentrated in three segments known as complementarity
   determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable loops (HVLs). CDRs are defined by
 5 sequence      comparison     in   Kabat et al.,     1991,  In:  Sequences of Proteins of
   Immunological Interest,      5th  Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health,
   Bethesda, Md., whereas HVLs (also referred herein as CDRs) are structurally defined
   according to the three-dimensional structure of the variable domain, as described by
   Chothia and Lesk, 1987, J. Mol. Biol. 196: 901-917. These two methods result in
 0 slightly different identifications of a CDR. As defined by Kabat, CDR-L1 is positioned at
   about residues 24-34, CDR-L2, at about residues 50-56, and CDR-L3, at about
   residues 89-97 in the light chain variable domain; CDR-H1 is positioned at about
   residues 31-35, CDR-H2 at about residues 50-65, and CDR-H3 at about residues 95
   102 in the heavy chain variable domain. The exact residue numbers that encompass a
?5 particular CDR will vary depending on the sequence and size of the CDR.                Those
   skilled in the art can routinely determine which residues comprise a particular CDR
   given the variable region amino acid sequence of the antibody. The CDR1, CDR2,
   CDR3 of the heavy and light chains therefore define the unique and functional
   properties specific for a given antibody.
30 The three CDRs within each of the heavy and light chains are separated by framework
   regions (FR), which contain sequences that tend to be less variable. From the amino

                                                   29
   terminus to the carboxy terminus of the heavy and light chain variable domains, the
   FRs and CDRs are arranged in the order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and
   FR4. The largely P-sheet configuration of the FRs brings the CDRs within each of the
   chains into close proximity to each other as well as to the CDRs from the other chain.
 5 The resulting conformation contributes to the antigen binding site (see Kabat et al.,
   1991, NIH Publ. No. 91-3242, Vol. I, pages 647-669), although not all CDR residues
   are necessarily directly involved in antigen binding.
   FR residues and Ig constant domains are not directly involved in antigen binding, but
   contribute to antigen binding and/or mediate antibody effector function. Some FR
 0 residues are thought to have a significant effect on antigen binding in at least three
   ways: by noncovalently binding directly to an epitope, by interacting with one or more
   CDR residues, and by affecting the interface between the heavy and light chains. The
   constant domains are not directly involved in antigen binding but mediate various Ig
   effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular
 5 cytotoxicity (ADCC),     complement        dependent      cytotoxicity (CDC)  and  antibody
   dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).
   The light chains of vertebrate immunoglobulins are assigned to one of two clearly
   distinct classes, kappa (K) and lambda (k), based on the amino acid sequence of the
   constant domain. By comparison, the heavy chains of mammalian immunoglobulins
 0 are assigned to one of five major classes, according to the sequence of the constant
   domains: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. IgG and IgA are further divided into subclasses
   (isotypes), e.g., IgG1 , IgG 2 , IgG 3 , IgG 4 , IgA1 , and IgA2 . The heavy chain constant
   domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called aX, 6, E,
   y, and t, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of
?5 the classes of native immunoglobulins are well known.
   The terms, "antibody", "anti-IL-23p19 antibody", "humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody",
   "humanized anti-IL-23p19 epitope antibody", and "variant humanized anti-IL-23p19
   epitope antibody" specifically encompass monoclonal antibodies (including full length
   monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific
30 antibodies), and antibody fragments such as variable domains and other portions of

                                              30
   antibodies that exhibit a desired biological activity, e.g., IL-23p19 binding.The term
   "monoclonal antibody" (mAb) refers to an antibody that is highly specific, being
   directed against a single antigenic determinant, an "epitope". Therefore, the modifier
   "monoclonal" is indicative of antibodies directed to the identical epitope and is not to
 5 be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. It
   should be understood that monoclonal antibodies can be made by any technique or
   methodology known in the art; including e.g., the hybridoma method ( Kohler et al.,
   1975, Nature 256:495), or recombinant DNA methods known in the art (see, e.g., U.S.
   Pat. No. 4,816,567), or methods of isolation of monoclonal recombinantly produced
 0 using phage antibody libraries, using techniques described in Clackson et al., 1991,
   Nature 352: 624-628, and Marks et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597.
   The term "monomer" refers to a homogenous form of an antibody. For example, for a
   full-length antibody, monomer means a monomeric antibody having two identical
   heavy chains and two identical light chains.
 5 Chimeric antibodies consist of the heavy and light chain variable regions of an
   antibody from one species (e.g., a non-human mammal such as a mouse) and the
   heavy and light chain constant regions of another species (e.g., human) antibody and
   can be obtained by linking the DNA sequences encoding the variable regions of the
   antibody from the first species (e.g., mouse) to the DNA sequences for the constant
 0 regions of the antibody from the second (e.g. human) species and transforming a host
   with an expression vector containing the linked sequences to allow it to produce a
   chimeric antibody. Alternatively, the chimeric antibody also could be one in which one
   or more regions or domains of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with,
   homologous to, or a variant of the corresponding sequence in a monoclonal antibody
?5 from another immunoglobulin class or isotype, or from a consensus or germline
   sequence. Chimeric antibodies can include fragments of such antibodies, provided
   that the antibody fragment exhibits the desired biological activity of its parent antibody,
   for example binding to the same epitope (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and
   Morrison et al., 1984, Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 81: 6851-6855).

                                               31
   The terms, "antibody fragment", "anti-IL-23p19 antibody fragment", "anti-IL-23p19
   epitope antibody fragment", "humanized anti-IL-23p1 9 antibody fragment", "humanized
   anti-IL-23p19 epitope antibody fragment", "variant humanized anti-IL-23p19 epitope
   antibody fragment" refer to a portion of a full length anti-IL-23p19 antibody, in which a
 5 variable region or a functional capability is retained, for example, specific IL-23p19
   epitope binding. Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, a Fab,
   Fab', F(ab') 2, Fd, Fv, scFv and scFv-Fc fragment, a diabody, a linear antibody, a
   single-chain antibody, a minibody, a diabody formed from antibody fragments, and
   multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.
 o Full length antibodies can be treated with enzymes such as papain or pepsin to
   generate useful antibody fragments. Papain digestion is used to produces two identical
   antigen-binding antibody fragments called "Fab" fragments, each with a single antigen
   binding site, and a residual "Fc" fragment. The Fab fragment also contains the
   constant domain of the light chain and the      CH1  domain of the heavy chain. Pepsin
 5 treatment yields a F(ab') 2 fragment that has two antigen-binding sites and is still
   capable of cross-linking antigen.
   Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the presence of additional residues
   including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region at the C-terminus of
   the  CH1  domain.   F(ab') 2 antibody fragments are pairs of Fab' fragments linked by
 0 cysteine residues in the hinge region. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments
   are also known.
   "Fv" fragment contains a complete antigen-recognition and binding site consisting of a
   dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent
   association. In this configuration, the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to
?5 define an antigen-biding site on the surface of the    VH-VL   dimer. Collectively, the six
   CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody.
   A "single-chain Fv" or "scFv" antibody fragment is a single chain Fv variant comprising
   the  VH  and VL domains of an antibody where the domains are present in a single
   polypeptide chain. The single chain Fv is capable of recognizing and binding antigen.
30 The scFv polypeptide may optionally also contain a polypeptide linker positioned

                                             32
   between the    VH  and VL domains in order to facilitate formation of a desired three
   dimensional structure for antigen binding by the scFv (see, e.g., Pluckthun, 1994, In
   The Pharmacology of monoclonal Antibodies, Vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds.,
   Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315).
 5 A "diabody" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which
   fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V.sub.H) connected to a light
   chain variable domain (V.sub.L) in the same polypeptide chain (V.sub.H-V.sub.L or
   V.sub.L-V.sub.H). Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., Holliger et al. (1993)
   Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448.
 0 Other recognized antibody fragments include those that comprise a pair of tandem Fd
   segments    (VH-CH1-VH-CH1)  to form a pair of antigen binding regions. These "linear
   antibodies" can be bispecific or monospecific as described in, for example, Zapata et
   al. 1995, Protein Eng. 8(10):1057-1062.
   A "humanized antibody" or a "humanized antibody fragment" is a specific type of
 5 chimeric antibody which includes an immunoglobulin amino acid sequence variant, or
   fragment thereof, which is capable of binding to a predetermined antigen and which,
   comprises one or more FRs having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human
   immunoglobulin and one or more CDRs having substantially the amino acid sequence
   of a non-human immunoglobulin. This non-human amino acid sequence often referred
 0 to as an "import" sequence is typically taken from an "import" antibody domain,
   particularly a variable domain. In general, a humanized antibody includes at least the
   CDRs or HVLs of a non-human antibody, inserted between the FRs of a human heavy
   or light chain variable domain. The present invention describes specific humanized
   anti-IL-23p19 antibodies which contain CDRs derived from the mouse monoclonal
?5 antibodies or humanized CDRs shown in Tables 3 and 4 inserted between the FRs of
   human germline sequence heavy and light chain variable domains.              It will be
   understood that certain mouse FR residues may be important to the function of the
   humanized antibodies and therefore certain of the human germline sequence heavy
   and light chain variable domains residues are modified to be the same as those of the
30 corresponding mouse sequence.

                                                      33
   In another aspect, a humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody comprises substantially all of at
   least one, and typically two, variable domains (such as contained, for example, in Fab,
   Fab', F(ab')2, Fabc, and Fv fragments) in which all, or substantially all, of the CDRs
   correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and specifically herein, all of the
 5 CDRs are mouse or humanized sequences as detailed in Tables 1 through 4 herein
   below and all, or substantially all, of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin
   consensus or germline sequence. In another aspect, a humanized anti- IL-23p19
   antibody also includes at least a portion of an immunoglobulin Fc region, typically that
   of a human immunoglobulin. Ordinarily, the antibody will contain both the light chain as
 0 well as at least the variable domain of a heavy chain. The antibody also may include
   one or more of the        CH1,  hinge, CH2,  0
                                                  H3,  and/or CH4  regions of the heavy chain, as
   appropriate.
   A    humanized       anti-IL-23p19     antibody      can  be   selected  from   any  class   of
   immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA and IgE, and any isotype, including
 5 IgG1,  IgG 2 , IgG 3 , IgG 4 , IgA1 and IgA2. For example, the constant domain can be a
   complement fixing constant domain where it is desired that the humanized antibody
   exhibit cytotoxic activity, and the isotype is typically IgG1 . Where such cytotoxic activity
   is not desirable, the constant domain may be of another isotype, e.g., IgG2. An
   alternative humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody can comprise sequences from more
 0 than one immunoglobulin class or isotype, and selecting particular constant domains
   to optimize desired effector functions is within the ordinary skill in the art. In specific
   embodiments, the present invention provides antibodies that are IgG1 antibodies and
   more particularly, are IgG1 antibodies in which there is a knock-out of effector
   functions.
?5 The FRs and CDRs, or HVLs, of a humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody need not
   correspond precisely to the parental sequences. For example, one or more residues
   in the import CDR, or HVL, or the consensus or germline FR sequence may be altered
   (e.g., mutagenized) by substitution, insertion or deletion such that the resulting amino
   acid residue is no longer identical to the original residue in the corresponding position
30 in either parental sequence but the antibody nevertheless retains the function of
   binding to IL-23p19. Such alteration typically will not be extensive and will be

                                               34
   conservative alterations. Usually, at least 75% of the humanized antibody residues will
   correspond to those of the parental consensus or germline FR and import CDR
   sequences, more often at least 90%, and most frequently greater than 95%, or greater
   than 98% or greater than 99%.
 5 Immunoglobulin residues that affect the interface between heavy and light chain
   variable regions ("the  VL-VH interface") are those that affect the proximity or orientation
   of the two chains with respect to one another. Certain residues that may be involved in
   interchain interactions include VL residues 34, 36, 38, 44, 46, 87, 89, 91, 96, and 98
   and  VH  residues 35, 37, 39, 45, 47, 91, 93, 95, 100, and 103 (utilizing the numbering
 0 system set forth in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest
   (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1987)). U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213 also
   discusses that residues such as VL residues 43 and 85, and         VH  residues 43 and 60
   also may be involved in this interaction. While these residues are indicated for human
   IgG only, they are applicable across species. Important antibody residues that are
 5 reasonably expected to be involved in interchain interactions are selected for
   substitution into the consensus sequence.
   The terms "consensus sequence" and "consensus antibody" refer to an amino acid
   sequence which comprises the most frequently occurring amino acid residue at each
   location in all immunoglobulins of any particular class, isotype, or subunit structure,
 0 e.g., a human immunoglobulin variable domain. The consensus sequence may be
   based on immunoglobulins of a particular species or of many species. A "consensus"
   sequence, structure, or antibody is understood to encompass a consensus human
   sequence as described in certain embodiments, and to refer to an amino acid
   sequence which comprises the most frequently occurring amino acid residues at each
?5 location in all human immunoglobulins of any particular class, isotype, or subunit
   structure. Thus, the consensus sequence contains an amino acid sequence having at
   each position an amino acid that is present in one or more known immunoglobulins,
   but which may not exactly duplicate the entire amino acid sequence of any single
   immunoglobulin. The variable region consensus sequence is not obtained from any
30 naturally produced antibody or immunoglobulin. Kabat et al., 1991, Sequences of
   Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of

                                              35
   Health, Bethesda, Md., and variants thereof. The FRs of heavy and light chain
   consensus sequences, and variants thereof, provide useful sequences for the
   preparation of humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibodies. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos.
   6,037,454 and 6,054,297.
 5 Human germline sequences are found naturally in the human population. A
   combination of those germline genes generates antibody diversity. Germline antibody
   sequences for the light chain of the antibody come from conserved human germline
   kappa or lambda v-genes and j-genes. Similarly the heavy chain sequences come
   from germline v-, d- and j-genes (LeFranc, M-P, and LeFranc, G, "The Immunoglobulin
 0 Facts Book" Academic Press, 2001).
   As used herein, "variant", "anti- IL-23p19 variant", "humanized anti- IL-23p19 variant",
   or "variant humanized anti- IL-23p19" each refers to a humanized anti-IL-23p19
   antibody having at least a light chain variable murine CDR from any of the sequences
   as shown in Table 1 or a heavy chain murine CDR sequence derived from the murine
 5 monoclonal antibody as shown in Table 2. Variants include those having one or more
   amino acid changes in one or both light chain or heavy chain variable domains,
   provided that the amino acid change does not substantially impair binding of the
   antibody to IL-23p1 9. Exemplary humanized antibodies produced herein include those
   designated as Antibody A, Antibody B, Antibody C and Antibody D, and the various
 0 light chains and heavy chains of the same are shown in SEQ ID Nos:174 and 180, and
   SEQ ID Nos:176 and 178, respectively.
   An "isolated" antibody is one that has been identified and separated and/or recovered
   from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of the
   antibody's natural environment are those materials that may interfere with diagnostic
?5 or therapeutic uses of the antibody, and can be enzymes, hormones, or other
   proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In one aspect, the antibody will be purified
   to at least greater than 95% isolation by weight of antibody.
   An isolated antibody includes an antibody in situ within recombinant cells in which it is
   produced, since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not

                                                    36
   be present. Ordinarily however, an isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one
   purification step in which the recombinant cellular material is removed.
   The term "antibody performance" refers to factors that contribute to antibody
   recognition of antigen or the effectiveness of an antibody in vivo. Changes in the
 5 amino acid sequence of an antibody can affect antibody properties such as folding,
   and can influence physical factors such as initial rate of antibody binding to antigen
   (ka), dissociation constant of the antibody from antigen (kd), affinity constant of the
   antibody for the antigen (Kd), conformation of the antibody, protein stability, and half
   life of the antibody.
 0 The term "epitope tagged" when used herein, refers to an anti-IL-23p1 9 antibody fused
   to an "epitope tag". An "epitope tag" is a polypeptide having a sufficient number of
   amino acids to provide an epitope for antibody production, yet is designed such that it
   does not interfere with the desired activity of the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody.
   The epitope tag is usually sufficiently unique such that an antibody raised against the
 5 epitope tag does not substantially cross-react with other epitopes. Suitable tag
   polypeptides generally contain at least 6 amino acid residues and usually contain
   about 8 to 50 amino acid residues, or about 9 to 30 residues. Examples of epitope
   tags and the antibody that binds the epitope include the flu HA tag polypeptide and its
   antibody 12CA5 (Field et al., 1988 Mol. Cell. Biol. 8: 2159-2165; c-myc tag and 8F9,
 0 3C7, 6E10, G4, B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto (Evan et al., 1985, Mol. Cell. Biol.
   5(12):3610-3616; and Herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its antibody
   (Paborsky et al. 1990, Protein Engineering 3(6): 547-553). In certain embodiments, the
   epitope tag is a "salvage receptor binding epitope". As used herein, the term "salvage
   receptor binding epitope" refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule
?5 (such as IgG1, IgG 2 , IgG 3 , or IgG 4 ) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum
   half-life of the IgG molecule.
   In some embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention may be conjugated to a
   cytotoxic agent. This is any substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells
   and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes
30 (such as 1131, 1125, Y90, and Re186), chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as
   enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, and fragments

                                                   37
   thereof. Such cytotoxic agents can be coupled to the humanized antibodies of the
   present invention using standard procedures, and used, for example, to treat a patient
   indicated for therapy with the antibody.
   A "chemotherapeutic agent" is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer.

   with the therapeutic antibodies of the present invention.                  Examples of such
   chemotherapeutic        agents   include     alkylating    agents    such     a   thiotepa     and

30 inhibit hormone action on tumors such as anti-estrogens and selective estrogen
   receptor    modulators      (SERMs),     including,    for    example,      tamoxifen      (including

                                                 39
   Nolvadex TM),    raloxifene,   droloxifene,   4-hydroxytamoxifen,  trioxifene,  keoxifene,
   LY117018, onapristone, and toremifene (Fareston T M ); aromatase inhibitors that inhibit
   the enzyme aromatase, which regulates estrogen production in the adrenal glands,
   such    as,   for example,     4(5)-imidazoles,   aminoglutethimide,   megestrol   acetate
 5 (Megace T M ), exemestane,      formestane, fadrozole, vorozole (Rivisor T M ), letrozole
   (Femara T M ), and anastrozole (Arimidex TM); and anti-androgens such as flutamide,
   nilutamide, bicalutamide, leuprolide, and goserelin; and pharmaceutically acceptable
   salts, acids, or derivatives of any of the above. Any one or more of these agents may
   be conjugated to the humanized antibodies of the present invention to provide a useful
 0 therapeutic agent for the treatment of various disorders.
   The antibodies also may be conjugated to prodrugs.          A "prodrug" is a precursor or
   derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor
   cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or
   converted into the more active form. See, for example, Wilman, 1986, "Prodrugs in
 5 Cancer Chemotherapy", In Biochemical Society Transactions, 14, pp. 375-382, 615th
   Meeting Belfast and Stella et al., 1985, "Prodrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted
   Drug Delivery, In: "Directed Drug Delivery, Borchardt et al., (ed.), pp. 247-267,
   Humana Press. Useful prodrugs include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing
   prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate-containing prodrugs peptide
 o containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glycosylated prodrugs, P
   lactam-containing     prodrugs,    optionally   substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing
   prodrugs,    and    optionally   substituted   phenylacetamide-containing    prodrugs,  5
   fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs that can be converted into the more
   active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a
?5 prodrug form include, but are not limited to, those chemotherapeutic agents described
   above.
   For diagnostic as well as therapeutic monitoring purposes, the antibodies of the
   invention also may be conjugated to a label, either a label alone or a label and an
   additional second agent (prodrug, chemotherapeutic agent and the like). A label, as
30 distinguished from the other second agents refers to an agent that is a detectable
   compound or composition and it may be conjugated directly or indirectly to a

                                               40
   humanized antibody of the present invention. The label may itself be detectable (e.g.,
   radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels) or, in the case of an enzymatic label, may
   catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition that is
   detectable. Labeled humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody can be prepared and used in
 5 various applications including in vitro and in vivo diagnostics.
   The antibodies of the present invention may be formulated as part of a liposomal
   preparation in order to affect delivery thereof in vivo. A "liposome" is a small vesicle
   composed of various types of lipids, phospholipids, and/or surfactant. Liposomes are
   useful for delivery to a mammal of a compound or formulation, such as a humanized
 0 anti-IL-23p19 antibody disclosed herein, optionally, coupled to or in combination with
   one or more pharmaceutically active agents and/or labels. The components of the
   liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid
   arrangement of biological membranes.
   Certain aspects of the present invention related to isolated nucleic acids that encode
 5 one or more domains of the humanized antibodies of the present invention.            An
   "isolated" nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and
   separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is
   ordinarily associated in the natural source of the antibody nucleic acid. An isolated
   nucleic acid molecule is distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in
 0 natural cells.
   In various aspects of the present invention one or more domains of the humanized
   antibodies will be recombinantly expressed.          Such recombinant expression may
   employ one or more control sequences, i.e., polynucleotide sequences necessary for
   expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The
?5 control sequences suitable for use in prokaryotic cells include, for example, promoter,
   operator, and ribosome binding site sequences. Eukaryotic control sequences include,
   but are not limited to, promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers. These
   control sequences can be utilized for expression and production of humanized anti-IL
   23p1 9 antibody in prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells.

                                                 41
   A nucleic acid sequence is "operably linked" when it is placed into a functional
   relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, a nucleic acid
   presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding a
   polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the
 5 polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it
   affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked
   to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally,
   "operably linked" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in
   the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading frame. However, enhancers
 0 are optionally contiguous. Linking can be accomplished by ligation at convenient
   restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers
   can be used.
   As used herein, the expressions "cell", "cell line", and "cell culture" are used
   interchangeably and all such designations include the progeny thereof. Thus,
 5 "transformants" and "transformed cells" include the primary subject cell and cultures
   derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers.
   The term "mammal" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a
   mammal, including humans, domesticated and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet
   animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, and the like. Preferably, the mammal is
 0 human.
   A "disorder", as used herein, is any condition that would benefit from treatment with a
   humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody described herein. This includes chronic and acute
   disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions that predispose the
   mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples or disorders to be treated
?5 herein include inflammatory, angiogenic, autoimmune and immunologic disorders,
   respiratory disorders, cancer, hematological malignancies, benign and malignant
   tumors, leukemias and lymphoid malignancies.
   The terms "cancer" and "cancerous" refer to or describe the physiological condition in
   mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of

                                                42
   cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and
   leukemia.
   As used herein, the term "IL-23-associated disorder" or "IL-23-associated disease"
   refers to a condition in which IL-23 activity contributes to the disease and typically
 5 where IL-23 is abnormally expressed. An IL-23-associated disorder includes diseases
   and disorders of the immune system, such as autoimmune disorders and inflammatory
   disorders. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
   systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, Sjogren's syndrome, multiple
   sclerosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative
 0 colitis  and    Crohn's     disease),   pulmonary    inflammation,   asthma,     idiopathic
   thrombocytopenic      purara   (ITP)  and    spondyloarthritis, for example    ankylosing
   spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis or peripheral spondyloarthritis.
   The term "intravenous infusion" refers to introduction of an agent into the vein of an
   animal or human patient over a period of time greater than approximately 15 minutes,
 5 generally between approximately 30 to 90 minutes.
   The term "intravenous bolus" or "intravenous push" refers to drug administration into a
   vein of an animal or human such that the body receives the drug in approximately 15
   minutes or less, generally 5 minutes or less.
   The term "subcutaneous administration" refers to introduction of an agent under the
_0 skin of an animal or human patient, preferable within a pocket between the skin and
   underlying tissue, by relatively slow, sustained delivery from a drug receptacle.
   Pinching or drawing the skin up and away from underlying tissue may create the
   pocket.
   The term "subcutaneous infusion" refers to introduction of a drug under the skin of an
?5 animal or human patient, preferably within a pocket between the skin and underlying
   tissue, by relatively slow, sustained delivery from a drug receptacle for a period of time
   including, but not limited to, 30 minutes or less, or 90 minutes or less. Optionally, the
   infusion may be made by subcutaneous implantation of a drug delivery pump
   implanted under the skin of the animal or human patient, wherein the pump delivers a

                                               43
   predetermined amount of drug for a predetermined period of time, such as 30 minutes,
   90 minutes, or a time period spanning the length of the treatment regimen.
   The term "subcutaneous bolus" refers to drug administration beneath the skin of an
   animal or human patient, where bolus drug delivery is less than approximately 15
 5 minutes; in another aspect, less than 5 minutes, and in still another aspect, less than
   60 seconds. In yet even another aspect, administration is within a pocket between the
   skin and underlying tissue, where the pocket may be created by pinching or drawing
   the skin up and away from underlying tissue.
   The term "therapeutically effective amount" is used to refer to an amount of an active
 0 agent that relieves or ameliorates one or more of the symptoms of the disorder being
   treated.   In another aspect, the therapeutically effective amount refers to a target
   serum concentration that has been shown to be effective in, for example, slowing
   disease progression. Efficacy can be measured in conventional ways, depending on
   the condition to be treated.
 5 The terms "treatment" and "therapy" and the like, as used herein, are meant to include
   therapeutic as well as prophylactic, or suppressive measures for a disease or disorder
   leading to any clinically desirable or beneficial effect, including but not limited to
   alleviation or relief of one or more symptoms, regression, slowing or cessation of
   progression of the disease or disorder. Thus, for example, the term treatment includes
 0 the administration of an agent prior to or following the onset of a symptom of a disease
   or disorder thereby preventing or removing one or more signs of the disease or
   disorder. As another example, the term includes the administration of an agent after
   clinical manifestation of the disease to combat the symptoms of the disease. Further,
   administration of an agent after onset and after clinical symptoms have developed
?5 where administration affects clinical parameters of the disease or disorder, such as the
   degree of tissue injury or the amount or extent of metastasis, whether or not the
   treatment leads to amelioration of the disease, comprises "treatment" or "therapy" as
   used herein. Moreover, as long as the compositions of the invention either alone or in
   combination with another therapeutic agent alleviate or ameliorate at least one
30 symptom of a disorder being treated as compared to that symptom in the absence of

                                             44
   use of the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody composition, the result should be
   considered an effective treatment of the underlying disorder regardless of whether all
   the symptoms of the disorder are alleviated or not.
   The term "package insert" is used to refer to instructions customarily included in
 5 commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the
   indications, usage, administration, contraindications and/or warnings concerning the
   use of such therapeutic products.
   Antibodies
 0 In one aspect, described and disclosed herein are anti-IL-23 antibodies, in particular
   humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibodies, and compositions and articles of manufacture
   comprising one or more anti-IL-23 antibody, in particular one or more humanized anti
   IL-23p19 antibody of the present invention. Also described are binding agents that
   include an antigen-binding fragment of an anti-IL-23 antibody, in particular a
 5 humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody. The humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibodies and
   binding agents can inhibit the production of Th17 associated cytokines, which
   contribute to chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The humanized anti-IL
   23p1 9 antibodies and binding agents can thus be used in the treatment of a variety of
   diseases or disorders. A humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody and an IL-23p19 binding
_0 agent each includes at least a portion that specifically recognizes an IL-23p19 epitope
   (i.e., an antigen-binding fragment).
   In the initial characterization mouse antibodies were selected based on IL-23p19
   binding characterization.
   Accordingly in one aspect, an antibody of the present invention has a K0 for IL-23, in
?5 particular human IL-23, of less than 100pM. In another aspect, an antibody of the
   present invention has a K0 of less than 40pM. In another aspect, an antibody of the
   present invention has a K0 of less than 20pM.     In another aspect, an antibody of the
   present invention has a K0 of less than 10pM. In another aspect, a monoclonal
   antibody of the present invention has a K0 of less than 1pM.

                                         45
The selected mouse antibodies have the following light chain variable regions and
heavy chain variable regions as shown in Table 1 and 2:

The CDRs listed above in Tables 3 and 4 are defined using the Chothia numbering
system (Al-Lazikani et al., (1997) JMB 273,927-948).

   Fabs that showed better or equal binding as compared to the chimeric parent Fab were
   selected for conversion to IgG. 6B8 was converted to an IgG1KO format. IgG1KO
   (knock-out of effector functions) has two mutations in the Fc region, Leu234Ala and
   Leu235Ala, which reduce effector function such as FcyR and complement binding. The
 5 IgG format is described in the literature (see for example Hezareh et al. (2001) Journal
   of Virology 75: 12161-12168). Example 1 describes the humanization process in further
   detail. The results of such humanization resulted in humanized antibody sequences. A
   representative number of humanized light chain and heavy chain variable regions
   derived from mouse antibody 6B8 are provided and shown in Tables 5 and 6. An
 0 alignment between the humanized light chain and heavy chain variable regions derived
   from mouse antibody 6B8 and the chain and heavy chain variable regions from mouse
   antibody 6B8 is shown in Figure 1.
   Selected combination of humanized light chain and heavy chain variable regions derived
   from mouse antibody 6B8 resulted in Antibodies A, B, C and D:
 5 Antibody A: 6B8-IgGlKO-2 with IgK-66 (heavy chain variable region 6B8CVH-02 and
   light chain variable region 6B8CVK-66);
   Antibody B: 6B8-IgGl KO-5 with IgK-66 (heavy chain variable region 6B8CVH-05 and
   light chain variable region 6B8CVK-66);
   Antibody C: 6B8-IgGl KO-2 with IgK-65 (heavy chain variable region 6B8CVH-02 and
?0 light chain variable region 6B8CVK-65);
   Antibody D: 6B8-IgGl KO-5 with IgK-65 (heavy chain variable region 6B8CVH-05 and
   light chain variable region 6B8CVK-65).
   Antibodies A, B, C and D have the heavy and light chain sequences shown in Table 7.

-0 In one aspect, the anti-IL-23p1 9 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof comprises
   a light chain variable region comprising a L-CDR1, L-CDR2 and L-CDR3 combination
   listed above, and a heavy chain variable region comprising a H-CDR1, H-CDR2 and H
   CDR3 combination listed above.
   In specific embodiments, it is contemplated that chimeric antibodies with switched CDR
?5 regions (i.e., for example switching one or two CDRs of one of the mouse antibodies or
   humanized antibody derived therefrom with the analogous CDR from another mouse
   antibody or      humanized   antibody derived therefrom)      between   these exemplary
   immunoglobulins may yield useful antibodies.
   In certain embodiments, the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody is an antibody fragment.
30 Various antibody fragments have been generally discussed above and there are

                                               -84
   techniques that have been developed for the production of antibody fragments.
   Fragments can be derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g.,
   Morimoto et al., 1992, Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117; and
   Brennan et al., 1985, Science 229:81). Alternatively, the fragments can be produced
 5 directly in recombinant host cells. For example, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly
   recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(ab') 2 fragments (see, e.g.,
   Carter et al., 1992, Bio/Technology         10:163-167).  By another approach,       F(ab') 2
   fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques
   for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner.
 0 Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides antibody fragments
   comprising the CDRs described herein, in particular one of the combinations of L-CDR1,
   L-CDR2, L-CDR3, H-CDR1, H-CDR2 and H-CDR3 described herein. In a further aspect,
   the present invention provides antibody fragments comprising the variable regions
   described herein, for example one of the combinations of light chain variable regions
 5 and heavy chain variable regions described herein.
   Certain embodiments include an F(ab') 2 fragment of a humanized anti-IL-23p1 9 antibody
   comprise a light chain sequence of any of SEQ ID NO: 174 or 180 in combination with a
   heavy chain sequence of SEQ ID NO: 176 or 178. Such embodiments can include an
   intact antibody comprising such an F(ab') 2.
 O In some embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment includes a constant region that
   mediates effector function. The constant region can provide antibody-dependent cellular
   cytotoxicity   (ADCC),    antibody-dependent     cellular phagocytosis     (ADCP)    and/or
   complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) responses against an IL-23 expressing target
   cell. The effector domain(s) can be, for example, an Fc region of an Ig molecule.
?5 The effector domain of an antibody can be from any suitable vertebrate animal species
   and isotypes. The isotypes from different animal species differ in the abilities to mediate
   effector functions. For example, the ability of human immunoglobulin to mediate CDC
   and    ADCC/ADCP       is generally in    the order    of IgM=lgG 1 =lgG 3>IgG 2>IgG 4 and
   IgG1 =lgG 3>IgG 2/IgM/IgG 4, respectively. Murine immunoglobulins mediate CDC and
30 ADCC/ADCP       generally in the order of murine IgM=lgG 3>>IgG 2b>IgG 2 a>>IgG1 and

                                              -85
   IgG2 b>IgG 2 >IgG1>>IgG 3, respectively. In another example, murine IgG2a mediates
   ADCC while both murine IgG2a and IgM mediate CDC.
   Antibody Modifications
 5 The humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibodies and agents can include modifications of the
   humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. For example, it
   may be desirable to modify the antibody with respect to effector function, so as to
   enhance the effectiveness of the antibody in treating cancer. One such modification is
   the introduction of cysteine residue(s) into the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain
 0 disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated can
   have improved internalization capability and/or increased complement-mediated cell
   killing and/or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See, for example, Caron
   et al., 1992, J. Exp Med. 176:1191-1195; and Shopes, 1992, J. Immunol. 148:2918
   2922. Homodimeric antibodies having enhanced anti-tumor activity can also be
 5 prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al., 1993,
   Cancer Research 53: 2560-2565. Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered to
   contain dual Fc regions, enhancing complement lysis and ADCC capabilities of the
   antibody. See Stevenson et al., 1989, Anti-Cancer Drug Design 3: 219-230.
   Antibodies with improved ability to support ADCC have been generated by modifying the
?0 glycosylation pattern of their Fc region. This is possible since antibody glycosylation at
   the asparagine residue, N297, in the   CH2  domain is involved in the interaction between
   IgG and Fcy receptors prerequisite to ADCC. Host cell lines have been engineered to
   express    antibodies with altered glycosylation,     such as increased bisecting       N
   acetylglucosamine or reduced fucose. Fucose reduction provides greater enhancement
?5 to ADCC activity than does increasing the presence of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine.
   Moreover, enhancement of ADCC by low fucose antibodies is independent of the
   FcyRIlla V/F polymorphism.
   Modifying the amino acid sequence of the Fc region of antibodies is an alternative to
   glycosylation engineering to enhance ADCC. The binding site on human IgG1 for Fcy
30 receptors has been determined by extensive mutational analysis. This led to the

                                                       - 86
   generation of humanized IgGi antibodies with Fc mutations that increase the binding
   affinity for FcyRIlila and enhance ADCC in vitro. Additionally, Fc variants have been
   obtained with many different permutations of binding properties, e.g., improved binding
   to specific FcyR receptors with unchanged or diminished binding to other FcyR
 5 receptors.
   Another aspect includes immunoconjugates comprising the humanized antibody or
   fragments thereof conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a
   toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or
   fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate).
 o Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have
   been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be
   used to form useful immunoconjugates include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active
   fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A
   chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin
 5 proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), Momordica charantia
   inhibitor, curcin, crotin, Sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin,
   phenomycin, enomycin, the tricothecenes, and the like. A variety of radionuclides are
   available for the production of radioconjugated humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibodies.
   Examples include      212 Bi, 1311, 1311In, 90Y, and  1 86
                                                              Re.
?0 Conjugates of the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody and cytotoxic or chemotherapeutic
   agent can be made by known methods, using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling
   agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT),
   bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters
   (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido
?5 compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives
   (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as toluene
   2,6-diisocyanate),      and     bis-active fluorine         compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4
   dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in
   Vitetta et al., 1987, Science 238:1098. Carbon-1 4-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3
30 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent

                                              -  87
   for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. Conjugates also can be formed with a
   cleavable linker.
   The humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibodies disclosed herein can also be formulated as
   immunoliposomes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known
 5 in the art, such as described in Epstein et al., 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:3688;
   Hwang et al., 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4030; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045
   and 4,544,545. Liposomes having enhanced circulation time are disclosed, for example,
   in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556.
   Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation
 0 method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG
   derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters
   of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab' fragments of an
   antibody disclosed herein can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et
   al.,  1982, J. Biol. Chem.      257:286-288 via a disulfide interchange reaction. A
 5 chemotherapeutic agent (such as doxorubicin) is optionally contained within the
   liposome. See, e.g., Gabizon et al., 1989, J. National Cancer Inst. 81(19):1484.
   The antibodies described and disclosed herein can also be used in ADEPT (Antibody
   Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy) procedures by conjugating the antibody to a
   prodrug-activating enzyme that converts a prodrug (e.g., a peptidyl chemotherapeutic
?0 agent), to an active anti-cancer drug. See, for example, WO 81/01145, WO 88/07378,
   and U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278. The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for
   ADEPT is an enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into
   its more active, cytotoxic form. Specific enzymes that are useful in ADEPT include, but
   are not limited to, alkaline phosphatase for converting phosphate-containing prodrugs
?5 into free drugs; arylsulfatase for converting sulfate-containing prodrugs into free drugs;
   cytosine deaminase for converting non-toxic 5-fluorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug,
   5-fluorouracil;   proteases,   such    as    serratia  protease,    thermolysin, subtilisin,
   carboxypeptidases, and cathepsins (such as cathepsins B and L), for converting
   peptide-containing prodrugs into free drugs; D-alanylcarboxypeptidases, for converting
30 prodrugs containing D-amino acid substituents; carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes such as

                                               - 88
   P-galactosidase and neuraminidase for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs;
   P-lactamase for converting drugs derivatized with p-lactams into free drugs; and
   penicillin amidases, such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase, for converting
   drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups,
 5 respectively, into free drugs. Alternatively, antibodies       having enzymatic activity
   ("abzymes") can be used to convert the prodrugs into free active drugs (see, for
   example, Massey, 1987, Nature 328: 457-458). Antibody-abzyme conjugates can be
   prepared by known methods for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population, for
   example,      by   covalently   binding   the    enzyme    to  the    humanized     anti-IL
 0 23p19antibody/heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents discussed above. Alternatively,
   fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of an antibody disclosed
   herein linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme as described above
   can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques (see, e.g., Neuberger et al.,
   1984, Nature 312:604-608).
 5 In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to use a humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody
   fragment, rather than an intact antibody, to increase tissue penetration, for example. It
   may be desirable to modify the antibody fragment in order to increase its serum half life.
   This can be achieved, for example, by incorporation of a salvage receptor binding
   epitope into the antibody fragment. In one method, the appropriate region of the
-0 antibody fragment can be altered (e.g., mutated), or the epitope can be incorporated into
   a peptide tag that is then fused to the antibody fragment at either end or in the middle,
   for example, by DNA or peptide synthesis. See, e.g., WO 96/32478.
   In other embodiments, covalent modifications of the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody
   are also included. Covalent modifications include modification of cysteinyl residues,
?5 histidyl residues, lysinyl and amino-terminal residues, arginyl residues, tyrosyl residues,
   carboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl), glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues, or
   seryl, or threonyl residues. Another type of covalent modification involves chemically or
   enzymatically coupling glycosides to the antibody. Such modifications may be made by
   chemical synthesis or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of the antibody, if applicable.
30 Other types of covalent modifications of the antibody can be introduced into the

                                              - 89
   molecule by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the antibody with an organic
   derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the amino- or
   carboxy-terminal residues.
   Removal of any carbohydrate moieties present on the antibody can be accomplished
 5 chemically or enzymatically. Chemical deglycosylation is described by Hakimuddin et
   al., 1987, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 259:52 and by Edge et al., 1981, Anal. Biochem.,
   118:131. Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on antibodies can be achieved
   by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al.,
   1987, Meth. Enzymol 138:350.
 0 Another type of useful covalent modification comprises linking the antibody to one of a
   variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, or
   polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in one or more of U.S. Pat. No. 4,640,835,
   U.S. Pat. No. 4,496,689, U.S. Pat. No. 4,301,144, U.S. Pat. No. 4,670,417, U.S. Pat.
   No. 4,791,192 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337.
 5
   Humanization and Amino Acid Sequence Variants
   Amino acid sequence variants of the anti-IL-23p19 antibody can be prepared by
   introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the anti-IL-23p19 antibody DNA, or by
   peptide synthesis. Such variants include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions
?0 into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the anti-IL
   23p19 antibodies of the examples herein. Any combination of deletions, insertions, and
   substitutions is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct
   possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post
   translational processes of the humanized or variant anti-IL-23p19 antibody, such as
?5 changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.
   A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the anti-IL-23p19
   antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called "alanine scanning
   mutagenesis," as described by Cunningham and Wells (Science, 244:1081-1085
   (1989)). Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (e.g., charged residues

                                               - 90
   such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged
   amino acid (typically alanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with IL-23p19
   antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the
   substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites
 5 of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is
   predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For
   example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, alanine scanning or
   random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed anti
   IL-23p1 9 antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.
 0 Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging
   in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as
   well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of
   terminal insertions include an anti-IL-23p19 antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other
   insertional variants of the anti-IL-23p19 antibody molecule include a fusion to the N- or
 5 C-terminus of the anti-IL-23p19 antibody of an enzyme or a polypeptide which increases
   the serum half-life of the antibody.
   Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at
   least one amino acid residue in the anti-IL-23p19 antibody molecule removed and a
   different residue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional
 0 mutagenesis     include the     hypervariable    regions, but   FR   alterations    are   also
   contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 5 under the heading of
   "preferred substitutions". If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity,
   then more substantial changes, denominated "exemplary substitutions", or as further
   described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products

   In protein chemistry, it is generally accepted that the biological properties of the antibody
   can be accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on
   maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution,
   for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the
 5 molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues
   are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:
   (1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile;
   (2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr;
   (3) acidic: asp, glu;
 0 (4) basic: asn, gin, his, lys, arg;
   (5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and
   (6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.
   Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes
   for another class.
 5 Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the
   humanized or variant anti-IL-23p19 antibody also may be substituted, generally with
   serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule, prevent aberrant crosslinking,
   or provide for established points of conjugation to a cytotoxic or cytostatic compound.
   Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability
?0 (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment).
   A type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region
   residues of a parent antibody (e.g., a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the
   resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological
   properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient
?5 way for generating such substitutional variants is affinity maturation using phage display.
   Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g., 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all
   possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are
   displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the

                                               - 93
   gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are
   then screened for their biological activity (e.g., binding affinity). In order to identify
   candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagenesis can
   be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to
 5 antigen binding. Alternatively, or in addition, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal
   structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody
   and human IL-23p19. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates
   for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are
   generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and
 0 antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for
   further development.
   Another type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation
   pattern of the antibody. By "altering" is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate
   moieties found in the antibody, and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are
 5 not present in the antibody.
   In some embodiments, it may be desirable to modify the antibodies of the invention to
   add glycosylations sites.    Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or 0
   linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of
   an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine
 O X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences
   for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus,
   the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential
   glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N
   aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly
?5 serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.
   Thus, in order to glycosylate a given protein, e.g., an antibody, the amino acid sequence
   of the protein is engineered to contain one or more of the above-described tripeptide
   sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the
   addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence
30 of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).

   Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the anti-IL-23p19
   antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include,
   but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring
   amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site
 5 directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier
   prepared variant or a non-variant version of the anti-IL-23p1 9 antibody.
   Polynucleotides, Vectors, Host Cells, and Recombinant Methods
   Other embodiments encompass isolated polynucleotides that comprise a sequence
 0 encoding a humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody, vectors, and host cells comprising the
   polynucleotides, and recombinant techniques for production of the humanized antibody.
   The isolated polynucleotides can encode any desired form of the anti-IL-23p19 antibody
   including, for example, full length monoclonal antibodies, Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2, and Fv
   fragments,    diabodies,   linear   antibodies,  single-chain  antibody   molecules,   and
 5 multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.
   Some embodiments include isolated polynucleotides comprising sequences that encode
   the light chain variable region of an antibody or antibody fragment having the amino acid
   sequence of any of SEQ ID NO: SEQ ID NO:84, 86, 88, 90, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103,
   105, 107, 109, 111,      113, 115, 117 or 119. Exemplary polynucleotide sequences

   100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116 and 118. Some embodiments include
   isolated polynucleotides comprising sequences that encode the heavy chain variable
   region of an antibody or antibody fragment having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID
   NO:121, 123, 125, 127, 128, 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 150,
?5 152, 154 or 156. Exemplary polynucleotide sequences encoding such amino acid
   sequences are SEQ ID NO: 120, 122, 124, 126, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143,
   145,147,149, 151, 153 or 155.
   Some embodiments include isolated polynucleotides comprising sequences that encode
   the light chain variable region of an antibody or antibody fragment having the amino acid
30 sequence of any of SEQ ID NO:158, 160, 162 or 164. Exemplary polynucleotide

                                              - 95
   sequences encoding such amino acid sequences are SEQ ID NO:1 57, 159, 161 or 163.
   Some embodiments include isolated polynucleotides comprising sequences that encode
   the heavy chain variable region of an antibody or antibody fragment having the amino
   acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 166, 168, 170 or 172. Exemplary polynucleotide
 5 sequences encoding such amino acid sequences are SEQ ID NO: 165, 167, 169 or 171.
   Some embodiments include isolated polynucleotides comprising sequences that encode
   the light chain of an antibody having the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NO:174
   or 180. Exemplary polynucleotide sequences encoding such amino acid sequences are
   SEQ ID NO:173 or 179. Some embodiments include isolated polynucleotides comprising
 0 sequences that encode the heavy chain of an antibody having the amino acid sequence
   of SEQ ID NO:176 or 178. Exemplary polynucleotide sequences encoding such amino
   acid sequences are SEQ ID NO:175 or 177.
   In one aspect, the isolated polynucleotide sequence(s) encodes an antibody or antibody
   fragment having a light chain and a heavy chain variable region comprising the amino
 5 acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:174 and SEQ ID NO:176, respectively; SEQ ID NO:174
   and SEQ ID NO:178, respectively; SEQ ID NO:180 and SEQ ID NO:176, respectively;
   SEQ ID NO:180 and SEQ             ID NO:178,    respectively. Exemplary polynucleotide
   sequences encoding such amino acid sequences are SEQ ID NO: 173 and 175,
   respectively, SEQ ID NO: 173 and 177, respectively, SEQ ID NO: 179 and 175,
 0 respectively, SEQ ID NO: 179 and 177, respectively.
   The polynucleotide(s) that comprise a sequence encoding a humanized anti-IL-23p19
   antibody or a fragment or chain thereof can be fused to one or more regulatory or
   control sequence, as known in the art, and can be contained in suitable expression
   vectors or host cell as known in the art. Each of the polynucleotide molecules encoding
?5 the heavy or light chain variable domains can            be independently fused to a
   polynucleotide sequence encoding a constant domain, such as a human constant
   domain, enabling the production of intact antibodies. Alternatively, polynucleotides, or
   portions thereof, can be fused together, providing a template for production of a single
   chain antibody.

                                               - 96
   For recombinant production, a polynucleotide encoding the antibody is inserted into a
   replicable vector for cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. Many suitable
   vectors for expressing the recombinant antibody are available. The vector components
   generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence,
 5 an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter,
   and a transcription termination sequence.
   The humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibodies can also be produced as fusion polypeptides,
   in which the antibody is fused with a heterologous polypeptide, such as a signal
   sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the amino terminus of
 0 the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected is
   typically one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by
   the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the
   humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody signal sequence, the signal sequence can be
   substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence. The signal sequence can be, for example,
 5 alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, lipoprotein, heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders, and
   the like. For yeast secretion, the native signal sequence can be substituted, for example,
   with   a leader sequence        obtained from    yeast invertase alpha-factor      (including
   Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces a-factor leaders), acid phosphatase, C. albicans
   glucoamylase, or the signal described in W090/13646. In mammalian cells, mammalian
-0 signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD
   signal, can be used. The DNA for such precursor region is ligated in reading frame to
   DNA encoding the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody.
   Expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector
   to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning vectors this
?5 sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host
   chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating
   sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses.
   The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative
   bacteria, the 2-1. plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40,
30 polyoma, adenovirus, VSV, and BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells.

                                               - 97
   Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression
   vectors (the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early
   promoter).
   Expression and cloning vectors may contain a gene that encodes a selectable marker to
 5 facilitate identification of expression. Typical selectable marker genes encode proteins
   that confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin,
   methotrexate, or tetracycline, or alternatively, are complement auxotrophic deficiencies,
   or in other alternatives supply specific nutrients that are not present in complex media,
   e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli.
 o One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those
   cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein
   conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such
   dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid, and hygromycin.
   Common selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification
 5 of cells competent to take up a nucleic acid encoding a humanized anti-IL-23p19
   antibody, such as DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase), thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I
   and -II (such as primate metallothionein genes), adenosine deaminase, ornithine
   decarboxylase, and the like. Cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first
   identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains
 O methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when
   wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in
   DHFR activity (e.g., DG44).
   Alternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR)
   transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding anti-IL-23p19 antibody,
?5 wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3'
   phosphotransferase (APH), can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a
   selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g.,
   kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199.
   Where the recombinant production is performed in a yeast cell as a host cell, the TRP1
30 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 (Stinchcomb et al., 1979, Nature 282: 39) can

                                                -98
   be used as a selectable marker. The TRP1 gene provides a selection marker for a
   mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No.
   44076 or PEP4-1 (Jones, 1977, Genetics 85:12). The presence of the trpl lesion in the
   yeast   host cell genome        then   provides an effective environment for detecting
 5 transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly, Leu2p-deficient yeast
   strains such as ATCC 20,622 and 38,626 are complemented by known plasmids
   bearing the LEU2 gene.
   In addition, vectors derived from the 1.6 pm circular plasmid pKD1 can be used for
   transformation of Kluyveromyces yeasts. Alternatively, an expression system for large
 0 scale production of recombinant calf chymosin was reported for K. lactis (Van den Berg,
   1990, Bio/Technology 8:135). Stable multi-copy expression vectors for secretion of
   mature recombinant human serum albumin by industrial strains of Kluyveromyces have
   also been disclosed (Fleer et al., 1991, Bio/Technology 9:968-975).
   Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host
 5 organism and is operably linked to the nucleic acid molecule encoding an anti-IL-23p19
   antibody or polypeptide chain thereof. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts
   include phoA       promoter,    p-lactamase    and lactose promoter    systems,   alkaline
   phosphatase, tryptophan (trp) promoter system, and hybrid promoters such as the tac
   promoter. Other known bacterial promoters are also suitable. Promoters for use in
 0 bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to
   the DNA encoding the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody.
   Many eukaryotic promoter sequences are known. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an
   AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where
   transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start
?5 of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At
   the 3' end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for
   addition of the poly A tail to the 3' end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences
   are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.
   Examples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the
30 promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, such as enolase,

                                               -99
   glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,         hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase,
   phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase,
   pyruvate     kinase,  triosephosphate    isomerase,   phosphoglucose       isomerase,  and
   glucokinase.
 5 Inducible promoters have the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth
   conditions. These include yeast promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2,
   isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, derivative enzymes associated with nitrogen
   metabolism,      metallothionein,   glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate      dehydrogenase,     and
   enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and
 0 promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73,657. Yeast
   enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.
   Humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is
   controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as
   polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma
 5 virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and Simian
   Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or
   an immunoglobulin promoter, or from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters
   are compatible with the host cell systems.
   The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40
?0 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate
   early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIl E
   restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine
   papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,446. A modification of this
   system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,978. See also Reyes et al., 1982, Nature
?5 297:598-601, disclosing expression of human p-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under
   the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the
   Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.
   Another useful element that can be used in a recombinant expression vector is an
   enhancer sequence, which is used to increase the transcription of a DNA encoding a
30 humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody by higher eukaryotes. Many enhancer sequences are

                                             -100
   now known from mammalian genes (e.g., globin, elastase, albumin, a-fetoprotein, and
   insulin). Typically, however, an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus is used. Examples
   include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the
   cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the
 5 replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, 1982, Nature 297:17-18
   for a description of enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The
   enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5' or 3' to the humanized anti-IL
   23p19 antibody-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5' from the
   promoter.
 0 Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal,
   human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) can also contain
   sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA.
   Such sequences are commonly available from the 5' and, occasionally 3', untranslated
   regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide
 5 segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the
   mRNA encoding anti-IL-23p19 antibody. One useful transcription termination component
   is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See W094/11026 and the
   expression vector disclosed therein. In some embodiments, humanized anti-IL-23p19
   antibodies can be expressed using the CHEF system. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No.
-0 5,888,809; the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.)
   Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are the
   prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells described above. Suitable prokaryotes for
   this purpose include eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for
   example, Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia, e.g., E. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia,
?5 Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, e.g., Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia, e.g., Serratia
   marcescans, and Shigella, as well as Bacilli such as B. subtilis and B. licheniformis (e.g.,
   B. licheniformis 41 P disclosed in DD 266,710 published Apr. 12, 1989), Pseudomonas
   such as P. aeruginosa, and Streptomyces. One preferred E. coli cloning host is E. coli
   294 (ATCC 31,446), although other strains such as E. coli B, E. coli X1776 (ATCC

                                              -101
   31,537), and E. coli W31 10 (ATCC 27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative
   rather than limiting.
   In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are
   suitable cloning or expression hosts for humanized anti-IL-23pl9antibody-encoding
 5 vectors. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or common baker's yeast, is the most commonly
   used among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms. However, a number of other genera,
   species,    and    strains are   commonly     available   and  useful   herein,  such  as
   Schizosaccharomyces pombe; Kluyveromyces hosts such as, e.g., K. lactis, K. fragilis
   (ATCC 12,424), K. bulgaricus (ATCC 16,045), K. wickeramii (ATCC 24,178), K. waltii
 0 (ATCC 56,500), K. drosophilarum (ATCC 36,906), K. thermotolerans, and K. marxianus;
   yarrowia (EP 402,226); Pichia pastors (EP 183,070); Candida; Trichoderma reesia (EP
   244,234); Neurospora crassa; Schwanniomyces such as Schwanniomyces occidentalis;
   and filamentous fungi such as, e.g., Neurospora, Penicillium, Tolypocladium, and
   Aspergillus hosts such as A. nidulans and A. niger.
 5 Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody
   are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include plant
   and insect cells, including, e.g., numerous baculoviral strains and variants and
   corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as Spodoptera frugiperda
   (caterpillar), Aedes aegypti (mosquito), Aedes albopictus (mosquito),           Drosophila
 O melanogaster (fruitfly), and Bombyx mori (silk worm). A variety of viral strains for
   transfection are publicly available, e.g., the L-1 variant of Autographa californica NPV
   and the Bm-5 strain of Bombyx mori NPV, and such viruses may be used, particularly
   for transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells.
   Plant cell cultures of cotton, corn, potato, soybean, petunia, tomato, and tobacco can
?5 also be utilized as hosts.
   In another aspect, expression of humanized anti-IL-23p19 is carried out in vertebrate
   cells. The propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become routine
   procedure and techniques are widely available. Examples of useful mammalian host cell
   lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651),
30 human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension

   ATCC CCL 10), Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR1 (CHO, Urlaub et al., 1980, Proc.
   Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 77: 4216; e.g., DG44), mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, 1980,
   Biol. Reprod. 23:243-251), monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70), African green
 5 monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587), human cervical carcinoma cells

   (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442), human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75), human liver cells
   (Hep G2, HB 8065), mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51), TR1 cells
   (Mather et al., 1982, Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. 383: 44-68), MRC 5 cells, FS4 cells, and
 0 human hepatoma line (Hep G2).
   Host cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for
   humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient
   media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or
   amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.
 5 The host cells used to produce a humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody described herein
   may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F1 0
   (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, Mo.), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma-Aldrich
   Co.), RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium
   ((DMEM), Sigma-Aldrich Co.) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of
 0 the media described in one or more of Ham et al., 1979, Meth. Enz. 58: 44, Barnes et
   al., 1980, Anal. Biochem. 102: 255, U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,704, U.S. Pat. No. 4,657,866,
   U.S. Pat. No. 4,927,762, U.S. Pat. No. 4,560,655, U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,469, WO
   90/103430, and WO 87/00195 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of
   these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth
?5 factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium
   chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides
   (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as gentamicin), trace elements
   (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the
   micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Other supplements
30 may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled

                                                 -103
   in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those
   previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the
   ordinarily skilled artisan.
   When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, in the
 5 periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced
   intracellularly, the cells may be disrupted to release protein as a first step. Particulate
   debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, can be removed, for example, by
   centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al., 1992, Bio/Technology 10:163-167 describes
   a procedure for isolating antibodies that are secreted to the periplasmic space of E. coli.
 0 Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and
   phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30 minutes. Cell debris can be
   removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the                 medium,
   supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a
   commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore
 5 Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of
   the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the
   growth of adventitious contaminants. A variety of methods can be used to isolate the
   antibody from the host cell.
   The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example,
 O hydroxylapatite       chromatography,      gel    electrophoresis,  dialysis,  and   affinity
   chromatography, with affinity chromatography being a typical purification technique. The
   suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any
   immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to
   purify antibodies that are based on human gammal, gamma2, or gamma4 heavy chains
?5 (see, e.g., Lindmark et al., 1983 J. Immunol. Meth. 62:1-13). Protein G is recommended
   for all mouse isotypes and for human gamma3 (see, e.g., Guss et al., 1986 EMBO J.
   5:1567-1575). A matrix to which an affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but
   other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass
   or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times
30 than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH3 domain, the

                                               -104
   Bakerbond ABX TM resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other
   techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column,
   ethanol precipitation, reverse phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography
   on heparin SEPHAROSETM chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such
 5 as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate
   precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.
   Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of
   interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction
   chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, typically
 0 performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).
   Also included are nucleic acids that hybridize under low, moderate, and high stringency
   conditions, as defined herein, to all or a portion (e.g., the portion encoding the variable
   region) of the nucleotide sequence represented by isolated polynucleotide sequence(s)
   that encode an antibody or antibody fragment of the present invention.The hybridizing
 5 portion of the hybridizing nucleic acid is typically at least 15 (e.g., 20, 25, 30 or 50)
   nucleotides in length. The hybridizing portion of the hybridizing nucleic acid is at least
   80%, e.g., at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 98%, identical to the sequence of a
   portion or all of a nucleic acid encoding an anti-IL-23p19 polypeptide (e.g., a heavy
   chain or light chain variable region), or its complement. Hybridizing nucleic acids of the
 0 type described herein can be used, for example, as a cloning probe, a primer, e.g., a
   PCR primer, or a diagnostic probe.

   130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 150, 152, 154 or 156. Some
   embodiments include isolated polynucleotides including sequences that encode an

   identical to the amino acid sequence of any of one SEQ ID NO:1 66, 168, 170 or 172. As
   used herein, the terms "identical" or "percent identity," in the context of two or more
   nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refer to two or              more sequences or
   subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of nucleotides or amino
 5 acid residues that are the same, when compared and aligned for maximum
   correspondence. To determine the percent identity, the sequences are aligned for
   optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first
   amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino or
   nucleic acid sequence). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino
 0 acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first
   sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the
   corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that
   position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of
   identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity=# of identical positions/total
 5 # of positions (e.g., overlapping positions)x100). In some embodiments, the two
   sequences that are compared are the same length after gaps are introduced within the
   sequences, as appropriate (e.g., excluding additional sequence extending beyond the
   sequences being compared).        For example, when variable region sequences are
   compared, the leader and/or constant domain sequences are not considered. For
 0 sequence comparisons between two sequences, a "corresponding" CDR refers to a
   CDR in the same location in both sequences (e.g., CDR-H1 of each sequence).
   The determination of percent identity or percent similarity between two sequences can
   be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred, non-limiting example of a
   mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of
?5 Karlin and Altschul, 1990, Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2264-2268, modified as in
   Karlin and Altschul, 1993, Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5877. Such an algorithm
   is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al., 1990, J. Mol.
   Biol. 215:403-410. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST
   program, score=100, wordlength=12, to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a
30 nucleic acid encoding a protein of interest. BLAST protein searches can be performed
   with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3, to obtain amino acid sequences

                                            -107
   homologous to protein of interest. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison
   purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al., 1997, Nucleic
   Acids Res. 25:3389-3402. Alternatively, PSI-Blast can be used to perform an iterated
   search which detects distant relationships between molecules (Id.). When utilizing
 5 BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI-Blast programs, the default parameters of the
   respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. Another preferred, non
   limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is
   the algorithm of Myers and Miller, CABIOS (1989). Such an algorithm is incorporated
   into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment
 0 software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid
   sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap
   penalty of 4 can be used. Additional algorithms for sequence analysis are known in the
   art and include ADVANCE and ADAM as described in Torellis and Robotti, 1994,
   Comput. Apple. Biosci. 10:3-5; and FASTA described in Pearson and Lipman, 1988,
 5 Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444-8. Within FASTA, ktup is a control option that sets
   the sensitivity and speed of the search. If ktup=2, similar regions in the two sequences
   being compared are found by looking at pairs of aligned residues; if ktup=1, single
   aligned amino acids are examined. ktup can be set to 2 or 1 for protein sequences, or
   from 1 to 6 for DNA sequences. The default if ktup is not specified is 2 for proteins and 6
 0 for DNA. Alternatively, protein sequence alignment may be carried out using the
   CLUSTAL W algorithm, as described by Higgins et al., 1996, Methods Enzymol.
   266:383-402.
   Non-Therapeutic Uses
?5 The antibodies described herein are useful as affinity purification agents. In this process,
   the antibodies are immobilized on a solid phase such a Protein A resin, using methods
   well known in the art. The immobilized antibody is contacted with a sample containing
   the IL-23p19 protein (or fragment thereof) to be purified, and thereafter the support is
   washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the
30 sample except the IL-2319 protein, which is bound to the immobilized antibody. Finally,

                                               -108
   the support is washed with another suitable solvent that will release the IL-23p1 9 protein
   from the antibody.
   Anti-IL-23p19 antibodies, for example humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibodies, are also
   useful in diagnostic assays to detect and/or quantify IL-23 protein, for example,
 5 detecting IL-23 expression in specific cells, tissues, or serum. The anti-IL-23p19
   antibodies can be used diagnostically to, for example, monitor the development or
   progression of a disease as part of a clinical testing procedure to, e.g., determine the
   efficacy of a given treatment and/or prevention regimen. Detection can be facilitated by
   coupling the anti-IL-23p19 antibody. Examples of detectable substances include various
 0 enzymes,      prosthetic   groups,    fluorescent     materials,  luminescent    materials,
   bioluminescent materials, radioactive materials, positron emitting metals using various
   positron emission tomographies, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. See, for
   example, U.S. Patent No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to
   antibodies for use as diagnostics according to the present invention.
 5 The anti-IL-23p1 9 antibodies can be used in methods for diagnosing an IL-23
   associated disorder (e.g., a disorder characterized by abnormal expression of IL-23) or
   to determine if a subject has an increased risk of developing an IL-23-associated
   disorder. Such methods include contacting a biological sample from a subject with an
   IL-23p1 9 antibody and detecting binding of the antibody to IL-23p1 9. By "biological
 0 sample" is intended any biological sample obtained from an individual, cell line, tissue
   culture, or other source of cells potentially expressing IL-23. Methods for obtaining
   tissue biopsies and body fluids from mammals are well known in the art.
   In some embodiments, the method can further comprise comparing the level of IL-23 in
   a patient sample to a control sample (e.g., a subject that does not have an IL-23
?5 associated disorder) to determine if the patient has an IL-23-associated disorder or is at
   risk of developing an IL-23-associated disorder.
   It will be advantageous in some embodiments, for example, for diagnostic purposes to
   label the antibody with a detectable moiety. Numerous detectable labels are available,
   including radioisotopes, fluorescent labels, enzyme substrate labels and the like. The
30 label may be indirectly conjugated with the antibody using various known techniques.

                                               -109
   For example, the antibody can be conjugated with biotin and any of the three broad
   categories of labels mentioned above can be conjugated with avidin, or vice versa.
   Biotin binds selectively to avidin and thus, the label can be conjugated with the antibody
   in this indirect manner. Alternatively, to achieve indirect conjugation of the label with the
 5 antibody, the antibody can be conjugated with a small hapten (such as digoxin) and one
   of the different types of labels mentioned above is conjugated with an anti-hapten
   antibody (e.g., anti-digoxin antibody). Thus, indirect conjugation of the label with the
   antibody can be achieved.
   Exemplary radioisotopes labels include     35S,  14C, 1251, 3
                                                                 H, and 1311. The antibody can be
 0 labeled with the radioisotope, using the techniques described in, for example, Current
   Protocols in Immunology, Volumes 1 and 2, 1991, Coligen et al., Ed. Wiley-Interscience,
   New York, N.Y., Pubs. Radioactivity can be measured, for example, by scintillation
   counting.
   Exemplary fluorescent labels include labels derived from rare earth chelates (europium
 5 chelates) or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl,
   Lissamine, phycoerythrin, and Texas Red are available. The fluorescent labels can be
   conjugated to the antibody via known techniques, such as those disclosed in Current
   Protocols in Immunology, for example. Fluorescence can be quantified using a
   fluorimeter.
?0 There are various well-characterized enzyme-substrate labels known in the art (see,
   e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149 for a review). The enzyme generally catalyzes a chemical
   alteration of the chromogenic substrate that can be measured using various techniques.
   For example, alteration may be a color change in a substrate that can be measured
   spectrophotometrically. Alternatively, the enzyme may alter the fluorescence or
?5 chemiluminescence      of the substrate.       Techniques for quantifying        a change in
   fluorescence     are  described    above.    The    chemiluminescent       substrate  becomes
   electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light that can be
   measured, using a chemiluminometer, for example, or donates energy to a fluorescent
   acceptor.

                                              -110
   Examples of enzymatic labels include luciferases such as firefly luciferase and bacterial
   luciferase (U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, malate
   dehydrogenase, urease, peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase (HRPO), alkaline
   phosphatase, p-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharine oxidases (such as
 5 glucose    oxidase, galactose   oxidase, and      glucose-6-phosphate   dehydrogenase),
   heterocyclic oxidases (such as uricase and xanthine oxidase), lactoperoxidase,
   microperoxidase, and the like. Techniques for conjugating enzymes to antibodies are
   described, for example, in O'Sullivan et al., 1981, Methods for the Preparation of
   Enzyme-Antibody Conjugates for use in Enzyme Immunoassay, in Methods in Enzym.
 0 (J. Langone & H. Van Vunakis, eds.), Academic press, N.Y., 73: 147-166.
   Examples of enzyme-substrate combinations            include, for example: Horseradish
   peroxidase (HRPO) with hydrogen peroxidase as a substrate, wherein the hydrogen
   peroxidase oxidizes a dye precursor such as orthophenylene diamine (OPD) or 3,3',5,5'
   tetramethyl benzidine hydrochloride (TMB); alkaline phosphatase (AP) with para
 5 Nitrophenyl phosphate as chromogenic substrate; and p-D-galactosidase (p-D-Gal) with
   a chromogenic substrate such as p-nitrophenyl-p-D-galactosidase or fluorogenic
   substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-p-D-galactosidase.
   Numerous other enzyme-substrate combinations are available to those skilled in the art.

?0 In another embodiment, the humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody is used unlabeled and
   detected with a labeled antibody that binds the humanized anti-IL-23p1 9 antibody.
   The antibodies described herein may be employed in any known assay method, such as
   competitive     binding   assays,   direct    and    indirect  sandwich    assays,  and
   immunoprecipitation assays. See, e.g., Zola, Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of
?5 Techniques, pp. 147-158 (CRC Press, Inc. 1987).
   The anti-IL-23p19 antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof can be used to inhibit
   the binding of IL-23 to the IL-23 receptor. Such methods comprise administering an
   anti-IL-23p19 antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof to a cell (e.g., a mammalian
   cell) or cellular environment, whereby signaling mediated by the IL-23 receptor is
30 inhibited. These methods can be performed in vitro or in vivo. By "cellular environment"

                                             - 111
   is intended the tissue, medium, or extracellular matrix surrounding a cell. The anti-IL
   23p19 antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof is administered to the cellular
   environment of a cell in such a manner that the antibody or fragment is capable of
   binding to IL-23 molecules outside of and surrounding the cell, therefore, preventing the
 5 binding of IL-23 to its receptor.
   Diagnostic Kits
   An anti-IL-23p19 antibody can be used in a diagnostic kit, i.e., a packaged combination
   of reagents in predetermined amounts with instructions for performing the diagnostic
 0 assay. Where the antibody is labeled with an enzyme, the kit may include substrates
   and cofactors required by the enzyme such as a substrate precursor that provides the
   detectable chromophore or fluorophore. In addition, other additives may be included
   such as stabilizers, buffers (for example a block buffer or lysis buffer), and the like. The
   relative amounts of the various reagents may be varied widely to provide for
 5 concentrations in solution of the reagents that substantially optimize the sensitivity of the
   assay. The reagents may be provided as dry powders, usually lyophilized, including
   excipients that on dissolution will provide a reagent solution having the appropriate
   concentration.
?0 Therapeutic Uses
   In another embodiment, a humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody disclosed herein is useful
   in the treatment of various disorders associated with the expression of IL-23p19 as
   described    herein.   Methods for treating   an   IL-23 associated disorder comprise
   administering a therapeutically effective amount of a humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody
?5 to a subject in need thereof.
   The humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody or agent is administered by any suitable means,
   including parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and,
   if desired for local immunosuppressive treatment, intralesional administration (including
   perfusing or otherwise contacting the graft with the antibody before transplantation). The

                                               -112
   humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody or agent can be administered, for example, as an
   infusion or as a bolus. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous,
   intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In addition, the humanized
   anti-IL-23p19 antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion, particularly with
 5 declining doses of the antibody. In one aspect, the dosing is given by injections, most
   preferably intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the
   administration is brief or chronic.
   For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of antibody will
   depend on a variety of factors such as the type of disease to be treated, as defined
 0 above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for
   preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and
   response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is
   suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments.
   Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 rig/kg to 20 mg/kg (e.g., 0.1
 5 15 mg/kg) of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient,
   whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous
   infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 pg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more,
   depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several
   days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired
?0 suppression of disease symptoms occurs. However, other dosage regimens may be
   useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and
   assays. An exemplary dosing regimen is that disclosed in WO 94/04188.
   The term "suppression" is used herein in the same context as "amelioration" and
   "alleviation" to mean a lessening of one or more characteristics of the disease.
?5 The antibody composition will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion
   consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include
   the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical
   condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the
   agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors
30 known to medical practitioners. The "therapeutically effective amount" of the antibody to

                                             -113
   be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount
   necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat the disorder associated with IL-23 expression.
   The antibody need not be, but is optionally, formulated with one or more agents
   currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such
 5 other agents depends on the amount of humanized anti-IL-23p19 antibody present in
   the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above.
   These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used
   hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages.
 o IL-23-Associated Disorders
   The anti-IL-23p19 antibodies or agents are useful for treating or preventing an
   immunological disorder characterized by abnormal expression of IL-23, e.g., by
   inappropriate activation of immune cells (e.g., lymphocytes or dendritic cells). Such
   abnormal expression of IL-23 can be due to, for example, increased IL-23 protein levels.
 5 The anti-IL-23p19 antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof also find use in the
   treatment or prevention of respiratory disorders, metabolic disorders, for example
   diabetes mellitus, and certain cancers. Treatment or prevention of the immunological
   disorder, respiratory disorder, metabolic disorder or cancer, according to the methods
   described herein, is achieved by administering to a subject in need of such treatment or
?0 prevention an effective amount of the anti-IL-23p19 antibody or agent, whereby the
   antibody decreases the activity of IL-23 associated with the disease state.
   Immunological diseases that are characterized by inappropriate activation of immune
   cells and that can be treated or prevented by the methods described herein can be
   classified, for example, by the type(s) of hypersensitivity reaction(s) that underlie the
?5 disorder. These reactions are typically classified into four types: anaphylactic reactions,
   cytotoxic (cytolytic) reactions, immune complex reactions, or cell-mediated immunity
   (CMI) reactions (also referred to as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions).
   (See, e.g., Fundamental Immunology (William E. Paul ed., Raven Press, N.Y., 3rd ed.
   1993).)   Immunological diseases include inflammatory diseases and autoimmune
30 diseases.

                                                 -114
   Specific examples of immunological diseases include the following: rheumatoid arthritis,
   autoimmune demyelinative diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, allergic encephalomyelitis),
   endocrine opthalmopathy, uveoretinitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia
   gravis, Grave's disease, glomerulonephritis, autoimmune hepatological disorder,
 5 inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis), anaphylaxis,
   allergic reaction, Sjogren's syndrome, type I diabetes mellitus, primary biliary cirrhosis,
   Wegener's granulomatosis, fibromyalgia, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inflammatory
   myositis, multiple endocrine failure, Schmidt's syndrome, autoimmune uveitis, Addison's
   disease, adrenalitis, thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autoimmune thyroid disease,

   autoimmune thrombocytopenia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia,
   pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus, dermatitis herpetiformis, alopecia arcata, pemphigoid,
   scleroderma, progressive systemic sclerosis, CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's
 5 phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyl), and telangiectasia), male and
   female autoimmune infertility, ankylosing spondolytis, ulcerative colitis, mixed
   connective tissue disease, polyarteritis nedosa, systemic necrotizing vasculitis, atopic
   dermatitis, atopic rhinitis, Goodpasture's syndrome, Chagas' disease, sarcoidosis,
   rheumatic fever, asthma, recurrent abortion, anti-phospholipid syndrome, farmer's lung,
 0 erythema multiforme, post cardiotomy syndrome, Cushing's syndrome, autoimmune
   chronic active hepatitis, bird-fancier's lung, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Alport's
   syndrome, alveolitis, allergic alveolitis, fibrosing alveolitis, interstitial lung disease,
   erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, transfusion reaction, Takayasu's arteritis,
   polymyalgia rheumatica, temporal arteritis, schistosomiasis, giant cell arteritis,
?5 ascariasis, aspergillosis, Sampter's syndrome, eczema, lymphomatoid granulomatosis,
   Behcet's disease, Caplan's syndrome, Kawasaki's disease (also known as Kawasaki
   syndrome or Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome), dengue, encephalomyelitis,
   endocarditis, endomyocardial fibrosis, endophthalmitis, erythema elevatum et diutinum,
   psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, erythroblastosis fetalis, eosinophilic faciitis, Shulman's
30 syndrome, Felty's syndrome, filariasis, cyclitis, chronic cyclitis, heterochronic cyclitis,
   Fuch's cyclitis, IgA nephropathy, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, graft versus host disease,

                                                 -115
   transplantation rejection, cardiomyopathy, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, relapsing
   polychondritis, cryoglobulinemia, Waldenstrom's macroglobulemia, Evan's syndrome,
   acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary inflammation, osteoporosis, delayed
   type hypersensitivity and autoimmune gonadal failure.
 5 In one aspect, the immunological disease is psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic
   inflammatory disease of the skin characterized by dysfunctional keratinocyte
   differentiation and hyperproliferation and marked accumulation of inflammatory T cells
   and dendritic cells. For example, the immunological disease includes plaque psoriasis,
   for example chronic plaque psoriasis, for example moderate to severe chronic plaque
 o psoriasis, for example in patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or
   phototherapy. For example, the immunological disease includes palmar pustular
   psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, inverse psoriasis, pustular psoriasis or erythodermic
   psoriasis.
   In a further aspect, the immunological disease is Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD)
 5 is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic transmural inflammatory
   lesions in the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier and mucosa. CD can affect any site within
   the GI tract, most frequently the terminal ileum. CD typically follows a relapsing and
   remitting course, and causes substantial acute and long-term morbidity and increased
   mortality. Patients often develop local complications (e.g. fistulas, abscesses), systemic
 O complications (e.g. uveitis, arthritis), or side effects of treatment, and may require major
   surgery. Roughly a third of patients fall into each of the categories of mild, moderate,
   and severe disease. Patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's Disease have debilitating
   illness with clinical features such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, abscess formation, and
   fistulae.
?5 In a further aspect, the immunological disease is spondyloarthritis. In a further aspect,
   the disease is ankylosing spondylitis (also called radiographic spondyloarthritis).
   Ankylosing spondylitis (AS; radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) is the prototypical form
   of the spondyloarthritides (SpA). It is a crippling insidious rheumatologic disease that is
   commoner in males than females and affects young individuals; in 80% of patients the
30 onset of symptoms occurs at less than 30 years of age. It is characterized by an

                                                 -116
   inflammatory component which contributes to the Ankylosing Spondylitis Activity Score
   (ASAS) that is used as a measure of improvement in treatment studies. Additionally,
   abnormal bone growth results in the formation of bony spurs (syndesmophytes) visible
   on plain radiographs accompanied by increased spinal rigidity, ultimately leading to bony
 5 ankylosis and vertebral deformities. In a further aspect, the immunological disease is
   non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis. Non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis
   (nrSpA), a more recently defined entity than AS, is considered to represent an earlier
   manifestation of the same pathologic processes as AS, although it is increasingly
   recognized that some patients (particularly females) may not progress to radiographic
 0 disease, and may therefore be considered to have a distinct subtype of this disease. In a
   further aspect, the disease is peripheral spondyloarthritis. Peripheral spondyloarthritis
   can be defined by the presence of arthritis, enthesitis, or dactylitis, with either at least
   one 'specific' SpA feature (psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, preceding infection,
   HLA-B27, uveitis, sacroiliitis on imaging) or at least two of the remaining SpA-features
 5 (arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, inflammatory back pain in the past, positive family history
   for SpA). This definition is for example used by ASAS (Association SpondyloArthritis
   investigation Society), see also for example Carron P. et al. (Curr Opinion Rheumatol
   2012; 24: 370-4).
   In some embodiments, the immunological disorder is a T cell-mediated immunological
-0 disorder and accordingly, the anti-IL-23p19 antibodies and agents as described herein
   are also useful for treating or preventing T cell-mediated immunological disorders.
   In one aspect, the anti-IL-23p19 antibodies or agents are useful for treating or
   preventing a respiratory disorder in which IL-23 is abnormally expressed. Treatment or
   prevention of the respiratory disorder, according to the methods described herein, is
?5 achieved by administering to a subject in need of such treatment or prevention an
   effective amount of the anti-IL-23p19 antibody or agent, whereby the antibody
   decreases the activity of IL-23 associated with the disease state.These include, but are
   not limited to: respiratory complaints, obstructive pulmonary diseases of various origins,
   pulmonary emphysema of various origins, restrictive pulmonary diseases, interstitial
30 pulmonary diseases, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, bronchitis of various origins,

                                              -117
   bronchiectasis, ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome) and all forms of pulmonary
   oedema;     obstructive pulmonary diseases selected from         among COPD       (chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease), asthma, bronchial asthma, paediatric asthma, severe
   asthma, acute asthma attacks and chronic bronchitis; pulmonary emphysema which has
 5 its origins in COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or al-proteinase inhibitor
   deficiency; restrictive pulmonary diseases selected from among allergic alveolitis,
   restrictive pulmonary diseases triggered by work-related noxious substances, such as
   asbestosis or silicosis, and restriction caused by lung tumours, such as lymphangiosis
   carcinomatosa, bronchoalveolar carcinoma and lymphomas; pneumonia caused by
 0 infections, such as for example infection by viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths
   or other pathogens, pneumonitis caused by various factors, such as for example
   aspiration and left heart insufficiency, radiation-induced pneumonitis or fibrosis,
   collagenoses, such as for example lupus erythematosus, systemic scleroderma or
   sarcoidosis, granulomatoses, such as for example Boeck's disease, idiopathic interstitial
 5 pneumonia or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); mucoviscidosis, bronchitis caused by
   bacterial or viral infection, allergic bronchitis and toxic bronchitis; bronchiectasis;
   pulmonary oedema, for example, toxic pulmonary oedema after aspiration or inhalation
   of toxic substances and foreign substances; rhinitis, arthritis and related arthropathies,
   psoriasis, myeloid leukemia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, glomerulonephritis,
 o and chronic atopic dermatitis.
   In another aspect, the anti-IL-23p19 antibodies and agents as described herein are also
   useful for treating cancers, in which IL-23 is abnormally expressed.
   IL-23-expressing cancers that can be treated by the methods described herein include,
   for example, leukemia, such as acute leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute
?5 myelocytic leukemia (e.g., myeloblastic, promyelocytic, myelomonocytic, monocytic, or
   erythroleukemia), chronic leukemia, chronic myelocytic (granulocytic) leukemia, or
   chronic lymphocytic leukemia; Polycythemia vera; Lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin's disease

   Vasculitis, scleritis or sepsis.
   Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration Thereof
?0 A composition comprising an IL-23p19 binding agent (e.g., an anti-IL-23p19 antibody)
   can be administered to a subject having or at risk of having an immunological disorder,
   respiratory disorder or a cancer. The invention further provides for the use of a IL-23p19
   binding agent (e.g., an anti-IL-23p19 antibody) in the manufacture of a medicament for
   prevention or treatment of a cancer, respiratory disorder or immunological disorder. The
?5 term "subject" as used herein means any mammalian patient to which an IL-23p19
   binding agent can be administered, including, e.g., humans and non-human mammals,
   such as primates, rodents, and dogs. Subjects specifically intended for treatment using
   the methods described herein include humans. The antibodies or agents can be
   administered either alone or in combination with other compositions in the prevention or
30 treatment of the        immunological disorder, respiratory disorder or cancer. Such

                                           -119
   compositions which can be administered in combination with the antibodies or agents
   include methotrexate (MTX) and immunomodulators, e.g. antibodies or small molecules.
   Examples of antibodies for use in such pharmaceutical compositions are those that
   comprise a humanized antibody or antibody fragment having the light chain variable
 5 region amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NO: 84, 86, 88, 90, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99,
   101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117 or 119. Examples of antibodies for use in
   such pharmaceutical compositions are also those that comprise a humanized antibody

   Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the IL-23p1 9 binding
   agent. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular,

                                             -120
   intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The IL
   23p19 binding agent can be administered, for example by infusion, bolus or injection,
   and can be administered together with other biologically active agents such as
   chemotherapeutic agents. Administration can be systemic or local.            In preferred
 5 embodiments, the administration is by subcutaneous injection.      Formulations for such
   injections may be prepared in for example prefilled syringes that may be administered
   once every other week.
   In specific embodiments, the IL-23p19 binding agent composition is administered by
   injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant,
 0 the implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including a
   membrane, such as a sialastic membrane, or a fiber. Typically, when administering the
   composition, materials to which the anti-IL-23p19 antibody or agent does not absorb are
   used.
   In other embodiments, the anti-IL-23p19 antibody or agent is delivered in a controlled
 5 release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see, e.g., Langer, 1990,
   Science 249:1527-1533; Sefton, 1989, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201; Buchwald
   et al., 1980, Surgery 88:507; Saudek et al., 1989, N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574). In another
   embodiment, polymeric materials can be used. (See, e.g., Medical Applications of
   Controlled Release (Langer and Wise eds., CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., 1974);
 O Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance (Smolen and Ball
   eds., Wiley, New York, 1984); Ranger and Peppas, 1983, Macromol. Sci. Rev.
   Macromol. Chem. 23:61. See also Levy et al., 1985, Science 228:190; During et al.,
   1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 1989, J. Neurosurg. 71:105.) Other controlled
   release systems are discussed, for example, in Langer, supra.
?5 An IL-23p19 binding agent (e.g., an anti-IL-23p19 antibody) can be administered as
   pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the
   binding agent and one or more pharmaceutically compatible ingredients.
   In typical embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated in accordance
   with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous or
30 subcutaneous       administration  to  human     beings.  Typically,   compositions    for

                                             -121
   administration by injection are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where
   necessary, the pharmaceutical can also include a solubilizing agent and a local
   anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the
   ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for
 5 example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed
   container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where
   the pharmaceutical is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an
   infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the
   pharmaceutical is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or
 0 saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.
   Further, the pharmaceutical composition can be provided as a pharmaceutical kit
   comprising (a) a container containing a IL-23p19 binding agent (e.g., an anti-IL-23p19
   antibody) in lyophilized form and (b) a second container containing a pharmaceutically
   acceptable diluent (e.g., sterile water) for injection. The pharmaceutically acceptable
 5 diluent can be used for reconstitution or dilution of the lyophilized anti-IL-23p1 9 antibody
   or agent. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form
   prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of
   pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of
   manufacture, use or sale for human administration.
 O The amount of the IL-23p19 binding agent (e.g., anti-IL-23p19 antibody) that is effective
   in the treatment or prevention of an immunological disorder or cancer can be determined
   by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed
   to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the
   formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the stage of
?5 immunological disorder or cancer, and should be decided according to the judgment of
   the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated
   from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.
   Generally, the dosage of an anti-IL-23p19 antibody or IL-23p19 binding agent
   administered to a patient with an immunological disorder or IL-23p1 9-expressing cancer
30 is typically about 0.1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of the subject's body weight. The

                                             -122
   dosage administered to a subject is about 0.1 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg
   to about 30 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 15 mg/kg,
   or about 1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of the subject's body weight.
   Exemplary doses include, but are not limited to, from 1 ng/kg to 100 mg/kg. In some
 5 embodiments, a dose is about 0.5 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg, about 3 mg/kg,
   about 4 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 6 mg/kg, about 7 mg/kg, about 8 mg/kg, about 9
   mg/kg, about 10 mg/kg, about 11 mg/kg, about 12 mg/kg, about 13 mg/kg, about 14
   mg/kg, about 15 mg/kg or about 16 mg/kg. The dose can be administered, for example,
   daily, once per week (weekly), twice per week, thrice per week, four times per week, five
 0 times per week, six times per week, biweekly or monthly, every two months, or every
   three months. In specific embodiments, the dose is about 0.5 mg/kg/week, about 1
   mg/kg/week, about 2 mg/kg/week, about 3 mg/kg/week, about 4 mg/kg/week, about 5
   mg/kg/week, about 6 mg/kg/week, about 7 mg/kg/week, about 8 mg/kg/week, about 9
   mg/kg/week, about 10 mg/kg/week, about 11 mg/kg/week, about 12 mg/kg/week, about
 5 13 mg/kg/week, about 14 mg/kg/week, about 15 mg/kg/week or about 16 mg/kg/week.
   In some embodiments, the dose ranges from about 1 mg/kg/week to about 15
   mg/kg/week.
   In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions comprising the IL-23p19
   binding agent can further comprise a therapeutic agent, either conjugated or
 0 unconjugated to the binding agent. The anti-IL-23p19 antibody or IL-23p19 binding
   agent can be co-administered in combination with one or more therapeutic agents for
   the treatment or prevention of immunological disorders or cancers.
   Such combination therapy administration can have an additive or synergistic effect on
   disease parameters (e.g., severity of a symptom, the number of symptoms, or frequency
?5 of relapse).
   With respect to therapeutic regimens for combinatorial administration, in a specific
   embodiment, an anti-IL-23p19 antibody or IL-23p19 binding agent is administered
   concurrently with a therapeutic agent. In another specific embodiment, the therapeutic
   agent is administered prior or subsequent to administration of the anti-IL-23p19 antibody
30 or IL-23p19 binding agent, by at least an hour and up to several months, for example at

                                               -123
   least an hour, five hours, 12 hours, a day, a week, a month, or three months, prior or
   subsequent to administration of the anti-IL-23p1 9 antibody or IL-23p1 9 binding agent.

   Examples
   Example 1: Production of Humanized Anti-IL-23p19 Antibodies
   Mouse lead antibody 6B8 was converted to a chimeric antibody consisting of the mouse
 5 variable domain of 6B8 and a human constant IgG1 KO domain. Mouse antibody 6B8 is
   shown in Tables 1 and 2 herein above. The IgG1 KO (knock out) has two replacement
   mutations (Leu234Ala and Leu235Ala) that eliminate ADCC and CDC activity by
   reducing effector functions such as FcyR and complement binding. The variable
   domains of the mouse and chimeric antibodies are identical. Chimeric antibodies are
 0 generated to confirm the function of the antibody and to ensure the correct sequence
   has been obtained. The variable region of the antibody is then humanized through a
   design and screening process. A library was made where human and mouse residues
   were varied in such a way that in any given position there could be either a human or
   mouse residue. Such a library was made for those amino acids that were different
 5 between human germline and mouse antibody. Only the clones that retain the function
   of the parent mouse antibody were selected. Representative humanized variable
   regions for antibody 6B8 are shown in Tables 5 and 6.
   In this manner, Antibody A, Antibody B, Antibody C and Antibody D were humanized
   antibodies derived from      mouse antibody 6B8 (cloned into a human               IgG1-KO
 o (KO=knock-out)/kappa backbone. Antibodies A, B, C and D are shown in Table 7.
   Example 2: Binding of antibodies to recombinant IL-23 protein
   A) Kinetics and affinity of mouse anti-IL-23p19 antibodies binding to recombinant
   human IL-23 are shown below (Table 9). Kinetics and binding affinities were measured
?5 using the Fortebio Octet (Fortebio, Menlo Park, CA) using material generated from
   hybridoma following single column purification. Since the Octet is not a fluidics based
   technology, this method does not provide precise determination of off-rate. In some
   cases, only a estimate of affinity can be obtained.

   D) Molecular Selectivity over human IL-12
   The anti-IL-23p19 antibodies were also injected over a human IL-12 surface at a
   concentration of 100 nM. The binding signal for these antibodies measured using the
   Fortebio Octet is zero, which indicates that these antibodies selectively bind to human
 5 IL-23. The binding of the anti-IL-23p1 9 antibodies to IL-23 was also analyzed in the
   presence of 50% human serum and no significant effect of serum on binding on-rate
   was observed demonstrating high specificity.
   Example 3: Competition binding assay of human IL-23 binding to human IL-23R/Fc
 0 Human IL-23R-Fc was captured on the biosensor surface and 10 nM of human IL-23
   was injected. The sensorgram indicates the specific binding between IL-23 and the IL-23
   receptor (Figure 2, top trace). Antibodies were then co-injected with 10 nM human IL-23
   to assess whether antibody binding to the IL-23 could inhibit the interaction between IL
   23 and the IL-23 receptor. In this example, if the antibody binds to human IL-23 and is
 5 able to inhbit the interaction then reduced or no binding will be observed (Figure 2,
   bottom trace). In the example shown an equivalent molar concentration of Antibody A
   was co-injected with 10 nM recombinant human IL-23.
   Example 4: Functional Cell Assays, Inhibition of IL-17 production from IL-23
 0 stimulated mouse splenocytes
   One functional cell assay for anti-IL-23p1 9 antibodies measures their ability to inhibit IL
   23 stimulated IL-17 production from mononuclear cells isolated from mouse spleens.
   Human recombinant IL-23 protein is capable of stimulating IL-1 7 release from mouse
   splenocytes. In addition, a natural source of human IL-23 found in the supernatant of
?5 activated human monocytic THP-1 cells can be used to stimulate IL-1 7 production from
   mouse mononuclear cells.
   Human recombinant IL-23 or natural human IL-23 from activated THP-1 cells was
   preincubated with titrated anti-IL-23p19 antibodies. The IL-23/antibody combinations
   were then added to freshly isolated murine splenocytes. Recombinant IL-23 alone was
30 used as a positive control. After two days in culture, cell supernatants were collected
   and assayed for IL-17 by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Representative IC50

  antibodies derived from hybridomas (rows 1-19, see tables 1 and 2), chimeric antibodies
  (rows 20-23), and Antibodies A to D. Antibody 6H12 (disclosed in WO 2007/027714),
  antibody QF20 (disclosed in WO 2007/024846) and antibody C1273 (disclosed in WO

  Example 5: Functional specificity testing against IL-12 in a human activated T cell
  assay
5 Anti-IL-23p1 9 antibodies were tested for functional inhibition of IL-1 2 in a human
  activated T cell assay. Human recombinant IL-12 (1 ng/ml) was preincubated with 5
   tg/ml anti-IL-23p1 9 antibodies. The IL-1 2/antibody combinations were then added to
  human PHA-derived T cell blasts. Recombinant IL-1 2 alone was used as a positive
  control. An anti-IL-12p70 antibody (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria) was used as
0 a control inhibitory antibody. After two days in culture, cell supernatants were collected
  and assayed for IFN-y by ELISA (R&D Systems). Samples were tested in triplicate and
  the average pg/ml of IFN-y was determined. Results (with standard deviations) are
  shown in the table below.

5 The human cell line DB (ATCC, Manassas, VA) responds to IL-23 stimulation through
  an endogenous IL-23Rcomplex (IL-23R and IL-12RP1) and phosphorylates STAT3 in an
  IL-23 dose dependent manner. An assay was developed for testing anti-IL-23p19
  antibody inhibition of IL-23 induced STAT3 phosphorylation. DB cells were plated at
  1x1 0e6 cells/well in a 96 well plate. Antibodies to be tested were serially diluted and pre
0 incubated with recombinant human IL-23 (10 ng/ml) for 1 hour at room temperature.
  The antibody/IL-23 mixture was then added to the cells for 30 minutes at 370C. Cells
  were harvested by centrifugation at 4 C for 10 minutes and then lysed in ice cold buffer
  (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). A portion of the lysate was run in a phospho
  STAT3 ELISA (Invitrogen). Antibody IC50 values were calculated as percent inhibition of
5 STAT3 phosphorylation compared to control wells without antibody. Representative IC50
  values are shown in the table below.

  Example 7: In vivo model of IL-23 induced cytokine production in the mouse ear
  An in vivo model in the mouse was used. Recombinant human IL-23 is injected into the
5 skin of the mouse ear for 4 consecutive days resulting in epidermal thickening and up
  regulation of IL-17 and IL-22 protein. Anti-IL-23p19 antibodies were evaluated in this
  model. A single intraperitoneal injection of 1mg/kg or 5 mg/kg antibody was
  administered 1 hour prior to the initial IL-23 injection into the skin. Recombinant human
  IL-23 (with linker) was injected once daily for 3 additional days and tissue was collected
0 for cytokine assessment. Inhibition of cytokine production was demonstrated for the
  antibodies. The results of three experiments are shown in the table below (exp. 1: rows

   Example 10: Epitope mapping
   Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HXMS) was employed to map the
 0 epitope of Antibody A binding to human IL-23p1 9. This method determined the
   susceptibility of the amide backbone hydrogens of IL-23p19 to exchange with D20. The
   experiment was conducted with IL-23 alone and IL-23 with added Antibody A. Regions
   of the IL-23p1 9 sequence showing significant protection from exchange due to binding
   of Antibody A were thus identified. Resolution of the method is determined by the
 5 peptides produced by digestion with pepsin or Protease XVIII. These IL-23p19 derived
   peptides were identified by additional control experiments with unexchanged samples
   employing standard accurate mass and HPLC MS/MS technologies.
   Recombinant human IL-23 was used. For the protein + antibody sample, 50ul of IL-23
   (0.8mg/ml) was incubated with 1Oul of Antibody A (12.7mg/ml) for 15 minutes at room

 5        Methods:
                 A. Fragmentation (to ID peptides): 12 minute acquisition time (3 minute
                 start delay), full-scan FTMS at 30,000 resolution, seven ion trap data
                 dependant scans (CID).

 0                FTMS at 60,000 resolution.
   Pepsin and Protease XVIII peptides were identified using fragmentation data and the
   program Proteome Discoverer (Thermoscientific, Waltham, MA). Identified peptides
   were visually compared (protein alone vs. protein with antibody present) using Xcalibur
?5 software (Thermoscientific). No significant shifts in exchange were observed for IL-23
   alone vs. IL-23 with Antibody A outside of the IL-23p1 9 region. For the p19 portion of
   the protein, data was analyzed using the program PepMap (Thermoscientific). This
   program calculates the average mass for exchanged peptides. PepMap results were
   checked and those peptides that did not yield verified results were calculated with the
30 aid of Microsoft Excel.

                                              -138
  The regions of the IL-23 sequence showing significant protection from exchange due to
  binding of Antibody A were identified as amino acid residues 108 to 126 of SEQ ID
  NO:1 81 and amino acid residues 137 to 151 of SEQ ID NO:1 81.
