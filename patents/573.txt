                                      Field of the Invention
    The present invention relates to a device or article for stabilizing outdoor furniture
  5 when placed on an uneven surface.
                                   Background of the Invention
    Outdoor furniture including picnic tables and the like will rock or wobble when placed
    on an uneven surface. As a result, any food items or drinks placed on the table, for
    example, may spill and cause damage and wastage.
 .0 It is not uncommon for people to use pieces of wood or brick and the like to stabilize
    the table. Other means include use of more elaborate mechanical devices which are
    screwed or threaded to the base or bottom of a leg of a table in order to level or
    stabilize the table.
    However, these devices require tools to fit the device to the piece of furniture.
15  The object of the present invention is to provide a simple device for stabilizing a
    piece of furniture when placed on an uneven surface.
                                    Summary of the Invention
    The present invention provides a device for stabilizing or levelling furniture
    comprising:
20       (i) a hollow cylindrical member (1) adapted to receive the bottom end (2) of a leg
                of a table;
                                                  1

        (ii) a plurality of slots (3) in the hollow member at opposite positions;
        (iii) a horizontal member or snapper pin (4) fixed through the slots to secure the
                 bottom end of the leg; and
        (iv)a means to lock the device into place or locking member (5) to ensure that the
  5              table is balanced when placed on an uneven surface.
    Preferably, a substantially U-shaped member is attached to the snapper pin as a
    means to secure the pin.
 .0 Preferably, the slots are about 10-20 mm apart.
    Preferably, the locking member is selected from a T-nut and Thumb screw, and a T
    nut and Finger screw.
 .s In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of stabilizing or levelling
    furniture using the device according to the present invention.
                                  Brief Description of the drawings
    Figure 1 shows the components of the device as an embodiment of the present
20  invention.
    Figure 2 shows the device as an embodiment of the present invention.
                                Detailed Description of the invention
    The present invention relates to an assembly, device or article for balancing
    furniture, for example, a picnic table, when placed on an uneven surface.
                                                    2

    Figure 1 shows the components of the device as an embodiment of the present
    invention.
    The components of the device comprise a hollow cylindrical member (1) adapted to
    receive the bottom end (2) of a leg of a table; a plurality of slots (3) in the hollow
  5 member at opposite positions; a horizontal member or snapper pin (4) fixed through
    the slots to secure the bottom end of the leg; and a means to lock the device into
    place (5) to ensure that the table is balanced when placed on an uneven surface.
    In use, the device (Stable Mate VII) is placed on an uneven surface near the base or
    bottom of the leg of the table. The bottom of the leg (2) is placed into the hollow
 .0 cylinder (1) and the appropriate height is selected to ensure an even or near level
    surface. The snapper pin (4) is placed through the slots horizontally (3) at the
    required height to provide the balance for the table. The table is further secured by
    tightening of the T nut and finger screw member (5) or locking member which is
    secured into a slot (3) above the snapper pin (4).
 .5 Preferably, a substantially U-shaped member is attached to the snapper pin (4) as a
    means to secure the pin. The U-shaped member is attached to each end of the pin
    (4) and is pressed locked to secure the pin (4).
    Preferably, the slots (3) are about 10-20 mm apart. The slots (3) are about 10-20 mm
20  apart to enable selection of appropriate height to stabilize the table.
    Preferably, the locking member (5) is selected from a T-nut and Thumb screw, and a
    T-nut and Finger screw. The locking member (5) is preferably positioned above the
    pin (4). Tightening of the screw additionally assists in securing the position of the
25  device.
    In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of stabilizing or levelling
    furniture using the device according to the present invention.
                                                3

    Figure 2 shows the device as an embodiment of the present invention providing a
    choice of metal (mild steel) of plastic (PVC) fittings.
    Thus, the present invention aids a particular type of table that when set up on
    uneven ground, the device according to the invention helps to bring the table to a
  5 level or near level balance. It can also assist to level chairs, camping cooking
    equipment and the like to a level or near level balance.
    This invention can be used when camping, on picnics or even around the house. It is
    useful for any equipment or piece of furniture such as a table which is out of level.
    The device according to the present invention may be used instead of trying to find a
 .0 brick, stick or something to stick under a leg of a table to level it out.
    While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the specific features of the
    preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that many additional features can be
    added and that many changes can be made in the preferred embodiment without
    departing from the principles of the disclosure. These and other changes in the
 .5 preferred embodiment of the disclosure will be apparent to those skilled in the art
    from the disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing
    descriptive matter is to be interpreted merely as illustrative of the disclosure and not
    as a limitation.
