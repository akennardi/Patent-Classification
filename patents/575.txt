MODIFIED GLENOID COMPONENTS AND METHODS OF INSTALLING SAME
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED U.S. PATENT APPLICATION
[0001]          This application claims PRIORITY under 35 U.S.C. § 119 to U.S. Patent
Application No. 61/665633, entitled "MODIFIED GLENOID COMPONENTS AND
METHODS OF INSTALLING SAME," which was filed on June 28, 2012. The disclosure
of such application is incorporated herein by reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]          The present disclosure relates generally to a glenoid component, and more
particularly, to a glenoid component that resists rotation and pullout and a method of
implanting the glenoid component.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]          During the lifetime of a patient, it may be necessary to perform a total
shoulder replacement procedure on the patient as a result of, for example, disease or
trauma. In a total shoulder replacement procedure, a humeral component having a head is
utilized to replace the natural head of the arm bone or humerus. The humeral component
typically has an elongated intramedullary stem that is utilized to secure the humeral
component to the patient's humerus. In such a total shoulder replacement procedure, the
natural glenoid surface of the scapula is resurfaced or otherwise replaced with a glenoid
component which provides a bearing surface for the head of the humeral component.
[0004]          Glenoid components generally include a body that defines a bearing surface
for receiving the head of the humeral component and a number of attachment pegs
integrally formed with the body. The attachment pegs are inserted and thereafter secured
into a corresponding number of holes that are drilled in the glenoid surface of the scapula
by use of bone cement. The pegs prevent rotation of the glenoid component.

                                                2
SUMMARY
[0005]          According to an illustrative embodiment, a glenoid component for
securement to a glenoid surface of a scapula so as to provide a bearing surface for a head
portion of a humerus comprises a body portion and an anchor peg. The body portion
includes a first surface adapted to contact the glenoid surface of a scapula and a second
surface configured to receive the head portion of the humerus. The anchor peg is for
penetrating the glenoid surface of the scapula so as to secure the body portion to the
glenoid surface of the scapula. The anchor peg includes a cylindrical shaft extending from
the first surface of the body portion and a fin secured to and extending outwardly from the
cylindrical shaft, the fin being generally square-shaped.
[0006]          The glenoid component includes a plurality of generally square-shaped fins
secured to and extending outwardly from the cylindrical shaft of the anchor peg.
[0007]          The fins are generally square-shaped and have rounded corners.
[0008]          The anchor peg is adapted for insertion into a hole within a glenoid surface
of a scapula and the fins have a width that is greater than a width or diameter of a hole in
which the anchor peg is inserted. The fins are configured to prevent rotation of the glenoid
component within the glenoid surface.
[0009]           Side edges of the fins are configured to have an interference with a wall
forming a hole in which the anchor peg is inserted of between about 0.25 millimeters and
about 2 millimeters.
[0010]          Rounded comers of the fins are configured to have an interference with the
wall forming the hole in which the anchor peg is inserted of between about 0.5 millimeters
and about 3 millimeters. The interference between the side walls and the rounded corners
with the wall forming the hole prevent rotation of the glenoid component.
[0011]          The anchor peg is configured for insertion into a generally square-shaped
hole in the glenoid surface of the scapula.

                                                3
[0012]          According to a further illustrative embodiment, a glenoid component for
securement to a glenoid surface of a scapula so as to provide a bearing surface for a head
portion of a humerus comprises a body portion, an anchor peg, and at least one gusset. The
body portion includes a first surface adapted to contact the glenoid surface of a scapula and
a second surface configured to receive the head portion of the humerus. The anchor peg is
for penetrating the glenoid surface of the scapula so as to secure the body portion to the
glenoid surface of the scapula. The anchor peg includes a cylindrical shaft extending from
the first surface of the body portion and a fin secured to and extending outwardly from the
cylindrical shaft. The at least one gusset is secured to and extending downwardly from the
first surface of the body portion and secured to and extending outwardly from the
cylindrical shaft of the anchor peg.
[0013]          An angled edge is formed by the gusset and extends between the first
surface of the body portion and the anchor peg.
[0014]          The angled edge of the gusset is configured to be driven into the glenoid
surface of the scapula to prevent rotation of the glenoid component.
[0015]          The glenoid component includes a plurality of gussets secured to and
extending downwardly from the first surface of the body portion and secured to and
extending outwardly from the cylindrical shaft of the anchor peg.
[0016]          The gussets are orthogonal to the first surface of the body portion and the
cylindrical shaft of the anchor peg.
[0017]          Four gussets are spaced about a longitudinal axis of the anchor peg with
about ninety degrees between adjacent gussets.
[0018]          The gussets are configured to be driven into the glenoid surface of the
scapula to prevent rotation of the glenoid component.
[0019]          According to another illustrative embodiment, a glenoid component for
securement to a glenoid surface of a scapula so as to provide a bearing surface for a head
portion of a humerus comprises a body portion and an anchor peg. The body portion

                                                4
includes a first surface adapted to contact the glenoid surface of a scapula and a second
surface configured to receive the head portion of the humerus. The anchor peg is for
penetrating the glenoid surface of the scapula so as to secure the body portion to the
glenoid surface of the scapula. The anchor peg includes a cylindrical shaft extending from
the first surface of the body portion and a fin secured to and extending outwardly from the
cylindrical shaft. The fin includes at least one cutout configured to allow the fin to deflect
outwardly along a hole in which the glenoid component is secured, thereby preventing
rotation of the glenoid component.
[0020]          The fin includes first and second opposing cutouts, wherein each of the
cutouts includes a first leg and a second leg forming generally triangular cutouts.
[0021]          The cutouts are symmetrical about an axis that bisects the fins.
[0022]          The body portion of the glenoid component is generally circular.
[0023]          Other aspects and advantages of the present disclosure will become apparent
upon consideration of the following drawings and detailed description, wherein similar
structures have similar reference numbers.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0040]          While the concepts of the present disclosure are susceptible to various
modifications and alternative forms, specific exemplary embodiments thereof have been
shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should
be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the concepts of the present
disclosure to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all
modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the
invention as defined by the appended claims.
[0041]          Terms representing anatomical references, such as anterior, posterior,
medial, lateral, superior, inferior, etcetera, may be used throughout this disclosure in
reference to both the orthopaedic implants described herein and a patient's natural
anatomy. Such terms have well-understood meanings in both the study of anatomy and the
field of orthopaedics. Use of such anatomical reference terms in the specification and
claims is intended to be consistent with their well-understood meanings unless noted
otherwise.
[0042]          Referring now to the figures, a first embodiment of a polymer glenoid
component 20 is depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2. The glenoid component 20 includes a body 22
having a generally convex surface 24 and a generally concave surface 26 opposite the
convex surface 24. The convex surface 24 generally abuts or otherwise contacts at least a
portion of the glenoid surface of the scapula. The body 22 of the glenoid component 20
generally has a shaped that is generally circular, such that the concave surface 26 generally
forms a spherical surface. In this manner, the concave surface 26 of the body 22 provides
a smooth bearing surface upon which the head 28 articulates and which generally matches
the shape of the spherical head 28.
[0043]          The glenoid component 20 also includes an anchor peg 40 secured to and
extending generally orthogonal to the convex surface 24 of the body 22. As shown in

                                                7
FIGS. 1 and 2, the anchor peg 40 includes a cylindrical shaft 42 and a tapered head 46 at
an end of the cylindrical shaft 42 that functions as a lead-in to facilitate insertion into a
hole 48 drilled or otherwise formed in a glenoid surface 50 (as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9) of
a patient's scapula 52. The anchor peg 40 may include a first cylindrical shaft segment
extending from the convex surface 24 and having a first diameter and a second cylindrical
shaft segment extending from the first cylindrical shaft segment and having a second
diameter less than the first diameter, as seen in FIGS. 1 and 2. Alternatively, the anchor
peg 40 may have a single diameter throughout a length of the cylindrical shaft 42.
[0044]          The anchor peg 40 further includes a plurality of flexible radial fins 60
extending outwardly from an end 62 of the anchor peg 40. The fins 60 function to secure
the glenoid component 20 within the glenoid surface 50. In addition, the flexible and
deformable nature of the radial fins 60 extending from the anchor peg 40 allow the fins 60
to deform upon insertion of the anchor peg 40 into the hole 48, thereby creating resistance
to extraction of the anchor peg 40 from the hole 48 once fully inserted therein.
[0045]          The fins 60 of glenoid component 20, as best seen in FIGS. 1 and 2, are
generally square-shaped with rounded corners 62. The fins 60 have a size and shape that
creates an interference with walls forming the hole 48 that prevents easy removal of the
glenoid component 20 from the glenoid surface 50 and prevents rotation of the glenoid
component 20 without the use of a stabilizing peg, as will be discussed in greater detail
hereinafter.
[0046]          A second embodiment of a glenoid component 80 is depicted in FIGS. 3 and
4. The glenoid component 80 is similar to the glenoid component 20 of FIGS. 1 and 2 in
that it includes a body 82 with opposing generally convex and generally concave surfaces
84, 86. The glenoid component 20 also includes an anchor peg 90 with a cylindrical shaft
91 and a tapered end 92. One manner in which the glenoid component 80 is different from
the glenoid component 20 of the first embodiment is that it includes a plurality of generally
circular fins 96 extending outwardly from an end 98 of the anchor peg 90.
[0047]          Referring again to FIGS. 3 and 4, the glenoid component 80 further includes
a plurality of gussets 100 extending downwardly from the convex surface 84 and

                                               8
outwardly from the anchor peg 90 adjacent the convex surface 84 of the body 82. The
gussets 100 are also generally orthogonal to the convex surface 84 and the anchor peg 90
and extend outwardly from the peg 90 a distance greater than the fins 96 extend from the
peg 90. An outer angled edge 102 of each gusset 100 extends between and is integrally
attached to the convex surface 84 and the anchor peg 90. The gussets are spaced about a
longitudinal axis 104 of the anchor peg 90 with about ninety degrees between adjacent
gussets 100.
[0048]          When the glenoid component 80 is installed within the glenoid surface 50,
the gussets 100 are pressed into the glenoid surface 50 surrounding the anchor peg 90 and
below the convex surface 84 of the body 82, thereby preventing rotation of the glenoid
component 80 without the use of a stabilizing peg. Installation and functionality of the
glenoid component will be discuss in greater detail below with respect to FIG. 13.
[0049]          While four gussets 100 are depicted with respect to the embodiment of the
glenoid component 80 of FIGS. 3 and 4, one or more gussets 100 may be utilized. In one
embodiment, a single gusset 100 may be utilized. In another embodiment, eight gussets
100 may be utilized. The number of gussets 100 utilized may be determined based on the
ability of those gussets 100 to prevent rotation of the glenoid component 80, the cost of
additional gussets 100, and/or other factors.
[0050]          A third embodiment of a glenoid component 120 is shown in FIG. 5. The
glenoid component 120 is similar to the glenoid component 80 of FIGS. 3 and 4 and, thus,
similar features will be numbered similarly. The main difference is that the glenoid
component 120 does not include gussets, but rather, includes a stabilizing peg 122
extending outwardly from the convex surface 84. The stabilizing peg 122 is spaced
between the anchor peg 90 and an outer edge 124 of the body 82. While one stabilizing
peg 122 is shown, other stabilizing pegs 122 may be spaced about the convex surface 84.
[0051]          The stabilizing peg 122 prevents the body 82 of the glenoid component 120
from moving a plane perpendicular to the anchor peg 90 and prevent rotational movement
of the glenoid component 120. Generally, the stabilizing peg 122 is shorter than the
anchor peg 90. Moreover, if multiple stabilizing pegs 122 are utilized, one or more of the

                                               9
stabilizing pegs 122 may be shorter than the others, although other configurations may be
used.
[0052]          While the body 82, the anchor peg 90, and the stabilizing peg 122 of the
glenoid component 120 are shown as being integral, one or more of the anchor peg 90 or
stabilizing peg 122 may be separately secured to the body 82. As one skilled in the art
would understand, any number of anchor pegs 90 or stabilizing pegs 122 may be utilized,
the anchor peg 90 may include any features that aid in inserting the anchor peg 90 into a
hole or retaining the anchor peg 90 within a hole, and/or the placement of the anchor
peg(s) 90 and/or stabilizing peg(s) 122 may be modified without departing from the scope
of the present disclosure.
[0053]          In the embodiment of FIG. 5, one or more secondary holes (not shown)
would be formed within the glenoid surface 50 and spaced between the hole 48 and an
outer edge of the glenoid surface 50. The secondary holes may have a size and shape that
conforms to the stabilizing peg(s) 122.
[0054]          A fourth embodiment of a glenoid component 150 is depicted in FIG. 6.
The glenoid component 150 is similar to the glenoid component 80 of FIGS. 3 and 4. In
particular, the glenoid component 150 includes a similar body 82 with convex and concave
surfaces 84, 86 and an anchor peg 90 having a cylindrical shaft 91 and a tapered end 92
and extending outwardly and transversely to the convex surface 84. The glenoid
component 150 further includes a plurality of fins 152 extending outwardly from an end of
the anchor peg 90. Upon insert of the anchor peg 90 into the hole 48, portions of the fins
152 deflect outwardly (toward an opening of the hole 48), thereby preventing rotation of
the glenoid component 150 without the use of a stabilizing peg.
[0055]          Each of the fins 152 is generally disc-shaped and includes two opposing
cutouts 154. The cutouts 154 are generally triangular in shape and are generally
symmetrical about an axis 155 that bisects the fins 152. Optionally, the cutouts 154 may
be asymmetrical. Each cutout 154 includes first and second legs 156, 158 that extend at an
angle A with respect to one another. The first leg 156 of each cutout 154 extends at an
angle B with respect to a line 160 tangent to an outer end of the first leg 156 and the

                                               10
second leg 158 of each cutout 154 extends at an angle C with respect to a line 162 tangent
to an outer end of the second leg 158. Optionally, the cutouts 154 may be formed of
another shape, for example, square-shaped or U-shaped. The cutouts 154 allow bone to
grow between the fins 152 in two planes. While two cutouts 154 are depicted, any number
of cutouts 154 is possible.
[0056]          The glenoid components shown and described herein may be made of a
polymeric material, for example, a polyethylene. One example of a suitable polyethylene
is ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). In addition to polymers, the
glenoid components may be made from ceramic, metal, or a composite material. Examples
of these materials include alumina, zirconia, and alumina/zirconia composite or composite
material.
[0057]          A method of securing the glenoid component 20 of FIGS. 1 and 2 to the
glenoid surface 50 of the scapula 52 will now be discussed in detail with reference to
FIGS. 8-11. A drill is used to bore the hole 48 through the glenoid surface 50 and into the
scapula 52 in a manner known in the art and, thereafter, the anchor peg 40 of the glenoid
component 20 is press fit or otherwise interference fit into the hole 48. During installation,
the rounded corners 62 and/or side edges 170 between the rounded corners 62 of the
square-shaped fins 96 deflect outwardly (or toward an opening of the hole 48), thereby
creating an interference with a wall forming the hole that prevents rotational movement of
the glenoid component 150 and prevents the glenoid component 20 from moving in a plane
perpendicular to the anchor peg 40. While the hole 48 is depicted herein as having a
circular cross-section, the hole may optionally have different cross-sections for any of the
embodiments disclosed herein, for example, a square-shaped cross section.
[0058]          As can be seen in FIG. 11, which depicts a range of interference between
the fins 60 and a wall forming the hole 48, the square shape of the fins 60 provides a
greater interference at the corners 62 of the fins 60 than at the side edges 170 of the fins 96.
In one embodiment, an interference between the side edges 170 of the fins 60 and the wall
of the hole 48 is between about 0.25 millimeters (mm) and about 2 mm and an interference
between the comers 62 of the fins 60 and the wall of the hole 48 is between about 0.5 mm

                                               11
and about 3 mm. In another embodiment, a width of the square fins 60 is greater than a
diameter of the hole 48.
[0059]          The deflection of the fins 60 upon insertion of the glenoid component 20
into the hole 48 is depicted in FIG. 10. In particular, the corners 62 of the fins 60 are
deflected outwardly a greater distance than the side edges 170 of the fins 60 are deflected
due to the difference in overall interference.
[0060]          If the hole in which the glenoid component 20 is installed has a square
shaped cross-section, a hole 172 maybe be created utilizing a tool having a bit 174 with a
general profile of a Reuleux triangle 176, as seen in FIGS. 14 and 15. In particular, a
Reuleux triangle 176 is created by starting with an equilateral triangle 178 with sides of
length S. With a radius equal to S and a center at a vertice of the triangle 178, three arcs
180 are drawn to form the Reuleux triangle 176. The bit 174, as noted above, has an outer
profile that forms the Reuleux triangle 176, such that, when the bit is rotated about a circle
182 starting at a center 184 of the equilateral triangle 178, a square-shaped hole 172 with
rounded corners is formed. The glenoid component 20 is secured in the same manner
when the hole 172 with a square-shaped cross-section is used. A length of a side of the
square forming the fins 96 may be greater than a length of a side of the square forming the
hole 172, thereby forming an interference fit. Upon insertion of the gleonid component 20,
the rounded corners 62 and the side edges 170 of the fins 96 deflect outwardly (toward an
opening of the hole 172). The square shapes would prevent rotation of the glenoid
component 20.
[0061]          Methods of securing the glenoid component 80 of FIGS. 3 and 4 to the
glenoid surface 50 of the scapula 52 will now be discussed in detail with reference to
FIGS. 12 and 13. A hole 48 is bored into the glenoid surface 50 of the scapula 52 in any
manner known in the art. Thereafter, a tool 200 as shown in FIG. 13, may be used to
create slots within the glenoid surface 50 surrounding the hole 48. The tool 200 generally
includes a handle 202, a rod 204 extending from an end 206 of the handle 202, and a punch
208 attached to an end 210 of the rod 204. The punch 208 includes a plate, for example, a
disc 212 having a cylinder 214 extending from a surface 216 of the disc 212 opposite the
rod 204. The cylinder 214 is shaped and sized to have a diameter that interferes with the

                                               12
hole 48. In particular, the cylinder 214 has a diameter that is larger than a diameter than
the hole 48 and smaller than a diameter of the fins of a glenoid component that fits within
the hole 48. Triangular gussets 218 extend outwardly from the cylinder 214. The gussets
218 are similar in size, shape, and number to the gussets 100 of the glenoid component 80.
In particular, the gussets 218 are generally orthogonal to the disc 212 and extend outwardly
and are generally orthogonal to the cylinder 214. Each gusset 218 is also disposed about
90 degrees around the cylinder 214 from an adjacent gusset 218. Should more or less
gussets 100 be formed within a glenoid component, the tool 200 may be modified
accordingly.
[0062]           The tool 200 is grasped by the handle 202, the cylinder 214 of the tool 200
is inserted into the hole 48, and pressure is exerted on the tool 200 toward the glenoid
surface 50, thereby creating slots in the glenoid surface 50 corresponding to the gussets
218. The anchor peg 90 of the glenoid component 80 may thereafter be inserted into the
hole 48, in the manner described with respect to the first embodiment, until the gussets 218
are disposed within the slots created by the tool 200.
[0063]           The glenoid component 80 may be secured to the glenoid surface 50 without
the use of the tool 200. In such an embodiment, the anchor peg 90 of the glenoid
component 80 would be inserted into the hole 48 and the gussets 100 would be driven into
the glenoid surface 50, thereby creating the slots in which the gussets 100 are disposed.
[0064]           The glenoid component 120 of FIG. 5 is secured to the glenoid surface 50 in
a manner similar to that of the glenoid component 20 except that a secondary hole is
created and, during installation of the glenoid component 120, the stabilizing peg 122 is
aligned with and inserted into the secondary hole.
[0065]           The anchor peg 90 of the glenoid component 150 of FIG. 6 is also secured
to the glenoid surface 50 in a manner similar to that of the glenoid component 20. During
installation, the cutouts 154 in the fins 152 of the glenoid component 150 allow the fins
152 to deflect outwardly (or toward an opening of the hole 48), thereby creating an
interference with a wall forming the hole that prevents rotational movement of the glenoid

                                               13
component 150 and movement of the glenoid component 150 in a plane perpendicular to
the glenoid component 150.
[0066]          The configurations of the fins and/or gussets as shown and described herein
eliminate the need for the use of bone cement to secure the anchor peg to the glenoid
surface 50 of the scapula 52, thereby reducing the complexity of a typical shoulder
replacement procedure.
[0067]          While the glenoid components shown in the figures and described in detail
include have a generally circular configuration, as described above, the principles of the
present disclosure may be implemented within a glenoid component having any
configuration, for example, oval-shaped. One advantage provided by the glenoid
components having a circular configuration is that the glenoid component does not have to
be aligned in a specific position or orientation.
[0068]          As will become apparent from reading the present specification, any of the
features of any of the embodiments disclosed herein may be incorporated within any of the
other embodiments without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.
[0069]          While the disclosure has been illustrated and described in detail in the
drawings and foregoing description, such an illustration and description is to be considered
as exemplary and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only illustrative
embodiments have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that
come within the spirit of the disclosure are desired to be protected.
[0070]          There are a plurality of advantages of the present disclosure arising from the
various features of the apparatus, system, and method described herein. It will be noted
that alternative embodiments of the apparatus, system, and method of the present
disclosure may not include all of the features described yet still benefit from at least some
of the advantages of such features. Those of ordinary skill in the art may readily devise
their own implementations of the apparatus, system, and method that incorporate one or
more of the features of the present invention and fall within the spirit and scope of the
present disclosure.

[0071]          Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the
context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and
"comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group
of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or
steps.
[0072]          The reference to any prior art in this specification is not and should not be
taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of the
common general knowledge in Australia.
