PRIORITY
[0001] This application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application
No. 2013209931, which is a national phase application of PCT Application No.
PCT/US2013/021674, filed 16 January 2013, which claims priority from U.S. Serial
Number 13/355,037 filed on January 20, 2012, entitled "PISTON FOR A
NEEDLELESS VALVE SYSTEM." The contents of each of these applications are
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Needleless devices or connectors are utilized as an alternative to hypodermic
needles. Needleless connectors are utilized as fluid ports for a catheter attached to a
patient. As a result of not using needles, needleless connectors reduce the risk of
acquiring bloodborne diseases.
[0003] However, needleless connectors may contain surfaces and features that are
difficult to clean. For example, some needleless connectors include a "split septum"
(e.g., slit, cut, pathway, etc.) on a top surface of a piston or valve plug. Typically, the
split septum is unable to be properly swabbed after use. Accordingly, pathogens may
be present in the unsanitized areas which may lead to patient infection.

  DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
  [00091   Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present
 technology, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
 While the technology will be described in conjunction with various
 embodiment(s), it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the
 present technology to these embodiments. On the contrary, the present
 technology is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents,
 which may be included within the spirit and scope of the various embodiments
 as defined by the appended claims.
 [0010]    Furthermore, in the following description of embodiments, numerous
 specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of
the present technology. However, the present technology may be practiced
without these specific details. In other instances, well known methods,
 procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail as not
to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present embodiments.
 [00111    Figure 1 depicts an embodiment of piston 100 which is configured to
be disposed in a needleless valve system. The structure and function of the
needleless valve system will be described in detail further below.
[00121     Piston 100 includes head portion 110 and base portion 150. In
various embodiments, base portion 150 can be any physical structure that
facilitates in head portion 110 controlling the flow of fluid through the
                                           3

 needleless valve system. As such, base portion 150 is generically depicted
 as a simple square with dotted lines. Accordingly, the focus of the description
 herein will focus primarily on the structure and functionality of head portion
 110 with respect to a needleless valve system.
[00131    Head portion 110 includes continuous top surface 120, opening 130
and compression features 140 and 141.
[0014]    Continuous top surface 120 is configured to seal a port of a housing,
which will be described in detail below. Continuous top surface 120 does not
include (or does not require) any broken portions. For example, continuous
top surface 120 is a continuous feature that does not include a slit, cut, hole,
etc.
[0015]    Continuous top surface 120 is a smooth surface. Accordingly, when
continuous top surface 120 is swabbed, pathogens are readily removed and
continuous top surface 120 is properly sanitized.
[0016]    Continuous top surface 120 is non-planar in the relaxed state of head
portion 110. This is based, in part, on opening 130 being in a relaxed open
position, as depicted in Figure 1. A relaxed state is understood as the natural
physical position of head portion 110 without any forces applied to head
portion 110.
                                         4

 [0017]    In one example, continuous top surface 120 includes non-planar
 configuration of a trough 122 in the relaxed state. It should be understood
 that the non-planar configuration can be any non-planar configuration that is
 conducive to allowing fluid flow around continuous top surface 120. Examples
 of non-planar configurations can be, but are not limited to, a concave surface,
 a valley, cavity, etc.
 100181    In one embodiment, head portion 110 is cylindrical. Thus,
continuous top surface 120 is circular.
 10019]    Opening 130 is disposed proximate continuous top surface 120.
Opening 130 is in an open position when head portion 110 is in a relaxed
state, as described above.
[0020]     Opening 130 can be compressed to a closed position. For example,
when head portion 110 is laterally compressed, then opening 130 is also
laterally compressed to a closed position. In other words, the outer surface or
walls of head portion is compressed inwards until opening 130 is closed. As a
result, continuous top surface 120 is deformed into a planar surface.
[0021]     Opening 130 can be any physical feature (e.g., hollow, void, channel,
etc.) disposed in any orientation within head portion 110 and is able to
resiliently open and close. Moreover, opening can be any shape that
facilitates in allowing head portion 110 to deform such that continuous top
                                         5

 surface 120 is deformed into a planar surface. For example, shapes of
 opening 130 can be, but is not limited to elliptical, oval, diamond, circle, etc.
 [0022]    Opening 130 is enclosed within head portion 110. For example, the
 periphery (or side surfaces) of opening 130 is fully enclosed within head
 portion 110.
 [0023]    In one embodiment, opening 130 is disposed along a diameter of
 head portion 110. In another embodiment, opening 130 is centrally disposed
along a center axis of head portion 110. In various embodiments, opening
 130 is disposed in any location that enables the deformation of continuous top
surface 120.
[0024]     Compression features 140 and 141 are disposed on the periphery of
head portion 110. Compression features 140 and 141 are configured to
facilitate in engaging with a housing such that opening 130 is compressed in a
closed position.
[0025]     In one embodiment, compression features 140 and 141 are bulges.
It should be understood that compression features can be any physical
features that facilitates in the engaging of a housing such that opening 130 is
compressed in a close position.
[0026]     Figure 2 depicts an embodiment of spacer 232 disposed in opening
130. Spacer 232 is configured to facilitate in the resilient opening of opening
                                         6

 130 from a closed position to an open position. Spacer 232 is depicted in a
 relaxed or natural position. However, spacer 232 can be fully compressed
 when opening 130 is in the closed position. It should be understood that
 spacer 232 can be any resiliently compressible material. Moreover, spacer
 232 can be any shape disposed in any orientation within opening 130 to
facilitate in the resilient opening of opening 130 from a closed position to an
open position.
 [0027]    Figures 3 and 4 depict embodiments of needleless valve system 300.
In general, needleless valve system 300 is configured to be coupled with
medical devices (e.g., a catheter) and convey fluid without the use of a
needle.
[00281     Needleless valve system 300 includes piston 100 disposed in
housing 310. Housing 310 includes port 315, inner wall 320, and base 360.
[00291     Needleless valve system 300 is initially sealed, as depicted in Figure
3. In particular, piston 100 is seated in housing 310 such that port 315 is
fluidly sealed by head portion 110. Additionally, the outer diameter of head
portion 110 is compressed and seated within inner wall 320 to create a seal.
[0030]    Opening 130 is compressed in a close position which results in
continuous top surface 120 to be deformed into a planar surface. As a result,
port 315 is sealed by continuous top surface 120 because the periphery of
continuous top surface 120 mates with port 315.
                                          7

 [00311     In one embodiment, needleless valve system 300 is fluidly connected
 to a catheter. For example, female luer fitting 361 of base 360 is connected to
 a catheter. Accordingly, fluid flow is able to flow to/from the catheter.
 [0032]     Figure 4 depicts needleless valve system 300 in an open position
 due to tip 410 of a needleless syringe being inserted into needleless valve
 system 300. Tip 410 displaces head portion 110 downward along inner wall
 320. In one embodiment, housing 310 includes a male luer fitting 312 that
 corresponds to a female luer fitting of the syringe.
 [0033]     The diameter of inner wall 320 increases in the downward direction.
Accordingly, the diameter of head portion 110 also increases when moving in
the downward direction. Thus, opening 130 subsequently expands into its
natural open position.
 [0034]    Moreover, continuous top surface 120 is deformed from planar to
non-planar to create trough 122. Therefore, fluid is able to flow around
continuous top surface 120 via trough 122 to volume 330. The fluid then
flows from volume 330 through base 360 to a medical device, such as a
catheter.
[0035]     In one embodiment, fluid is able to flow in the opposite direction. For
example, blood flows from a patient into volume 330 around continuous top
surface 120 via trough 122 and into the syringe.
                                          8

  [0036]    In various embodiments, it should be appreciated that needleless
 valve system 300 can allow positive and/or negative fluid displacement.
 [0037]    Piston 100 is an elastic body. As such, piston 100 is able to deform
 back to its original position such that head portion 110 is pushed up through
 inner wall 320. Accordingly, head portion is compressed against inner wall
 320 and port 315 is subsequently sealed.
 [0038]    In particular, base portion 350 acts as a spring to facilitate in opening
 130 deforming to a closed position and head portion 110 resealing port 315.
 For example, base portion 350 includes a tail that resiliently deforms to its
original position in response to tip 410 being removed from housing 310. The
spring force of base portion 350 causes head portion 110 to move upward
within inner wall 320 and head portion 110 is compressed within inner wall
320. As a result, opening 310 is deformed into a closed position and
continuous top surface 120 is deformed into a planar surface. Moreover, the
spring force of the diaphragm 355 also causes head portion 110 to move in
and be compressed within inner wall 320.
[0039]   Additionally, compression features 140 and 141 (e.g., bulges)
enhance the compression of head portion 110 within housing 310.
Compression features 140 and 141 increase the diameter of head portion 110
and thus, increase the forces applied on head portion 110 to close opening
130.
                                          9

  [0040]   It should be appreciated that base portion 350 can include any elastic
 feature for generating a spring force to translate head portion 110 within inner
 wall 320 such that port 315 is resealed.
 [00411    In various embodiments, a base portion (e.g., base portion 150 or
 base portion 350) can include any combination of a tale and/or a diaphragm.
 In one embodiment, a base portion does not include a tale and/or a
 diaphragm.
 [0042]   Oftentimes pathogens may be present on or around continuous top
 surface 120 after tip 410 of the syringe is removed from needleless valve
system 300. However, the pathogens are easily swabbed away from the
smooth continuous top surface. Therefore, the risk of patient infection is
reduced.
 [0043]   Figure 5 depicts an embodiment of a method 500 for controlling fluid
flow. In some embodiments, method 500 is performed at least by needleless
valve system 300, as depicted in Figures 3 and 4.
[00441    At 510 of method 500, a port of a housing is sealed with a continuous
top surface. The continuous top surface is planar when the port is sealed, and
a channel disposed proximate continuous top surface is compressed in a
closed position. For example, port 315 is fluidly sealed with continuous top
surface 120 when continuous top surface 120 is planar. Moreover, opening
                                        10

  130 (e.g. a channel) is disposed proximate continuous top surface 120 and is
  collapsed or compressed.
  [0045]   At 520, the continuous top surface is depressed by a needleless
 device. For example, continuous top surface 120 is depressed down through
 housing 310 by tip 410 of a needleless syringe.
 [00461    At 530, the channel is opened such that the continuous top surface is
 non-planar. For example, when head portion 110 slides down through
 housing 310, opening 130 expands to a natural open position.
 [0047]    At 540, in response to the opening the channel, fluid is allowed to
 flow around the non-planar continuous top surface. For example, opening
 130 expands to a natural open position which causes continuous top surface
 120 to bend or fold to create trough 122. As a result, fluid is allowed to flow
around non-planar continuous top surface 120 through housing 310.
 [0048]   At 550, fluid is injected through the port via the needleless device.
For example, medicine is injected through port 315 via a fluid channel of tip
410 of a needleless syringe.
[0049]    At 560, the port is resealed with the continuous top surface in
response to removing the needleless device from the port. For example, tip
410 is removed from housing 310. In response, as head portion 110 is
compressed within inner wall 320, opening 130 is compressed to a closed
                                          11

 position and continuous top surface 120 is deformed to a planar state and
thus, port 315 is fluidly sealed.
 [0050]   Various embodiments of the present invention are thus described.

should be appreciated that the present invention should not be construed as
limited by such embodiments, but rather construed according to the following

and in the open position, the head portion is displaced from the fluid port such that the
fluid port is not fluidly sealed.
                                               18

       17.     The needleless valve system of Claim 10, wherein the housing is
configured to engage with a needleless syringe.
       18.     A needleless valve system comprising:
               a housing comprising a fluid port; and
               a piston having a head portion configured to extend into the fluid port and
       a base portion, the head portion comprising a continuous top surface and
       compression features, the top surface being non-planar and the compression
       features separated to form an opening positioned adjacent the top surface when
       the head portion is in a relaxed state, and the top surface being substantially
       planar when the compression features are pressed together to close the opening
       between the compression features,
               wherein, the piston comprises (1) an open position within said housing,
       when the head portion does not extend into the fluid port, and the compression
       features are separated by the opening, and (2) a closed position within said
       housing, when the head portion is urged by the base portion to extend into the
       fluid port such that the compression features are pressed together to close the
       opening.
       19.     The needleless valve system of Claim 18, wherein an outer surface of the
head portion is engaged against the fluid port such that the compression features are
directed toward the opening in the closed position.
       20.     The needleless valve system of Claim 18, wherein an outer surface of the
head portion is separated from an inner surface of the fluid port such that the
compression features are unrestrained.
