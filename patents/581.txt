   Summary of the Invention
   In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of
   gaming comprising:
30             displaying a plurality of games for player selection, each of the games having a
   corresponding set of prize modifiers for applying to a prize awarded during the
   respective game when a trigger condition is met during the selected game;
               receiving a selection indicative of a selected game selected from the games;
               selecting from the set of prize modifiers corresponding to the selected game a
35 subset of the prize modifiers comprising one, some or all of the prize modifiers;
               conducting play of the selected game;
               determining an outcome of the play of the selected game; and
               selecting one of the prize modifiers from the subset of prize modifiers and
   10089240_1(GHMaters) P100167.AU.2

                                                -2
   modifying any prize awarded according to the outcome of the selected game according
   to the selected prize modifier when the trigger condition is met.
   The prize modifiers may be prize multipliers, such that applying the selected prize
 5 modifier to any prize awarded according to the outcome of the selected game
   comprises multiplying the prize by the selected prize multiplier. In other embodiments,
   for example, the prize modifiers may increase or decrease the prize by a fixed amount,
   or by an amount that is dependent on the game outcome, or to a maximum value, or
   otherwise modify the prize.
10
   The method may include selecting the prize modifier to be applied in the selected
   game from the subset of prize modifiers randomly or pseudo-randomly.
   The method may include selecting the subset of the prize modifiers randomly or
15 pseudo-randomly.
   The method may include selecting the subset of the prize modifiers such that any of
   the prize modifiers of the set not in the subset are smaller than all of the one or more
   prize modifiers in the subset.
20
   In one embodiment, the subset is smaller than the set. It should be noted, however,
   that the subset may be the same size as the set. For example, in some embodiments
   the number of prize modifiers to be included in the subset is selected (such as
   randomly or pseudo-randomly) from the values 1 to N inclusive (where N is the number
25 of prize modifiers in the set), in others the values 1 to N-1 inclusive. In certain
   embodiments it is set to a fixed number (e.g. 1 or 2); in others it is selected (such as
   randomly or pseudo-randomly) from the set of integers {1, 2} or {1, 2, 3}.
   The second trigger condition may comprise a win with a scatter symbol substitution.
30
   In some embodiments, at least some of the games comprises different numbers of
   game rounds (known colloquially, when in a feature game, as 'free games'). The
   method may include altering a displayed number of games rounds in the selected
   game after receiving the selection.
35
   According to one embodiment, the method includes displaying to the player one or
   more characteristics of at least one of the games at least only after the selection has
   been received. In another embodiment, the method includes displaying to the player
   10089240_1(GHMaters) P100167.AU.2

                                                   -3
   one or more characteristics of at least one of the games at least only after the selection
   has been received if the player has made an ante bet. In these two embodiment
   (though also in others), the method may include selecting the one or more
   characteristics of at least one of the games randomly or pseudo-randomly from a set of
 5 possible values of the one or more characteristics.
   The method may include randomly or pseudo-randomly selecting and awarding a
   number of bonus game rounds when the trigger condition is met. For example,
   randomly or pseudo-randomly selected number of bonus game rounds from 1 to a
10 predefined maximum value may be awarded when the trigger condition is met.
   In one embodiment, the game is a feature game. The method may include awarding
   eligibility to the feature game in response to a feature game trigger condition being met
   in relation to a base game.
15
   The feature game trigger condition may comprise a scatter symbol win.
   The feature game trigger condition may be generated randomly or pseudo-randomly.
20 The feature game trigger condition may include receiving an ante bet from the player.
   In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a game
   controller for a gaming system, the game controller arranged to:
               display a plurality of games for player selection, each of the games having a
25 corresponding set of prize modifiers for applying to a prize awarded during the
   respective game when a trigger condition is met during the selected game;
               receive a selection indicative of a selected game selected from the games;
               select from the set of prize modifiers corresponding to the selected game a
   subset of the prize modifiers comprising one, some or all of the prize modifiers;
30             conduct play of the selected game;
               determine an outcome of the play of the selected game; and
               select one of the prize modifiers from the subset of prize modifiers and modify
   any prize awarded according to the outcome of the selected game according to the
   selected prize modifier when the trigger condition is met.
35
   In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a gaming
   system comprising:
               a player interface comprising a display for displaying game outcomes to a
   10089240_1(GHMaters) P100167.AU.2

                                                   -4
   player; and
               a game controller arranged to:
               display a plurality of games for player selection, each of the games having a
   corresponding set of prize modifiers for applying to a prize awarded during the
 5 respective game when a trigger condition is met during the selected game;
               receive a selection indicative of a selected game selected from the games;
               select from the set of prize modifiers corresponding to the selected game a
   subset of the prize modifiers comprising one, some or all of the prize modifiers;
               conduct play of the selected game;

   Detailed Description of Embodiments of the Invention
   According to embodiments of the invention there is provided a gaming system in which
   a player plays a spinning reel type game or games. An award is determined for the
25 game or games. The reels spin about an axis in a conventional manner to display a
   sequence of symbols and in due course may form a winning pattern (such as on a win
   line). According to embodiments of the present invention, the reels are each of
   apparent three-dimensional, torus form. In one example, the torus has a circular cross
   section, and in another example a square cross section. It will be appreciated,
30 however, that essentially any cross section can be used provided it is suitable for
   displaying the symbols.
   The gaming system may be provided in a number of different forms.
35 In a first form, a stand-alone gaming machine is provided in which all or most
   components required for implementing the game are present in a player operable
   gaming machine.
   10089240_1(GHMaters) P100167.AU.2

                                               -6
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided wherein some of the
   components required for implementing the game are present in a player operable
   gaming machine and some of the components required for implementing the game are
   located remotely relative to the gaming machine. For example, a "thick client"
 5 architecture may be used wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely, such as by a gaming
   server; or a "thin client" architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player operable gaming machine
   is used only to display audible and/or visible gaming information to the player and
10 receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are envisaged. For example,
   an architecture may be provided wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming
   server and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the gaming server are
15 selectively modifiable. For example, the gaming system may operate in stand-alone
   gaming machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending on the
   game being played, operating conditions, and so on. Other variations will be apparent
   to persons skilled in the art.
20 Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises several core components.
   Referring to figure 1, at the broadest level the core components are a player interface
   12 and a game controller 14, as illustrated schematically at 10 in figure 1.
   Player interface 12 is arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and the
25 gaming system and for this purpose includes the input/output components required for
   the player to enter instructions and play the game. Components of the player interface
   may vary from embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a credit
   mechanism 16 to enable a player to input credits and receive payouts, one or more
   displays 18 and a game play mechanism 20 that enables a player to input game play
30 instructions.
   Game controller 14 is in data communication with the player interface and typically
   includes a processor 22 that processes the game play instructions in accordance with
   game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the display. Typically, the game
35 play instructions are stored as program code in a memory 24 but can also be
   hardwired. Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically to any device that
   can process game play instructions in accordance with game play rules and may
   include: a microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device or other
   10089240_1(GHMaters) P100167.AU.2

                                              -7
   computational device, a general purpose computer (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand-alone gaming machine 30 according to another
   embodiment of the invention is shown schematically at 30 in figure 2. Gaming
 5 machine 30 includes a console 32 having a display 34 on which is displayed
   representations of a game 36 that can be played by a player. A mid-trim 40 of the
   gaming machine 30 houses a bank of buttons 42 for enabling a player to interact with
   the gaming machine, in particular during game play. The mid-trim 40 also houses a
   credit input mechanism 44 that, in this example, includes a coin input chute 44A and a
10 bill collector 44B. Other credit input mechanisms may also be employed, such as a
   card reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit card. A player marketing
   module having a reading device may also be provided for the purpose of reading a
   player tracking device, for example as part of a loyalty program. The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any other portable storage medium
15 capable of being read by the reading device.
   A top box 46 may carry artwork 48 including, for example, pay tables and details of
   bonus awards and other information or images relating to the game. Further artwork
   and/or information may be provided on a front panel 50 of the console 32. A coin tray
20 52 is mounted beneath the front panel 50 for dispensing cash payouts from the gaming
   machine 30.
   Display 34 of gaming machine 30 is in the form of a video display unit, particularly a
   cathode ray tube screen device. Alternatively, the display 34 may be a liquid crystal
25 display, plasma screen, any other suitable video display unit, or the visible portion of
   an electromechanical device. The top box 46 may also include a display, such as a
   video display unit, which may be of the same type as the display 34, or of a different

   mechanism 90 and a coin output mechanism 92. Additional hardware may be included
   as part of the gaming machine 60, or hardware may be omitted as required for the
   specific implementation.
25 Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of an exemplary memory 66.
   Memory 66 includes RAM 66A, EPROM 66B and a mass storage device 66C. RAM
   66A typically temporarily holds program files for execution by the processor 64 and
   related data. EPROM 66B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain some
   system or game related code. Mass storage device 66C is typically used to store
30 game programs, the integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   processor 64 using protected code from EPROM 66B or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the gaming machine 60 to be
   distributed; for example, input/output devices 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92 may be provided
35 remotely from game controller 62.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 100 in accordance with an alternative embodiment.

   10089240_1(GHMaters) P100167.AU.2

                                                -9
   network. Gaming machines 104, shown arranged in three banks 106 of two gaming
   machines 104 in figure 5, are connected to the network 102. Gaming machines 104
   provide a player operable interface and may be the same as gaming machines 30, 60
   shown in figures 2 and 3, or may have simplified functionality depending on the
 5 requirements for implementing game play. While banks 106 of two gaming machines
   are illustrated in figure 5, banks of one, three or more gaming machines are also
   envisaged.
   One or more displays 108 may also be connected to the network 102. Displays 108
10 may, for example, be associated with one or more banks 106 of gaming machines.
   Displays 108 may be used to display representations associated with game play on
   gaming machines 104, to display other representations, such as promotional or
   informational material, or both.
15 In a thick client embodiment, game server 110 of gaming system 100 implements part
   of the game played by a player using a gaming machine 104 and gaming machine 104
   implements part of the game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and the
   gaming machine implement part of the game, they collectively provide a game
   controller. A database management server 112 may manage storage of game
20 programs and associated data for downloading or access by the gaming devices 104
   in a database 112A. Typically, if the gaming system enables players to participate in a
   Jackpot game, a Jackpot server 114 will be provided to carry out the accounting in
   respect of the Jackpot game. A loyalty program server 116 may also be provided.
25  In a thin client embodiment, game server 110 implements most or all of the game
   played by a player using a gaming machine 104 and gaming machine 104 essentially
   provides only the player interface. With this embodiment, game server 110 provides

20 displayed when displayed to spin. Outcome determiner 144, which typically receives
   input from random number generator 72, determines game outcomes. Display
   controller 140, spinning module 142 and outcome determiner 144 cooperate to display
   and determine the outcome of a game.
25 Memory 24 includes game play instructions 146, which control the reels to be
   displayed to spin such that game symbols arranged along the reels are displayed as
   moving downwards in display 34, 82, and reel data 148 comprising vertical symbol
   sequence data. The vertical symbol sequence data is indicative of the sequence in
   which game symbols are to be displayed along each of the reels. This can be encoded
30 in any convenient way.
   Processor 22 further includes a feature game controller 150, which determines when a
   player becomes eligible to be awarded a feature game, according to trigger conditions
    152 stored in memory 24. Trigger conditions 152 specify that a feature game is
35 triggered by a scatter symbol win during a base game and randomly after any bought
   base game.
   Feature game controller 150 is configured, once a feature game has been awarded, to
   10089240_1(GHMaters) P100167.AU.2

                                                      - 11
   control display controller 140 to display to the player a plurality of feature games for
   player selection. Each of the feature games has a corresponding feature game
   characteristic set 154 and a feature game prize multiplier set 156, stored in memory
   24. For any particular feature game, the corresponding feature game characteristic set
 5  154 and feature game prize multiplier set 156 specify, respectively, the number of
   game rounds (colloquially referred to, when in a feature game, as 'free games')
   included in that feature game and the possible multipliers by which any prize awarded
   in the feature game will be multiplied under certain conditions (described below).
10 When the feature games are displayed to the player, feature game controller 150 also
   controls display controller 140 to display, in association with each feature game, the
   corresponding number of game rounds and possible multipliers. This allows the player
   to consider which of the offered feature games to select. It should be understood that
   the feature games may have the same game play rules, but differ only in respect of the
15 number of game rounds and possible multipliers (though in other embodiments the
   game play rules may also differ). Thus, in the present embodiment the feature games
   indeed have the same game play rules, and differ only in respect of the number of
   game rounds and possible multipliers as shown in Table 1:
20                                   Table 1: Feature Games without Ante Bet

    It will be seen that, according to this embodiment, in making a selection from the
   available feature games, the user may choose to receive more game rounds but at the
25 expense of the size of the possible prize multiplier, or vice versa.
   Also according to this embodiment, if the player has made an ante bet when awarded
   a feature game, feature game controller 150 controls display controller 140 to display a
   different group of feature games, as shown in Table 2. It should again be noted,
30 however, that in this embodiment the game play rules are the same for each of the
   feature games in Table 2, and indeed the same as those of the feature games in Table
   10089240_1(GHMaters) P100167.AU.2

   Figures 7 and 8 are, respectively, schematic views 170, 180 of display 34, 82 when
   feature game controller 150 controls display controller 140 to display the feature
   games of Table 1 and the feature games of Table 2 for player selection. In both cases,
   the player uses touch screen and/or buttons 84 of player interface 80 to select the
10 desired feature game.
   Processor 22 includes a feature game selector 158 that receives player input indicative
   of a selection of one of the available feature games. It should be noted that feature
   game 6 in Table 2 is termed a "Mystery Game", because the number of game rounds
15 and the multiplier set are selected, randomly, and displayed only once that feature
   game has been selected (if it is selected). (In another embodiment, the number of
   game rounds and the available multiplier set are selected, randomly, before feature
   game 6 is selected, but not displayed until that feature game has been selected.) The
   selection of the number of game rounds and the multiplier set are made by feature
20 game controller 150, and drawn from feature game characteristic sets 154 and feature
   game prize multiplier sets 156.
   Once the feature game selection has been received by feature game selector 158, if
   the player has made an ante bet when awarded a feature game and then selected
25 feature game 6 (see Table 2), feature game selector 158 controls feature game
   controller 150 to select the number of game rounds and the multiplier set as described
   above. Next, or if any other feature game has been selected, feature game selector
   10089240_1(GHMaters) P100167.AU.2

                                                       - 13
    158 controls game controller 14 to conduct game play of the selected feature game.
   Processor 22 includes a prize multiplier subset selector 160, prize multiplier selector
    162 and prize awarder 164, a prize modifier 166 and a game round modifier 168. If,
 5 during the game play of the selected feature game, an outcome is determined by
   outcome determiner 14, prize awarder 164 determines the prize to be awarded.
   However, if an outcome is determined by outcome determiner 14 in which a specific
   scatter symbols substitutes in a win (which constitutes a required trigger condition),
   prize awarder 164 determines the prize that would, without the scatter symbol
10 substitution, be awarded, prize multiplier selector 162 randomly selects a prize
   multiplier from the respective feature game prize multiplier set 156, prize modifier 166
   receives the prize from prize awarder and the selected prize multiplier from prize
   modifier selector 162 and multiplies the prize by the selected prize multiplier, then
   passes the result back to prize awarder 164.
15
    In this example, for each feature game a different, respective DRAGON symbol is
   specified as the scatter symbol; this specification is stored in the feature game
   characteristic sets 154.
20  In addition, if the player made an ante bet when awarded a feature game, there is a
   chance that some of the lowest multipliers of the feature game prize multiplier set 156
   corresponding to the selected feature game will be effectively removed, hence
   increasing the likely effect of prize multiplication described above. Also, extra game
   rounds may be awarded. Thus, if the player made an ante bet when awarded a
25 feature game, prize multiplier subset selector 160 randomly selects a subset of the
   feature game prize multiplier set 156 pertaining to the selected feature game (of
   feature games nos. 1 to 6); this includes randomly selecting both the size n of the
   subset (where 1                  n N, and N is the number of values in the feature game prize
   multiplier set 156), then randomly selecting the elements of the subset from the feature
30 game prize multiplier set 156 starting from the lowest value. In the case of feature
   game no. 6 (the "Mystery Choice"), the feature game prize multiplier set 156 comprises
   sets of multipliers, so the random selection of a subset of the feature game prize
   multiplier set 156 comprises the selection of one or more of these sets. In one
   embodiment, if prize multiplier subset selector 160 randomly determines that any of
35 these sets should be eliminated, it eliminates the lowest of these sets (hence, in the
   embodiment illustrated by reference to Table 2, the set {2, 3, 5}); in other
   embodiments, one or more of the sets constituting feature game prize multiplier set
    156 pertaining to the "Mystery Choice" may be eliminated.
   10089240_1(GHMaters) P100167.AU.2

                                              - 14
   The result in this embodiment is that all values of prize multiplier in the relevant feature
   game prize multiplier set 156 but omitted from the subset are smaller (or, in the case of
   the "Mystery Choice", are on average smaller) than all values in the selected subset, to
 5 the benefit of the player.
    It should also be noted that the subset may include all values from the set, so in a
   sense may not be mathematically a true 'subset.' Nonetheless, the term 'subset' is
   used for simplicity.
10
   Once prize multiplier subset selector 160 has formed the subset, game play, outcome
   determination, prize awarding and prize modification proceed as described above,
   except that prize modifier 166 randomly selects a prize multiplier from the subset rather
   than from the relevant feature game prize multiplier set 156.
15
    Furthermore, if the player made an ante bet when awarded a feature game round
   modifier 168 randomly selects a bonus number of game rounds (from 1 to 15), and
   adds these-during the selected feature game-to the number of game rounds that the
   selected feature game normally involves, also to the benefit of the player. Game round
20 modifier 168 controls display controller 140 to modify the displayed number of game
   rounds (see figure 8) of the selected feature game to reflect the addition of the bonus
   game rounds. The feature game then commences.
   Thus, while feature game play with and without an ante bet are essentially identical,
25 play when an ante bet has been made will entail more game rounds and the chance of
   an improved prize multiplier.
   The method of this embodiment is summarized as a flow diagram 190 in figure 9. At
   step 192, games play is conducted. At step 194, feature game controller 150
30 determines whether the player has become eligible to be awarded a feature game
   (according to whether the relevant feature game trigger condition is met). If not,
   processing returns to step 192, but if the player has become eligible to be awarded a
   feature game, processing continues at step 196 where game controller 14 determines
   whether an ante bet has been made. If not, processing continues at 198 where display
35 controller 140 displays the feature games of Table 1 for player selection. If an ante bet
   has been made, however, processing continues at step 200 where display controller
    140 displays the feature games of Table 2 for player selection, at step 202 prize
   multiplier subset selector 160 selects the subset of prize multipliers and at step 204 the
   10089240_1(GHMaters) P100167.AU.2

                                               - 15
   game round modifier 168 selects a bonus number of game rounds and applies them to
   the feature game.
    In both cases (i.e. whether or not an ante bet was made), processing continues at step
 5 206 where the player's feature game selection is received.
   At step 208, game controller 14 conducts the selected feature game, at step 210
   outcome determiner 144 determines an outcome of a game, after which at step 212
   game controller 14 determines whether the outcome is a win or not; if not, processing
10 ends but if the outcome is a win, processing continues at step 214 where prize awarder
    164 awards a prize.
   At step 216, game controller 14 determines whether the win was with scatter symbol
   substitution. If not, processing ends, but if so, processing continues at step 218 where
15 prize multiplier selector 162 selects a prize multiplier (which will be from the subset
   selected at step 202 if an ante bet was made or from the set of prize multipliers for the
   selected feature game if not). At step 220, prize modifier 166 multiplies the awarded
   prize by the selected prize multiplier. Processing then ends.
20 It will be appreciated that other features known in electronic gaming machines and the
   games provided thereby can be advantageously and synergistically combined with the
   features described above.
   Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a skilled addressee are deemed
