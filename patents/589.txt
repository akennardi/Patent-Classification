                 HOLLOW SECTION STRUCTURAL MEMBER
                       FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5      The present invention relates to hollow section
   structural members made from steel for use in the
   construction industry, for example in the construction of
   multistorey buildings, and a method for producing such
   hollow section structural members.
10      The invention also relates to concrete filled columns
   that form part of the framework of a multistorey building
   and comprise  (a) a hollow section structural member made
   from steel,  (b) concrete that fills the hollow section,
   and (c) reinforcement embedded in the concrete.
15
                    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
        Concrete filled hollow section structural members,
   such as concrete filled hollow steel tubes, are
20 increasingly widely used to form composite structural
   columns for buildings. The resistance of the concrete to
   bending reduces the occurrence of local buckling of the
   steel tubes, and the steel tubes confine the concrete
   thereby improving its strength and ductility.
25      Concrete filled hollow section columns for the
   building industry are discussed in a Corus Tubes document
   entitled "Design guide for SHS concrete filled columns" by
   Dr S J Hicks and Mr G M Newman published in 2012. The
   following paragraphs in this section of the specification
30 are based in large part on information in this document.
        Structural hollow section   (SHS) tubes are the most
   efficient of all structural steel sections in resisting
   compression. Structural hollow section tubes are readily
   fabricated from high yield materials to achieve a high
35 strength to weight ratio, allowing columns to be more
   slender and attractive.   Moreover, the width of the steel
   and the reinforcement, or absence thereof, in the concrete
                                           9821358_1 (GHMatters) P92733.AU.2 21/12/17

                               - 2
   can be varied whilst maintaining constant external
   dimensions of the structural hollow section tubes.
   Therefore, the structural hollow section tubes can have
   constant external dimensions over the full height of the
 5 building.
         Concrete filled hollow section tubes are
   significantly less susceptible to temperature variations
   than unfilled hollow section tubes. As such, a concrete
   filled hollow section tube will maintain its load carrying
10 capacity through fluctuations in temperature. Conversely,
   for a given load carrying capacity, a smaller composite
    (i.e. concrete filled) section tube may be used when
   compared with an unfilled hollow section tube.
         Concrete or grout filled hollow section tubes can be
15 divided into those that are externally protected against
   fire by fire-rated boards, lightweight sprayed protection
   or intumescent coatings, and those that have no such
   protection.   A further division can be made by
   differentiating between those hollow section tubes that
20 are filled with plain concrete mixes and those hollow
   section tubes that contain steel reinforcement within the
   mix.
         In order to facilitate interconnection of the
   formwork of a building, hollow section structural members,
25 such as hollow section tubes, are roll-formed and
   connectors such as cleats and flanges are welded to the
   outside of the roll-formed hollow section structural steel
   members.   The connectors are then bolted or otherwise
   connected to horizontal floor beams and the like to create
30 the formwork of the building.   The attachment of
   connectors is time-consuming when performed on site since
   access to a relevant portion of the hollow section
   structural member is necessary, but that portion may be at
   a height of multiple storeys from the ground.          To avoid
35 this issue, connectors can be attached off-site.              However,
   where connectors are necessary on more than one side of a
   hollow section structural steel member, which is often the
                                          9821358_1 (GHMatters) P92733.AU.2 21/12/17

                                        -  3
   case, the hollow section structural member may need to be
   rotated to obtain access to each side.               This process is
   also time-consuming and invariably requires lifting
   equipment.

   description of part of the common general knowledge in
   Australia or elsewhere.
            In addition, the reference to the Corus Tubes
   document mentioned above should not be taken to be an
10 admission that the document and the information in the
   document is part of the common general knowledge in

                           SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
15
            As used herein, the term "longitudinal", and its
   derivatives such as "longitudinally", are intended to mean
   parallel to a longitudinal axis of the hollow section
   structural      member.   Where the terms "longitudinal"                  and its
20 derivatives      are used in   relation   to features         such as
   welds,      folds and steel plates, those terms again indicate
   reference to the longitudinal axis of the hollow section
   structural member that will ultimately be formed using the
   referred to features.         The term "longitudinal" and its
25 derivatives may refer to features that extend the full
   length of the hollow section structural member, or only
   part of that length.
            In broad terms, the present invention provides a
   hollow section structural member comprising steel plate
30 folded into a hollow section and welded together along
   longitudinal edges of the plate.
            In more specific terms, the present invention
   provides a hollow section structural member comprising two
   or more steel plates that form different portions of the
35 member, at least one of the steel plates being folded, and
   the steel plates being welded together.
                                                    9821358_1 (GHMatters) P92733.AU.2 21/12/17

                                -  4
        In more specific terms, the present invention
   provides a hollow section structural member comprising two
   or more steel plates that form respectively different
   portions of a transverse cross-section of the hollow
 5 section structural member, at least one of the steel
   plates being folded, the steel plates being welded
   together to form the hollow section structural member.
        The or each fold may be a longitudinal fold.
        The plates may be welded together by longitudinal
10 welds.
        The hollow section structural member may further
   comprise one or more openings formed in at least one of
   the steel plates.
        The or each opening may be sized and positioned to
15 receive a floor   beam.
        The or each opening may be sized and positioned to
   vent vapour from internally of the hollow section
   structural member.
        The or each opening may be sized and positioned to
20 enable drainage of water from internally of the hollow
   section structural member.
        The hollow section structural member may comprise one
   or more connectors fastened to a surface of one or more of
   the steel plates.
25      The or each connector may be selected from the group
   comprising:   a column-beam connector;   a moment resisting
   connector;  a fill-connection strengthening lug;             a
   reinforcement locating lug;    and a reinforcing member.
        The hollow section structural member may comprise two
30 folded steel plates.
        The hollow section structural member may comprise one
   folded steel plate and one flat plate.
        The present invention also provides a method for
   forming a hollow section structural member, comprising:
35  (a) forming two or more steel plates into different
   portions of a hollow section structural member by folding
   at least one of the steel plates;    and
                                             9821358_1 (GHMatters) P92733.AU.2 21/12/17

                               - 5
    (b)   welding the plates together to form the member.
        The step of folding at least one of the steel plates
   may include forming a longitudinal fold in the or each
   plate.
 5      The step of welding the plates together may include
   welding the plates together using longitudinal welds.
        The method may further comprise forming one or more
   openings in one or more of the steel plates, prior to the
   positioning step.
10      The forming step may include sizing and positioning
   the or each opening to receive a beam.
        The forming step may include sizing and positioning
   the or each opening to vent vapour from internally of the
   hollow section structural member.
15      The forming step may include sizing and positioning
   the or each opening to enable drainage of water from
   internally of the hollow section structural member.
        The method may further comprise fastening one or more
   connectors to a surface of one or more of the steel
20 plates, prior to the positioning step.
        The fastening step may include fastening to the
   surface of one of more of the steel plates one or more
   connector selected from the group comprising:         a column
   beam connector;  a moment resisting connector;        a fill
25 connection strengthening lug;   a reinforcement locating
   lug; and a reinforcing member.
        The present invention also provides a concrete filled
   column that forms part of a framework of a multistorey
   building and comprises  (a) the hollow section structural
30 member described above,  (b) concrete in the hollow
   section, and (c) reinforcement embedded in the concrete.
        Advantageously, in situations where the hollow
   section structural member is filled with concrete, the
   steel plate of the structural member substantially
35 prevents construction damage of the concrete filling.
        Advantageously, in situations where the hollow
   section structural member is filled with concrete, the
                                           9821358_1 (GHMatters) P92733.AU.2 21/12/17

                               - 6
   overall weight of the structural member when compared with
   a non-composite  (e.g. unfilled hollow section member, or
   exposed concrete column) is lower for a member of the same
   strength.
 5      Advantageously, the present invention makes it
   possible for the hollow section structural member to be
   made to order.  Consequently, multiple floors of a
   multistorey building can be erected concurrently.
        Advantageously, floor beam connections may be
10 attached (e.g. by welding) onto the surfaces of the steel
   plate prior to welding the plates together to form the
   hollowing section structural member.   Consequently, the
   hollow section structural member may be fabricated to have
   integral internal and/or external floor beam connections
15 once the steel plates have been welded together.              In
   contrast, roll-forming plate to form a closed section
   would result in damage and/or distortion of openings of
   fittings such as connectors that are installed prior to
   the structural member being rolled into its        'in use' form.
20      Advantageously, the present invention makes it
   possible for reinforcement, such as reinforcing bars                 (as
   individual bars or as cages made from a plurality of bars
   tied together) or reinforcing I-beams, to be attached to
   an inner surface of one or more steel plates before the
25 steel plates are welded together.   The resulting hollow
   section structural member will then have integral
   reinforcement once fabrication is completed.

20                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         A hollow section structural member 10, as shown in
   Figures 1 and 2,   is in the form of a Square Hollow Section
    (SHS) beam.
25       The hollow section structural member 10 comprises two
   steel plates 12,   14 that form respectively different
   portions of a transverse cross-section of the hollow
   section structural member 10.
         In the embodiment shown in Figures 1 and 2,             the steel
30 plates 12,   14 form respectively opposite halves of the
   transverse cross-section of the hollow section structural
   member 10.
         The steel plates 12,   14 are welded together by welds
   16, 18 to form the hollow section structural member 10.
35 Welds 16, 18 are longitudinal welds that are continuous
   along the length of the hollow section structural member
   10.   It will be appreciated that intermittent or
                                            9821358_1 (GHMatters) P92733.AU.2 21/12/17

                               - 8
   discontinuous  (e.g. spot) welding, or welding at an angle
   to the longitudinal axis of the hollow section structural
   member, may be appropriate in some cases, and all such
   welding techniques and directions are intended to fall
 5 within the scope of the present disclosure.
        Each of the steel plates 12,  14 in the member 10
   shown in Figures 1 and 2 includes a fold 20, 22.              The
   folds 20, 22 are longitudinal, which gives the plates 12,
   14 an angle-section.   Each angle forms half of the square
10 section of the beam so when the two folded plates 12,                 14
   are brought together the square section is complete.                  It
   will be appreciated that folds in directions other than
   the longitudinal direction may be appropriate in some
   cases, and are intended to fall within the scope of the
15 present disclosure.
        In a standard, roll-formed structural hollow section
   beam there will be a single butt weld running
   longitudinally of the beam.   Each longitudinal edge of the
   beam will constitute a roll-formed angle and thus assume a
20 rounded shape.
        In the beam shown in Figures 1 and 2 the two
   longitudinal seams 16, 18 are positioned at the corners.
   Therefore, two of the longitudinal edges of the beam are
   formed by the longitudinal folds 20, 22 in the steel
25 plates 12, 14 and the other two the longitudinal edges are
   formed by the seams 16, 18.   The two edges formed by the
   folds 20, 22 will typically have a rounded shape by virtue
   of the curvature of the fold. The two edges formed by the
   seams 16, 18 will also typically have a rounded shape as
30 they are formed using butt welds, though another type of
   weld or connection may be used as desired.
        It is desirable that whatever connection is made
   between the plates 12,  14 is continuous along the length
   of the plates 12,  14 so that the structural forces are
35 correctly distributed throughout the column and upon
   filling of the hollow section structural member 10 with
   concrete there is no unexpected leakage.
                                          9821358_1 (GHMatters) P92733.AU.2 21/12/17

                              - 9
        As an alternative to connecting the plates 12,              14 by
   longitudinal seams 16, 18 forming corners of the hollow
   section structural member 10, the plates 12, 14 may
   instead be folded to form C-section beams.       Welding the
 5 two C-section beams together will result in welds along
   broken lines 24, 26 as shown in Figure 1.
             Figure 3 and Figure 4 show transverse cross
   sections of other hollow section structural members.
             Figure 3 shows a D-section hollow section
10 structural member 28.  The hollow section structural
   member 28 comprises two steel plates 30, 32 that form
   respectively different portions of the transverse cross
   section of the structural member 28.  In particular, plate
   30 forms a linear backing plate and plate 32 forms a C
15 section beam welded centrally, with respect to the
   longitudinal axis of the structural member 28, to plate
   30. Since plate 32 is centrally disposed on plate 30, and
   the open or long side of the C-section plate 32 is shorter
   than the width of plate 30, two longitudinal flanges 34,
20 36 are created, one extending from each side of the C
   section plate 32.
        Notably, only one of the plates 30, 32 is folded.                   It
   will therefore be understood that a hollow section
   structural member formed in accordance with the present
25 teachings may comprises two or more steel plates and one
   or more of those plates may be folded, depending on the
   configuration of the hollow section structural member
   desired to be fabricated.
        The steel plates 30, 32 are welded together by
30 longitudinal fillet welds 38, 40 to form a D-section
   hollow section structural member 10.
        The flanges 34, 36 are useful features in terms of
   mounting other structural members to the structural member
   28.  In particular, the flanges 34, 36, enable the hollow
35 section structural member 28 to be attached to concrete or
   other members of the formwork of a building.
   Consequently, the hollow section structural member 28 is
                                         9821358_1 (GHMatters) P92733.AU.2 21/12/17

                              - 10
   suitable for retrofitting to an existing building
   structure.
        The hollow section structural member 42 as shown in
   Figure 4 comprises two steel plates 44, 46 that are folded
 5 to form different sized angle-section beams.         The smaller
   angle-section beam 46 is positioned centrally on the
   larger angle section beam 44 and is welded in position by
   fillet welds 48, 50 to give hollow section structural
   member 42 is an "E-section".
10      The smaller angle-section plate 46 does not extend to
   the edges of the larger angle-section plate 44 and thus
   two flanges 52, 54 are formed, one extending laterally
   outwardly from each fillet weld 48, 50.
        The flanges 52, 54 are useful features in terms of
15 mounting other structural members to the structural member
   28.  In particular, as with the D-section hollow section
   structural member 28, the E-section hollow section
   structural member 42 can be readily retrofitted to an
   existing building structure by flanges 52, 54.            The E
20 section hollow section structural member 42, as with the
   D-section hollow section structural member 28, can be used
   to strengthen existing structures and/or to enable
   extension of existing structures.
        Figure 5 shows a steel plate 56 with various
25 elements, including connectors, fastened to an internal
   surface before the plate 56 is folded.     It will be
   appreciated that the connectors may be fastened at any
   time up to the point at which two or more plates are
   welded together to form the hollow section structural
30 member.
        A reference to an "internal surface" is intended to
   mean a surface internal of a hollow section structural
   member or, with reference to the plate 56, a surface that
   will ultimately form an internal surface of the hollow
35 section structural member once the plate is folded and/or
   welded to one or more other plates.  Conversely, an
   "external surface" is a surface that does, or ultimately
                                          9821358_1 (GHMatters) P92733.AU.2 21/12/17

                                   -  11
   will, constitute an external surface of the hollow section
   structural member.
         In use, plate 56 will be folded to form part of a
   hollow section structural column, and to that end the
 5 connectors include a floor beam connector 58 shown
   extending through an opening, similar to opening 60 and
   extending   (indicated by broken lines) outwardly from an
   external surface of the plate 56.         The floor beam
   connector 58 is for connecting to a floor beam of the
10 formwork of the building.
         Where the hollow section structural member is a beam,
   the connector 58 will constitute a column connector.
   Consequently, connector 58 may be variously referred to as
   a column-beam   connector,    a column connector or a beam
15 connector.
         The connectors  further     include,  by way of example
   only:
    (a)  a moment resisting connector 62 for connection to a
   moment resisting fitting as shown in Figure 6;
20  (b) a fill connection strengthening lug 64, that may or
   may not be headed, that sets into a concrete in-fill to
   mechanically bond the hollow section structural member to
   the concrete, or alternatively may be connected to a
   reinforcing member internally of the hollow section
25 structural member, thereby constituting a reinforcement
   locating lug;   and
    (c) a reinforcing member      (not shown) that may comprise an
   I-section beam, reinforcing rod or similar.
         In addition to the connectors, the plate 56 can be
30 provided with one or more openings.         Presently there are
   openings 60 and 66.     Opening 60 is designed to receive a
   plate  of another connector,      such a column-beam connector
   58.   Opening 66 is  designed to      receive a beam,        such as a
   floor beam or profiled beam 67, or column where the hollow
35 section structural member is a beam.         The opening 66 may
   have a corresponding opening in another plate to enable a
   beam or column, as the case may be, to extend right
                                                9821358_1 (GHMatters) P92733.AU.2 21/12/17

                              - 12
   through the hollow section structural member.
        It will be appreciated that an opening of any desired
   shape such as opening 66 may be cut into the steel plate,
   for example to suit a particular floor beam profile.                 A
 5 cooperating opening can then be cut in another plate so
   that when the two plates are welded together a floor beam
   of the desired profile can extend through the resulting
   hollow section structural member.   The floor beam will be
   welded to the outside of the hollow section structural
10 member enabling floor beams to be continuous, rather than
   being segmented with the hollow section structural member
   between the segments.  Such an arrangement is
   significantly more structurally efficient.
        There may be further openings  (not shown) at the top
15 and/or bottom of each column, or at the ends of each beam,
   for the release of water particularly in circumstances
   where the hollow section structural member is to remain on
   site during inclement weather without being filled with
   concrete.  The same openings, or additional openings, can
20 be used for venting steam in the event of a fire, to
   reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failure or rupturing
   of the hollow section structural member.
        Plate 56 is folded into an angle-section as shown in
   Figure 6.  The ends of connectors 58, 62 are available for
25 connection to beams of the formwork of the building in the
   case of connector 58, and a moment resisting connector
   member in the case of connector 62.
        Although the embodiment shown in Figure 5 and 6
   involves the addition of connectors to the plate 56 before
30 folding, it will typically be preferable to add the
   connectors after folding to reduce the likelihood of
   damage to connectors during folding.
        Figure 7 is a perspective view of another embodiment
   of a hollow section structural member according to the
35 present invention.  The embodiment is similar to the
   embodiment shown in Figure 3 and shows a D-section hollow
   section structural member 28.
                                          9821358_1 (GHMatters) P92733.AU.2 21/12/17

                              - 13
        Specifically, with reference to Figure 7, the hollow
   section structural member 28 comprises two steel plates
   30, 32 that form respectively different portions of the
   transverse cross-section of the structural member 28.                   In
 5 particular, plate 30 forms a linear backing plate and
   plate 32 forms a C-section beam welded centrally, with
   respect to the longitudinal axis of the structural member
   28, to plate 30. Since plate 32 is centrally disposed on
   plate 30, and the open or long side of the C-section plate
10 32 is shorter than the width of plate 30, two longitudinal
   flanges 34, 36 are created, one extending from each side
   of the C-section plate 32.
        In addition, the end of the hollow section structural
   member 28 shown in Figure 7 includes a connector in the
15 form of a plate 80 positioned to extend through a slot 82
   in the C-section plate 32.   The end of the plate 8o that
   extends beyond the member 28 forms a mounting flange.                   The
   other end of the plate 80 is welded or otherwise secured
   to an internal wall of the plate 30.
20      Figure 8 shows a concrete filled column that can form
   part of a framework of a multistorey building.            The
   concrete filled column comprises  (a) the hollow section
   structural member 10 described above,   (b) concrete 68 that
   fills the hollow section structural member 10 and, with
25 regard to the embodiment shown in Figure 9,        (c)
   reinforcement 72, 74 embedded in the concrete.
        While the embodiment shown in Figure 8 is, in effect,
   a concrete column sheathed in a metal skin, in order to
   improve the mechanical connection between the concrete and
30 the hollow section structural member the embodiment
   includes fill connection strengthening lugs, such as lug
   64 in Figure 5, disposed along the length of the hollow
   section structural member 10.
        Hollow section structural member 70 as shown in
35 Figure 9 comprises an SHS hollow section structural member
   according to Figure 1, filled with concrete.         Set within
   the concrete are reinforcing rods 72 and a rigidifying I
                                          9821358_1 (GHMatters) P92733.AU.2 21/12/17

                              -  14
   beam 74.  It will be appreciated that any number and type
   of reinforcing element may be used, the or each member
   being set within the concrete, or directly connected (e.g.
   welded) to the hollow section structural member, or
 5 connected to the hollow section structural member by being
   welded to reinforcement locating lugs 64.
        The reinforcement can be added prior to the steel
   plates being welded together to form the hollow section
   structural member.  To that end, the reinforcement can be
10 mechanically connected to the hollow section structural
   member along its length, rather than simply being set into
   concrete within the hollow section structural member.
        One embodiment of a method for forming a hollow
   section structural member, such as member 10 described
15 herein, comprises the following steps:
    (a) forming two or more steel plates 12,     14 into
   different portions of a transverse cross-section of the
   hollow section structural member 10, by folding at least
   one of the steel plates 12,  14; and
20  (b) positioning the steel plates 12, 14 adjacent one
   another and welding the plates 12, 14 together          (e.g. using
   longitudinal welds 16, 18) to form the hollow section
   structural member 10.
        The fold in the or each steel plate is preferably a
25 longitudinal fold, so as to provide a consistent cross
   section along the length of the hollow section structural
   member.
        Similarly, the welds 16, 18 are preferably
   longitudinal welds that are continuous over the length of
30 the hollow section structural member so as to prevent
   leaks if the hollow section structural member is filled
   with concrete.
        As mentioned above, one or more openings may be
   formed in the hollow section structural member.             Forming
35 the openings could include sizing and positioning each
   opening to:
    (a) receive a beam; and/or
                                          9821358_1 (GHMatters) P92733.AU.2 21/12/17

                                       -  15
    (b)     vent vapour from internally of the hollow section
   structural     member,    for  example steam being vented in                  the
   event of a     fire;    and/or
    (c)     enable drainage of water from internally of the
 5 hollow section structural member, particularly where the
   structural member is on site unfilled during inclement
   weather.
            As also mentioned above, one or more connectors may
   be fastened to a surface of one or more of the steel
10 plates, prior to positioning the plates adjacent one
   another.
            Fastening the connectors to the surface may include
   fastening one or more connectors of the following types: a
   column-beam connector;         a moment resisting connector;                  a
15 fill-connection strengthening lug;            a reinforcement
   locating lug;        and a reinforcing member.
            Such a method may also include attaching one or more
   reinforcing elements to an internal surface of one or more
   of the steel plates prior to welding the steel plates
20 together to form the hollow section structural member.
   This may be either by directly connecting the reinforcing
   elements to the steel plates directly, or by connecting
   the reinforcing elements to reinforcement locating lugs
   that are attached to an internal surface of one or more of
25 the steel plates.
            The above-described concrete-filled hollow section
   structural     members    are suitable    for  use as columns that
   form part     of a framework of a multistorey building.
            Many modifications may be made to         the embodiments of
30 the present      invention described above without departing
   from the spirit and scope of the invention.
            By way of example, the present invention is not
   confined to the cross-sectional profiles of the particular
   embodiments of the hollow section structural member shown
35 in Figures 1 to 5 and 7 and extends to any other suitable
   profiles.      One example of another profile is a circular
   cross-section profile.
