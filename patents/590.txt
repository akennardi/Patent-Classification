                 Oxidatively Stable Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Containing Oil
[1]       The invention relates to an oil comprising one or more polyunsaturated fatty acids
having at least 4 double bonds.
                    CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[2]       The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent application
number <removed-apn>, which is turn is a divisional application from Australian patent
application number 2012333227, which is turn claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §1 19(e) to
U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/554,291, filed November 1, 2011, the entire disclosures
of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[3]       Oils containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may oxidize and become rancid
during storage. This results in unpleasant flavors and odors in the oil as well as in the products
in which such oils are incorporated. A PUFA with 4 or more C-C double bonds may be less
oxidatively stable than a PUFA with fewer double bonds. Moreover, the presence of metals,
such as, iron, may increase the rate at which a PUFA containing oil oxidizes.
[4]       Those skilled in the art have attempted to decrease the oxidation of a PUFA
containing oil by employing various means including incorporating ascorbic acid derivatives,
such as, ascorbyl palmitate in combination with lecithin. There, however, remains a need for
more oxidatively stable PUFA containing oils.
[5]      It has now been discovered that combining ascorbic acid derivatives, such as,
ascorbyl palmitate with lecithin increases the oxidation of an oil comprising 30% of at least
one PUFA having 4 or more carbon-carbon double bonds. Accordingly, the following non
limiting embodiments of the present invention are provided herein. The embodiments
described herein may be suitably combined or subdivided to yield suitable subcombinations to
comprise, consist of or consist essentially of additional embodiments.

 [77]     In some embodiments, the oil described herein is obtained via the following steps:
 generating biomass by fermenting microalgae capable of producing oil that contains at least one
 C18  22 PUFA having 4 carbon-carbon double bonds; harvesting the biomass; spray drying the
biomass; extracting oil from the biomass; refining the oil (to remove free fatty acids and
 phospholipids); bleaching the oil (to remove any remaining polar compounds and pro-oxidant
 metals, and to break down lipid oxidation products); chill filtering the oil (to remove any
 remaining insoluble fats, waxes, and solids); deodorizing the oil (optionally under vacuum and
 in, for example, a packed column, counter current steam stripping deodorizer); adding an
antioxidant to the oil; and any combinations thereof. In some embodiments, following a
controlled growth over a pre-established period, the culture is harvested by centrifugation then
 pasteurized and spray dried. In certain embodiments, the dried biomass is flushed with nitrogen
and packaged before being stored frozen at -20"C. In certain embodiments, the oil is extracted
 from the dried biomass by mixing the biomass with n-hexane or isohexane in a batch process
which disrupts the cells and allows the oil and cellular debris to be separated. In certain
embodiments, the solvent is then removed. In one embodiment, the oil described herein is stored
at room temperature (25*C) in Nylon/Foil/PE Low Density Polyethylene bags packaged with
vacuum then heat sealed under N 2 on a Model AGV Multivac. (Multivac Sepp Haggenmdller

186]    Fatty Acid Profile of PTA-10208. Two samples of the biomass produced in accordance
with Example 1 (PTA-10208 Sample #1 and PTA-10208 Sample #2) were analyzed for total
crude oil content by solvent extraction, lipid classes were determined by high performance liquid
chromatography/evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC/ELSD), triacylglycerol (TAG) was
analyzed by HPLC/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS), and fatty acid (FA) profiles were determined
by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). The crude lipid content of
each freeze dried biomass was determined using solvent grinding with hexane and compared to
the sum of FAME (mg/g) generated by direct transesterification, and the resultant fatty acid
methyl esters (FAME) were quantified by GC/FID analysis. FAs in the extracted crude lipid
were also quantified by transesterification and quantified using GC/FID analysis of the resultant
FAME. The weight percent of all neutral lipids (NL) and free fatty acids (FFA) were determined
in the extracted crude lipid using normal phase HPLC with ELSD and atmospheric pressure
chemical ionization-MS (APCI-MS) identification. The method separates and quantifies sterol
esters (SE), TAG, FFAs, 1,3-diacylglycerols (1,3-DAG), sterols, 1,2-diacylglycerols (1,2-DAG),
and monoacylglycerols (MAG). Results are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

(PTA-10208 Sample #1 and PTA-10208 Sample #2). TAG was isolated using low pressure flash
chromatography and PL was isolated using solid phase extraction (SPE). The identity of each
isolated fraction was confirmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The fatty acid profiles of

[01011           Individual lipid classes were isolated from a sample of crude oil extracted from
PTA-10208 (PTA-10208 Sample #3) using normal HPLC with ELSD and APCI-MS
identification.
[871    Experimental Procedures.
[881     Crude Oil Extraction - Crude oil was extracted from samples of freeze-dried biomass
using solvent grinding. For example, approximately 3 grams of biomass was weighed into a
Swedish tube. Three ball bearings and 30 mL of hexane were added to the Swedish tube, which
was sealed with a neoprene stopper and placed in a shaker for 2 hours. The resultant slurry was
filtered using a Buchner funnel and Whatman filter paper. The filtered liquid was collected, the
solvent removed under vacuum, and the amount of remaining crude lipid determined
gravimetrically.
101021 Fatty AcidAnalysis - The samples of biomass, extracted crude lipid, and isolated lipid
classes were analyzed for fatty acid composition as FAME. Briefly, freeze-dried biomass and
isolated lipid classes were weighed directly into a screw cap test tubes, while samples of the
crude oil were dissolved in hexane to give a concentration of approximately 2 mg/mL. Toluene,
containing internal standard, and 1.5 N HCI in methanol was added to each tube. The tubes were
vortexed, then capped and heated to 1000 C for 2 hours. The tubes were allowed to cool, and
saturated NaCl in water was added. The tubes were vortexed again and centrifuged to allow the
layers to separate. A portion of the organic layer was then placed in a GC vial and analyzed by
GC-FID. FAME was quantified using a 3-point calibration curve generated using Nu-Check
Prep GLC Reference Standard (NuCheck, Elysian, MN). Fatty acids present in the extract were
expressed as mg/g and as a weight percent. Fat content in the samples was estimated assuming
equal response to the internal standard when analyzed by GC-FID.

101031 Solid Phase Extraction-PL fractions were separated from the crude lipid by solid phase
extraction (SPE) using 2 g aminopropyl cartridges (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden) placed in a Vac
Elut apparatus (Varian Inc, Palo Alto, USA). The cartridge was conditioned with 15 mL of
hexane, and ~60 mg of each sample was dissolved in I mL CHCl 3 and applied to the cartridge.
The column was washed with 15 mL of 2:1 CHCI3 :isopropyl alcohol to elute all the neutral
lipids, which was discarded. The fatty acids were then eluted with 15 mL of 2% acetic acid
(HOAc) in ether, which was discarded. The PL portion was eluted with 15 mL of 6:1
Methanol:Chloroform, which was collected, dried under nitrogen, and weighed.
[01041 Flash Chromatography- Flash chromatography was used to separate the lipid classes
present in the crude oil. Approximately 200 mg of crude oil dissolved in hexane was injected
onto the head of the column. The chromatography system utilized Silica Gel 60 (EMD
Chemical, Gibbstown, NJ) with mobile phase composed of Petroleum Ether and Ethyl Acetate at
5 mL/min (Tables 6-7) or 3 mL/min (Tables 8-13). A step gradient was used to selectively elute
each lipid class from the column. The mobile phase gradient started from 100% petroleum ether
and finished with 50% ethyl acetate. Fractions were collected in 10 mL test tubes using a Gilson
FC 204 large-bed fraction collector (Gilson, Inc., Middleton, WI). Each tube was analyzed by
thin layer chromatography (TLC) and the tubes containing individual lipid classes (as judged by
single spots on TLC plate with expected retention factor (Rf)) were pooled, concentrated to
dryness, and weighed. The total fraction content was then determined gravimetrically.
[01051 TLC Analysis - Thin layer chromatography was conducted on silica gel plates. The plates
were eluted using a solvent system consisting of petroleum ether:ethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1)
and were visualized using iodine vapor. The Rf values of each spot were then compared with
reported literature values for each lipid class.

101061 Analysis of TAG and PLfractions- The isolated TAG and PL fractions were analyzed
for fatty acid composition as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). The TAG fractions were
dissolved in hexane to give a concentration of approximately 1-2 mg/mL. I mL aliquots of the
solutions were concentrated to dryness under nitrogen. Toluene, containing internal standard,
and 1.5 N HCI in methanol was added to each tube. The tubes were vortexed, then capped and
heated to .1000 C for 2 hours. Internal standard and HCl methanol were added directly to the
tubes containing the PL fraction and heated. The tubes were allowed to cool, and saturated NaCl
in water was added. The tubes were vortexed again and centrifuged to allow the layers to
separate. A portion of the organic layer was then placed in a GC vial and analyzed by GC-FID.
FAMEs were quantified using a 3-point calibration curve generated using Nu-Check-Prep GLC
502B Reference Standard (NuCheck, Elysian, MN). Fatty acids present in the extract were
expressed as mg/g and as a % of FAME.
 [90]    PTA-10208 Sample #1. The fatty acid profile of the biomass and extracted crude lipid
for PTA-10208 Sample #1 was determined using GC/FID. FAs in the biomass were
transesterified in situ by weighing 28.6 mg of biomass directly into a FAME tube, while a
sample of the extracted crude lipid was prepared by weighing 55.0 mg of crude lipid into a 50
mL volumetric flask and transferring 1 ml to a separate FAME tube. The estimated crude lipid
content of the biomass was determined to be 53.2% (as SUM of FAME) using GC with FID
detection, while 52.0% (wt/wt) lipid was extracted from the dry biomass, giving a 97.8%
recovery of total lipid. The crude lipid was determined to be 91.9% fatty acids (as SUM of
FAME) using GC/FID. The major fatty acids contained in the crude lipid were C16:0 (182.5
mg/g), C20:5 n-3 (186.8 mg/g), and C22:6 n-3 (423.1 mg/g).
 [0107] The lipid class profile of the extracted crude lipid was determined by weighing 55.0 mg
of crude lipid into a 50 mL volumetric flask and transferring an aliquot into an HPLC vial for
HPLC/ELSD/MS analysis. According to the HPLC/ELSD/MS analysis, the crude lipid contained
0.2% sterol esters (SE), 95.1% TAG, 0.4% sterols, and 0.5% 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG).       5% of
the TAG fraction included a peak that eluted directly after the TAG peak, but did not give a
recognizable mass spectrum.
 [01081 Isolated TAG from this sample as determined by flash chromatography made up
approximately 92.4% of the crude oil. PL was not detected by weight or TLC after SPE

for PTA-10208 Sample #2 was determined using GC/FID. FAs in the biomass were
transesterified in situ by weighing 32.0 mg of biomass directly into a FAME tube, while a
sample of the extracted crude lipid was prepared by weighing 60.1 mg of crude lipid into a 50
mL volumetric flask and transferring I ml to a separate FAME tube. The estimated crude lipid
content of the biomass was determined to be 52.4% (as SUM of FAME) using GC with FID
detection, while 48.0% (wt/wt) lipid was extracted from the dry biomass, giving a 91.7%
recovery of total lipid. The crude lipid was determined to be 95.3% fatty acids (as SUM of
FAME) using GC/FID. The major fatty acids contained in the crude lipid were C16:0 (217.5
mg/g), C20:5 n-3 (169.3 mg/g), and C22:6 n-3 (444.1 mg/g).
 101091 The lipid class profile of the extracted crude lipid was determined by weighing 60.1 mg
of crude lipid into a 50 mL volumetric flask and transferring an aliquot into an HPLC vial for
HPLC/ELSD/MS analysis. According to the HPLC/ELSD/MS analysis, the crude lipid contained
0.2% SE, 95.7% TAG, 0.3% sterols, and 0.7% 1,2-DAG. 5.1% of the TAG fraction included a
peak that eluted directly after the TAG peak, but did not give a recognizable mass spectrum.
 [01101 Isolated TAG from this sample made up approximately 93.9% of the crude oil. PL was
not detected by weight or TLC after SPE isolation. The major fatty acids (>50mg/g) contained
 in the TAG were C16:0 (218 mg/g), C20:5 n-3 (167 mg/g) and C22:6 n-3 (430 mg/g).
 [92]     PTA-10208 Sample #3. A sample of crude oil from the microorganism deposited under
ATCC Accession No. PTA-10208 (Sample PTA-10208 #3) was analyzed using
HPLC/ELSD/MS. A total of 98.38% of lipids were recovered, with the sterol ester (SE) fraction
accounting for 0.32%, the TAG fraction accounting for 96.13%, the 1,3-diacylglycerol (DAG)
fraction accounting for 0.22%, the 1,2-DAG fraction accounting for 0.78%, and the sterol
fraction accounting for 0.93%.

oils according to examples 4 and 5 were compared. The results of this comparison are set forth
in Table 15.
[96]    The potency was obtained via the following protocol AOCS Ce I b-89(modified). The
marine/fishy aroma (smell) and marine/fishy aromatics (taste) sensory values were determined
according to the method as described in Sensory Evaluation Techniques, Meilgaard et al., CRC
Press;4 edition (December 13, 2006). A panel of 8 - 18 experienced people tasted and/or
smelled a sample of the final oils according to examples 4 and 5. Each of these people
determined the value of the sample. Afterwards all the values were averaged arithmetically and
the result was rounded up or down to the next number. A value of> 1.5 fishy/marine aroma and
> 2.5 fishy/marine aromatics is expected to be perceivable by the general population.

rancimat apparatus operated at 90 0 C, with airflow set at 10 L/hour (AOCS Cd 12b-92). The
potency was obtained via the following protocol AOCS Ce Ib-89(modified). The marine/fishy
aroma (smell) and marine/fishy aromatics (taste) sensory values were determined according to
the method as described in Sensory Evaluation Techniques, Meilgaard et al., CRC Press; 4
edition (December 13, 2006). A panel of 8 - 18 experienced people tasted and/or smelled a
sample a sample of the final oils according to examples 7a-m and 8a-g. Each of these people
determined the value of the sample. Afterwards all the values were averaged arithmetically and
the result was rounded up or down to the next number. A value of > 1.5 fishy/marine aroma and
> 2.5 fishy/marine aromatics is expected to be perceivable by the general population.
