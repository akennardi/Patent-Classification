15 Background
   Multiple            Sclerosis             (MS)      is     a    neurological                disease        affecting         more
   than       1 million             people          worldwide.              It     is    the most           common        cause    of
   neurological                disability in young and middle-aged adults and has a
   major         physical,             psychological,                     social         and      financial            impact     on
20 subjects            and      their         families,             friends           and     bodies        responsible          for
   health care               (EMEA Guideline, 2006).
   It     is      generally              assumed           that        MS      is      mediated          by     some       kind    of
   autoimmune                 process               possibly                triggered              by        infection           and
   superimposed                  upon        a     genetic            predisposition.                   It     is      a    chronic
25 inflammatory                 condition             that         damages           the      myelin        of     the      Central
   Nervous           System         (CNS)      .   The     pathogenesis                 of MS       is    characterized           by
   the       infiltration                 of      autoreactive                 T-cells           from      the      circulation
   directed            against          myelin          antigens            into       the      CNS      (Bjartmar,           2002).
   In    addition             to     the      inflammatory                 phase       in     MS,     axonal        loss      occurs
30 early         in      the      course          of     the        disease           and      can     be    extensive          over
   time,          leading            to      the        subsequent                development              of     progressive,
   permanent,                  neurologic                 impairment                  and,         frequently,                severe
   disability              (Neuhaus,             2003) .        Symptoms            associated            with      the     disease
   include           fatigue,           spasticity,                ataxia,          weakness,           bladder         and bowel
35 disturbances,                    sexual           dysfunction,                     pain,         tremor,           paroxysmal

            cognitive dysfunction (EMEA Guideline, 2006).
            MS disease activity can be monitored by cranial scans, including
            magnetic    resonance      imaging      (MRI)    of   the brain,      accumulation       of
         5  disability,      as    well    as    rate     and    severity      of    relapses.      The
            diagnosis    of clinically        definite       MS as determined          by the     Poser
            criteria    (Poser,     1983)   requires at least           two neurological         events
            suggesting     demyelination        in    the    CNS    separated     in    time    and  in
            location.     A    clinically      isolated       syndrome       (CIS)     is   a    single
       10   monosymptomatic       attack suggestive of MS,             such as optic neuritis,
            brain stem symptoms, and partial myelitis. Patients with CIS that
            experience     a second clinical           attack are generally           considered to
            have   clinically       definite       multiple      sclerosis       (CDMS).      Over   80
            percent    of patients with a CIS and MRI lesion                    go on to develop
       15   MS,   while   approximately       20 percent        have a      self-limited       process
             (Brex, 2002; Frohman, 2003).
            Various   MS disease stages and/or types are described in                         Multiple
            Sclerosis     Therapeutics        (Duntiz,       1999).      Among    them,     relapsing
            remitting multiple         sclerosis       (RRMS)    is   the most      common     form at
       20   the time of      initial diagnosis.           Many subjects        with RRMS have        an
            initial    relapsing-remitting           course     for    5-15   years,      which    then
            advances into the secondary progressive MS (SPMS) disease course.
            Relapses     result      from   inflammation         and     demyelination,        whereas
            restoration     of nerve conduction and remission is                     accompanied     by
       25   resolution     of inflammation,         redistribution of sodium channels on
            demyelinated axons and remyelination                   (Neuhaus,    2003; Noseworthy,
            2000).
             In  April   2001,     an  international         panel    in   association with         the
            National    MS   Society of       America      recommended       diagnostic       criteria
       30    for  multiple       sclerosis.      These      criteria      became     known     as   the
            McDonald     Criteria.       The    McDonald        Criteria      make      use    of   MRI
            techniques and are intended to replace the Poser Criteria and the
            older Schumacher Criteria (McDonald, 2001). The McDonald Criteria
            was   revised     in   March    2005     by   an   international        panel     (Polman,
       35    2005) and updated again in 2010              (Polman, 2010).

            of    MS   is    suggested        to     reduce       and/or     prevent       accumulating
            neurodegeneration         (Hohlfeld,        2000;     De Stefano,       1999).      There     are
            currently a number of disease-modifying medications                            approved for
        5   use   in  relapsing MS          (RMS),      which     includes     RRMS     and     SPMS    (The
            Disease Modifying Drug Brochure,                  2006).     These include interferon
            beta 1-a      (Avonex@ and Rebif@),            interferon beta 1-b (Betaseron@),
            glatiramer       acetate        (Copaxone@),           mitoxantrone          (Novantrone@),
            natalizumab       (Tysabri@)      and     Fingolimod        (Gilenya@).       Most     of   them
       10   are    believed       to    act    as      immunomodulators.           Mitoxantrone          and
            natalizumab are believed to act as immunesuppressants.                                 However,
            the    mechanisms        of    action       of     each      have    been      only      partly
            elucidated.      Immunosuppressants            or    cytotoxic      agents     are used         in
            some   subjects      after    failure of conventional               therapies.         However,
       15   the relationship between changes                  of the      immune response           induced
            by   these agents        and    the    clinical       efficacy      in    MS   is     far   from
            settled (EMEA Guideline, 2006).
            Other therapeutic approaches                include symptomatic treatment which
            refers to all therapies applied to improve the symptoms caused by
       20   the    disease       (EMEA   Guideline,         2006)       and    treatment         of   acute
            relapses with corticosteroids.                 While     steroids do not affect              the
            course of MS over time, they can reduce the duration and severity
            of attacks in some subjects.

            decreases in new gadolinium enhancing lesions, Tl and T2 lesions,

             (Kappos et al., 2008).
            The mechanisms          of the action of DMF are not fully known.                             DMF can
       15   suppress NF-xB (nuclear factor KB)-dependent transcription (Stoof
            et  al.,    2001; Gerdes           et al.,      2007),       thus     accounting       for    some   of
            its    anti-inflammatory             effects.      DMF      can     also     activate       the   Nrf2
             (nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45 subunit-related factor 2) pathway
             (Lukashev    et    al.,      2007;    Kappos     et al.,         2008),      which     induces    the
       20   transcription         of     various       genes,       including         anti-oxidative         ones,
            reduces     oxidative           neuronal        death       and     helps        maintain      myelin

            Laquinimod
            Laquinimod     is     a     novel          synthetic           compound        with       high         oral
            bioavailability       which has been suggested as an oral                                formulation
         5  for   the   treatment        of      Multiple         Sclerosis           (MS)     (Polman,          2005;
            Sandberg-Wollheim, 2005).               Laquinimod and its sodium salt form are
            described,     for      example,           in    U.S.        Patent       No.     6,077,851.            The
            mechanism of action of laquinimod is not fully understood. Animal
            studies   show it       causes       a Thl        (T helper          1    cell,    which produces

            inflammatory      profile         (Yang,       2004;       Bruick,       2011) . Another             study
            demonstrated       (mainly         via      the      NFkB       pathway)        that        laquinimod
            induced suppression of genes related to antigen presentation and

            Combination Therapy
            The administration of two drugs to treat a given condition,                                            such
            as multiple    sclerosis,          raises       a number         of potential problems.                  In
            vivo  interactions         between        two drugs          are complex.          The    effects        of
       25   any single    drug are related               to its       absorption,         distribution,             and
            elimination.     When      two drugs          are introduced into                 the     body,        each
            drug  can affect      the absorption,               distribution,            and elimination of
            the   other   and      hence,        alter        the      effects         of   the      other.         For
            instance, one drug may inhibit, activate or induce the production
       30   of enzymes    involved         in    a metabolic            route of elimination of                     the
            other   drug     (Guidance           for      Industry,           1999).      In     one        example,
            combined    administration             of     GA     and      interferon         (IFN)        has      been

            either    therapy.         (Brod      2000)        In     another         experiment,            it     was

            with IFN-0       antagonized        its up-regulator           effect.      Thus,      when     two
            drugs     are    administered         to     treat      the   same      condition,          it   is
            unpredictable whether each will complement, have no effect on, or
            interfere with,         the therapeutic activity of the other in                          a human
        5   subject.
            Not    only    may     the     interaction          between     two     drugs      affect       the
            intended therapeutic            activity of each drug,               but the interaction
            may    increase      the      levels     of      toxic     metabolites         (Guidance        for
            Industry,      1999).    The interaction may also heighten or lessen the
       10   side    effects     of    each     drug.     Hence,      upon    administration            of   two
            drugs    to   treat     a disease,       it     is   unpredictable        what change will
            occur in     the negative side profile of each drug.                        In   one example,
            the combination of natalizumab and interferon                            p-la was observed
            to   increase      the    risk of      unanticipated          side     effects.        (Vollmer,

            Additionally,        it    is    difficult         to   accurately       predict       when     the
            effects     of    the    interaction        between       the   two     drugs     will      become
            manifest.      For   example,       metabolic        interactions       between       drugs     may
       20   become     apparent      upon     the   initial        administration         of    the     second

       15   Disclosed     is    a   method     for     treating      a    subject,      e.g.,      human
            patient,    afflicted        with    multiple        sclerosis,        e.g.,     relapsing
            multiple    sclerosis      or presenting         CIS using laquinimod with DMF
            which    provides     a   more    efficacious         treatment       than    each     agent
            alone.    The    use   of   laquinimod        for   multiple      sclerosis       had   been
       20   previously       suggested      in,    e.g.,       U.S.     Patent      No.    6,077,851.
            However,      the     inventors      have       surprisingly         found       that    the
            combination      of laquinimod and DMF is              particularly       effective      for
            the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis as compared to each
            agent alone.
       25   Terms
            As   used    herein,      and    unless       stated     otherwise,       each      of   the
            following terms shall have the definition set forth below.
            As    used    herein,      "laquinimod"         means      laquinimod       acid      or     a
            pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
       30   As  used   herein,     "dimethyl     fumarate"       or   "DMF",     unless    otherwise,
            specified       means     dimethyl        fumarate        or     a     pharmaceutically
            acceptable salt thereof.

            A "salt thereof"        is     a salt of         the instant      compounds which have
            been modified by making acid or base salts of the compounds.                                The
            term   "pharmaceutically           acceptable        salt"   in   this respect,         refers
            to the relatively non-toxic,                 inorganic and organic acid or base
        5   addition     salts    of       compounds        of     the   present       invention.       For
            example,    one    means      of    preparing       such a     salt    is   by    treating     a
            compound of the present invention with an inorganic base.
            As used herein,       an "amount"           or    "dose" of laquinimod as measured
            in milligrams refers to the milligrams of laquinimod acid present
       10   in  a preparation,         regardless         of the form of          the preparation.         A
            "dose of 0.6 mg laquinimod" means                     the amount      of laquinimod acid
            in   a   preparation        is     0.6    mg,     regardless      of    the   form     of   the
            preparation.       Thus, when in the form of a salt, e.g. a laquinimod
            sodium salt,      the weight of the salt form necessary                       to provide a
       15   dose of 0.6       mg laquinimod would be greater                     than 0.6      mg    (e.g.,
            0.64    mg)   due    to      the     presence       of    the    additional        salt    ion.
            Similarly,     "amount"        or   "dose"      of DMF as measured           in    milligrams
            refers    to    the   milligrams           of     DMF   present      in    a   preparation,
            regardless of the form of the preparation.
       20   As   used herein,     "about"         in   the context       of a     numerical      value   or
            range    means    ±10% of         the    numerical       value    or    range     recited    or
            claimed.
            As used herein, "combination" means an assemblage of reagents for
            use    in    therapy       either         by    simultaneous         or    contemporaneous
       25   administration.            Simultaneous              administration            refers        to
            administration       of      an     admixture         (whether     a     true    mixture,      a
            suspension,      an  emulsion          or   other      physical    combination)        of   the
             laquinimod and the DMF.             In   this case,      the combination may be the
            admixture     or   separate        containers       of   the   laquinimod       and   the   DMF
       30    that  are   combined      just      prior     to   administration.        Contemporaneous
            administration       refers         to    the     separate     administration          of   the
             laquinimod and the DMF at the same time, or at times sufficiently
             close together that a synergistic activity or an activity that                               is
             additive or more than additive relative to the activity of either
       35    the laquinimod or the DMF alone is observed.

             "Administration"         means      the     giving        of,    dispensing        of,     or
            application      of   medicines,       drugs,     or     remedies     to    a   subject     to
             relieve or cure a pathological               condition.       Oral administration is
            one way of administering the instant compounds to the subject.
         5  As used herein,       "add-on" or "add-on therapy" means an assemblage
            of reagents for use in therapy, wherein the subject receiving the
             therapy begins a first           treatment regimen of one or more reagents
            prior    to  beginning       a   second    treatment         regimen    of    one   or more
            different reagents in addition to the first treatment regimen, so
       10    that not all of the reagents used in                   the therapy are started at
             the   same   time.     For     example,      adding       laquinimod      therapy      to   a
            patient already receiving DMF therapy.
            As   used    herein,       "effective"      when     referring       to    an    amount     of
             laquinimod and/or DMF refers to the quantity of laquinimod and/or
       15   DMF   that is     sufficient       to yield a desired             therapeutic      response
            without undue adverse side effects                (such as toxicity, irritation,
            or allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk
            ratio when used in the manner of this invention.

            emulsion at a volume of 0.2 ml/mouse in                       the right flank. On the
            day of     induction,       pertussis        toxin    is   injected       i.p.     at   a  volume
            dose    of 0.2      ml/mouse.       The     injection of       the pertussis            toxin    is
            repeated after 48 hours.

            The objective of this study was to assess the effect of combining
            laquinimod      and DMF       treatments      in     MOG induced         EAE.     The C57BL/6
            strain     of mouse was       selected,     as    it   is   an established chronic               EAE
       10   model     to   test   for    the    efficacy       of    candidate       molecules        for    the
            treatment of MS.
            materials and Methods
            Disease      was    induced       in   all     mice       by     the     injection        of     the
            encephalitogenic emulsion (MOG/CFA). The test articles and vehicle
       15   were dosed daily via gavage              from      Day    1 until      Day 30     (termination
            of study).

            Healthy,      nulliparous,        non-pregnant          female      mice    of    the      C57BL/6
            Strain were used. The animals weighed 17-20 g on arrival, and were
       25   approximately       11   weeks    of age     at the       time of      induction.       The body
            weights      of  the     animals     were    recorded        on    the    day   of     delivery.
            Overtly healthy animals were assigned                     to   study groups        arbitrarily
            before treatment commenced.
            The    mice   were    individually       identified          by   markings      on    the      body.
       30   Information including cage number, group number and identification
            were     provided     in    a    color-coded         card     on    each    cage.      The      test

            Experimental Observations
            Morbidity and Mortality:
       15   All     animals     were    examined      once     daily     to   detect     if    any   are
            moribund.       Mice were weighed once weekly.
            EAZ Clinical Signs:
            The mice       were   observed daily       from    the   81h day post       EAE-induction
            and EAE clinical signs were scored.                    The scores were recorded on
       20   observation       cards    according     to    the   grades     described     in    Table    3
            shown above.
            All mice with score 1 and above were considered                        sick.       When the
            first     clinical     sign appears      all mice were given             food soaked       in
            water,    which was spread        on different        places    on the bedding of        the
       25   cages.     For calculation       purposes,       the score of        animals that were
            sacrificed or died was carried forward.
            Interpretation of Results:
            Same as in Experiment 1A.
