10 Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller arranged to implement plural game
   instances in different display areas on one or more
15 displays of the gaming system. The game instances each
   involve selecting symbols for display at an array of
   display positions. The selected symbols can include a
   replicating symbol. If the replicating symbol occurs at a
   display position of one of the display areas that
20 satisfies one or more adjacency criteria with respect to a
   corresponding display position of another one of the
   display areas, the symbol is replicated at the
   corresponding display position. The replicated symbol then
   forms part of an award evaluation, in the current game
25 round and/or in a subsequent game round.
   General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
30 a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
35 wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
                                              10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 11
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
 5 such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
10 receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
15 and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.   For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
20 and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
25 components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
30 instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
35 credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
                                             10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

                               - 12
   enable a player to input game play instructions           (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
 5 player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
10 Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
15  (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs  (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
20 to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
   integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).
25
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
30 by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
35 chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
                                               10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
 5 shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.    The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
10 reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
15 the player marketing module.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
20 artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
25 The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
30 electromechanical device.    The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
   type.

   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
 5 processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
10 memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
15 communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
20 devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.          Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
25 In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
30 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
35 screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
                                               10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 15
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
 5 devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
10 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
15 controller, central controller, server or database.                   In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
20 communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.             The RAM
25 103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.             The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
30 integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
35 gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.

   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
 5 Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
10 simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
15 One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,

   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
25 202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
30 and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.      A loyalty
35 program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
                                              10393606 1 (GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
 5 gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
10 that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are

   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
20 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
25 The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
30 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
35 separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
                                              10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

   Further detail of gaming system
   The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
10 a wager and hence win entitlements which will be evaluated
   for this play of the game and initiates a play of the
   game. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a
   player's win entitlement will vary from game to game
   dependent on player selections. In most spinning reel
15 games, it is typical for the player's entitlement to be
   affected by the amount they wager and selections they make
    (i.e. the nature of the wager) . For example,      a player's
   win entitlement may be based on how many lines they play
   in each game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the
20 maximum number of lines allowed by the game (noting that
   not all permutations of win lines may be available for
   selection) and how much they wager per line.          Such win
   lines are typically formed by a combination of symbol
   display positions, one from each reel, the symbol display
25 positions being located relative to one another such that
   they form a line.
   In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
   strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
30 example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   players selection of pay lines and are an inherent part of
   the win entitlement.
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
35 embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement by
   selecting a number of reels to play and an amount to wager
   per reel. Such games are marketed under the trade name
                                               10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

   "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd. The
   selection of the reel means that each displayed symbol of
   the reel can be substituted for a symbol at one or more
   designated display positions. In other words, all symbols
 5 displayed at symbol display positions corresponding to a
   selected reel can be used to form symbol combinations with
   symbols displayed at a designated, symbol display
   positions of the other reels.  For example,   if      there are
   five reels and three symbol display positions for each
10 reel such that the symbol display positions comprise three
   rows of five symbol display positions, the symbols
   displayed in the centre row are used for non-selected
   reels. The total number of ways to win is determined by
   multiplying the number of active display positions of each
15 reels, the active display positions being all display
   positions of each selected reel and the designated display
   position of the non-selected reels. As a result for five
   reels and fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to
   win.

   In other embodiments a player win entitlement may be
   affected by purchasing access to particular pay tables
   e.g. a first bet amount entitles the player to wins
   including cherry symbols and a second amount entitles them
25 to wins including plum symbols.
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
   code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
30 art will appreciate that various of the modules could be
   implemented in some other way, for example by a dedicated
   circuit.
   In the embodiment, a play controller 624 operates in
35 response to the player's operation of game play mechanism
   56 to place a wager and initiate a play of the game to
   control play of the game based on game rules 642 in memory
                                               10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 20
   64 until the play of the game is completed. In this
   embodiment, game play comprises a base game which is
   carried out each time the player makes a wager, typically
   irrespective of the wager, and a feature game that will
 5 only be carried out occasionally, in this if a trigger
   event occurs (or a trigger condition is met).      The trigger
   event may be, a symbol combination in the game, occurrence
   of a specific symbol in the game, purchased, be caused by
   another connected system, be based on turnover, be based
10 on a random evaluation, etc.
   It will be appreciated that in some embodiments the plural
   display area feature game described below could be
   provided on its own without play of a base game. For
15 example, the player may be able to play it in response to
   a specific wager being made.
   To implement the base game, the play controller 624
   controls the symbol determiner 622 to determine a set of
20 symbols for display on display 54. In the base game,
   symbols are selected for each display position in an array
   of display positions. In the embodiment, the array has a
   number of rows and columns with the columns corresponding
   to spinning reels. Dimensions of the array may be, for
25 example, five columns of three symbols each or three
   columns of threes symbols. The symbol selector 622A
   selects symbols from a set of symbols specified by symbol
   data 641 using random number generator 621. The selected
   symbols are advised to the display controller 624 which
30 causes them to be displayed on display 54 at a set of
   display positions.
   As indicated above, in the embodiment, the symbol selector
   622A selects symbols for display from a plurality of
35 symbol sets corresponding to respective ones of a
   plurality of spinning reels. The symbol sets 641 can
   specify a sequence of symbols for each reel such that the
                                             10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 21
   symbol selector 622A can select all of the symbols by
   selecting a stopping position in the sequence. In one
   example, three symbols of each of five reels may be
   displayed such that symbols are displayed at fifteen
 5 display positions on display 54. It is known to use a
   probability table stored in memory 64 to vary the odds of
   a particular stop position being selected. Other
   techniques can be used to control the odds of particular
   outcomes occurring to thereby control the return to player
10 of the game.
   After the symbols are selected, they are evaluated by the
   symbol evaluator 623 which compares the symbols at the
   positions against the set of winning outcomes defined in
15 base pay table 645 of pay table data 644.    The base pay
   table 645 defines various winning combinations of symbols
   such as three of a kind, four of a kind or five of a kind
   of a particular symbol.  The symbol evaluator 623 also
   incorporates a trigger monitor 623b which monitors the
20 selected symbols to determine whether a trigger condition
   643 specified in game rules 642 is met.   In one example,
   the trigger condition is the occurrence of three, four, or
   five scatter symbols in the selected symbols displayed on
   display 54.  In one embodiment, the different numbers of
25 scatter symbols correspond to different numbers of game
   rounds of a feature game that will be conducted as part of
   the play of a game.  For example, 10, 15 and 20 five game
   rounds.  Upon the trigger condition 643 occurring in any
   base game round, play controller 624 controls the game to
30 carry out each of the game rounds awarded in accordance
   with game rules 642.
   Initially, play controller 624 causes display controller
   625 to modify the display 54 so that instead of a display
35 of one set of reels there are four sets of reels             (i.e.
   four separate game instances) displayed in respective ones
   of four display areas 54A to 54D.  Play controller 624
                                              10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

                               - 22
   then controls symbol determiner 622 to determine symbols
   for display at each of the display areas 54A to 54D.                     In
   the embodiment, each of the display areas 54A to 54D
   initially displays an array of display positions
 5 corresponding to what was displayed on the display when
   the trigger condition was met (i.e. the result of the base
   game).  New symbols are then determined for each of the
   display positions based on the same symbol data, that is,
   the same reels, used in the base game.   Persons skilled in
10 the art will appreciate that in other embodiments, the
   reels may be modified for the feature game or different
   reels may be used in the feature game.   Further, while at
   least the replicating symbol needs to be able to
   participate in winning outcomes in all games, the symbols
15 of each game instance need not necessarily be the same.
   In this embodiment, the symbols of each of the four game
   instances are the same.   The symbol determiner 622 is
   arranged such that in a first game round of the plurality
   of free game rounds conducted under control of the play
20 controller 624,  symbols are selected for display at each
   of the display positions of each of the display areas 54A
   to 54D.
   Figure 8A, shows an example of such a display.           From
25 Figure 8A it will be apparent that the player is displayed
   information about game play on two separate screens 810A
   and 820A which form part of the display 54.        The top
   screen 810A displays the value of a minor jackpot 816 and
   the value of a mini jackpot 817.   It also displays
30 different award amounts which may be awarded in addition
   to awards for winning outcomes.   In particular, it
   displays that a ten dollar prize is awarded when five WILD
   symbols are collected during the feature game, a fifty
   dollar prize is awarded when seven WILD symbols are
35 collected 822, a five hundred dollar prize is awarded when
   fifteen WILD symbols are collected 813 and a one hundred
   dollar prize is awarded when ten WILD symbols are
                                              10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

                               - 23
   collected 814.
   As indicated above, there are four sets of reels displayed
   in respective one of display areas 54A to 54D.          Among the
 5 symbol selected in these display areas are four
   replicating symbols in the form of tree symbol 821, 823,
   822 and 824.   The tree symbol also acts as a WILD symbol
   in that is substitutes for all other symbols in winning
   combinations and will replicate between the display areas
10 54A to 54D upon one or more adjacency criteria being met.
   In the embodiment, each replicating symbol which is either
   the basis for other symbols being replicated or results
   from a replication is held in place in future game rounds.
15 In this respect, in this embodiment, the symbols are
   replicated before game outcomes are evaluated.           For this
   purpose, the symbol determiner 622 includes a symbol
   replicator 622B that has a criterion checker 622C for
   determining whether the symbols satisfy an adjacency
20 criterion.
   In the embodiment, the adjacency criterion is that the
   replicating symbol is positioned at an edge of its own
   array of symbols that is also proximate an edge of an
25 array of symbols in one or the other display areas.
   Accordingly, in the example shown in figure 8A, symbols
   821 and 824 are arranged in the middle of the array and
   hence not along an edge that is proximate the edge of
   another array and accordingly, they will not be replicated
30 as they fail to satisfy the adjacency criterion.               Symbol
   822 is position on an edge but this edge is not shared
   with any of the other arrays and hence it also doesn't
   satisfy the adjacency criterion.   Symbol 823 which is in
   display area 54A is positioned where display area 54A (and
35 hence the array of symbols) shares an edge with each of
   display area 54B and display area 54C and hence is
   replicated into each of these display areas by symbol
                                              10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 24
   replicator.  As a consequence of the replication of tree
   symbol 823 into areas 54B and 54C, there is a further
   replication into area 54D as described in more detail
   below.
 5
   Once the symbol replication is complete, the displayed
   symbols are then evaluated by the symbol evaluator 623.
   The symbol evaluator evaluates them based on the feature
   game pay table 646 which may be the same of different to
10 the base game pay table 644.   For example, the feature
   game pay table may include an additional entry
   corresponding to what occurs when all WILD symbols are
   displayed along a single pay line.   As part of the
   evaluation, the symbol evaluator 623 also includes a WILD
15 total tracker 623a which updates the total of WILDs (i.e.
   tree symbols) that have occurred. In the embodiment, only
   WILD symbols that are held in future game rounds are added
   to the WILD total.  In other embodiments all WILD symbols
   may be added to the total irrespective of whether they are
20 held. In other embodiments all WILD symbols may be held,
   Referring to figure 8B, it can be seen that symbol 823 has
   been replicated based on the adjacency rules so as to
   result in display of symbols 825 and 826   (noting that the
25 remainder of the reels have been re-spun in screen display
   820B).  As indicated above, a further tree symbol 827
   results as a consequence of replicating symbols 826 and
   825 being added to display positions that satisfies an
   adjacency criterion with respect to the position at which
30 symbol at which symbol 827 is displayed. While this
   embodiment, advantageously shows the replicating symbol
   spreading, it will be appreciated that in other
   embodiments, an additional adjacency criterion could have
   been specified so that the symbol 823 directly caused the
35 appearance of tree symbol 827 instead of via the indirect
   path described above.
                                               10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

   Figure 8B shows a current total 840A of WILDs that have
   been collected that will be held in further game rounds
   and that the current total is four.
 5 It will also be appreciated that a graphic of fire 830 is
   added to the edge to graphically indicate adjacency
   criterion, i.e. the display positions at which replication
   of symbols may occur.
10 Figure 8C shows updated screen displays 810C and 820C
   after a further subsequent game round.   In this respect,
   it will be appreciated that the symbol determiner 622 does
   not select symbols for all display positions once certain
   symbols are held in place.   In this respect, the symbol
15 determiner 622 includes held symbols 622D that indicates
   which symbol positions are already occupied by a WILD
   symbol and the symbol selector 622A is controlled to
   operate in subsequent game rounds to only select symbols
   at those display positions that are not occupied by a held
20 WILD symbol.  To achieve this, the symbol selector 622A
   selects symbols randomly from the reels in the same manner
   described above but does not display the symbol that would
   have been displayed at the position occupied by the
   replicating symbol. In screen display 820C, it will be
25 apparent that additional tree symbols have occurred at
   display positions 851 and 852.   Screen display 820C also
   shows an animation of fire spreading from symbol 853 to
   symbol 854 as indicated by fire trail 860.      Further, it
   will be seen that the total 840B of WILDs has been
30 increased to eight as a result of this play.         In this
   respect, it will be appreciated that in this embodiment,
   WILD symbol 855 does not participate in the total number
   of WILDs because it has not taken part in a replication.
35 As a result of the wild total reaching 8, two prizes are
   awarded for the collection of WILDs. Figure 8C shows the
   prizes for collecting five WILDs is graphically being made
                                              10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

   Subsequent to this animation completing, sack of coins
   812A will be shown as being poured into money sack 815A.
 5 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that game play
   continues until the game play controller determines that
   the set of game rounds of the feature game has finished.
   All wins are accumulated in win meter which forms part of
   meters 648 and are transferred to the credit meter when
10 the player decides to initiate another play of the game or
   cashes out.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there may
   be a number of variations on the above embodiment. For
15 example, rather than two jackpots, three or four jackpot
   bonuses may be displayed. These jackpot prizes may be
   awarded dependent on the number of WILDs collected in the
   game.  That is, the jackpot awards 816 and 817 shown in
   figures 8A to 8C could be awarded for different number of
20 WILDs collected such as 20 and 25 WILDs respectively.
   These jackpot awards can also be shown as being awarded by
   an animation of coins being poured into the money bag
   815A.
25 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that while in
   the above embodiment, the WILD symbols stay in play all
   the time provided they have participated in a replication
   event, in other embodiment, WILD symbols could only
   participate in a current game.  In another variation, all
30 WILD symbols can be held in position irrespective of
   whether they are involved in a replication or not.
   Further, in the above embodiment, the symbol evaluation is
   performed after the WILD symbols have been replicated.                       In
35 other embodiments, the symbol evaluation could be
   performed before the symbols are replicated such that they
   participate in a symbol evaluation only in a subsequent
                                             10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 27
   game round after fresh symbols have been selected at all
   of the other symbol positions.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there can
 5 be other variations to the prize awarding. For example, in
   other embodiments, a single prize may be awarded to the
   player that depends on the number of WILD symbols they
   have collected at the end of the feature game.
10 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, not all of the display areas 54A-D may be
   active to begin with.  For example, initially only one
   area might be active and then subsequently other areas may
   be activated upon a condition being met. In one example,
15 they may be activated only when a replicating symbol is
   replicated into the display area.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that other
   embodiments are feasible.   Figure 9 shows one such example
20 where there are five arrays with four satellite arrays
   920, 930, 940 and 950 arranged around a central array 910
   on a display 900.
   In this embodiment, it will be appreciated that the
25 central array 910 has a greater capacity to be involved in
   the replication of WILD symbols.   In one example, the
   central display area operates in the same manner as
   described in relation to figure 8 but has a greater
   capacity to generate winning outcomes because of its
30 ability to receive more replicating WILD symbols then the
   other display areas.  This is shown by the shading of the
   display positions of the embodiment of figure 9 that
   satisfy the adjacency criterion.
35 In another embodiment, the symbols displayed in central
   display area 910 may be different to those in satellite
   areas 920, 930, 940 and 950.   In one example, each of the
                                              10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

                               - 28
   satellite areas is arranged to display a set of reels
   whose spinning can result in winning outcome whereas the
   central area 910 display as alternative set of reels
   designed only to donate replicating WILD symbols to the
 5 other display area.   In one such embodiment the central
   area 910 has a set of reels having a mixture of blank
   symbols and WILD symbols such that it is not involved in
   the generation of winning outcomes but can contribute to
   winning outcomes when replicating symbols are spun up and
10 are replicated to the other display areas. In one example
   of such an embodiment, satellite areas 920, 930, 940 and
   950 do not themselves generate symbols that result in
   replication of symbols such that there is a one way flow
   of replicating symbols between display areas 910 and
15 display areas 920, 930, 940 and 950.
   The embodiment of figure 9 can also involve the activation
   of the satellite areas in response to a WILD symbol
   spreading to the areas as described above.
20
   In some embodiments, an eligibility criterion may be
   applied in order for the player to obtain either the
   replicating wild feature game itself or to activate
   replication of the wild symbols. For example that the
25 player has made a certain sized wager, made an ante bet,
   selected all win lines, played sufficient games, or the
   player is a member of a loyalty program.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the
30 outcome of a game round of the feature game may be no win,
   a win  (for example from a winning combination of symbols),
   a contribution towards a win accrued over a plurality of
   game rounds  (such as the collection of wild symbols
   described above),  further game play etc. Typically, a win
35 will result in some form of award being made such as an
   award of credits. Such an award may never actually be
   physically received by a player. For example, many gaming
                                              10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 29
   systems provide a player with a double or nothing gamble
   feature, where the player can double or forfeit their
   credits before commencing another play of the game or
   cashing out. Further, as credits are fungible, once
 5 credits have been added to the credit meter it is not
   possible to distinguish between credits which exist
   because the player has input cash or the like and credits
   resulting from an award.
10 A flowchart of the method 700 of the embodiment is shown
   in figure 7. Game play begins when a game player initiates
   play 705.  A base game round is conducted 710 and it is
   determined whether a trigger event has occurred 715.                     If
   no trigger occurs, a further play needs to be initiated.
15 If a trigger occurs, the display is changed to show the
   plurality of display areas and symbols are determined 720
   for each of the sub areas.   The process of determining
   symbols 720 is shown in figure 8.   Figure 8 shows that at
   the first sub step it is determined whether there are any
20 replicating symbols from a prior game round 721. If there
   are no replicating symbols from a prior game round as will
   be the case when symbols are first selected, symbols are
   selected from all positions 722 if instead there are
   replicating symbols from a prior game round, these are
25 held in position 723 and symbols are selected for all
   other positions 724.
   Returning to Figure 7, the method then involves
   determining whether the selected symbols 725 include a
30 replicating symbol.  It is then determined whether the
   adjacency criteria are met 730. In one example, the
   embodiment, the adjacency criteria are that the display
   positions neighbour those of the corresponding other one
   of the display areas and also that there is not already a
35 replicating symbol at that position.   If the adjacency
   criterion is met, a replicating symbol is replicated 735
   at the corresponding display position in the array in the
                                              10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

                               - 30
   other display area.
   The symbols are then evaluated 740 by symbol evaluator and
   it is determined 745 whether there is an award to make
 5 750. The method continues by determining whether each of
   the game rounds of the feature game has been completed.
   In this example, by determining whether a counter has
   reached zero 755.   If the counter has not reached zero,
   the counter is adjusted 760 the method proceeds by
10 determining symbols to be displayed in the next game round
   720.   Once the counter reaches zero 755, the feature game
   ends and assuming the player does not activate a game or
   feature, all credits are transferred from the win meter to
   the credit meter.

   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
20 executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
   description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
25 sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
   may need to compute several values and compare those
30 values.
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
35 medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
    (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
                                              10393606 1(GHMatters) P89706.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 31
   server). Further different parts of the program code can
   be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
 5 instructions executable by the processor.
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
10 particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
   further embodiments.
   It is to be understood that, if any prior art is referred
15 to herein, such reference does not constitute an admission
   that the prior art forms a part of the common general
   knowledge in the art in any country.

20 description of the invention, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
   implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as
   "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
