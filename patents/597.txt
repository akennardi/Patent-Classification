                             TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         [001] The present invention relates to solid state forms, for example, crystalline and
amorphous forms, of (R)-1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-N-(1-(2,3 -dihydroxypropyl)
6-fluoro-2-(I-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-1H-indol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide,
pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and methods therewith.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
         [002] CFTR is a cAMP/ATP-mediated anion channel that is expressed in a variety of
cells types, including absorptive and secretory epithelia cells, where it regulates anion flux
across the membrane, as well as the activity of other ion channels and proteins. In epithelia
cells, normal functioning of CFTR is critical for the maintenance of electrolyte transport
throughout the body, including respiratory and digestive tissue. CFTR is composed of
approximately 1480 amino acids that encode a protein made up of a tandem repeat of
transmembrane domains, each containing six transmembrane helices and a nucleotide binding
domain. The two transmembrane domains are linked by a large, polar, regulatory (R)-domain
with multiple phosphorylation sites that regulate channel activity and cellular trafficking.
         [003] The gene encoding CFTR has been identified and sequenced (See Gregory, R. J.
et al. (1990) Nature 347:382-386; Rich, D. P. et al. (1990) Nature 347:358-362), (Riordan, J. R.
et al. (1989) Science 245:1066-1073). A defect in this gene causes mutations in CFTR resulting
in cystic fibrosis ("CF"), the most common fatal genetic disease in humans. Cystic fibrosis
affects approximately one in every 2,500 infants in the United States. Within the general United
                                                  -I-

States population, up to 10 million people carry a single copy of the defective gene without
apparent ill effects. In contrast, individuals with two copies of the CF associated gene suffer
from the debilitating and fatal effects of CF, including chronic lung disease.
         [004] In patients with cystic fibrosis, mutations in CFTR endogenously expressed in
respiratory epithelia lead to reduced apical anion secretion causing an imbalance in ion and fluid
transport. The resulting decrease in anion transport contributes to enhance mucus accumulation
in the lung and the accompanying microbial infections that ultimately cause death in CF
patients. In addition to respiratory disease, CF patients typically suffer from gastrointestinal
problems and pancreatic insufficiency that, if left untreated, results in death. In addition, the
majority of males with cystic fibrosis are infertile and fertility is decreased among females with
cystic fibrosis. In contrast to the severe effects of two copies of the CF associated gene,
individuals with a single copy of the CF associated gene exhibit increased resistance to cholera
and to dehydration resulting from diarrhea--perhaps explaining the relatively high frequency of
the CF gene within the population.
         [005] Sequence analysis of the CFTR gene of CF chromosomes has revealed a variety
of disease-causing mutations (Cutting, G. R. et al. (1990) Nature 346:366-369; Dean, M. et al.
(1990) Cell 61:863:870; and Kerem, B-S. et al. (1989) Science 245:1073-1080; Kerem, B-S et
al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:8447-845 1). To date, greater than 1000 disease
causing mutations in the CF gene have been identified as reported by the scientific and medical
literature. The most prevalent mutation is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of the
CFTR amino acid sequence, and is commonly referred to as AF508-CFTR. This mutation
occurs in approximately 70 percent of the cases of cystic fibrosis and is associated with a severe
disease. Other mutations include the RI 17H and G551D.
         [006] The deletion of residue 508 in AF508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein from
folding correctly. This results in the inability of the mutant protein to exit the ER, and traffic to
the plasma membrane. As a result, the number of channels present in the membrane is far less
than observed in cells expressing wild-type CFTR. In addition to impaired trafficking, the
mutation results in defective channel gating. Together, the reduced number of channels in the
membrane and the defective gating lead to reduced anion transport across epithelia leading to
                                                   -2-

defective ion and fluid transport. (Quinton, P. M. (1990), FASEB J. 4: 2709-2727). Studies
have shown, however, that the reduced numbers of AF508-CFTR in the membrane are
functional, albeit less than wild-type CFTR. (Dalemans et al. (1991), Nature Lond. 354: 526
528; Denning et al., supra; Pasyk and Foskett (1995), J. Cell. Biochem. 270: 12347-50). In
addition to AF508-CFTR, other disease causing mutations in CFTR that result in defective
trafficking, synthesis, and/or channel gating could be up- or down-regulated to alter anion
secretion and modify disease progression and/or severity.
         [007] Although CFTR transports a variety of molecules in addition to anions, it is clear
that this role (the transport of anions) represents one element in an important mechanism of
transporting ions and water across the epithelium. The other elements include the epithelial Na*
channel, ENaC, Na*/2Cl-/K* co-transporter, Na*-K*-ATPase pump and the basolateral
membrane K' channels, that are responsible for the uptake of chloride into the cell.
         [008] These elements work together to achieve directional transport across the
epithelium via their selective expression and localization within the cell. Chloride absorption
takes place by the coordinated activity of ENaC and CFTR present on the apical membrane and
the Na--K*-ATPase pump and Cl- channels expressed on the basolateral surface of the cell.
Secondary active transport of chloride from the luminal side leads to the accumulation of
intracellular chloride, which can then passively leave the cell via Cl- channels, resulting in a
vectorial transport. Arrangement of Na*/2Cl-/K co-transporter, Na'-K*-ATPase pump and the
basolateral membrane K' channels on the basolateral surface and CFTR on the luminal side
coordinate the secretion of chloride via CFTR on the luminal side. Because water is probably
never actively transported itself, its flow across epithelia depends on tiny transepithelial osmotic
gradients generated by the bulk flow of sodium and chloride.
         [009] As discussed above, it is believed that the deletion of residue 508 in AF508
CFTR prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly, resulting in the inability of this
mutant protein to exit the ER, and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, insufficient
amounts of the mature protein are present at the plasma membrane and chloride transport within
epithelial tissues is significantly reduced. In fact, this cellular phenomenon of defective
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) processing of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters by the ER
                                                   -3-

machinery, has been shown to be the underlying basis not only for CF disease, but for a wide
range of other isolated and inherited diseases. The two ways that the ER machinery can
malfunction is either by loss of coupling to ER export of the proteins leading to degradation, or
by the ER accumulation of these defective/misfolded proteins [Aridor M, et al., Nature Med.,

in US published patent application US20090131492 (said publication being incorporated herein

compound that can be used readily in pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use as
therapeutics.

         [0045] As used herein, a "dispersion" refers to a disperse system in which one
substance, the dispersed phase, is distributed, in discrete units, throughout a second substance
(the continuous phase or vehicle). The size of the dispersed phase can vary considerably (e.g.
colloidal particles of nanometer dimension, to multiple microns in size). In general, the

dispersed phases can be solids, liquids, or gases. In the case of a solid dispersion, the dispersed
and continuous phases are both solids. In pharmaceutical applications, a solid dispersion can
include a crystalline drug (dispersed phase) in an amorphous polymer (continuous phase), or
alternatively, an amorphous drug (dispersed phase) in an amorphous polymer ( continuous
phase). In some embodiments an amorphous solid dispersion includes the polymer constituting
the dispersed phase, and the drug constitutes the continuous phase. In some embodiments, the
dispersion includes amorphous Compound I or substantially amorphous Compound 1.
         [0046] The term "solid amorphous dispersion" generally refers to a solid dispersion of
two or more components, usually a drug and polymer, but possibly containing other components
such as surfactants or other pharmaceutical excipients, where Compound 1 is amorphous or
substantially amorphous (e.g., substantially free of crystalline Compound 1), and the physical
stability and/or dissolution and/or solubility of the amorphous drug is enhanced by the other
components.
         [0047] As used herein, the terms "about" and "approximately", when used in connection
with doses, amounts, or weight percent of ingredients of a composition or a dosage form, mean
a dose, amount, or weight percent that is recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide
a pharmacological effect equivalent to that obtained from the specified dose, amount, or weight
percent. Specifically the term "about" or "approximately" means an acceptable error for a
particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, which depends in part on how
the value is measured or determined. In certain embodiments, the term "about" or
"approximately" means within 1, 2, 3, or 4 standard deviations. In certain embodiments, the
term "about" or "approximately" means within 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%,
5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.1%, or 0.05% of a given value or range.

                                        Compound 1
        [0086]Methods for ForminZ Compound 1 Form A
        [0087] In one embodiment, Form A is prepared by slurrying Compound I in an
appropriate solvent for an effective amount of time. In another embodiment, the appropriate
solvent is ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, MTBE, isopropyl acetate, various ratios of
water/ethanol solutions, various ratios of water/acetonitrile solutions, various ratios of
water/methanol solutions, or various ratios of water/isopropyl alcohol solutions. For example,
various ratios of water/ethanol solutions include water/ethanol 1:9 (vol/vol), water/ethanol 1:1
(vol/vol), and water/ethanol 9:1 (vol/vol). Various ratios of water/acetonitrile solutions include
water/acetonitrile 1:9 (vol/vol), water/acetonitrile 1:1 (vol/vol), and water/acetonitrile 9:1
(vol/vol). Various ratios of water/methanol solutions include water/methanol 1:9 (vol/vol),
water/methanol 1:1 (vol/vol), and water/methanol 9:1 (vol/vol). Various ratios of
water/isopropyl alcohol solutions include water/isopropyl alcohol 1:9 (vol/vol), water/isopropyl
alcohol 1:1 (vol/vol), and water/isopropyl alcohol 9:1 (vol/vol).
        [0088] Generally, about 40 mg of Compound 1 is slurred in about 1.5 ml of an
appropriate solvent (target concentration at 26.7 mg/ml) at room temperature for an effective
amount of time. In some embodiments, the effective amount of time is about 24 hours to about
2 weeks. In some embodiments, the effective amount of time is about 24 hours to about 1
                                                      -21-

week. In some embodiments, the effective amount of time is about 24 hours to about 72 hours.
The solids are then collected.
         [0089] In another embodiment, Form A is prepared by dissolving Compound 1 in an
appropriate solvent and then evaporating the solvent. In one embodiment, the appropriate
solvent is one in which Compound I has a solubility of greater than 20 mg/ml. For example,
these solvents include acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, acetone, and the like.
         [0090] Generally, Compound I is dissolved in an appropriate solvent, filtered, and then
left for either slow evaporation or fast evaporation. An example of slow evaporation is covering
a container, such as a vial, comprising the Compound 1 solution with parafilm having one hole
poked in it. An example of fast evaporation is leaving a container, such as a vial, comprising
the Compound 1 solution uncovered. The solids are then collected.
         [0091]In another aspect, the invention features a process of preparing Form A
comprising dissolving Compound I in a first solvent and adding a second solvent that
Compound 1 has poor solubility in (solubility < 1 mg/ml). For example, the first solvent may
be a solvent that Compound 1 has greater than 20 mg/ml solubility in, e.g. ethyl acetate, ethanol,
isopropyl alcohol, or acetone. The second solvent may be, for example, heptane or water.
         [0092] Generally, Compound 1 is dissolved in the first solvent and filtered to remove
any seed crystals. The second solvent is added slowly while stirring. The solids are precipitated
and collected by filtering.
         [0093] Methods of PreparingAmorphous Compound 1
         [0094] Starting from Compound I or Compound I Form A, the amorphous form of
Compound I may be prepared by rotary evaporation or by spray dry methods.
         [0095] Dissolving Compound 1 in an appropriate solvent like methanol and rotary
evaporating the methanol to leave a foam produces Compound 1 amorphous form. In some
embodiments, a warm water bath is used to expedite the evaporation.
         [0096] Compound I amorphous form may also be prepared from Compound 1 Form A
using spray dry methods. Spray drying is a process that converts a liquid feed to a dried
particulate form. Optionally, a secondary drying process such as fluidized bed drying or
                                                 -22-

vacuum drying, may be used to reduce residual solvents to pharmaceutically acceptable levels.
Typically, spray drying involves contacting a highly dispersed liquid suspension or solution, and
a sufficient volume of hot air to produce evaporation and drying of the liquid droplets. The
preparation to be spray dried can be any solution, coarse suspension, slurry, colloidal dispersion,
or paste that may be atomized using the selected spray drying apparatus. In a standard
procedure, the preparation is sprayed into a current of warm filtered air that evaporates the
solvent and conveys the dried product to a collector (e.g. a cyclone). The spent air is then
exhausted with the solvent, or alternatively the spent air is sent to a condenser to capture and
potentially recycle the solvent. Commercially available types of apparatus may be used to
conduct the spray drying. For example, commercial spray dryers are manufactured by Buchi
Ltd. And Niro (e.g., the PSD line of spray driers manufactured by Niro) (see, US
2004/0105820; US 2003/0144257).
        [0097] Spray drying typically employs solid loads of material from about 3% to about
30% by weight, (i.e., drug and excipients), for example about 4% to about 20% by weight,
preferably at least about 10%. In general, the upper limit of solid loads is governed by the
viscosity of (e.g., the ability to pump) the resulting solution and the solubility of the components
in the solution. Generally, the viscosity of the solution can determine the size of the particle in
the resulting powder product.
        [0098] Techniques and methods for spray drying may be found in Perry's Chemical
Engineering Handbook, 6"' Ed., R. H. Perry, D. W. Green & J. 0. Maloney, eds.), McGraw-Hill
book co. (1984); and Marshall "Atomization and Spray-Drying" 50, Chem. Eng. Prog. Monogr.
Series 2 (1954). In general, the spray drying is conducted with an inlet temperature of from
about 60 'C to about 200 'C, for example, from about 95 'C to about 185 'C, from about 110
'C to about 182 'C, from about 96 'C to about 180 'C, e.g., about 145 'C. The spray drying is
generally conducted with an outlet temperature of from about 30 'C to about 90 'C, for example
from about 40 'C to about 80 'C, about 45 'C to about 80 'C e.g., about 75 'C. The
atomization flow rate is generally from about 4 kg/h to about 12 kg/h, for example, from about
4.3 kg/h to about 10.5 kg/h, e.g., about 6 kg/h or about 10.5 kg/h. The feed flow rate is
generally from about 3 kg/h to about 10 kg/h, for example, from about 3.5 kg/h to about 9.0
                                                   -23-

kg/h, e.g., about 8 kg/h or about 7.1 kg/h. The atomization ratio is generally from about 0.3 to
1.7, e.g., from about 0.5 to 1.5, e.g., about 0.8 or about 1.5.
         [0099] Removal of the solvent may require a subsequent drying step, such as tray
drying, fluid bed drying (e.g., from about room temperature to about 100 C), vacuum drying,
microwave drying, rotary drum drying or biconical vacuum drying (e.g., from about room
temperature to about 200 C).
         [00100] In one embodiment, the solid dispersion is fluid bed dried.
         [00101] In one process, the solvent includes a volatile solvent, for example a solvent
having a boiling point of less than about 100 'C. In some embodiments, the solvent includes a
mixture of solvents, for example a mixture of volatile solvents or a mixture of volatile and non
volatile solvents. Where mixtures of solvents are used, the mixture can include one or more
non-volatile solvents, for example, where the non-volatile solvent is present in the mixture at
less than about 15%, e.g., less than about 12%, less than about 10%, less than about 8%, less
than about 5%, less than about 3%, or less than about 2%.
         [00102] Preferred solvents are those solvents where Compound I has a solubility of at
least about 10 mg/ml, (e.g., at least about 15 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml, 25 mg/ml, 30 mg/ml, 35 mg/ml,
40 mg/ml, 45 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, or greater). More preferred solvents include those where
Compound 1 has a solubility of at least about 20 mg/ml.
         [00103] Exemplary solvents that could be tested include acetone, cyclohexane,
dichloromethane, NN-dimethylacetamide (DMA), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 1,3
dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dioxane, ethyl acetate, ethyl
ether, glacial acetic acid (HAc), methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP),
methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), tetrahydrofuran (THF), pentane, acetonitrile, methanol,
ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, isopropyl acetate, and toluene. Exemplary co-solvents include
acetone/DMSO, acetone/DMF, acetone/water, MEK/water, THF/water, dioxane/water. In a two
solvent system, the solvents can be present in of from about 0.1% to about 99.9%. In some
preferred embodiments, water is a co-solvent with acetone where water is present from about
0.1% to about 15%, for example about 9% to about 11%, e.g., about 10%. In some preferred
embodiments, water is a co-solvent with MEK where water is present from about 0.1% to about
                                                   -24-

15%, for example about 9% to about 11%, e.g., about 10%. In some embodiments the solvent
solution includes three solvents. For example, acetone and water can be mixed with a third
solvent such as DMA, DMF, DMI, DMSO, or HAc. In instances where amorphous Compound
I is a component of a solid amorphous dispersion, preferred solvents dissolve both Compound 1
and the polymer. Suitable solvents include those described above, for example, MEK, acetone,
water, methanol, and mixtures thereof.
         [00104] The particle size and the temperature drying range may be modified to prepare
an optimal solid dispersion. As would be appreciated by skilled practitioners, a small particle
size would lead to improved solvent removal. Applicants have found however, that smaller
particles can lead to fluffy particles that, under some circumstances do not provide optimal solid
dispersions for downstream processing such as tabletting. At higher temperatures,
crystallization or chemical degradation of Compound 1 may occur. At lower temperatures, a
sufficient amount of the solvent may not be removed. The methods herein provide an optimal
particle size and an optimal drying temperature.
         [00105] In general, particle size is such that D10 (pm) is less than about 5, e.g., less
than about 4.5, less than about 4.0, or less than about 3.5, D50 (pum) is generally less than about
17, e.g., less than about 16, less than about 15, less than about 14, less than about 13, and D90
(pLm) is generally less than about 175, e.g., less than about 170, less than about 170, less than
about 150, less than about 125, less than about 100, less than about 90, less than about 80, less
than about 70, less than about 60, or less than about less than about 50. In general bulk density
of the spray dried particles is from about 0.08 g/cc to about 0.20 g/cc, e.g., from about 0.10 to
about 0.15 g/cc, e.g., about 0.11 g/cc or about 0.14 g/cc. Tap density of the spray dried particles
generally ranges from about 0.08 g/cc to about 0.20 g/cc, e.g., from about 0.10 to about 0.15
g/cc, e.g., about 0.11 g/cc or about 0.14 g/cc, for 10 taps; 0.10 g/cc to about 0.25 g/cc, e.g., from
about 0.11 to about 0.21 g/cc, e.g., about 0.15 g/cc, about 0.19 g/cc, or about 0.21 g/cc for 500
taps; 0.15 g/cc to about 0.27 g/cc, e.g., from about 0.18 to about 0.24 g/cc, e.g., about 0.18 g/cc,
about 0.19 g/cc, about 0.20 g/cc, or about 0.24 g/cc for 1250 taps; and 0.15 g/cc to about 0.27
g/cc, e.g., from about 0.18 to about 0.24 g/cc, e.g., about 0.18 g/cc, about 0.21 g/cc, about 0.23
g/cc, or about 0.24 g/cc for 2500 taps.
                                                   -25-

         [00106] Polymers
         [00107] Solid dispersions including amorphous Compound 1 and a polymer (or solid
state carrier) also are included herein. For example, Compound 1 is present as an amorphous
compound as a component of a solid amorphous dispersion. The solid amorphous dispersion,
generally includes Compound 1 and a polymer. Exemplary polymers include cellulosic
polymers such as HPMC or HPMCAS and pyrrolidone containing polymers such as PVP/VA.
In some embodiments, the solid amorphous dispersion includes one or more additional
excipients, such as a surfactant.
         [00108] In one embodiment, a polymer is able to dissolve in aqueous media. The
solubility of the polymers may be pH-independent or pH-dependent. The latter include one or
more enteric polymers. The term "enteric polymer" refers to a polymer that is preferentially
soluble in the less acidic environment of the intestine relative to the more acid environment of
the stomach, for example, a polymer that is insoluble in acidic aqueous media but soluble when
the pH is above 5-6. An appropriate polymer should be chemically and biologically inert. In
order to improve the physical stability of the solid dispersions, the glass transition temperature
(Tg) of the polymer should be as high as possible. For example, preferred polymers have a glass
transition temperature at least equal to or greater than the glass transition temperature of the
drug (i.e., Compound 1). Other preferred polymers have a glass transition temperature that is
within about 10 to about 15 'C of the drug (i.e., Compound 1). Examples of suitable glass
transition temperatures of the polymers include at least about 90 'C, at least about 95 'C, at
least about 100 'C, at least about 105 'C, at least about 110 'C, at least about 115 'C, at least
about 120 'C, at least about 125 'C, at least about 130 'C, at least about 135 'C, at least about
 140 C, at least about 145 'C, at least about 150   CC, at least about 155 'C, at least about 160 'C,
at least about 165 CC, at least about 170 CC, or at least about 175 'C (as measured under dry
conditions). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the underlying
mechanism is that a polymer with a higher Tg generally has lower molecular mobility at room
temperature, which can be a crucial factor in stabilizing the physical stability of the amorphous
solid dispersion.
                                                  -26-

         [00109] Additionally, the hygroscopicity of the polymers should be as low, e.g., less
than about 10%. For the purpose of comparison in this application, the hygroscopicity of a
polymer or composition is characterized at about 60% relative humidity. In some preferred
embodiments, the polymer has less than about 10% water absorption, for example less than
about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less
than about 4%, less than about 3%, or less than about 2% water absorption. The hygroscopicity
can also affect the physical stability of the solid dispersions. Generally, moisture adsorbed in
the polymers can greatly reduce the Tg of the polymers as well as the resulting solid dispersions,
which will further reduce the physical stability of the solid dispersions as described above.
         [00110] In one embodiment, the polymer is one or more water-soluble polymer(s) or
partially water-soluble polymer(s). Water-soluble or partially water-soluble polymers include
but are not limited to, cellulose derivatives (e.g., hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC),
hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC)) or ethylcellulose; polyvinylpyrrolidones (PVP); polyethylene
glycols (PEG); polyvinyl alcohols (PVA); acrylates, such as polymethacrylate (e.g., Eudragit@
E); cyclodextrins (e.g., P-cyclodextrin) and copolymers and derivatives thereof, including for
example PVP-VA (polyvinylpyrollidone-vinyl acetate).
         [00111] In some embodiments, the polymer is hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC),
such as HPMC E50, HPMCE15, or HPMC60SH50).
         [00112] As discussed herein, the polymer can be a pH-dependent enteric polymer. Such
pH-dependent enteric polymers include, but are not limited to, cellulose derivatives (e.g.,
cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP)), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalates (HPMCP),
hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)
or a salt thereof (e.g., a sodium salt such as (CMC-Na)); cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT),
hydroxypropylcellulose acetate phthalate (HPCAP), hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose acetate
phthalate (HPMCAP), and methylcellulose acetate phthalate (MCAP), or polymethacrylates
(e.g., Eudragit@ S).     In some embodiments, the polymer is hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose
acetate succinate (HPMCAS). In some embodiments, the polymer is hydroxypropyl methyl
cellulose acetate succinate HG grade (HPMCAS-HG).
                                                   -27-

        [00113] In yet another embodiment, the polymer is a polyvinylpyrrolidone co-polymer,
for example, a vinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate co-polymer (PVP/VA).
        [00114] In embodiments where Compound I forms a solid dispersion with a polymer,
for example with an HPMC, HPMCAS, or PVP/VA polymer, the amount of polymer relative to
the total weight of the solid dispersion ranges from about 0.1% to 99% by weight. Unless
otherwise specified, percentages of drug, polymer and other excipients as described within a
dispersion are given in weight percentages. The amount of polymer is typically at least about
20%, and preferably at least about 30%, for example, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at
least about 45%, or about 50% (e.g., 49.5%). The amount is typically about 99% or less, and
preferably about 80% or less, for example about 75% or less, about 70% or less, about 65% or
less, about 60% or less, or about 55% or less. In one embodiment, the polymer is in an amount
of up to about 50% of the total weight of the dispersion (and even more specifically, between
about 40% and 50%, such as about 49%, about 49.5%, or about 50%). HPMC and HPMCAS
are available in a variety of grades from ShinEtsu, for example, HPMCAS is available in a
number of varieties, including AS-LF, AS-MF, AS-HF, AS-LG, AS-MG, AS-HG. Each of
these grades vary with the percent substitution of acetate and succinate.
        [00115] In some embodiments, Compound 1 and polymer are present in roughly equal
amounts, for example each of the polymer and the drug make up about half of the percentage
weight of the dispersion. For example, the polymer is present in about 49.5% and the drug is
present in about 50%.
        [00116] In some embodiments, Compound 1 and the polymer combined represent 1%
to 20% w/w total solid content of the non-solid dispersion prior to spray drying. In some
embodiments, Compound I and the polymer combined represent 5% to 15% w/w total solid
content of the non-solid dispersion prior to spray drying. In some embodiments, Compound 1
and the polymer combined represent about 11% w/w total solid content of the non-solid
dispersion prior to spray drying.
        [00117] In some embodiments, the dispersion further includes other minor ingredients,
such as a surfactant (e.g., SLS). In some embodiments, the surfactant is present in less than
about 10% of the dispersion, for example less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less than
                                                 -28-

about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less
than about 2%, about 1%, or about 0.5%.
         [00118] In embodiments including a polymer, the polymer should be present in an
amount effective for stabilizing the solid dispersion. Stabilizing includes inhibiting or
preventing, the crystallization of Compound 1. Such stabilizing would inhibit the conversion
Compound 1 from amorphous to crystalline form. For example, the polymer would prevent at
least a portion (e.g., about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%,
about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%,
about 75%, or greater) of Compound 1 from converting from an amorphous to a crystalline
form. Stabilization can be measured, for example, by measuring the glass transition
temperature of the solid dispersion, measuring the rate of relaxation of the amorphous material,
or by measuring the solubility or bioavailability of Compound 1.
         [00119] Suitable polymers for use in combination with Compound 1, for example to
form a solid dispersion such as an amorphous solid dispersion, should have one or more of the
following properties:
         [00120] The glass transition temperature of the polymer should have a temperature of
no less than about 10-15 'C lower than the glass transition temperature of Compound 1.
Preferably, the glass transition temperature of the polymer is greater than the glass transition
temperature of Compound 1, and in general at least 50'C higher than the desired storage
temperature of the drug product. For example, at least about 100 'C, at least about 105 'C, at
least about 105 'C, at least about 110 'C, at least about 120 'C, at least about 130 'C, at least
about 140 'C, at least about 150 'C, at least about 160 'C, at least about 160 'C, or greater.
         [00121] The polymer should be relatively non-hygroscopic. For example, the polymer
should, when stored under standard conditions, absorb less than about 10% water, for example,
less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about 7%, less than about 6%, or less than
about 5%, less than about 4%, or less than about 3% water. Preferably the polymer will, when
stored under standard conditions, be substantially free of absorbed water.
         [00122] The polymer should have similar or better solubility in solvents suitable for
spray drying processes relative to that of Compound 1. In preferred embodiments, the polymer
                                                 -29-

will dissolve in one or more of the same solvents or solvent systems as Compound 1. It is
preferred that the polymer is soluble in at least one non-hydroxy containing solvent such as
methylene chloride, acetone, or a combination thereof.
        [00123] The polymer, when combined with Compound 1, for example in a solid
dispersion or in a liquid suspension, should increase the solubility of Compound 1 in aqueous
and physiologically relative media either relative to the solubility of Compound I in the absence
of polymer or relative to the solubility of Compound I when combined with a reference
polymer. For example, the polymer could increase the solubility of amorphous Compound 1 by
reducing the amount of amorphous Compound 1 that converts to crystalline Compound 1, either
from a solid amorphous dispersion or from a liquid suspension.
        [00124] The polymer should decrease the relaxation rate of the amorphous substance.
        [00125] The polymer should increase the physical and/or chemical stability of
Compound 1.
        [00126] The polymer should improve the manufacturability of Compound 1.
        [00127] The polymer should improve one or more of the handling, administration or
storage properties of Compound 1.
        [00128] The polymer should not interact unfavorably with other pharmaceutical
components, for example excipients.
        [00129] The suitability of a candidate polymer (or other component) can be tested using
the spray drying methods (or other methods) described herein to form an amorphous
composition. The candidate composition can be compared in terms of stability, resistance to the
formation of crystals, or other properties, and compared to a reference preparation, e.g., a
preparation of neat amorphous Compound 1 or crystalline Compound 1. For example, a
candidate composition could be tested to determine whether it inhibits the time to onset of
solvent mediated crystallization, or the percent conversion at a given time under controlled
conditions, by at least 50 %, 75 %, 100%, or 110% as well as the reference preparation, or a
candidate composition could be tested to determine if it has improved bioavailability or
solubility relative to crystalline Compound 1.
                                                  -30-

        [00130] Surfactants
        [00131] A solid dispersion or other composition may include a surfactant. A surfactant
or surfactant mixture would generally decrease the interfacial tension between the solid
dispersion and an aqueous medium. An appropriate surfactant or surfactant mixture may also
enhance aqueous solubility and bioavailability of Compound 1 from a solid dispersion. The
surfactants for use in connection with the present invention include, but are not limited to,
sorbitan fatty acid esters (e.g., Spans@), polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters (e.g.,
Tweens@), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) dioctyl
sodium sulfosuccinate (Docusate), dioxycholic acid sodium salt (DOSS), Sorbitan
Monostearate, Sorbitan Tristearate, hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB), Sodium
N-lauroylsarcosine, Sodium Oleate, Sodium Myristate, Sodium Stearate, Sodium Palmitate,

polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), Lecithin, MW 677-692, Glutanic acid monosodium
monohydrate, Labrasol, PEG 8 caprylic/capric glycerides, Transcutol, diethylene glycol
monoethyl ether, Solutol HS-15, polyethylene glycol/hydroxystearate, Taurocholic Acid,
Pluronic F68, Pluronic F108, and Pluronic F127 (or any other polyoxyethylene
polyoxypropylene co-polymers (Pluronics) or saturated polyglycolized glycerides
(Gelucirs)). Specific example of such surfactants that may be used in connection with this
invention include, but are not limited to, Span 65, Span 25, Tween 20, Capryol 90, Pluronic
F108, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), Vitamin E TPGS, pluronics and copolymers. SLS is
generally preferred.
        [00132] The amount of the surfactant (e.g., SLS) relative to the total weight of the solid
dispersion may be between 0.1-15%. Preferably, it is from about 0.5% to about 10%, more
preferably from about 0.5 to about 5%, e.g., about 0.5 to 4%, about 0.5 to 3%, about 0.5 to 2%,
about 0.5 to 1%, or about 0.5%.
        [00133] In certain embodiments, the amount of the surfactant relative to the total weight
of the solid dispersion is at least about 0.1%, preferably about 0.5%. In these embodiments, the
surfactant would be present in an amount of no more than about 15%, and preferably no more
than about 12%, about 11%, about 10%, about 9%, about 8%, about 7%, about 6%, about 5%,
                                                  -31-

about 4%, about 3%, about 2% or about 1%. An embodiment wherein the surfactant is in an
amount of about 0.5% by weight is preferred.
         [00134] Candidate surfactants (or other components) can be tested for suitability for use
in the invention in a manner similar to that described for testing polymers.

        [00142] In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method of treating a
CFTR-mediated disease in a human comprising the step of administering to said human an
effective amount of a composition comprising Compound 1 Form A or amorphous Compound 1
described herein.
        [00143]       According to an alternative preferred embodiment, the present invention
provides a method of treating cystic fibrosis in a human comprising the step of administering to
said human a composition comprising Compound 1 Form A or amorphous Compound 1
described herein.
        [00144] According to the invention an "effective amount" of Compound 1 Form A or
amorphous Compound 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof is that amount
effective for treating or lessening the severity of any of the diseases recited above.
        [00145] Compound 1 Form A or amorphous Compound I or a pharmaceutically
acceptable composition thereof may be administered using any amount and any route of
administration effective for treating or lessening the severity of one or more of the diseases
recited above.
                                                  -34-

         [00146]      In certain embodiments, Compound 1 Form A or amorphous Compound 1
described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof is useful for treating or
lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in patients who exhibit residual CFTR activity in the
apical membrane of respiratory and non-respiratory epithelia. The presence of residual CFTR
activity at the epithelial surface can be readily detected using methods known in the art, e.g.,
standard electrophysiological, biochemical, or histochemical techniques. Such methods identify
CFTR activity using in vivo or ex vivo electrophysiological techniques, measurement of sweat or
salivary Cl- concentrations, or ex vivo biochemical or histochemical techniques to monitor cell
surface density. Using such methods, residual CFTR activity can be readily detected in patients
heterozygous or homozygous for a variety of different mutations, including patients
homozygous or heterozygous for the most common mutation, AF508, as well as other mutations
such as the G55 ID mutation, or the RI 17H mutation.
         [00147]      In one embodiment, Compound 1 Form A or amorphous Compound 1
described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof is useful for treating or
lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in patients within certain genotypes exhibiting residual
CFTR activity, e.g., class III mutations (impaired regulation or gating), class IV mutations
(altered conductance), or class V mutations (reduced synthesis) (Lee R. Choo-Kang, Pamela L.,
Zeitlin, Type I,A III, IV, and V cystic fibrosis Tansmembrane ConductanceRegulator Defects
and Opportunitiesof Therapy; Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine 6:521 - 529, 2000).
Other patient genotypes that exhibit residual CFTR activity include patients homozygous for
one of these classes or heterozygous with any other class of mutations, including class I
mutations, class 11 mutations, or a mutation that lacks classification.
         [00148]      In one embodiment, Compound 1 Form A or amorphous Compound 1
described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof is useful for treating or
lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in patients within certain clinical phenotypes, e.g., a
moderate to mild clinical phenotype that typically correlates with the amount of residual CFTR
activity in the apical membrane of epithelia. Such phenotypes include patients exhibiting
pancreatic insufficiency or patients diagnosed with idiopathic pancreatitis and congenital
bilateral absence of the vas deferens, or mild lung disease.

        [00149]       The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on
the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular
agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The compounds of the invention are preferably
formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The
expression "dosage unit form" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of agent
appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage
of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending
physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any
particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being
treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the
specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient;
the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific
compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental
with the specific compound employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts. The
term "patient" or "subject", as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most
preferably a human.
        [00150]       The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be
administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally,
intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an
oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In
certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or
parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about
1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain
the desired therapeutic effect.
        [00151]       In certain embodiments, the dosage amount of Compound 1 Form A or
amorphous Compound 1 in the dosage unit form is from 100 mg to 1,000 mg. In another
embodiment, the dosage amount of Compound 1 Form A or amorphous Compound 1 is from
200 mg to 900 mg. In another embodiment, the dosage amount of Compound I Form A or
amorphous Compound 1 is from 300 mg to 800 mg. In another embodiment, the dosage
amount of Compound 1 Form A or amorphous Compound I is from 400 mg to 700 mg. In
                                                   -36-

another embodiment, the dosage amount of Compound 1 Form A or amorphous Compound 1 is
from 500 mg to 600 mg.
         [00152]      Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or
oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing
or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile
injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or
solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and
solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride
solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending
medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or
diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.
         [00153]      The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration
through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile
solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile
injectable medium prior to use.
         [00154]      Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably
suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable
non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository
wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in
the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.
         [00155]      Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills,
powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least
one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium
phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and
silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin,
polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating
agents such as agar--agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain
silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption
accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example,
                                                   -37-

cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i)
lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium
lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form
may also comprise buffering agents.
         [00156]      Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft
and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high
molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees,
capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings
and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally
contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active
ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a
delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric
substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in
soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as
high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
         [00157]      The active compounds can also be in microencapsulated form with one or
more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and
granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid
dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as
sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice,
additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids
such a magnesium stearate and microciystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and
pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain
opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s)
only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.
Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and
waxes.

         [00158]      It will also be appreciated that Compound I Form A or amorphous
Compound 1 described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof can be
employed in combination therapies, that is, Compound I Form A or amorphous Compound I
can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired
therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or
procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the
desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will
also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same
disorder (for example, an inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another
agent used to treat the same disorder), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any
adverse effects). As used herein, additional therapeutic agents that are normally administered to
treat or prevent a particular disease, or condition, are known as "appropriate for the disease, or

         [00178] Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDSC) and Differential
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
         [00179] The modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) was used for testing
the glass transition temperature of the amorphous form and spray dried dispersion of a
compound. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the melting point of
crystalline materials and to discriminate between different polymorphs. The data were collected
using a TA DSC Q2000 differential scanning calorimeter (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE).
The instrument was calibrated with indium. Samples of approximately 1-5 mg were weighed
into aluminum hermetic pans that were crimped using lids with one hole. For MDSC the
samples were scanned from -20'C to 220'C at 2 'C/minute heating rate with +/- 1 'C
modulation every 60 seconds. For DSC the samples were scanned from 25'C to 220'C at a
heating rate of 10 'C/min. Data were collected by Thermal Advantage      Q SeriesTM  software

(TA Instruments, New Castle, DE).
        [00180] XRPD (X-ray Powder Diffraction)
        [00181] X-ray Powder Diffraction was used to characterize the physical form of the lots
produced to date and to characterize different polymorphs identified. The XRPD data of a
compound were collected on a PANalytical X'pert Pro Powder X-ray Diffractometer (Almelo,
the Netherlands). The XRPD pattern was recorded at room temperature with copper radiation
(1.54060 A). The X-ray was generated using Cu sealed tube at 45 kV, 40 mA with a Nickel KP
suppression filter. The incident beam optic was comprised of a variable divergence slit to
ensure a constant illuminated length on the sample and on the diffracted beam side; a fast linear
solid state detector was used with an active length of 2.12 degrees 2 theta measured in a
scanning mode. The powder sample was packed on the indented area of a zero background
silicon holder and spinning was performed to achieve better statistics. A symmetrical scan was
measured from 4 - 40 degrees 2 theta with a step size of 0.017 degrees and a scan step time of
15.5 seconds. The data collection software is X'pert Data Collector (version 2.2e). The data
analysis software is either X'pert Data Viewer (version 1.2d) or X'pert Highscore (version:
2.2c).
        [00182] Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
        [00183] TGA was used to investigate the presence of residual solvents in the lots
characterized, and identify the temperature at which decomposition of the sample occurs. TGA
data were collected on a TA Q500 Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TA Instruments, New Castle,
DE). A sample with weight of approximately 2-5 mg was scanned from 25 'C to 300 'C at a
heating rate of 10 'C/min. Data were collected by Thermal Advantage      Q SeriesTM software
(version 2.5.0.255) and analyzed by Universal Analysis software (version 4.4A, build 4.4.0.5)
(TA Instruments, New Castle, DE).
        [00184] Compound I Form A Single Crystal Structure Determination
        [00185] Diffraction data were acquired on Bruker Apex II diffractometer equipped with
sealed tube Cu Kax source and an Apex II CCD detector. The structure was solved and refined
using SHELXprogram (Sheldrick,G.M.,Acta Ciyst., (2008) A64, 112-122). Based on
                                                -45-

intensities statistics and systematic absences the structure was solved and refined in C2 space
group. The absolute configuration was determined using anomalous diffraction. Flack
parameter refined to 0.00 (18) indicating that the model represent the correct enantiomer [(R)].
         [00186] Solid State NMR
         [00187] Solid state NMR was conducted on a Bruker-Biospin 400 MHz wide-bore
spectrometer equipped with a Bruker-Biospin 4mm HFX probe. Samples were packed into
4mm ZrO2 rotors and spun under Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) condition with spinning speed
of 12.5 kHz. The proton relaxation time was first measured using 1H MAS Ti saturation
                                                                                 13
recovery relaxation experiment in order to set up proper recycle delay of the       C cross
polarization (CP) MAS experiment. The CP contact time of carbon CPMAS experiment was
set to 2 ms. A CP proton pulse with linear ramp (from 50% to 100%) was employed. The
Hartmann-Hahn match was optimized on external reference sample (glycine). The fluorine
MAS spectrum was recorded with proton decoupling. TPPM1 5 decoupling sequence was used
with the field strength of approximately 100 kHz for both    13

        [00227] Benzylglycolated 4-ammonium-2-brono-5-fluoroaniline tosylate salt was
freebased by stirring the solid in EtOAc (5 vol) and saturated NaHCO 3 solution (5 vol) until
clear organic layer was achieved. The resulting layers were separated and the organic layer was
washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution (5 vol) followed by brine and concentrated in vacuo to
obtain benzylglycolated 4-ammonium-2-bromo-5-fluoroaniline tosylate salt as an oil.
        [00228] Then, a flask was charged with benzylglycolated 4-ammonium-2-bromo-5
fluoroaniline tosylate salt (freebase, 1.0 equiv), Pd(OAc) (4.0 mol%), dppb (6.0 mol%) and
powdered K2CO 3 (3.0 equiv) and stirred with acetonitrile (6 vol) at room temperature. The
resulting reaction mixture was degassed for approximately 30 min by bubbling in N 2 with vent.

was concentrated in vacuo and the residue was redissolved in EtOAc (6 vol). The organic layer
was washed twice with NH 4 Cl solution (20% w/v, 4 vol) and brine (6 vol). The resulting

         [00239] Method A
         [00240] A 20 L autoclave was flushed three times with nitrogen gas and then charged
with palladium on carbon (Evonik E 101 NN/W, 5% Pd, 60% wet, 200 g, 0.075 mol, 0.04
equiv). The autoclave was then flushed with nitrogen three times. A solution of crude benzyl
protected Compound 1 (1.3 kg, ~1.9 mol) in THF (8 L, 6 vol) was added to the autoclave via
suction. The vessel was capped and then flushed three times with nitrogen gas. With gentle
stirring, the vessel was flushed three times with hydrogen gas, evacuating to atmosphere by
diluting with nitrogen. The autoclave was pressurized to 3 Bar with hydrogen and the agitation
rate was increased to 800 rpm. Rapid hydrogen uptake was observed (dissolution). Once uptake
subsided, the vessel was heated to 50 'C.
         [00241] For safety purposes, the thermostat was shut off at the end of every work-day.
The vessel was pressurized to 4 Bar with hydrogen and then isolated from the hydrogen tank.
         [00242] After 2 full days of reaction, more Pd / C (60 g, 0.023 mol, 0.01 equiv) was
added to the mixture. This was done by flushing three times with nitrogen gas and then adding
the catalyst through the solids addition port. Resuming the reaction was done as before. After 4
full days, the reaction was deemed complete by HPLC by the disappearance of not only the
starting material but also of the peak corresponding to a mono-benzylated intermediate.

         [00243] The reaction mixture was filtered through a Celite pad. The vessel and filter
cake were washed with THF (2 L, 1.5 vol). The Celite pad was then wetted with water and the
cake discarded appropriately. The combined filtrate and THF wash were concentrated using a
rotary evaporator yielding the crude product as a black oil, 1 kg.
         [00244] The equivalents and volumes in the following purification are based on 1 kg of
crude material. The crude black oil was dissolved in 1:1 ethyl acetate-heptane. The mixture
was charged to a pad of silica gel (1.5 kg, 1.5 wt. equiv) in a fritted funnel that had been
saturated with 1:1 ethyl acetate-heptane. The silica pad was flushed first with 1:1 ethyl acetate
heptane (6 L, 6 vol) and then with pure ethyl acetate (14 L, 14 vol). The eluent was collected in
4 fractions which were analyzed by HPLC.
         [00245] The equivalents and volumes in the following purification are based on 0.6 kg
of crude material. Fraction 3 was concentrated by rotary evaporation to give a brown foam (600
g) and then redissolved in MTBE (1.8 L, 3 vol). The dark brown solution was stirred overnight
at ambient temperature, during which time, crystallization occurred. Heptane (55 mL, 0.1 vol)
was added and the mixture was stirred overnight. The mixture was filtered using a Buchner
funnel and the filter cake was washed with 3:1 MTBE-heptane (900 mL, 1.5 vol). The filter
cake was air-dried for I h and then vacuum dried at ambient temperature for 16 h, furnishing
253 g of VXc-661 as an off-white solid.
         [00246] The equivalents and volumes for the following purification are based on 1.4 kg
of crude material. Fractions 2 and 3 from the above silica gel filtration as well as material from
a previous reaction were combined and concentrated to give 1.4 kg of a black oil. The mixture
was resubmitted to the silica gel filtration (1.5 kg of silica gel, eluted with 3.5 L, 2.3 vol of 1:1
ethyl acetate-heptane then 9 L, 6 vol of pure ethyl acetate) described above, which upon
concentration gave a tan foamy solid (390 g).
         [00247] The equivalents and volumes for the following purification are based on 390 g
of crude material. The tan solid was insoluble in MTBE, so was dissolved in methanol (1.2 L, 3
vol). Using a 4 L Morton reactor equipped with a long-path distillation head, the mixture was
distilled down to 2 vol. MTBE (1.2 L, 3 vol) was added and the mixture was distilled back
down to 2 vol. A second portion of MTBE (1.6 L, 4 vol) was added and the mixture was
                                                  -61-

distilled back down to 2 vol. A third portion of MTBE (1.2 L, 3 vol) was added and the mixture
was distilled back down to 3 vol. Analysis of the distillate by GC revealed it to consist of-6%
methanol. The thermostat was set to 48 'C (below the boiling temp of the MTBE-methanol
azeotrope, which is 52 C). The mixture was cooled to 20 'C over 2 h, during which time a
relatively fast crystallization occurred. After stirring the mixture for 2 h, heptane (20 mL, 0.05
vol) was added and the mixture was stirred overnight (16 h). The mixture was filtered using a
Buchner funnel and the filter cake was washed with 3:1 MTBE-heptane (800 mL, 2 vol). The
filter cake was air-dried for 1 h and then vacuum dried at ambient temperature for 16 h,
furnishing 130 g of Compound 1 as an off-white solid.
         [00248] Method B
         [00249] Benzyl protected Compound 1 was dissolved and flushed with THF (3 vol) to
remove any remaining residual solvent. Benzyl protected Compound 1 was redissolved in THF
(4 vol) and added to the hydrogenator containing 5 wt% Pd/C (2.5 mol%, 60% wet, Degussa E5
E101 NN/W). The internal temperature of the reaction was adjusted to 50 'C, and flushed with
N 2 (x5) followed by hydrogen (x3). The hydrogenator pressure was adjusted to 3 Bar of
hydrogen and the mixture was stirred rapidly (>1100 rpm). At the end of the reaction, the
catalyst was filtered through a pad of Celite and washed with THIF (1 vol). The filtrate was
concentrated in vacuo to obtain a brown foamy residue. The resulting residue was dissolved in
MTBE (5 vol) and 0.5N HCl solution (2 vol) and distilled water (1 vol) were added. The
mixture was stirred for NLT 30 min and the resulting layers were separated. The organic phase
was washed with 1Owt% K 2C0       3 solution (2 vol x2) followed by a brine wash. The organic
layer was added to a flask containing silica gel (25 wt%), Deloxan-THP 11 (5wt%, 75% wet),
and Na2SO4 and stirred overnight. The resulting mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite
and washed with 10%THF/MTBE (3 vol). The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to afford
crude Compound I as pale tan foam.

         [00279] Single crystal data were obtained for Compound 1 Form A, providing
additional detail about the crystal structure, including lattice size and packing.
         [00280] Crystal Preparation
         [00281] Crystals of Compound 1 Form A were obtained by slow evaporation from a
concentrated solution of methanol (10 mg/ml). A colorless crystal of Compound 1 Form A with
dimensions of 0.20 x 0.05 x 0.05 mm was selected, cleaned using mineral oil, mounted on a
MicroMount and centered on a Bruker APEXII diffractometer. Three batches of 40 frames
separated in reciprocal space were obtained to provide an orientation matrix and initial cell
parameters. Final cell parameters were obtained and refined based on the full data set.
         [00282] Experimental
         [00283] A diffraction data set of reciprocal space was obtained to a resolution of 0.83 A
using 0.50 steps with 30 s exposure for each frame. Data were collected at room temperature
[295 (2) K]. Integration of intensities and refinement of cell parameters were accomplished
using APEXII software. Observation of the crystal after data collection showed no signs of
decomposition.

          [00284] Geometry: All esds (except the esd in the dihedral angle between two l.s.
planes) are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell esds are taken into account
individually in the estimation of esds in distances, angles and torsion angles; correlations
between esds in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An
approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell esds is used for estimating esds involving l.s. planes.

          [00286] Refinement: Refinement of F2 against ALL reflections. The weighted R-factor
wR and goodness of fit S are based on F 2 , conventional R-factors R are based on F, with F set to
zero for negative F2 . The threshold expression of F2 > 2sigma(F 2) is used only for calculating
R-factors(gt) etc. and is not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. R-factors based
on F 2 are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R-factors based on ALL data
will be even larger.
          [00287] Conformational pictures of Compound 1 Form A based on single crystal X-ray
analysis are shown in Figures 9 and 10. The terminal -OH groups are connected via hydrogen
bond networks to form a tetrameric cluster with four adjacent molecules (Figure 10). The other
hydroxyl group acts as a hydrogen bond donor to form a hydrogen bond with a carbonyl group
from an adjacent molecule. The crystal structure reveals a dense packing of the molecules.

Compound 1 (approximately 10 g) was dissolved in 180 ml of MeOH and rotary evaporated in a
50 'C bath to a foam. DSC (Figure 14) and XRPD (Figure 13) confirmed amorphous form of
Compound 1. Figure 15 discloses a TGA trace of Compound 1 amorphous form prepared by
this method.

        [00294] 9.95g of Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate HG grade
(HPMCAS-HG) was weighed into a 500 ml beaker, along with 50 mg of sodium lauryl sulfate
(SLS). MeOH (200 ml) was mixed with the solid. The material was allowed to stir for 4 h. To
insure maximum dissolution, after 2 h of stirring the solution was sonicated for 5 mins, then
allowed to continue stirring for the remaining 2 h. A very fin suspension of HPMCAS
remained in solution. However, visual observation determined that no gummy portions
remained on the walls of the vessel or stuck to the bottom after tilting the vessel.
        [00295] Compound I Form A (1Og) was poured into the 500 ml beaker, and the system
was allowed to continue stirring. The solution was spray dried using the following parameters:

         [00301] Assays for Detecting and Measuring AF508-CFTR Correction Properties
of Compounds
         [00302] Membrane potential optical methods for assaying AF508-CFTR modulation
properties of compounds
         [00303] The optical membrane potential assay utilized voltage-sensitive FRET sensors
described by Gonzalez and Tsien (Se Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1995) "Voltage sensing
by fluorescence resonance energy transfer in single cells" Biophys J 69(4): 1272-80, and
Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1997) "Improved indicators of cell membrane potential that
use fluorescence resonance energy transfer" Chem Biol 4(4): 269-77) in combination with
instrumentation for measuring fluorescence changes such as the Voltage/Ion Probe Reader
(VIPR) (S     Gonzalez, J. E., K. Oades, et al. (1999) "Cell-based assays and instrumentation for
screening ion-channel targets" Drug Discov Today 4(9): 431-439).
         [00304] These voltage sensitive assays are based on the change in fluorescence resonant
                                                  -74-

energy transfer (FRET) between the membrane-soluble, voltage-sensitive dye, DiSBAC 2 (3), and
a fluorescent phospholipid, CC2-DMPE, which is attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma
membrane and acts as a FRET donor. Changes in membrane potential (Vm) cause the
negatively charged DiSBAC 2 (3) to redistribute across the plasma membrane and the amount of
energy transfer from CC2-DMPE changes accordingly. The changes in fluorescence emission
were monitored using VIPRrM 11, which is an integrated liquid handler and fluorescent detector
designed to conduct cell-based screens in 96- or 384-well microtiter plates.
        [00305] 1. Identification of CorrectionCompounds
        [00306] To identify small molecules that correct the trafficking defect associated with
AF508-CFTR; a single-addition HTS assay format was developed. The cells were incubated in
serum-free medium for 16 hrs at 37 'C in the presence or absence (negative control) of test
compound. As a positive control, cells plated in 384-well plates were incubated for 16 hrs at 27
'C to "temperature-correct" AF508-CFTR. The cells were subsequently rinsed 3X with Krebs
Ringers solution and loaded with the voltage-sensitive dyes. To activate AF508-CFTR, 10 pM
forskolin and the CFTR potentiator, genistein (20 pM), were added along with Cl--free medium
to each well. The addition of Cl--free medium promoted Cl- efflux in response to AF508-CFTR
activation and the resulting membrane depolarization was optically monitored using the FRET
based voltage-sensor dyes.
        [00307] 2. Identification of PotentiatorCompounds
        [00308] To identify potentiators of AF508-CFTR, a double-addition HTS assay format
was developed. During the first addition, a Cl--free medium with or without test compound was
added to each well. After 22 sec, a second addition of Cl--free medium containing 2 - 10 PM
forskolin was added to activate AF508-CFTR. The extracellular Cl- concentration following
both additions was 28 mM, which promoted Cl- efflux in response to AF508-CFTR activation
and the resulting membrane depolarization was optically monitored using the FRET-based
voltage-sensor dyes.

        [00310] 4. Cell Culture
        [00311] NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing AF508-CFTR are used for optical
measurements of membrane potential. The cells are maintained at 37 'C in 5% CO 2 and 90 %
humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10 %
fetal bovine serum, 1 X NEAA, p-ME, I X pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm 2 culture
flasks. For all optical assays, the cells were seeded at 30,000/well in 384-well matrigel-coated
plates and cultured for 2 hrs at 37 'C before culturing at 27 'C for 24 hrs for the potentiator
assay. For the correction assays, the cells are cultured at 27 'C or 37 'C with and without
compounds for 16 - 24 hours.
        [00312] ElectrophysiologicalAssavs for assaving AF508-CFTR modulationproperties
of compounds
        [00313] 1. Using Chamber Assav
        [00314] Using chamber experiments were performed on polarized epithelial cells
expressing AF508-CFTR to further characterize the AF508-CFTR modulators identified in the
optical assays. FRTAF5 08-CFTR epithelial cells grown on Costar Snapwell cell culture inserts were
mounted in an Ussing chamber (Physiologic Instruments, Inc., San Diego, CA), and the
monolayers were continuously short-circuited using a Voltage-clamp System (Department of
Bioengineering, University of Iowa, IA, and, Physiologic Instruments, Inc., San Diego, CA).
                                                  -76-

Transepithelial resistance was measured by applying a 2-mV pulse. Under these conditions, the
FRT epithelia demonstrated resistances of 4 KQ/ cm 2 or more. The solutions were maintained
at 27 'C and bubbled with air. The electrode offset potential and fluid resistance were corrected
using a cell-free insert. Under these conditions, the current reflects the flow of Cl- through
AF508-CFTR expressed in the apical membrane. The Isc was digitally acquired using an
MP100A-CE interface and AcqKnowledge software (v3.2.6; BIOPAC Systems, Santa Barbara,
CA).
        [00315] 2. Identification of CorrectionCompounds
        [00316] Typical protocol utilized a basolateral to apical membrane Cl- concentration
gradient. To set up this gradient, normal ringer was used on the basolateral membrane, whereas
apical NaCl was replaced by equimolar sodium gluconate (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH) to
give a large Cl- concentration gradient across the epithelium. All experiments were performed
with intact monolayers. To fully activate AF508-CFTR, forskolin (10 pIM) and the PDE
inhibitor, IBMX (100 pM), were applied followed by the addition of the CFTR potentiator,
genistein (50 pM).
        [00317] As observed in other cell types, incubation at low temperatures of FRT cells
stably expressing AF508-CFTR increases the functional density of CFTR in the plasma
membrane. To determine the activity of correction compounds, the cells were incubated with
10 pM of the test compound for 24 hours at 37'C and were subsequently washed 3X prior to
recording. The cAMP- and genistein-mediated Isc in compound-treated cells was normalized to
the 27'C and 37'C controls and expressed as percentage activity. Preincubation of the cells
with the correction compound significantly increased the cAMP- and genistein-mediated Isc
compared to the 37'C controls.
        [00318] 3. Identification of PotentiatorCompounds
        [00319] Typical protocol utilized a basolateral to apical membrane Cl- concentration
gradient. To set up this gradient, normal ringers was used on the basolateral membrane and was
permeabilized with nystatin (360 ptg/ml), whereas apical NaCl was replaced by equimolar
sodium gluconate (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH) to give a large Cl- concentration gradient
across the epithelium. All experiments were performed 30 min after nystatin permeabilization.
                                                 -77-

Forskolin (10 pM) and all test compounds were added to both sides of the cell culture inserts.
The efficacy of the putative AF508-CFTR potentiators was compared to that of the known
potentiator, genistein.

                                                 7.4 with NaOH.

                                                 with Na Gluconate (135).
        [00321] 5. Cell Culture
        [00322] Fisher rat epithelial (FRT) cells expressing AF508-CFTR (FRTAF5 08-CFTR) were
used for Ussing chamber experiments for the putative AF508-CFTR modulators identified from
our optical assays. The cells were cultured on Costar Snapwell cell culture inserts and cultured
for five days at 37 'C and 5% CO2 in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with
5% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 tg/ml streptomycin. Prior to use for
characterizing the potentiator activity of compounds, the cells were incubated at 27 'C for 16
48 hrs to correct for the AF508-CFTR. To determine the activity of corrections compounds, the
cells were incubated at 27 'C or 37 'C with and without the compounds for 24 hours.
        [00323] 6. Whole-cell recordings
           The macroscopic AF508-CFTR current (IAF508) in temperature- and test compound
  corrected NIH3T3 cells stably expressing AF508-CFTR were monitored using the perforated
  patch, whole-cell recording. Briefly, voltage-clamp recordings of IAF508 were performed at
  room temperature using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc.,
  Foster City, CA). All recordings were acquired at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz and low
  pass filtered at 1 kHz. Pipettes had a resistance of 5 - 6 MQ when filled with the intracellular
  solution. Under these recording conditions, the calculated reversal potential for Cl- (Eci) at
                                                  -78-

  room temperature was -28 mV. All recordings had a seal resistance > 20 GQ and a series
  resistance < 15 MQ. Pulse generation, data acquisition, and analysis were performed using a
  PC equipped with a Digidata 1320 A/D interface in conjunction with Clampex 8 (Axon
  Instruments Inc.). The bath contained < 250      1dof saline and was continuously perifused at a
  rate of 2 ml/min using a gravity-driven perfusion system.
         [00324] 7. Identification of CorrectionCompounds
         [00325] To determine the activity of correction compounds for increasing the density of
functional AF508-CFTR in the plasma membrane, we used the above-described perforated
patch-recording techniques to measure the current density following 24-hr treatment with the
correction compounds. To fully activate AF508-CFTR, 10 p.M forskolin and 20 pM genistein
were added to the cells. Under our recording conditions, the current density following 24-hr
incubation at 27'C was higher than that observed following 24-hr incubation at 37 'C. These
results are consistent with the known effects of low-temperature incubation on the density of
AF508-CFTR in the plasma membrane. To determine the effects of correction compounds on
CFTR current density, the cells were incubated with 10 ptM of the test compound for 24 hours at
37'C and the current density was compared to the 27'C and 37'C controls (% activity). Prior to
recording, the cells were washed 3X with extracellular recording medium to remove any
remaining test compound. Preincubation with 10 pM of correction compounds significantly
increased the cAMP- and genistein-dependent current compared to the 37'C controls.
         [00326] 8. Identification of PotentiatorCompounds
         [00327] The ability of AF508-CFTR potentiators to increase the macroscopic AF508
CFTR Cl- current (IAF508) in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing AF508-CFTR was also investigated
using perforated-patch-recording techniques. The potentiators identified from the optical assays
evoked a dose-dependent increase in    IAF508 with similar potency and efficacy observed in the
optical assays. In all cells examined, the reversal potential before and during potentiator
application was around -30 mV, which is the calculated Eci (-28 mV).

         [00329] 10. Cell Culture
         [00330] NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing AF508-CFTR are used for whole
cell recordings. The cells are maintained at 37 'C in 5% CO 2 and 90 % humidity in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10 % fetal bovine serum, I X
NEAA, [-ME, 1 X pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm 2 culture flasks. For whole-cell
recordings, 2,500 - 5,000 cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips and
cultured for 24 - 48 hrs at 27 'C before use to test the activity of potentiators; and incubated
with or without the correction compound at 37 'C for measuring the activity of correctors.
         [00331]11. Single-channel recordings
         [00332] The single-channel activities of temperature-corrected AF508-CFTR stably
expressed in NIH3T3 cells and activities of potentiator compounds were observed using excised
inside-out membrane patch. Briefly, voltage-clamp recordings of single-channel activity were
performed at room temperature with an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon
Instruments Inc.). All recordings were acquired at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz and low
pass filtered at 400 Hz. Patch pipettes were fabricated from Coming Kovar Sealing #7052 glass
(World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) and had a resistance of 5 - 8 MQ when filled
with the extracellular solution. The AF508-CFTR was activated after excision, by adding 1 mM
Mg-ATP, and 75 nM of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (PKA; Promega
Corp. Madison, WI). After channel activity stabilized, the patch was perifused using a gravity
driven microperfusion system. The inflow was placed adjacent to the patch, resulting in
complete solution exchange within 1 - 2 sec. To maintain AF508-CFTR activity during the
                                                  -80-

rapid perifusion, the nonspecific phosphatase inhibitor F- (10 mM NaF) was added to the bath
solution. Under these recording conditions, channel activity remained constant throughout the
duration of the patch recording (up to 60 min). Currents produced by positive charge moving
from the intra- to extracellular solutions (anions moving in the opposite direction) are shown as
positive currents. The pipette potential (Vp) was maintained at 80 mV.
         [00333] Channel activity was analyzed from membrane patches containing         2 active
channels. The maximum number of simultaneous openings determined the number of active
channels during the course of an experiment. To determine the single-channel current
amplitude, the data recorded from 120 sec of AF508-CFTR activity was filtered "off-line" at
100 Hz and then used to construct all-point amplitude histograms that were fitted with
multigaussian functions using Bio-Patch Analysis software (Bio-Logic Comp. France). The
total microscopic current and open probability (Po) were determined from 120 sec of channel
activity. The Po was determined using the Bio-Patch software or from the relationship Po     =
I/i(N), where I = mean current, i = single-channel current amplitude, and N = number of active
channels in patch.
