15                                 Background of the Invention
             The mucosal surfaces at the interface between the environment and the body
     have evolved a number of "innate defenses", i.e., protective mechanisms. A principal
     form of such innate defense is to cleanse these surfaces with liquid. Typically, the
20   quantity of the liquid layer on a mucosal surface reflects the balance between
     epithelial liquid secretion, often reflecting anion (CI- and/or HCO-) secretion coupled
     with water (and a cation counter-ion), and epithelial liquid absorption, often reflecting
     Na* absorption, coupled with water and counter anion (CI- and/or HC0 3 ).              Many
     diseases of mucosal surfaces are caused by too little protective liquid on those
25   mucosal surfaces created by an imbalance between secretion (too little) and
     absorption (relatively too much).         The defective salt transport processes that
     characterize these mucosal dysfunctions reside in the epithelial layer of the mucosal
     surface.
              One approach to replenish the protective liquid layer on mucosal surfaces is
30   to "re-balance" the system by blocking Na* channels and liquid absorption.               The
     epithelial protein that mediates the rate-limiting step of Na* and liquid absorption is
     the epithelial Na* channel ("ENaC"). ENaC is positioned on the apical surface of the
     epithelium, i.e. the mucosal surface-environmental interface.      Ideally, to inhibit ENaC
     mediated Na* and liquid absorption, an ENaC blocker of the amiloride class will be
35   delivered to the mucosal surface and maintained at this site to achieve maximum
     therapeutic benefit.
                                                   1

              The use of ENaC blockers has been reported for a variety of diseases which
     are ameliorated by increased mucosal hydration.           In particular, the use of ENaC
     blockers in the treatment of respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), and
     COPD, including chronic bronchitis (CB) and emphysema, which reflect the body's
 5   failure to clear mucus normally from the lungs and ultimately result in chronic airway
     infection has been reported. See, Evidence for airway surface dehydration as the
     initiating event in CF airway disease, R. C. Boucher, Journal of Internal Medicine,
     Vol. 261, Issue 1, January 2007, pages 5-16; and Cystic fibrosis: a disease of
     vulnerability to airway surface dehydration, R.C. Boucher, Trends in Molecular
10   Medicine, Vol. 13, Issue 6, June 2007, pages 231-240.
              Data indicate that the initiating problem in both CB and CF is the failure to
     clear mucus from airway surfaces. The failure to clear mucus reflects an imbalance in
     the quantities of mucus as airway surface liquid (ASL) on airway surfaces. This
     imbalance results in a relative reduction in ASL which leads to mucus concentration,
15   reduction in the lubricant activity of the periciliary liquid (PCL), mucus adherence to
     the airway surface, and failure to clear mucus via ciliary activity to the mouth. The
     reduction in mucus clearance leads to chronic bacterial colonization of mucus
     adherent to airway surfaces.        The chronic retention of bacteria, inability of local
     antimicrobial substances to kill mucus-entrapped bacteria on a chronic basis, and the
20   consequent chronic inflammatory response to this type of surface infection, are
     manifest in CB and CF.
              There is currently a large, unmet medical need for products that specifically
     treat the variety of diseases which are ameliorated by increased mucosal hydration,
     including CB, COPD and CF, among others. The current therapies for CB, COPD
25   and CF focus on treating the symptoms and/or the late effects of these diseases.
     However, none of these therapies effectively treat the fundamental problem of the
     failure to clear mucus from the lung.
              R.C. Boucher, in U.S. 6,264,975, describes the use of pyrazinoylguanidine
     sodium channel blockers for hydrating mucosal surfaces typified by the well-known
30   diuretics amiloride, benzamil, and phenamil.           However, these compounds are
     relatively impotent, considering the limited mass of drug that can be inhaled to the
     lung; (2) rapidly absorbed, and thereby exhibiting undesirably short half-life on the
     mucosal surface; and (3) are freely dissociable from ENaC. More potent drugs with
     longer half-lives on the mucosal surface are needed.
35            Too little protective surface liquid on other mucosal surfaces is a common
     pathophysiology of a number of diseases. For example, in xerostomia (dry mouth)
     the oral cavity is depleted of liquid due to a failure of the parotid sublingual and
                                                  2

     submandibular glands to secrete liquid despite continued Na* (ENaC) transport
     mediated liquid absorption from the oral cavity. Keratoconjunctivitis sira (dry eye) is
     caused by failure of lacrimal glands to secrete liquid in the face of continued Na*
     dependent liquid absorption on conjunctional surfaces. In rhinosinusitis, there is an
 5   imbalance between mucin secretion and relative ASL depletion. Failure to secrete
     Cl- (and liquid) in the proximal small intestine, combined with increased Na* (and
     liquid) absorption in the terminal ileum leads to the distal intestinal obstruction
     syndrome (DIOS).      In older patients excessive Na* (and volume) absorption in the
     descending colon produces constipation and diverticulitis.

             As used herein, the following terms are defined as indicated.
             "A compound of the invention" means a compound of Formula (A) or a salt
15   thereof, particularly a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
             "A compound of Formula (A)" means a compound having the structural
     formula designated herein as Formula (A).        Compounds of Formula (A) include
     solvates and hydrates (i.e., adducts of a compound of Formula (A) with a solvent). In
     those embodiments wherein a compound of Formula (A) includes one or more chiral
                                                   19

   WO 2014/099673                                                             PCT/US2013/075093
     centers, the phrase is intended to encompass each individual stereoisomer including
     optical isomers (enantiomers and diastereomers) and geometric isomers (cis-/trans
     isomerism) and mixtures of stereoisomers. In addition, compounds of Formula (A)
     also include tautomers of the depicted formula(s).
 5           Throughout the description and examples, compounds are named using
     standard IUPAC naming principles, where possible, including the use of the
     ChemDraw       Ultra  11.0 software     program    for naming compounds, sold by
     CambridgeSoft Corp./Perkin Elmer.
              In some chemical structure representations where carbon atoms do not have
10   a sufficient number of attached variables depicted to produce a valence of four, the
     remaining carbon substituents needed to provide a valence of four should be
     assumed to be hydrogen. Similarly, in some chemical structures where a bond is
     drawn without specifying the terminal group, such bond is indicative of a methyl (Me,
     -CH3) group, as is conventional in the art.
15           The compounds of Formula I, may be in the form of a free base or a salt,
     particularly a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. For a review of pharmaceutically
     acceptable salts see Berge et al., J. Pharma Sci. (1977) 66:1-19.
              Pharmaceutically acceptable salts formed from inorganic or organic acids
     include for example, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulfate, bisulfate,
20   nitrate, sulfamate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, acetate, trifluoroacetate,
     maleate, malate, fumarate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, formate, gluconate, succinate,
     pyruvate, tannate, ascorbate, palmitate, salicylate, stearate, phthalate, alginate,
     polyglutamate, oxalate, oxaloacetate, saccharate, benzoate, alkyl or aryl sulfonates
     (e.g., methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate or
25   naphthalenesulfonate) and isothionate; complexes formed with amino acids such as
     lysine, arginine, glutamic acid, glycine, serine, threonine, alanine, isoleucine, leucine
     and the like. The compounds of the invention may also be in the form of salts formed
     from elemental anions such as chlorine, bromine or iodine.
              For therapeutic use, salts of active ingredients of the compounds of Formula
30   (A) will be pharmaceutically acceptable, i.e. they will be salts derived from a
     pharmaceutically acceptable acid.          However, salts of acids which are not
     pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or
     purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. Trifluoroacetate salts, for
     example, may find such use.             All salts, whether or not derived from a
35   pharmaceutically acceptable acid, are within the scope of the present invention.

              The term "chiral" refers to molecules which have the property of non
     superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term "achiral" refers to
     molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.
              The term "stereoisomers" refers to compounds which have identical chemical
 5   constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in
     space. "Diastereomer" refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality
     and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have
     different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties,
     and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution
10   analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography. "Enantiomers"
     refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror
     images of one another.
              Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P.
     Parker, Ed., MCGRAW-HILL DICTIONARY OF CHEMICAL TERMS (1984) McGraw-Hill
15   Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., STEREOCHEMISTRY OF
     ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (1994) John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.
              Use of the wavy or undulating symbol (       '^'  )in the structures herein is
     understood to indicate a point through which the structure shown is bonded to
     another portion of a molecule.
20            Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the
     ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active
     compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute
     configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). A specific stereoisomer may
     also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called
25   an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic
     mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or
     stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms "racemic mixture" and
     "racemate" refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species.
              The term "tautomers" refers to a type of stereoisomer in which migration of a
30   hydrogen atom results in two or more structures. The compounds of Formula (A)
     may exist in different tautomeric forms.     One skilled in the art will recognize that
     amidines, amides, guanidines, ureas, thioureas, heterocycles and the like can exist in
     tautomeric forms. By way of example and not by way of limitation, compounds of
     Formula (A) can exist in various tautomeric forms as shown below:

              All possible tautomeric forms of the amidines, amides, guanidines, ureas,
     thioureas, heterocycles and the like of all of the embodiments of Formula (A) are
 5   within the scope of the instant invention. Tautomers exist in equilibrium and thus the
     depiction of a single tautomer in the formulas provided will be understood by those
     skilled in the art to refer equally to all possible tautomers.
              It is to be noted that all enantiomers, diastereomers, and racemic mixtures,
     tautomers, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs of compounds within the scope of
10   Formula (A) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are embraced by the
     present invention. All mixtures of such enantiomers and diastereomers, including
     enantiomerically enriched mixtures and diastereomerically enriched mixtures are
     within the scope of the present invention. Enantiomerically enriched mixtures are
     mixtures of enantiomers wherein the ratio of the specified enantiomer to the
15   alternative enantiomer is greater than 50:50. More particularly, an enantiomerically
     enriched mixture comprises at least about 75% of the specified enantiomer, and
     preferably at least about 85% of the specified enantiomer. In one embodiment, the
     enantiomerically enriched mixture is substantially free of the other enantiomer.
     Similarly, diastereomerically enriched mixtures are mixtures of diastereomers
20   wherein amount of the specified diastereomer is greater than the amount of each
     alternative diastereomer.       More particularly, a diastereomerically enriched mixture
     comprises at least about 75% of the specified diastereomer, and preferably at least
     about 85% of the specified diastereomer. In one embodiment, the diastereomerically
     enriched mixture is substantially free of all other diastereomers.             The term
25   "substantially free of" will be understood by those skilled in the art to indicate less
     than a 5% presence of other diastereomers, preferably less than 1%, more preferably
     less than 0.1%.      In other embodiments no other diastereomers will be present or the
     amount of any other diastereomers present will be below the level of detection.
     Stereoisomers may be separated by techniques known in the art, including high
30   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and crystallization of chiral salts.

             A single stereoisomer,      e.g. an enantiomer, substantially free of its
     stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method
     such as formation of diastereomers          using optically active resolving agents
     ("Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds," (1962) by E. L. Eliel, McGraw Hill;
 5   Lochmuller, C. H., (1975) J. Chromatogr., 113:(3) 283-302). Racemic mixtures of
     chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable
     method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds
     and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of
     diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the
10   diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the
     substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions.

     in which there is no long-range order of the positions of the atoms in the solid. This
     definition applies as well when the crystal size is two nanometers or less. Additives,
     including solvents, may be used to create the amorphous forms of the instant
25   invention. The instant invention, including all pharmaceutical compositions, methods
     of treatment, combination products, and uses thereof described herein, comprises all
     amorphous forms of the compounds of Formula (A) and pharmaceutically acceptable
     salts thereof.
30   USES
              The compounds of the invention exhibit activity as sodium channel blockers.
     Without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the compounds of the
     invention may function in vivo by blocking epithelial sodium channels present in
     mucosal surfaces and thereby reduce the absorption of water by the mucosal
35   surfaces. This effect increases the volume of protective liquids on mucosal surfaces,
     and rebalances the system.

              As a consequence, the compounds of the invention are useful as
     medicaments, particularly for the treatment of clinical conditions for which a sodium
     channel blocker may be indicated.        Such conditions include pulmonary conditions
     such as diseases associated with reversible or irreversible airway obstruction,
 5   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including acute exacerbations of
     COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis (including bronchiectasis due to conditions other than
     cystic fibrosis), acute bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, post-viral cough, cystic fibrosis,
     emphysema, pneumonia, panbronchiolitis, and transplant-associated bronchiolitis,
     including lung- and bone marrow-transplant associated bronchiolitis, in a human in
10   need thereof. The compounds of the invention may also be useful for treating
     ventilator-associated    tracheobronchitis   and/or    preventing   ventilator-associated
     pneumonia in ventilated patients.       The present invention comprises methods for
     treating each of these conditions in a mammal in need thereof, preferably in a human
     in need thereof, each method comprising administering to said mammal a
15   pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention, or a
     pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.       Also provided are (a) a method for
     reducing exacerbations of COPD in a mammal in need thereof;            (b) a method for
     reducing exacerbations of CF in a mammal in need thereof;              (c) a method of

20   improving lung function (FEV1) in a mammal experiencing COPD, (e) a method of
     improving lung function (FEV1) in a mammal experiencing CF, (f) a method of
     reducing airway infections in a mammal in need thereof.
              Also provided is a method of stimulating, enhancing or improving mucociliary
     clearance in a mammal, the method comprising administering to a mammal in need
25   thereof a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (A), or a
     pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Mucociliary clearance will be understood to
     include the natural mucociliary actions involved in the transfer or clearance of mucus
     in the airways, including the self-clearing mechanisms of the bronchi. Therefore, also
     provided is a method of improving mucus clearance in the airways of a mammal in
30   need thereof.
              Additionally, sodium channel blockers may be indicated for the treatment of
     conditions which are ameliorated by increased mucosal hydration in mucosal
     surfaces other than pulmonary mucosal surfaces.           Examples of such conditions
     include dry mouth (xerostomia), dry skin, vaginal dryness, sinusitis, rhinosinusitis,
35   nasal dehydration, including nasal dehydration brought on by administering dry
     oxygen, dry eye, Sjogren's disease, otitis media, primary ciliary dyskinesia, distal

              The terms "effective amount", "pharmaceutically effective amount", "effective
10   dose", and "pharmaceutically effective dose" as used herein, refer to an amount of
     compound of the invention which is sufficient in the subject to which it is
     administered, to elicit the biological or medical response of a cell culture, tissue,
     system, or mammal (including human) that is being sought, for instance by a
     researcher or clinician. The term also includes within its scope, amounts effective to
15   enhance normal physiological function. In one embodiment, the effective amount is
     the amount needed to provide a desired level of drug in the secretions and tissues of
     the airways and lungs, or alternatively, in the bloodstream of a subject to be treated
     to give an anticipated physiological response or desired biological effect when such a
     composition is administered by inhalation.       For example an effective amount of a
20   compound of the invention for the treatment of a condition for which a sodium
     channel blocker is indicated is sufficient in the subject to which it is administered to
     treat the particular condition. In one embodiment an effective amount is an amount
     of a compound of the invention which is sufficient for the treatment of COPD or cystic
     fibrosis in a human.
25            The precise effective amount of the compounds of the invention will depend

     bioavailability, potency, and other properties of the specific compound being
     administered, the nature of the formulation, the route of administration, and the
30   delivery device, and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or
     veterinarian.   Further guidance with respect to appropriate dose may be found in
     considering conventional dosing of other sodium channel blockers, such as
     amiloride, with due consideration also being given to any differences in potency
     between amiloride and the compounds of the present invention.

             The foregoing suggested doses may be adjusted using conventional dose
 5   calculations if the compound is administered via a different route. Determination of
     an appropriate dose for administration by other routes is within the skill of those in
     the art in light of the foregoing description and the general knowledge in the art.
              Delivery of an effective amount of a compound of the invention may entail
     delivery of a single dosage form or multiple unit doses which may be delivered
10   contemporaneously or separate in time over a designated period, such as 24 hours.
     A dose of a compound of the invention (alone or in the form of a composition
     comprising the same) may be administered from one to ten times per day. Typically,
     a compound of the invention (alone or in the form of a composition comprising the
     same) will be administered four, three, two, or one time(s) per day (24 hours).
15           The compounds of Formula (A) of the present invention are also useful for
     treating airborne infections. Examples of airborne infections include, for example,
     RSV. The compounds of Formula (A) of the present invention are also useful for
     treating an anthrax infection. The present invention relates to the use of the
     compounds of Formula (A) of the present invention for prophylactic, post-exposure
20   prophylactic, preventive or therapeutic treatment against diseases or conditions
     caused by pathogens. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to
     the use of the compounds of Formula                (A) for prophylactic, post-exposure
     prophylactic, preventive or therapeutic treatment against diseases or conditions
     caused by pathogens which may be used in bioterrorism.
25            In recent years, a variety of research programs and biodefense measures
     have been put into place to deal with concerns about the use of biological agents in
     acts of terrorism.      These measures are intended to address concerns regarding
     bioterrorism or the use of microorganisms or biological toxins to kill people, spread
     fear, and disrupt society. For example, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
30   Diseases (NIAID) has developed a Strategic Plan for Biodefense Research which
     outlines plans for addressing research needs in the broad area of bioterrorism and
     emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. According to the plan, the deliberate
     exposure of the civilian population of the United States to Bacillus anthracis spores
     revealed a gap in the nation's overall preparedness against bioterrorism. Moreover,
35   the report details that these attacks uncovered an unmet need for tests to rapidly
     diagnose, vaccines and immunotherapies to prevent, and drugs and biologics to cure
     disease caused by agents of bioterrorism.

   WO 2014/099673                                                            PCT/US2013/075093
              Much of the focus of the various research efforts has been directed to
     studying the biology of the pathogens identified as potentially dangerous as
     bioterrorism agents, studying the host response against such agents, developing
     vaccines against infectious diseases, evaluating the therapeutics currently available
 5   and under investigation against such agents, and developing diagnostics to identify
     signs and symptoms of threatening agents. Such efforts are laudable but, given the
     large number of pathogens which have been identified as potentially available for
     bioterrorism, these efforts have not yet been able to provide satisfactory responses
     for all possible bioterrorism threats. Additionally, many of the pathogens identified as
10   potentially dangerous as agents of bioterrorism do not provide adequate economic
     incentives for the development of therapeutic or preventive measures by industry.
     Moreover, even if preventive measures such as vaccines were available for each
     pathogen which may be used in bioterrorism, the cost of administering all such
     vaccines to the general population is prohibitive.
15            Until convenient and effective treatments are available against every
     bioterrorism threat, there exists a strong need for preventative, prophylactic or
     therapeutic treatments which can prevent or reduce the risk of infection from
     pathogenic agents.
              The present invention provides such methods of prophylactic treatment. In
20   one aspect, a prophylactic treatment method is provided comprising administering a
     prophylactically effective amount of the compounds of Formula (A) to an individual in
     need of prophylactic treatment against infection from one or more airborne
     pathogens. A particular example of an airborne pathogen is anthrax.
              In another aspect, a prophylactic treatment method is provided for reducing
25   the risk of infection from an airborne pathogen which can cause a disease in a
     human, said method comprising administering an effective amount of the compounds
     of Formula (A) to the lungs of the human who may be at risk of infection from the
     airborne pathogen but is asymptomatic for the disease, wherein the effective amount
     of a sodium channel blocker and osmolye are sufficient to reduce the risk of infection
30   in the human. A particular example of an airborne pathogen is anthrax.
              In another aspect, a post-exposure prophylactic treatment or therapeutic
     treatment method is provided for treating infection from an airborne pathogen
     comprising administering an effective amount of the compounds of Formula (A) to the
     lungs of an individual in need of such treatment against infection from an airborne
35   pathogen. The pathogens which may be protected against by the prophylactic post
     exposure, rescue and therapeutic treatment methods of the invention include any
     pathogens which may enter the body through the mouth, nose or nasal airways, thus
                                                 34

   WO 2014/099673                                                              PCT/US2013/075093
     proceeding into the lungs.      Typically, the pathogens will be airborne pathogens,
     either naturally occurring or by aerosolization. The pathogens may be naturally
     occurring or may have been introduced into the environment intentionally after
     aerosolization or other method of introducing the pathogens into the environment.
 5   Many pathogens which are not naturally transmitted in the air have been or may be
     aerosolized for use in bioterrorism. The pathogens for which the treatment of the
     invention may be useful includes, but is not limited to, category A, B and C priority
     pathogens as set forth by the NIAID. These categories correspond generally to the
     lists compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As set up
10   by the CDC, Category A agents are those that can be easily disseminated or
     transmitted person-to-person, cause high mortality, with potential for major public
     health impact.    Category B agents are next in priority and include those that are
     moderately easy to disseminate and cause moderate morbidity and low mortality.
     Category C consists of emerging pathogens that could be engineered for mass
15   dissemination in the future because of their availability, ease of production and
     dissemination and potential for high morbidity and mortality. Particular examples of
     these pathogens are anthrax and plague. Additional pathogens which may be
     protected against or the infection risk therefrom reduced include influenza viruses,
     rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and respiratory syncytial viruses, and the like. A further
20   pathogen which may be protected against is the coronavirus which is believed to
     cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
             The present invention also relates to the use of sodium channel blockers of
     Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for preventing, mitigating,
     and/or treating deterministic health effects to the respiratory tract caused by
25   exposure to radiological materials, particularly respirable aerosols containing
     radionuclides from nuclear attacks, such as detonation of radiological dispersal
     devices (RDD), or accidents, such as nuclear power plant disasters.             As such,
     provided herein is a method for preventing, mitigating, and/or treating deterministic
     health effects to the respiratory tract and/or other bodily organs caused by respirable
30   aerosols containing radionuclides in a recipient in need thereof, including in a human
     in need thereof, said method comprising administering to said human an effective
     amount of a compound of Formula (A), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
             A major concern associated with consequence management planning for
     exposures of members of the public to respirable aerosols containing radionuclides
35   from nuclear attacks, such as detonation of radiological dispersal devices (RDD), or
     accidents, such as nuclear power plant disasters is how to prevent, mitigate or treat
     potential deterministic health effects to the respiratory tract, primarily the lung. It is
                                                 35

   WO 2014/099673                                                              PCT/US2013/075093
     necessary to have drugs, techniques and procedures, and trained personnel
     prepared to manage and treat such highly internally contaminated individuals.
              Research has been conducted to determine ways in which to prevent,
     mitigate or treat potential damage to the respiratory tract and various organs in the
 5   body that is caused by internally deposited radionuclides.        To date, most of the
     research attention has focused on strategies designed to mitigate health effects from
     internally deposited radionuclides by accelerating their excretion or removal. These
     strategies have focused on soluble chemical forms that are capable of reaching the
     blood stream and are deposited at remote systemic sites specific to a given
10   radioelement.     Such approaches will not work in cases where the deposited
     radionuclide is in relatively insoluble form.   Studies have shown that many, if not
     most of the physicochemical forms of dispersed radionuclides from RDDs, will be in
     relatively insoluble form.
              The only method known to effectively reduce the radiation dose to the lungs
15   from inhaled insoluble radioactive aerosols is bronchoalveolar lavage or BAL. This
     technique, which was adapted from that already in use for the treatment of patients
     with alveolar proteinosis, has been shown to be a safe, repeatable procedure, even
     when performed over an extended period of time. Although there are variations in
     procedure, the basic method for BAL is to anaesthetize the subject, followed by the
20   slow introduction of isotonic saline into a single lobe of the lung until the function
     residual capacity is reached. Additional volumes are then added and drained by
     gravity.
              The results of studies using BAL on animals indicate that about 40% of the
     deep lung content can be removed by a reasonable sequence of BALs. In some
25   studies, there was considerable variability among animals in the amount of
     radionuclide recovered. The reasons for the variability are currently not understood.
              Further, based on a study on animals, it is believed that a significant dose
     reduction from BAL therapy results in mitigation of health effects due to inhalation of
     insoluble radionuclides.     In the study, adult dogs inhaled insoluble       1 44
                                                                                        Ce-FAP
30   particles. Two groups of dogs were given lung contents of         144
                                                                           Ce known to cause
     radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis (about 2 MBq/kg body mass), with one
     group being treated with 10 unilateral lavages between 2 and 56 days after exposure,
     the other untreated. A third group was exposed at a level of 1 44 Ce comparable to that
     seen in the BAL-treated group after treatment (about 1 MBq/kg), but these animals
35   were untreated. All animals were allowed to live their lifespans, which extended to

     Nevertheless, the effect of BAL in reducing the risk from pneumonitis/fibrosis was
     evident from the survival curves . In the untreated dogs with lung contents of 1.5-2.5
     MBq/kg, the mean survival time was 370  65 d. For the treated dogs, the mean
     survival was 1270  240 d, which was statistically significantly different. The third

                                                      Ce of 0.6-1.4 MBq had a mean survival
     time of 1800  230, which was not statistically different from the treated group.
     Equally important to the increased survival, the dogs in the high-dose untreated
     group died from deterministic effects to lung (pneumonitis/fibrosis) while the treated
     dogs did not.    Instead, the treated dogs, like the dogs in the low-dose untreated
10   group, mostly had lung tumors (hemangiosarcoma or carcinoma).             Therefore, the
     reduction in dose resulting from BAL treatment appears to have produced biological
     effects in lung that were predictable based on the radiation doses that the lungs
     received.
              Based on these results, it is believed that decreasing the residual radiological
15   dose further by any method or combination of methods for enhancing the clearance
     of particles from the lung would further decrease the probability of health effects to
     lung.   However, BAL is a procedure that has many drawbacks.            BAL is a highly
     invasive procedure that must be performed at specialized medical centers by trained
     pulmonologists. As such, a BAL procedure is expensive. Given the drawbacks of
20   BAL, it is not a treatment option that would be readily and immediately available to
     persons in need of accelerated removal of radioactive particles, for example, in the
     event of a nuclear attack. In the event of a nuclear attack or a nuclear accident,
     immediate and relatively easily administered treatment for persons who have been
     exposed or who are at risk of being exposed is needed. Sodium channel blockers
25   administered as an inhalation aerosol have been shown to restore hydration of
     airway surfaces. Such hydration of airway surfaces aids in clearing accumulated
     mucus secretions and associated particulate matter from the lung. As such, without
     being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that sodium channel blockers can
     be used to accelerate the removal of radioactive particles from airway passages.
30            As discussed above, the greatest risk to the lungs following a radiological
     attack, such as a dirty bomb, results from the inhalation and retention of insoluble
     radioactive particles. As a result of radioactive particle retention, the cumulative
     exposure to the lung is significantly increased, ultimately resulting in pulmonary
     fibrosis/pneumonitis and potentially death. Insoluble particles cannot be systemically
35   cleared by chelating agents because these particles are not in solution. To date, the
     physical removal of particulate matter through BAL is the only therapeutic regimen
     shown to be effective at mitigating radiation-induced lung disease. As discussed
                                                  37

   WO 2014/099673                                                               PCT/US2013/075093
     above, BAL is not a realistic treatment solution for reducing the effects of radioactive
     particles that have been inhaled into the body. As such, it is desirable to provide a
     therapeutic regimen that effectively aids in clearing radioactive particles from airway
     passages and that, unlike BAL, is relatively simple to administer and scalable in a
 5   large-scale radiation exposure scenario.       In addition, it is also desirable that the
     therapeutic regimen be readily available to a number of people in a relatively short
     period of time.
              In an aspect of the present invention, a method for preventing, mitigating,
     and/or treating deterministic health effects to the respiratory tract and/or other bodily
10   organs     caused    by   respirable   aerosols containing      radionuclides  comprises
     administering an effective amount of a sodium channel blocker of Formula (A) or a
     pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to an individual in need. In a feature of this
     aspect, the sodium channel blocker is administered in conjunction with an osmolyte.
     With further regard to this feature, the osmolyte is hypertonic saline (HS). In a further
15   feature, the sodium channel blocker and the osmolyte are administered in
     conjunction with an ion transport modulator. With further regard to this feature, the
     ion transport modulator may be selected from the group consisting of p-agonists,
     CFTR potentiators, purinergic receptor agonists, lubiprostones, and protease
     inhibitors. In another feature of this aspect, the radionuclides are selected from the
20   group consisting of Colbalt-60, Cesium-137, Iridium-192, Radium-226, Phospohrus
     32, Strontium-89 and 90, lodine-125, Thallium-201,               Lead-210, Thorium-234,
     Uranium-238, Plutonium, Cobalt-58, Chromium-51, Americium, and Curium.               In a
     further feature, the radionuclides are from a radioactive disposal device.         In yet
     another feature, the sodium channel blocker or pharmaceutically acceptable salt
25   thereof is administered in an aerosol suspension of respirable particles which the
     individual inhales.     In an additional feature, the sodium channel blocker or a
     pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered post-exposure to the
     radionuclides.

              The pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s), diluent(s) or carrier(s) must be
     acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the
     formulation     and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.                   Generally, the
     pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s), diluent(s) or carrier(s) employed in the
20   pharmaceutical formulation are "non-toxic" meaning that it/they is/are deemed safe
     for consumption in the amount delivered in the formulation and "inert" meaning that
     it/they does/do not appreciable react with or result in an undesired effect on the
     therapeutic activity of the active ingredient(s).                Pharmaceutically acceptable
     excipients, diluents and carriers are conventional in the art and may be selected
25   using conventional techniques, based upon the desired route of administration. See,
     REMINGTON'S, PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2 1s Ed
     (May 1, 2005). Preferably, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s), diluent(s) or
     carrier(s) are Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) according to the FDA.

     most suitable route of administration may depend upon, several factors including the
     patient and the condition or disorder being treated.
             The formulations may be presented in unit dosage form or in bulk form as for
     example in the case of formulations to be metered by an inhaler and may be
 5   prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Generally, the
     methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the
     carrier, diluent or excipient and optionally one or more accessory ingredients.         In
     general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into
     association the active ingredient with one or more liquid carriers, diluents or
10   excipients or finely divided solid carriers, diluents or excipients, or both, and then, if
     necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.
              In one preferred embodiment, the composition is an inhalable pharmaceutical
     composition which is suitable for inhalation and delivery to the endobronchial space.
     Typically, such composition is in the form of an aerosol comprising particles for
15   delivery using a nebulizer, pressurized metered dose inhaler (MDI), softmist inhaler,
     or dry powder inhaler (DPI). The aerosol formulation used in the methods of the
     present invention may be a liquid (e.g., solution) suitable for administration by a
     nebulizer, softmist inhaler, or MDI, or a dry powder suitable for administration by an
     MDI or DPI.
20           Aerosols used to administer medicaments to the respiratory tract are typically
     polydisperse; that is they are comprised of particles of many different sizes. The
     particle size distribution is typically described by the Mass Median Aerodynamic
     Diameter (MMAD) and the Geometric Standard Deviation (GSD). For optimum drug
     delivery to the endobronchial space the MMAD is in the range from about 1 to about
25   10 pm and preferably from about 1 to about 5 pm, and the GSD is less than 3, and
     preferably less than about 2. Aerosols having a MMAD above 10 pm are generally
     too large when inhaled to reach the lungs. Aerosols with a GSD greater than about 3
     are not preferred for lung delivery as they deliver a high percentage of the
     medicament to the oral cavity. To achieve these particle sizes in powder formulation,
30   the particles of the active ingredient may be size reduced using conventional
     techniques such as micronisation or spray drying. Non-limiting examples of other
     processes or techniques that can be used to produce respirable particles include
     spray drying, precipitation, supercritical fluid, and freeze drying. The desired fraction
     may be separated out by air classification or sieving.          In one embodiment, the
35   particles will be crystalline. For liquid formulations, the particle size is determined by
     the selection of a particular model of nebulizer, softmist inhaler, or MDI.

   WO 2014/099673                                                            PCT/US2013/075093
              Aerosol particle size distributions are determined using devices well known in
     the art.    For example a multi-stage Anderson cascade impactor or other suitable
     method such as those specifically cited within the US Pharmacopoeia Chapter 601 as
     characterizing devices for aerosols emitted from metered-dose and dry powder
 5   inhalers.
              Dry powder compositions for topical delivery to the lung by inhalation may be
     formulated without excipient or carrier and instead including only the active
     ingredients in a dry powder form having a suitable particle size for inhalation. Dry
     powder compositions may also contain a mix of the active ingredient and a suitable
10   powder base (carrier/diluent/excipient substance) such as mono-, di- or poly
     saccharides (e.g., lactose or starch). Lactose is typically the preferred excipient for
     dry powder formulations.       When a solid excipient such as lactose is employed,
     generally the particle size of the excipient will be much greater than the active
     ingredient to aid the dispersion of the formulation in the inhaler.
15            Non-limiting examples of dry powder inhalers include reservoir multi-dose
     inhalers, pre-metered multi-dose inhalers, capsule-based inhalers and single-dose
     disposable inhalers. A reservoir inhaler contains a large number of doses (e.g. 60) in
     one container. Prior to inhalation, the patient actuates the inhaler which causes the
     inhaler to meter one dose of medicament from the reservoir and prepare it for
20   inhalation. Examples of reservoir DPIs include but are not limited to the Turbohaler@
     by AstraZeneca and the ClickHaler@ by Vectura.
              In a pre-metered multi-dose inhaler, each individual dose has been
     manufactured in a separate container, and actuation of the inhaler prior to inhalation
     causes a new dose of drug to be released from its container and prepared for
25   inhalation. Examples of multidose DPI inhalers include but are not limited to Diskus@
     by GSK, Gyrohaler@ by Vectura, and Prohaler@ by Valois. During inhalation, the
     inspiratory flow of the patient accelerates the powder out of the device and into the
     oral cavity. For a capsule inhaler, the formulation is in a capsule and stored outside
     the inhaler. The patient puts a capsule in the inhaler, actuates the inhaler (punctures
30   the capsule), then inhales.      Examples include the RotohalerTM (GlaxoSmithKline),
     Spinhaler  TM
                    (Novartis), HandiHalerTM (IB), TurboSpin T M (PH&T). With single-dose
     disposable inhalers, the patient actuates the inhaler to prepare it for inhalation,
     inhales, then disposes of the inhaler and packaging. Examples include the
     TwincerTM (U Groningen), OneDoseTM (GFE), and Manta InhalerTM (Manta Devices).
35            Generally, dry powder inhalers utilize turbulent flow characteristics of the
     powder path to cause the excipient-drug aggregates to disperse, and the particles of
     active ingredient are deposited in the lungs. However, certain dry powder inhalers

     utilize a cyclone dispersion chamber to produce particles of the desired respirable
     size. In a cyclone dispersion chamber, the drug enters a coin shaped dispersion
     chamber tangentially so that the air path and drug move along the outer circular wall.
     As the drug formulation moves along this circular wall it bounces around and
 5   agglomerates are broken apart by impact forces. The air path spirals towards the
     center of the chamber exiting vertically.         Particles that have small enough
     aerodynamic sizes can follow the air path and exit the chamber.            In effect, the
     dispersion chamber works like a small jet mill.     Depending on the specifics of the
     formulation, large lactose particles may be added to the formulation to aid in the
10   dispersion through impact with the API particles.
              The TwincerTM single-dose disposable inhaler appears to operate using a
     coin-shaped cyclone dispersion chamber referred to as an "air classifier." See, U.S.

              In preferred embodiments, the aerosol formulation is delivered as a dry
     powder using a dry powder inhaler wherein the particles emitted from the inhaler

              In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention
     is a dry powder for inhalation which is formulated for delivery by a Diskus@-type
     device. The Diskus@ device comprises an elongate strip formed from a base sheet
30   having a plurality of recesses spaced along its length and a lid sheet hermetically but
     peelably sealed thereto to define a plurality of containers, each container having
     therein an inhalable formulation containing a predetermined amount of active
     ingredient either alone or in admixture with one or more carriers or excipients (e.g.,
     lactose) and/or other therapeutically active agents. Preferably, the strip is sufficiently
35   flexible to be wound into a roll. The lid sheet and base sheet will preferably have
     leading end portions which are not sealed to one another and at least one of the
     leading end portions is constructed to be attached to a winding means.               Also,
                                                44

   WO 2014/099673                                                           PCT/US2013/075093
     preferably the hermetic seal between the base and lid sheets extends over their
     whole width. To prepare the dose for inhalation, the lid sheet may preferably be
     peeled from the base sheet in a longitudinal direction from a first end of the base
     sheet.
 5             In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention
     is a dry powder for inhalation which is formulated for delivery using a single-dose
     disposable inhaler, and particularly the TwincerTM inhaler.     The TwincerTM inhaler
     comprises a foil laminate blister with one or more recesses and a lid sheet
     hermetically but peelably sealed thereto to define a plurality of containers. Each
10   container has therein an inhalable formulation containing a predetermined amount of
     active ingredient(s) either alone or in admixture with one or more carriers or
     excipients (e.g., lactose).   The lid sheet will preferably have a leading end portion
     which is constructed to project from the body of the inhaler. The patient would
     operate the device and thereby administer the aerosol formulation by 1) removing the
15   outer packaging overwrap, 2) pulling the foil tab to uncover the drug in the blister and
     3) inhaling the drug from the blister.
               In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation according to the
     invention is a dry powder for inhalation wherein the dry powder is formulated into
     microparticles     as described     in PCT    Publication   No.   W02009/015286       or
20   W02007/114881, both to NexBio. Such microparticles are generally formed by
     adding a counter ion to a solution containing a compound of the invention in a
     solvent, adding an antisolvent to the solution; and gradually cooling the solution to a
     temperature below about 250C, to form a composition containing microparticles
     comprising the compound. The microparticles comprising the compound may then
25   be separated from the solution by any suitable means such as sedimentation,
     filtration or lyophillization. Suitable counterions, solvents and antisolvents for
     preparing microparticles of the compounds of the invention are described in
     W02009/015286.
               In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition according to the
30   invention is delivered as a dry powder using a metered dose inhaler. Non-limiting
     examples of metered dose inhalers and devices include those disclosed in
     US5,261,538; US5,544,647; US5,622,163; US4,955,371; US3,565,070; US3,361306
     and US6,116,234 and US7,108,159. In a preferred embodiment, a compound of the
     invention is delivered as a dry powder using a metered dose inhaler wherein the
35   emitted particles have an MMAD that is in the range of about 1 pm to about 5 pm and
     a GSD that is less than about 2.

               Liquid aerosol formulations for delivery to the endobronchial space or lung by
     inhalation may for example be formulated as aqueous solutions or suspensions or as
     aerosols delivered from pressurized packs, such as metered dose inhalers, with the
     use of suitable liquefied propellants, softmist inhalers, or nebulizers. Such aerosol
 5   compositions suitable for inhalation can be either a suspension or a solution and
     generally contain the active ingredient(s) together with a pharmaceutically acceptable
     carrier or diluent (e.g., water (distilled or sterile), saline, hypertonic saline, or ethanol)
     and optionally one or more other therapeutically active agents.
               Aerosol compositions for delivery by pressurized metered dose inhalers
10   typically further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable propellant.             Examples of
     such propellants include fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon or
     mixtures thereof,       particularly hydrofluoroalkanes, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane,
     trichlorofluoromethane,            dichlorotetrafluoroethane,        especially        1,1,1,2
     tetrafluoroethane, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3,-heptafluoro-n-propane or a mixture thereof.              The
15   aerosol composition may be excipient free or may optionally contain additional
     formulation excipients well known in the art such as surfactants e.g., oleic acid or
     lecithin and cosolvents e.g., ethanol.           Pressurized formulations will generally be
     retained in a canister (e.g., an aluminum canister) closed with a valve (e.g., a
     metering valve) and fitted into an actuator provided with a mouthpiece.
20             In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition according to the
     invention is delivered as a liquid using a metered dose inhaler.                  Non-limiting
     examples of metered dose inhalers and devices include those disclosed in US Patent
     Nos. 6,253,762, 6,413,497, 7,601,336, 7,481,995, 6,743,413, and 7,105,152. In a
     preferred embodiment, a compound of the invention is delivered as a dry powder
25   using a metered dose inhaler wherein the emitted particles have an MMAD that is in
     the range of about 1pm to about 5 pm and a GSD that is less than about 2.
               In one embodiment the aerosol formulation is suitable for aerosolization by a
     jet nebulizer, or ultrasonic nebulizer including static and vibrating porous plate
     nebulizers.      Liquid aerosol formulations for nebulization may be generated by
30   solubilizing or reconstituting a solid particle formulation or may be formulated with an
     aqueous vehicle with the addition of agents such as acid or alkali, buffer salts, and
     isotonicity adjusting agents. They may be sterilized by in-process techniques such as
     filtration, or terminal processes such as heating in an autoclave or gamma irradiation.
     They may also be presented in non-sterile form.
35             Patients can be sensitive to the pH, osmolality, and ionic content of a
     nebulized solution. Therefore these parameters should be adjusted to be compatible
     with the active ingredient and tolerable to patients. The most preferred solution or

     suspension of active ingredient will contain a chloride concentration >30 mM at pH
     4.5-7.4, preferably 5.0-5.5, and an osmolality of from about 800-1600mOsm/kg. The
     pH of the solution can be controlled by either titration with common acids
     (hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, for example) or bases (sodium hydroxide, for
 5   example) or via the use of buffers. Commonly used buffers include citrate buffers,
     such as citric acid/sodium citrate buffers, acetate buffers, such as acetic acid/sodium
     acetate buffers, and phosphate buffers. Buffer strengths can range from 2mM to
     50mM.
              Useful acetate, phosphate, and citrate buffers include sodium acetate, sodium
10   acetate trihydrate, ammonium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium phosphate,
     sodium phosphate dibasic, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen
     phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, potassium phosphate, sodium citrate,
     and potassium citrate. Other buffers which may be utilized include sodium
     hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, aminomethylpropanol,
15   tromethamine, tetrahydroxypropyl ethylenediamine, citric acid, acetic acid,
     hydroxytricarboxylic acid or a salt thereof, such as a citrate or sodium citrate salt
     thereof, lactic acid, and salts of lactic acid including sodium lactate, potassium
     lactate, lithium lactate, calcium lactate, magnesium lactate, barium lactate, aluminum
     lactate, zinc lactate, silver lactate, copper lactate, iron lactate, manganese lactate,
20   ammonium lactate, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine,
     diisopropanolamine, as well as combinations thereof, and the like.
              Such formulations may be administered using commercially available
     nebulizers or other atomizer that can break the formulation into particles or droplets
     suitable for deposition in the respiratory tract. Non-limiting examples of nebulizers
25   which may be employed for the aerosol delivery of a composition of the invention
     include pneumatic jet nebulizers, vented or breath-enhanced jet nebulizers, or
     ultrasonic nebulizers       including static    or vibrating    porous plate    nebulizers.
     Commercially available nebulizers include the Aeroneb@ Go nebulizer (Aerogen) and
     the eFlow nebulizer (Pari Pharma).
30            A jet nebulizer utilizes a high velocity stream of air blasting up through a
     column of water to generate droplets. Particles unsuitable for inhalation impact on
     walls or aerodynamic baffles.         A vented or breath enhanced nebulizer works in
     essentially the same way as a jet nebulizer except that inhaled air passes through
     the primary droplet generation area to increase the output rate of the nebulizer while
35   the patient inhales.
              In an ultrasonic nebulizer, vibration of a piezoelectric crystal creates surface
     instabilities in the drug reservoir that cause droplets to be formed. In porous plate
                                                   47

   WO 2014/099673                                                             PCT/US2013/075093
     nebulizers pressure fields generated by sonic energy force liquid through the mesh
     pores where it breaks into droplets by Rayleigh breakup. The sonic energy may be
     supplied by a vibrating horn or plate driven by a piezoelectric crystal, or by the mesh
     itself vibrating. Non-limiting examples of atomizers include any single or twin fluid
 5   atomizer or nozzle that produces droplets of an appropriate size. A single fluid
     atomizer works by forcing a liquid through one or more holes, where the jet of liquid
     breaks up into droplets. Twin fluid atomizers work by either forcing both a gas and
     liquid through one or more holes, or by impinging a jet of liquid against another jet of
     either liquid or gas.
10            The choice of nebulizer which aerosolizes the aerosol formulation is important
     in the administration of the active ingredient(s).    Different nebulizers have differing
     efficiencies based their design and operation principle and are sensitive to the
     physical and chemical properties of the formulation. For example, two formulations
     with different surface tensions may have different particle size distributions.
15   Additionally, formulation properties such as pH, osmolality, and permeant ion content
     can affect tolerability of the medication, so preferred embodiments conform to certain
     ranges of these properties.
              In a preferred embodiment, the formulation for nebulization is delivered to the
     endobronchial space as an aerosol having an MMAD between about 1 pm                  and
20   about 5 pm      and a GSD less than 2 using an appropriate nebulizer. To be optimally
     effective and to avoid upper respiratory and systemic side effects, the aerosol should
     not have a MMAD greater than about 5 pm and should not have a GSD greater than
     about 2.       If an aerosol has an MMAD larger than about 5 pm or a GSD greater
     than about 2      a large percentage of the dose may be deposited in the upper airways
25   decreasing the amount of drug delivered to the desired site in the lower respiratory
     tract.   If the MMAD of the aerosol is smaller than about 1 pm             then a large
     percentage of the particles may remain suspended in the inhaled air and may then be
     exhaled during expiration.
              The    compounds      of  the   invention   may    also  be   administered    by
30   transbronchoscopic lavage.
              Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete
     units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount
     of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or suspension in an
     aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a
35   water-in-oil liquid emulsion.     The active ingredient may also be presented as a
     sachet, bolus, electuary or paste.

     ingredient in a base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.
              Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous
     sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and
15   solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient;
     and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending
     agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or
     multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in
     a freeze-dried lyophilizedd) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid
20   carrier, for example       saline or water-for-injection,  immediately prior to      use.
     Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile
     powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.
              Oral fluids such as solutions, syrups and elixirs can be prepared in dosage
     unit form so that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of the active
25   ingredient. Syrups can be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in a suitably
     flavored aqueous solution, while elixirs are prepared through the use of a
     pharmaceutically acceptable alcoholic vehicle. Suspensions can be formulated by
     dispersing the active ingredient in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Solubilizers
     and emulsifiers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxy ethylene sorbitol
30   ethers, preservatives, flavor additive such as peppermint oil or natural sweeteners or
     saccharin or other artificial sweeteners, and the like can also be incorporated into oral
     liquid compositions.

     unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles may also be employed as delivery
35   means for the compounds of the invention. Liposomes may be formed from a variety
     of phospholipids such as cholesterol, stearylamine and phosphatidylcholines.

              Pharmaceutical compositions for topical administration may be formulated as
     ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays,
     aerosols or oils. Compositions designed for the treatment of the eyes or other
     external tissues, for example the mouth and skin, may be applied as a topical
 5   ointment or cream. When formulated as an ointment, the active ingredient may be
     employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the
     active ingredient may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a
     water-in-oil base.
             Other compositions designed for topical administration to the eyes or ears
10   include eye drops and ear drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or

     saline.
             Compositions designed for nasal administration include aerosols, solutions,
     suspensions, sprays, mists and drops.             Aerosolable formulations for nasal
15   administration may be formulated in much the same ways as aerosolable
     formulations for inhalation with the condition that particles of non-respirable size will
     be preferred in formulations for nasal administration. Typically, particles of about 5
     microns in size, up to the size of visible droplets may be employed. Thus, for nasal
     administration, a particle size in the range of 10-500 pm may be used to ensure
20   retention in the nasal cavity.
             Transdermal patches may also be employed, which are designed to remain in
     contact with the epidermis of the patient for an extended period of time and promote
     the absorption of the active ingredient there through.
             Compositions for vaginal or rectal administration include ointments, creams,
25   suppositories and enemas, all of which may be formulated using conventional

     preferred embodiment, the method comprises administering the pharmaceutical
     composition as an inhalable composition comprising an amount of a compound of the
10   invention that is sufficient to achieve dissolved concentration of the compound on the
     airway surfaces of from about 10-9, 10-8, or 10-7 to about 10-4,10-3,       10-2, or  10-1
     Moles/liter, more preferably from about 10-9 to about 10-4 Moles/liter.
              In another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating any one of dry
     mouth (xerostomia), dry skin, vaginal dryness, sinusitis, rhinosinusitis, or nasal
15   dehydration, including nasal dehydration brought on by administering dry oxygen,
     dry eye or Sjogren's disease, promoting ocular or corneal hydration, treating distal
     intestinal obstruction syndrome, treating otitis media, primary ciliary diskinesia, distal
     intestinal obstruction syndrome, esophagitis, constipation, or chronic diverticulitis in a
     human in need thereof, comprising administering to the human a pharmaceutical
20   composition comprising a compound of the invention, wherein said compound is
     administered in an effective amount.
              Preferred unit dosage formulations for the compounds of the invention are
     those containing an effective amount of the active ingredient or an appropriate
     fraction thereof.
25            It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly
     mentioned above, the formulations of this invention may include other agents
     conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question for
     example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.
             The compositions of the present invention may be formulated for immediate,
30   controlled or sustained release as desired for the particular condition being treated
     and the desired route of administration.           For example, a controlled release
     formulation for oral administration may be desired for the treatment of constipation in
     order to maximize delivery of the active agent to colon.         Such formulations and
     suitable excipients for the same are well known in the art of pharmacy. Because the
35   free base of the compound is generally less soluble in aqueous solutions than the
     salt, compositions comprising a free base of a compound of Formula (A) may be
     employed to provide more sustained release of active agent delivered by inhalation
                                                  51

     to the lungs. An active agent present in the lungs in particulate form which has not
     dissolved into solution is not available to induce a physiological response, but serves
     as a depot of bioavailable drug which gradually dissolves into solution. As another
     example, a formulation may employ both a free base and salt form of a compound of
 5   the invention to provide both immediate release and sustained release of the active
     ingredient for dissolution into the mucus secretions of, for example, the nose.
     COMBINATIONS
             The compounds of the invention may be formulated and/or used in
10   combination     with other therapeutically      active agents.     Examples     of other
     therapeutically active agents which may be formulated or used in combination with
     the compounds of the invention include but are not limited to osmolytes, anti
     inflammatory agents, anticholinergic agents, p-agonists (including selective P2
     agonists), P2Y2 receptor agonists, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)
15   delta agonists, other epithelial sodium channel blockers (ENaC receptor blockers),
     cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, kinase
     inhibitors, antiinfective   agents, antihistamines,    non-antibiotic anti-inflammatory
     macrolides, elastase and protease inhibitors, and mucus or mucin modifying agents,
     such as surfactants. In addition, for cardiovascular indications, the compounds of the
20   invention may be used in combination with beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, HMGCoA
     reductase inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and other cardiovascular agents.
             The present invention thus provides, as another aspect, a composition
     comprising an effective amount of a compound of the invention and one or more
     other therapeutically active agents selected from osmolytes, anti-inflammatory
25   agents, anticholinergic agents, p-agonists (including selective p 2-agonists), P2Y2
     receptor agonists, PPAR delta agonists, ENaC receptor blockers, cystic fibrosis
     transmembrane       conductance regulator      (CFTR)   modulators, kinase inhibitors,
     antiinfective agents, antihistamines, non-antibiotic anti-inflammatory macrolides,
     elastase and protease inhibitors, and mucus or mucin modifying agents, such as
30   surfactants. The present invention thus provides, as another aspect, a composition
     comprising an effective amount of a compound of the invention and one or more
     other therapeutically active agents selected from beta blockers, ACE inhibitors,
     HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. Use of the compounds
     of the invention in combination with one or more other therapeutically active agents
35   (particularly osmolytes) may lower the dose of the compound of the invention that is
     required to sufficiently hydrate mucosal surfaces, thereby reducing the potential for
                                                 52

     for example in the kidneys.
              "Osmolytes" according to the present invention are molecules or compounds
     that are osmotically active.          "Osmotically active" molecules and compounds are
 5   membrane-impermeable           (i.e.,   essentially non-absorbable)  on   the airway or
     pulmonary epithelial surface. The terms "airway surface" and "pulmonary surface," as
     used herein, include pulmonary airway surfaces such as the bronchi and bronchioles,
     alveolar surfaces, and nasal and sinus surfaces. Suitable osmolytes include ionic
     osmolytes (i.e., salts), and non-ionic osmolytes (i.e., sugars, sugar alcohols, and
10   organic osmolytes).       In general, osmolytes (both ionic and non-ionic) used in
     combination with the compounds of the invention are preferably osmolytes that do
     not promote, or in fact deter or retard bacterial growth. Osmolytes suitable for use in
     the present invention may be in racemic form or in the form of an enantiomer,
     diastereomer, tautomer, polymorph or pseudopolymorph.
15            Examples of ionic osmolytes useful in the present invention include any salt of
     a pharmaceutically acceptable anion and a pharmaceutically acceptable cation.
     Preferably, either (or both) of the anion and cation are osmotically active and not
     subject to rapid active transport, in relation to the airway surfaces to which they are
     administered. Such compounds include but are not limited to anions and cations that
20   are contained in FDA approved commercially marketed salts, see, e.g., Remington:
      The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Vol. //, pg. 1457 (19 th Ed. 1995), and can be
     used in any combination as known in the art.
              Specific examples of pharmaceutically acceptable osmotically active anions
     include but are not limited to, acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate,
25   bitartrate, bromide, calcium edetate, camsylate (camphorsulfonate), carbonate,
     chloride, citrate, dihydrochloride, edetate, edisylate (1,2-ethanedisulfonate), estolate
     (lauryl sulfate), esylate (1,2-ethanedisulfonate), fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate,
     glutamate, glycollylarsanilate (p-glycollamidophenylarsonate), hexylresorcinate,
     hydrabamine            (NN'-Di(dehydroabietyl)ethylenediamine),             hydrobromide,

     diphosphate, polygalacturonate, salicylate, stearate, subacetate, succinate, sulfate,
     tannate, tartrate, teoclate (8-chlorotheophyllinate), triethiodide, bicarbonate, etc.
35   Preferred anions include chloride, sulfate, nitrate, gluconate, iodide, bicarbonate,
     bromide, and phosphate.

             Specific examples of pharmaceutically acceptable osmotically active cations
     include but are not limited to, organic cations such as benzathine (NN'
     dibenzylethylenediamine), chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine,
     meglumine (N-methyl D-glucamine), procaine, D-lysine, L-lysine, D-arginine, L
 5   arginine, triethylammonium, N-methyl D-glycerol, and the like; and metallic cations
     such as aluminum, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc, iron,
     ammonium, and the like. Preferred organic cations include 3-carbon, 4-carbon, 5
     carbon and 6-carbon organic cations. Preferred cations include sodium, potassium,
     choline, lithium, meglumine, D-lysine, ammonium, magnesium, and calcium.
10           Specific examples of ionic osmolytes that may be used in combination with a
     compound of the invention include but are not limited to, sodium chloride (particularly
     hypertonic saline), potassium chloride, choline chloride, choline iodide, lithium
     chloride, meglumine chloride, L-lysine chloride, D-lysine chloride, ammonium
     chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium nitrate, potassium gluconate, potassium
15   iodide, ferric chloride, ferrous chloride, potassium bromide, and combinations of any
     two or more of the foregoing. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a
     combination of a compound of the invention and two different osmotically active salts.
     When different salts are used, one of the anion or cation may be the same among
     the differing salts.     Hypertonic saline is a preferred ionic osmolyte for use in
20   combination with the compounds of the invention.
             Non-ionic osmolytes include sugars, sugar-alcohols, and organic osmolytes.
     Sugars and sugar-alcohols useful as osmolytes in the present invention include but
     are not limited to      3-carbon sugars (e.g., glycerol, dihydroxyacetone); 4-carbon
     sugars (e.g., both the D and L forms of erythrose, threose, and erythrulose); 5-carbon
25   sugars (e.g., both the D and L forms of ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, psicose,
     fructose, sorbose, and tagatose); and 6-carbon sugars (e.g., both the D and L forms
     of altose, allose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, and talose, and the D
     and L forms of allo-heptulose, allo-hepulose, gluco-heptulose, manno-heptulose,
     gulo-heptulose, ido-heptulose, galacto-heptulose, talo-heptulose). Additional sugars
30   useful in the practice of the present invention include raffinose, raffinose series
     oligosaccharides, and stachyose. Both the D and L forms of the reduced form of
     each sugar/sugar alcohol are also suitable for the present invention. For example,
     glucose, when reduced, becomes sorbitol; an osmolyte within the scope of the
     invention.    Accordingly, sorbitol and other reduced forms of sugar/sugar alcohols
35   (e.g., mannitol, dulcitol, arabitol) are suitable osmolytes for use in the present
     invention. Mannitol is a preferred non-ionic osmolyte for use in combination with the
     compounds of the invention.

   WO 2014/099673                                                             PCT/US2013/075093
              "Organic osmolytes" is generally used to refer to molecules that control
     intracellular osmolality in the kidney. See e.g., J. S. Handler et al., Comp. Biochem.
     Physiol, 117, 301-306      (1997); M. Burg, Am. J. Physiol. 268, F983-F996 (1995).
     Organic osmolytes include but are not limited to three major classes of compounds:
 5   polyols (polyhydric alcohols), methylamines, and amino acids.            Suitable polyol
     organic osmolytes include but are not limited to, inositol, myo-inositol, and sorbitol.
     Suitable methylamine organic osmolytes include but are not limited to, choline,
     betaine, carnitine (L-, D- and DL forms), phosphorylcholine, lyso-phosphorylcholine,
     glycerophosphorylcholine, creatine, and creatine phosphate.        Suitable amino acid
10   organic osmolytes include but are not limited to, the D- and L-forms of glycine,
     alanine, glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, proline and taurine. Additional organic
     osmolytes suitable for use in the present invention include tihulose and sarcosine.
     Mammalian organic osmolytes are preferred, with human organic osmolytes being
     most preferred.     However, certain organic osmolytes are of bacterial, yeast, and
15   marine animal origin, and these compounds may also be employed in the present
     invention.
              Osmolyte precursors may be used in combination with the compounds of the
     invention An "osmolyte precursor" as used herein refers to a compound which is
     converted into an osmolyte by a metabolic step, either catabolic or anabolic.
20   Examples of osmolyte precursors include but are not limited to, glucose, glucose
     polymers, glycerol, choline, phosphatidylcholine,        lyso-phosphatidylcholine and
     inorganic phosphates, which are          precursors of polyols and methylamines.
     Precursors of amino acid osmolytes include proteins, peptides, and polyamino acids,
     which are hydrolyzed to yield osmolyte amino acids, and metabolic precursors which
25   can be converted into osmolyte amino acids by a metabolic step such as
     transamination.     For example, a precursor of the amino acid glutamine is poly-L
     glutamine, and a precursor of glutamate is poly-L-glutamic acid.
              Chemically modified osmolytes or osmolyte precursors may also be
     employed. Such chemical modifications involve linking the osmolyte (or precursor) to
30   an additional chemical group which alters or enhances the effect of the osmolyte or
     osmolyte precursor (e.g., inhibits degradation of the osmolyte molecule).          Such
     chemical modifications have been utilized with drugs or prodrugs and are known in
     the art. (See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,479,932 and 4,540,564; Shek, E. et al., J.
     Med. Chem. 19:113-117 (1976); Bodor, N. et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 67:1045-1050

     Sci. 75:29-35 (1986).

   WO 2014/099673                                                              PCT/US2013/075093
              Preferred osmolytes for use in combination with the compounds of the
     invention include sodium chloride, particular hypertonic saline, and mannitol.
              For the formulation of 7% and >7% hypertonic saline, formulations containing
     bicarbonate anions may be particularly useful, especially for respiratory disorders
 5   with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction such
     as CF or COPD. Recent findings indicate that, although the relative ratio of HC03
     conductance/C- conductance is between 0.1 and 0.2 for single CFTR channels
     activated with cAMP and ATP, the ratio in the sweat duct can range from virtually 0 to
     almost 1.0, depending on conditions of stimulation. That is, combining cAMP       +  cGMP
10   +  a-ketoglutarate can yield CFTR HC03- conductance almost equal to that of CI
     conductance (Quiton et al. Physiology, Vol. 22, No. 3, 212-225, June 2007).
     Furthermore, formulations of 7% and >7% hypertonic saline containing bicarbonate
     anions may be particularly useful due to better control of the pH in the airway surface
     liquid. First, it has shown that that airway acidification occurs in CF (Tate et al. 2002)
15   and that absent CFTR-dependent bicarbonate secretion can lead to an impaired
     capacity to respond to airway conditions associated with acidification of airway
     surface liquid layer (Coakley et al. 2003). Second, addition of HS solution without
     bicarbonate to the surface of the lung may further dilute the bicarbonate
     concentrations, and potentially reduce the pH or the ability to respond to airway
20   acidification within the airway surface liquid layer. Therefore addition of bicarbonate
     anions to HS may help maintain or improve the pH of airway surface liquid layer in
     CF patients.
              Due to this evidence, inclusion of bicarbonate anion in the formulation of 7%
     or >7% hypertonic saline administered by the method of this invention would be
25   particularly useful. Formulations containing up to 30 to 200 mM concentrations of
     bicarbonate anions are of particular interest for 7% or >7% HS solutions.
              Hypertonic saline is understood to have a salt concentration greater than that
     of normal saline (NS), i.e. greater than 9 g/L or 0.9% w/v, and hypotonic saline has a
     salt concentration less than that of normal saline, such as from about 1 g/L or 0.1%
30   w/v to about 8 g/L or 0.8% w/v. Hypertonic saline solutions useful in the formulations
     and methods of treatment herein may have a salt concentration from about 1% to
     about 23.4% (w/v).       In one embodiment the hypertonic saline solution has a salt
     concentration from about 60 g/L (6% w/v) to about 100 g/L (10% w/v).           In another
     embodiment, the saline solution has a salt concentration from about 70 g/L (7% w/v)
35   to about 100 g/L (10% w/v).        In further embodiments, the saline solution has salt
     concentrations of a) from about 0.5 g/L (0.05% w/v) to about 70 g/L (7% w/v); b) from

     concentrations/percentages may also be used, such as saline of          1.7 g/L (0.17%

     w/v), 35 g/L (3.5% w/v), 45 g/L (4.5% w/v), and 75 g/L (7.5% w/v).
             Specific useful concentration of hypotonic saline solutions include those from
     about 0.12 g/L (0.012% w/v) to about 8.5 g/L (0.85% w/v). Any concentration within
     this range may be used, such as, on a w/v basis, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.15%, 0.2%, 0.225%

     include furin, meprin, matriptase, trypsin, channel associated proteases (CAPs), and
20   neutrophil elastases.    Protease inhibitors that can inhibit the proteolytic activity of
     these proteases that can be administered in the combinations herein include, but are
     not limited to, camostat, prostasin, furin, aprotinin, leupeptin, and trypsin inhibitors.

              Mucus or mucin modifying agents useful in the combinations and methods
     herein include reducing agents, surfactants and detergents, expectorants, and
 5   deoxyribonuclease agents.
              Mucin proteins are organized into high molecular weight polymers via the
     formation of covalent (disulfide) and non-covalent bonds. Disruption of the covalent
     bonds with reducing agents is a well-established method to reduce the viscoelastic
     properties of mucus in vitro and is predicted to minimize mucus adhesiveness and
10   improve clearance in vivo. Reducing agents are known to decrease mucus viscosity
     in vitro and commonly used as an aid to processing sputum samples. Examples of
     reducing agents include sulfide containing molecules or phosphines capable of
     reducing protein di-sulfide bonds including, but not limited to, N-acetyl cysteine, N
     acystelyn, carbocysteine, glutathione, dithiothreitol, thioredoxin containing proteins,
15   and tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine.
              N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is approved for use in conjunction with chest
     physiotherapy to loosen viscid or thickened airway mucus. Clinical studies evaluating
     the effects of oral or inhaled NAC in CF and COPD have reported improvements in
     the rheologic properties of mucus and trends toward improvements in lung function
20   and decreases in pulmonary exacerbations. However, the preponderance of clinical
     data suggests that NAC is at best a marginally effective therapeutic agent for treating
     airway mucus obstruction when administered orally or by inhalation. A recent
     Cochrane review of the existing clinical literature on the use of NAC found no
     evidence to support the efficacy of NAC for CF-.
25            NAC is a relative inefficient reducing agent which is only partially active on the
     airway surface. Very high concentrations of NAC (200 mM or 3.26%) are required to
     fully reduce Muc5B, a major gel-forming airway mucin, in vitro. Furthermore, in the
     pH environment of the airway surface (measured in the range of pH 6.0 to 7.2 in CF
     and COPD airways), NAC exists only partially in its reactive state as a negatively
30   charge thiolate. Thus, in the clinic, NAC is administered at very high concentrations.
     However, it is predicted that current aerosol devices will not be able to achieve
     therapeutic concentrations of even a 20% Mucomyst solution on distal airway
     surfaces within the relatively short time domains (7.5 - 15 minutes) typically used.
              In non-clinical studies, "C-labled NAC, administered by inhalation, exhibits
35   rapid elimination from the lungs with a half-life ranging from 6 to 36 minutes"
              NAC is administered as a highly concentrated, hypertonic inhalation solution
     (20% or 1.22 molar) and has been reported to cause bronchoconstriction and cough.
                                                  62

   WO 2014/099673                                                                 PCT/US2013/075093
     In many cases, it is recommended that NAC be administered with a bronchodilator to
     improve the tolerability of this agent.
              Thus, reducing agents such as NAC are not well suited for bolus aerosol
     administration.      However, it is anticipated that delivery of reducing agents by
 5   pulmonary aerosol infusion would increase the effectiveness, while allowing for a
     decrease in the concentration of reducing agent in the inhalation solution (predicted
     to increase tolerability).
              Surfactants and detergents are spreading agents shown to decrease mucus
     viscoelasticity, improving mucus clearability.            Examples of surfactants include
10   dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine          (DPPC),       PF,    palmitic     acid,    palmitoyl
     oleoylphosphatidylglycerol, surfactant-associated proteins (e.g. SP-A, B, or C), or
     may be animal derived (e.g. from cow or calf lung lavage or extracted from minced
     pig lung) or combinations thereof. See, e.g., US Patent Nos. 7,897,577; 5,876,970;
     5,614,216; 5,100,806; and 4,312,860.            Examples of surfactant products include
15   Exosurf*      Neonatal     (colfosceril   palmitate),     Pumactant*    (DPPC     and    egg
     phosphatidylglycerol), KL-4 surfactant, Venticute* (lusulptide, rSP-C surfactant),
     Alveofact* (bovactant), Curosurf* (poractant alfa), Infasurf* (calfactant), Newfacten*
     (modified bovine surfactant), Surface*, NatsurfTM (nonionic alcohol ethoxylate
     surfactant)and Survanta* (beractant).         Examples of detergents include, but are not
20   limited to, Tween-80 and triton-X 100.
              Any suitable expectorant can be used, including but not limited to guaifenesin
     (see, e.g., US Patent No. 7,345,051). Any suitable deoxyribonuclease can be used,
     including but not limited to Dornase Alpha. (see, e.g., US Patent No. 7,482,024).
     Examples of kinase inhibitors include inhibitors of NFkB, P13K (phosphatidylinositol

     or 2) separate pharmaceutical compositions each including one or more of the
 5   component active ingredients.          The components of the combination may be
     administered separately in a sequential manner wherein the compound of the
     invention is administered first and the other therapeutically active agent is
     administered second or vice versa.
              In the embodiments wherein the compound of the invention is administered in
10   combination with one or more osmolytes, the administration of each component is
     preferably concomitant, and may be in a unitary composition                   or separate
     compositions. In one embodiment, the compound of the invention and one or more
     osmolytes are administered concomitantly by transbronchoscopic lavage. In another
     embodiment, the compound of the invention and one or more osmolytes are
15   administered concomitantly by inhalation.
             When a compound of the invention is used in combination with another
     therapeutically active agent, the dose of each compound may differ from that when
     the compound of the invention is used alone.          Appropriate doses will be readily
     determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The appropriate dose of the compound
20   of the invention, the other therapeutically active agent(s) and the relative timings of
     administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic
     effect, and are within the expertise and discretion of the attendant physician, clinician

15            Generally, the compounds of the invention may be conveniently prepared by
     treating a compound of Formula (a) with an amine of Formula (b). More specifically,
     compounds of Formula (a) are treated with the amine of Formula (b) in a suitable
     solvent such as methanol, ethanol, or tetrahydrofuran, and a base such as
     triethylamine (TEA), or di-isoproylethylamine (DIPEA), with heating to elevated
20   temperature,    e.g.,    702C.     Further purification, resolution   of stereoisomers,

     crystallization and/or preparation of salt forms may be carried out using conventional
     techniques.
               As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, in certain instances, the starting
     or intermediate compounds in the synthesis may possess other functional groups
 5   which provide alternate reactive sites. Interference with such functional groups may
     be avoided by utilization of appropriate protecting groups, such as amine or alcohol
     protecting groups, and where applicable, appropriately prioritizing the synthetic steps.
     Suitable protecting groups will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Methods are
     well known in the art for installing and removing such protecting groups and such
10   conventional techniques may be employed in the processes of the instant invention
     as well.

             Several assays may be used to characterize the compounds of the present
     invention. Representative assays are discussed below.
 5   Assay 1. In Vitro Measure of Sodium Channel Blockinq Activity and
     Reversibility
     One assay used to assess mechanism of action and/or potency of the compounds of
     the present invention involves the determination of lumenal drug inhibition of airway
     epithelial sodium currents measured under short circuit current (Isc) using airway
10   epithelial monolayers mounted in Ussing chambers. This assay is described in detail
     in Hirsh, A.J., Zhang, J., Zamurs, A., et al. Pharmacological properties of N-(3,5

                                                    Inserts (CoStar), cultured at air-liquid
 5   interface (ALI) conditions in hormonally defined media, and assayed for sodium
     transport activity (Isc) while bathed in Krebs Bicarbonate Ringer (KBR) in Using
     chambers. All test drug additions are to the lumenal bath with half-log dose addition
     protocols (from 1 x 10-11 M to 3 x 10-5 M), and the cumulative change in Isc (inhibition)
     recorded. All drugs are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide as stock solutions at a
10   concentration of 1 x 10-2 M and stored at -200 C. Eight preparations are typically run
     in parallel; two preparations per run incorporate amiloride and/or benzamil as positive
     controls. After the maximal concentration (5 x 10-5 M) is administered, the lumenal
     bath is exchanged three times with fresh drug-free KBR solution, and the resultant Isc
     measured after each wash for approximately 5 minutes in duration. Reversibility is
15   defined as the percent return to the baseline value for sodium current after the third
     wash. All data from the voltage clamps are collected via a computer interface and
     analyzed off-line.
             Dose-effect relationships for all compounds are considered and analyzed by
     the Prism 3.0 program. IC50 values, maximal effective concentrations, and
20   reversibility are calculated and compared to amiloride and benzamil as positive
     controls. The potency of the sodium channel blocking activity of representative
     compounds relative to amiloride in freshly excised cell from canine airways is shown
     in Table 1.

     Assay 2. Mucociliary Clearance (MCC) Studies in Sheep
              The animal model that has been used most often to measure changes in
     MCC is the sheep model. The effect of compounds for enhancing mucociliary
     clearance (MCC) can be measured using an in vivo model described by Sabater et
 5   al., Journal of Applied Physiology, 1999, pp. 2191-2196, incorporated herein by
     reference.
     In these studies, adult sheep were restrained and nasally intubated with an
     endotracheal tube. Aerosolized test articles were administered over 10-15 minutes
     to sheep. Radiolabeled      99mTc-sulfur colloid (TSC, 3.1 mg/mL; containing
10   approximately 20 mCi) was then administered at a specified time four or eight hours
     after test article. The radiolabeled aerosol was administered through the
     endotracheal tube for about 5 minutes. The sheep were then extubated, and total
     radioactive counts in the lung were measured every 5 minutes for a 1-hour
     observation period. The rate of radiolabel clearance from the lung is representative
15   of the MCC rate in the animal. The advantage of this system is that it closely
     simulates the human lung environment. The model also allows for the collection of
     simultaneous PK/PD information through plasma and urine sampling over the test
     period. There are also several techniques to measure the drug concentrations on the
     airway surface during the MCC measurements. These include the collection of
20   exhaled breath condensates or a filter paper method to obtain ASL via
     bronchoscopy.
     The ovine model described above was used to evaluate the in vivo effects
     (efficacy/durability) of aerosol-delivered Compound Il-d on MCC. Treatments
     consisting of either 4 mL of Compound II-d, Comparative Example 1, (S)-3,5
25   diamino-6-chloro-N-(N-(4-(4-(2,3-diamino-3
     oxopropoxy)phenyl)butyl)carbamimidoyl)pyrazine-2-carboxamide, vehicle (sterile
     distilled H2 0), or test agent in combination with HS were tested. To determine if
     combining HS with Compound Il-d MCC, HS was administered immediately
     following Compound Il-d administration. Test solutions were aerosolized using a
30   Raindrop nebulizer at a flowrate of eight liters per minute and connected to a
     dosimetry system consisting of a solenoid valve and a source of compressed air
     (20 psi). The deposited dose of drug in sheep lungs after an aerosol administration
     using the Raindrop nebulizer is estimated to be 8-15 % of the dose. Using a
     Raindrop nebulizer, radiolabeled TSC was administered over approximately 3
35   minutes either 4 or 8 hours after drug treatment to evaluate efficacy/durability.
     Radioactive counts were measured in a central region in the right lung at 5 min

     intervals for one hour with a gamma camera. Three methods of analysis were
     utilized, 1) initial rate of clearance (slope) over the first 30 min fitted using linear
     regression 2) area under the curve for % clearance over time over one hour, and 3)
     the maximum clearance obtained in one hour.
 5   The effect of Compound Il-d at 0.024 nmol/kg, 0.24 nmol/kg and 2.4 nmol/kg were
     tested and compared to vehicle (4 mL sterile H2 0) on sheep MCC four hour post
     dosing (Figure 1). The analyses of effects are shown in Table 2. At all doses tested,
     Compound Il-d enhanced MCC compared to vehicle control. The 0.24 nmol/kg dose
     was considered to be a maximum (100%) MCC effect at the top of the dose response
10   curve as illustrated in Figure 2. The ED50 dose for Compound Il-d was
     approximately 0.024 nmo/kg. Importantly, doses as high as 24 nmol/kg (1,000 times
     the ED50 ) exhibited no increase in plasma potassium (a marker for hyperkalemia) as
     seen in Figure 2.

     Assay 3. Airway Surface Liquid Drug (ASL) Clearance and Metabolism by
     Human Airway Epithelium
20   The disappearance of Compound Il-d from the apical surface and airway epithelial
     metabolism were assessed in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells (Table 3). In
     these experiments 25 pL of a 25 pM solution of ENaC blocker was added to the
     apical surface of HBE cells grown at an air/liquid interface, and the drug
     concentration in the apical and basolateral compartment was measured over 2 h by
25   UPLC. After 2 h incubation of Compound Il-d on the apical surface (37 0C), no
     metabolites were detected on either the apical or basolateral sides and no
     Compound Il-d was detectable on the basolateral side.

     Primary CBE cells are plated onto collagen-coated, porous membranes maintained
     at an air-liquid interface to assess maintenance of surface liquid volume over time.
15   At the start of the experiment, each 12 mm snapwell insert was removed from the
     plate containing air-liquid interface culture media, blotted dry, weighed, and 50 pL of
     vehicle (0.1% DMSO), or ENaC blocker (10 pM in 0.1% DMSO) applied to the apical
     surface and the mass was recorded. The inserts were immediately returned to a
     transwell plate (500 pL, Krebs Ringer Bicarbonate (KRB), pH 7.4 in lower chamber)
20   and placed in a 370 C, 5% CO2 incubator. To reduce artifact due to an apical
     carbohydrate osmotic gradient upon water loss, glucose was not included in the
     apical buffer. Compound (1a) was tested and compared to vehicle, and the mass of
     ASL was monitored serially from 0-8 or 24 h. The mass of surface liquid was
     converted to volume in tL. Data are reported as % initial volume (100 % = 50 tL).
25   The duration of sodium transport inhibition was determined indirectly by measuring
     the buffer retained after a 50 pl volume of experimental buffer was added to the
     apical surface of CBE cells. Only 12.512.1% of vehicle (buffer) remained on the
     surface after 8 hours and a small increase in surface liquid retention was seen with

     10 pM amiloride in the vehicle (2519.2% after 8 hours). In comparison, Compound
     II-d significantly increased apical surface liquid retention, maintaining 11211% (n=6)
     of the surface liquid over 8 hours .
     To test Compound II-d further, the duration of incubation was increased from eight
 5   to 24 hours. Amiloride was not tested over 24 hours as the majority of the effect was
     gone after eight hours. After 24 hours, only 11 % of the vehicle buffer remained
     whereas, Compound Il-d maintained 70.68.0% (n=42) of surface liquid over 24
     hours, a loss of only 16% relative to the 8-hour measure, suggesting Compound Il-d
     exhibits a durable effect on liquid retention.

     Comparative Examples
     The present compounds of Formula (A) are more potent and/or absorbed less rapidly
     from mucosal surfaces, especially airway surfaces, compared to known sodium
     channel blockers, such as amiloride and third generation compounds such as
15   Comparative Example 1 described below. Therefore, the compounds of Formula (A)
     have a longer half-life on mucosal surfaces compared to these know compounds as
     evidenced by the data shown in Table 4. The disappearance of Compound Il-d from
     the apical surface and airway epithelial metabolism were assessed in HBE and
     compared to Comparative Example 1 (Table 4). In these experiments 25 pL of a 25
20   pM solution of ENaC blocker was added to the apical surface of HBE cells grown at
     an air/liquid interface, and the drug concentration in the apical and basolateral
     compartment was measured over 2 h by UPLC. After 2 h incubation of the
     compounds of this present invention on the apical surface (37 0C), no metabolites
     were detected on either the apical or basolateral sides and only small ammounts of
25   these compounds were detectable on the basolateral side. In contrast, most of
     Comparative Example 1 was eliminated from the apical side with 83% metabolized to

             The compound of Comparative Example 1 can be seen on page 15 of US
     2005/0080093 and as Compound 2 on page 90 of WO 2008/031048, and as
     Compound 2 on pages 42-43 of WO 2008/031028. In order to have useful activity in
     treating Cystic Fibrosis and C.O.P.D a compound must have properties that will
 5   cause enhancement of mucociliary clearance (MCC) at doses that do not elevate
     plasma potassium which will eventually lead to hyperkalemia, a serious and
     dangerous condition, upon multiple dosing. It must therefore be avoided in this class
     of compounds, which are known to elevate plasma potassium if they are significantly
     excreted by the kidney. In order to evaluate this potential, it is beneficial to have
10   MCC activity in vivo and not cause elevation of plasma potassium at the useful dose.
     One model to assess this is the sheep MCC model described below.
               As can be seen from the Table 5 and Figure 4 the ED50 for Comparative
     Example 1 in the sheep MCC model is approximately 240 nmol/kg (3mM) using
     three different measures (slope, AUC and Maximum Clearance). At this dose, which
15   would be a clinically active dose, Comparative Example 1 causes a rise in plasma
     potassium (Figure 5) which on repeat dosing will lead to hyperkalemia. Thus,
     Comparative Example I is unacceptable for human use while Compound Il-d
     produces a safe and effective MCC with a benefit to risk ratio greater than 1000 in
     this model.

              Figure 6 graphs the percentage mucus clearance over time by Compound 1i
     d and Comparative Example 1, as described in the MCC model, above. A similar
     percentage mucus clearance was provided by Compound 1l-d at a 10,000-fold lower
 5   dose than seen with Comparative Example 1. Compound 1l-d provided a maximal
     effect in a clinically relevant dose range.
              Figure 7 illustrates the significant increase in plasma potassium levels at an
     efficacious dose seen in the plasma of the sheep receiving Comparative Example 1
     in the MCC study. Compound 1l-d is 10,000 times more potent in sheep MCC than
10   Comparative Example 1 with no elevation of Plasma K at doses as high as
     24nmol/kg (1000 times the ED50 dose), whereas Comparative Example 1 has
     elevations of plasma K at the approximate ED50 dose of 3mM (Figures 6 and 7).
     This, again, demonstrates the unique and unexpected potency and safety advantage
     of Compound 1l-d as seen in Table 6 with a Therapeutic Index of 10,000- 100,000
15   times greater renal safety than Comparative Example 1.
