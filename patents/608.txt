                                         Incorporation
        This application is a divisional of Australian patent application No. <removed-apn>,
which is in turn a divisional of Australian patent application No. 2012310300, the entire
contents of both of which are incorporated herein by cross-reference.
                                          Background
        Thermoplastic    polymers are widely used for packaging purposes. However,
degradation of these thermoplastic polymers .in general is a very slow process. When the
thermoplastic polymer is casually disposed of, it is liable to remain substantially unaltered for
months or even years. The disposal problem of thermoplastic polymers thus reduces its
applicability and commercial value. In this respect, thermoplastic polymers have less
satisfactory properties than the conventional packaging materials such as those based on
cellulose which degrade rapidly when exposed to the environment.
        One method to increase the degradability of thermoplastic materials is to add
additives to the thermoplastics- polymers. These additives, commonly known as pro
degradants, increase the rate of degradation of the polymers by increasing the rate of photo
degradation, biological, degradation, and/or chemical degradation.
        One known method of preparation of degradable polyolefin films utilizes certain
organic derivatives of transition metals or transition metal salts, to enhance its degradability
in the absence of sunlight. The transition metal is selected from the group comprising cobalt,
manganese, copper, cerium, vanadium and iron. However, the exemplified film degrades to
an embrittled condition within a short period of time. Furthermore,

                                                 2
     the utility       of    such a      film is      limited        as it      would       likely
     degrade      before     use     and   the     high    concentrations               of    toxic
     transition metals,             such    as    cobalt,        used would           create       an
     extremely costly and toxic material.
  5        Another          known       method        of       producing            degradable
     thermoplastic compositions                 comprises melting               the polymer,
     adding     the   degradants         to    the   melted        polymer,        and mixing
     the   degradants          and    polymer       to    disperse         the      degradants
     within the       polymer.        However,      poor     compatibility              with      and
10   dispersability         in    thermoplastics may lead to poor bonding
    between       the  degradant         and polymer,          which in         turn       results
     in composites with poor mechanical properties.                                   Moreover,
     such   a    method     is     usually      detrimental          to    the     quality         of
     the final       polymer blend,           since each          event of heating                and
15  melting a polymer tends                 to result        in    some     degradation            of
     the polymer.
           In      another       known      method       of      producing          degradable
    plastic       compositions,          the    polymer       is    first       blended         with
    high    concentrations            of    the    pro-degradant.                The      polymer
20  blend     is    then     combined        with    the     original         polymer          in    a
    ratio so as to provide the desired final concentration of
    pro-degradants.             An extruder is typically used to mix the
    two    polymer         compositions            and     to      disperse           the       pro
    degradants throughout the original polymer.                                 However, due
25  to     the . high             concentrations             of        degradants,                the
    thermoplastics            are      susceptible           to      decomposition                and
    therefore        can    only      be   stored       for      a   limited         length        of
    time.          Hence,       the     degradable          thermoplastic               of      such
    composition          has       to     be      made      just         prior         to       use.
30  Furthermore,           the       high      concentrations              of      degradants
    present       typically        leads     to    deterioration           of    the      polymer
    in   the     final    composition          and,    thus,       results        in     a   final
    polymer       that   is     of   inferior       quality.        This     is    especially
    true      when      the      polymer         is     subjected           to       the        high

                                               3
   temperatures    necessary           in     manufacturing             operations            such
   as  extrusion     or       film        blowing         to      produce           the     final
   article.
         Accordingly,          there          is       a    need         to        provide         a
 5 degradation    agent        for     plastics           that       overcomes,            or     at
   least ameliorates, the disadvantages mentioned above.
                                          Summary
         According    to     a   first         aspect,       there        is     provided         an
10 ionomer   degradation         agent        comprising          a    transition           metal
   complexed with an ionized cyclic ester.
         Advantageously,         the       degradation           agent       may      act    as    a
   photocatalyst      to       enhance           degradation            of        a    plastic.
   Advantageously,       the    transition             metal,       such       as    iron,     may
15 be  non-toxic     to     the      environment             and      may        not     have      a
   detrimental       effect              on          the         environment.                More
   advantageously,      the     functional             groups      on the         degradation
   agent may aid dispersion                and adhesion            of the         degradation
   agent in the plastic.
20       According     to    a    second         aspect,        there       is     provided        a

   cyclic   ester;    (ii)      ionizing          the     cyclic        ester        and    (iii)
   adding a   transition        metal         ion     to   said polymer             to    form a
25 complex   with  said polymer               and     thereby        form       said     ionomer
   degradation agent.
         According     to     a   third         aspect,       there        is      provided        a
   degradation    agent     comprising             a    clay     intercalated             with     a
   transition metal       ion dispersed within the clay.
30       According    to     a    fourth         aspect,       there        is     provided        a
   method of producing a degradation agent comprising a clay
   intercalated with a transition metal ion dispersed within
   the  clay  comprising         the       steps       of   (i)      providing          a   metal
   ion  intercalated       clay;        (ii)     adding       a    surfactant           to   said

                                                  4
    metal      ion intercalated              clay to form a mixture;                and      (iii)
    applying         a   pressure         to   the    mixture      from      step      (ii)        to
    obtain said degradation agent.
             According        to   a    fifth     aspect,      there     is   provided           use
  5 of the degradation agent as defined above in a polyolefin
    plastic.

             The following words and terms used herein shall have
10  the-meaning indicated:
             The term 'dispersed' is.to be interpreted broadly to
    refer        to    the     distribution           of     the     degradation            agent
    particles in the plastic.
             The     term      'intercalate',           and     grammatical          variants
15  thereof,        is    to    be    interpreted         broadly      to    refer      to       the
    interaction          between         the    surfactant        modified        transition
    metal        ion     and     the        nanoclay.       When      the      nanoclay            is
    intercalated            with       the     surfactant        modified         transition

    nanoclay.
             The    term     "clay"       refers     to both       naturally        occurring
    clay      materials        and      to    synthetic       clay    materials.              Clay

                                                    5
   Illustrative              are    the    two     groups        of   naturally             occurring
   clay minerals.                First    is    the      hormite      group,         defined        here
   as      including           palygorskite             and     sepiolite,               which      have
   channels .formed by octahedral                          units and tetrahedral units
 5 of     the     clay       mineral       structure.          Second         is     the      smectite
   group       including          montmorillonites             and     saponite,           which are
   constituted             by     stacked      layers         formed       by      an     octahedral
   sheet       and more          than    one     tetrahedral          sheet,         and mixtures
   of the foregoing.                  Smectite is a generic term that refers
10 to a variety of related minerals also                                  found in some clay
   deposits.           Smectite         is     composed         of    units         made        of   two
   silica          tetrahedral             sheets          with      a       central            alumina
   octahedral           sheet.       Each     of    the tetrahedra               has     a   tip    that
   points          to       the      center        of       the     smectite              unit.      The
15 tetrahedral             and     octahedral         sheets       are      combined           so   that
   the tips          of the tetrahedra                of each       silica         sheet       and one
   of     the     hydroxyl          layers      of    the     octahedral            sheet        form    a
   common        layer.       In   particular,            the   smectite          family       of clay
   minerals               includes           the         various           mineral              species
20 montmorillonite,                 beidellite,            nontronite,             hectorite         and
   saponite,          all     of which can be present                   in    the clay mineral
   in varying amounts.
            The      term        "synthetic          clay"       is      to      be      interpreted
   broadly         to      include       materials           related         in     structure         to
25 layered        clays       and porous          fibrous clays            such as synthetic
   hectorite           (lithium magnesium                 sodium silicate)             .     The    term
   "synthetic clay" may include materials that have the                                             same
   chemical formula and structure as natural clays.
            The term 'nanoclays' is to be interpreted broadly to
30 include        clays       and     clay minerals            whose       particles           have   at
   least one dimension in the nanoscale range (1-100 nm).
            The     term       'ionomer'        is    to be      interpreted              broadly     to
   refer        to    a     polymer       which        is    made     up       of     electrically

                                                    6
   neutral       repeating         monomers          and     a    fraction          of    which      are
   ionized units.
            The      word          "substantially"                   does          not        exclude
   "completely"          e.g.      a    composition            which        is    "substantially
 5 free"       from     Y    may       be      completely            free        from     Y.     Where
   necessary,        the     word       "substantially"               may      be     omitted      from
   the definition of the invention.

            Throughout        this       disclosure,            certain         embodiments         may
   be     disclosed      in    a    range       format.        It     should       be    understood
   that      the    description              in     range        format          is    merely        for
   convenience and brevity and should not be construed as an
25 inflexible         limitation             on     the      scope         of     the     disclosed
   ranges.      Accordingly,            the description of a range should be
   considered          to      have         specifically                disclosed          all       the
   possible        sub-ranges             as      well       as      individual           numerical
   values      within      that      range.         For    example,           description         of   a
30 range      such   as     from      1    to    6   should        be    considered          to    have
   specifically          disclosed           sub-ranges            such       as   from     1   to    3,
   from 1 to 4,          from 1 to 5,              from 2 to 4,             from 2 to 6,           from

   range,   for example,      1,   2,    3,    4,     5,    and    6.    This     applies
   regardless of the breadth of the range.
         Certain    embodiments        may    also        be     described        broadly

                  Detailed Disclosure           of Embodiments
         Exemplary,     non-limiting         embodiments              of   an     ionomer
   degradation agent comprising a transition metal complexed
15 with an ionized cyclic ester will                 now be disclosed.
         The  cyclic ester may be            a    furanone         group such as           a
   2-furanone     group    or    a    furan-2,5-dione                (also      commonly
   known as maleic      anhydride)       group.        The     cyclic ester group
   may  be   grafted     onto     the     backbone           of    a    polymer.        The
20 polymer may contain about 0.5 wt% to about 6.0 wt% of the
   cyclic   ester    by  weight.          It    is     to     be    noted      that     the
   higher  level    of  cyclic ester         present          in   the polymer may
   result  in an ionomer with higher               iron content.
        The   molecular     weight       of    the       polymer       may     be    about
25 1000 Mw to about 20000 Mw.
         The   backbone       of      the      polymer           may      comprise         a
   polyolefin.     The   polyolefin         may      comprise          at    least      one
   monomer   selected    from    the    group        consisting          of ethylene,
   propylene,     butene,     pentene,         hexene,           heptene,         octene,
30 styrene    and    isoprene.       Hence,         the      polymer        may      be   a
   polyethylene     such   as    high     density          polyethylene,            "HDPE"
                                             3                                  3
   (densities    from   0.940    gram/cm        to      0.965     grams/cm ),           low
   density    polyethylene,         "LDPE"         or      linear        low      density
   polyethylene,     "LLDPE"     (densities          from      0.870      grams/cm3 to

                                                   8
    0.939        grams/cm3 ),       polypropylene,              polybutene,            polypentene
    such as         poly     (4-methylpentene),                polyhexene,           polyheptene,
    polyoctene, polystyrene or polyisoprene.
              The polymer may be a copolymer of a polyolefin and a
  5 poly(maleic anhydride).
              The     polyolefin         may    further          comprise         at      least       one
    monomer        selected        from     the    group        consisting           of    a-olefins
    having between             about     3 to about            10 carbon         atoms,        acrylic
    acid,        methacrylic          acid,       ethylacrylate,                propylacrylate,
10  butyl       acrylate,       pentyl acrylate              and vinyl acetate.                  The o
    olefins        having      between        about      3   to     about      10    carbon        atoms
    may be propene, butene, pentene, hexene, heptene, octane,
    nonene        and decene.         In   one embodiment,                 the polymer may be
    polypropylene-co-maleic anhydride.
15            The polymer may comprise                   a transition metal selected
    from       the    group      consisting         of     cobalt,          chromium,          copper,
    iron,        manganese         and     nickel.             In     one     embodiment,             the
    transition           metal      may     be    cobalt         or     copper.         In     another
    embodiment,           the    transition         metal        may      be   chromium,           iron,
20  manganese          or    nickel.       In    such      materials,           the      transition
    metal        may   be    present       in    any      readily          accessible          valence
    state;         for     example,          cobalt         may       be     present           in     the
    cobaltous           (+2)     or    cobaltic          (+3)      state,        copper         in    the
    cuprous          (+1)     or    cupric        (+2)       state,         and     iron       in    the
25  ferrous          (+2)      or     ferric        (+3)        state.         More        than      one
    transition          metal      may    be    present         in     the    ionomer         and    the
    percentage of each transition metal may be adjustable.
              The    polymer        having      a    transition             metal      therein         is
    also      termed      as    an   "ionomer".          The     ionomer        may     be     present
30  in the form of a powder which facilitates the addition of
    the ionomer to a plastic blend.
              In    one    embodiment,           an     iron       ionomer        is      formed       in
    which       the    transition metal             is     iron       (II)    and     the      polymer

                                                                            H

             As     shown    in    the     formula       above,        the     ionomer          has      a
    free        maleic       anhydride          group        which          can       act        as      a
    compatibiliser             for      inorganic          fillers          in     the       plastic
   polymer.           Hence,      it    may      not     be     necessary             to     add      an
10  external additive.
             The degradation agent may be an additive that may be
    added       to   a plastic       blend.         The     degradation           agent        may be
   compounded           with a plastic           using an extruder                and then          the
   compounded product may be formed as a film sheet having a
15 thickness          of about      10     tm to about         120     pLm,    or about 15 ptm
   to about 35 tim. The concentration of ionomer in the blend
   may     be     in    the   range     of    about      1   wt% to         about        6  wt%.      As
   mentioned          above,     if    the     iron    content          in    the      ionomer        is
   high,       then a lower dosage               of   ionomer        prodegradant              can be
20 used      in    the plastic blend.             The degradation               agent        can act
   as    a photocatalyst            due     to the     presence           of the        transition
   metal ion such as the Fe2+ ion                       in the lionomer. Hence, the
   degradation            agent     functions        by      absorbing          UV       light      and
   accelerating            the    breakdown         of    the     plastic         into       smaller
25 fragments           that     can     be    then     broken          down      by       naturally
   occurring           microorganisms.            Due      to    the       presence          of     the
   maleic        anhydride       groups      which      act     as     a   dispersion            agent
   and compatibilizer between the Fe2+ ion and the plastic as

                                         10
   a   result      of    van   der     Waals      attraction      forces,     the
   degradation       agent    can    be     well     dispersed     within     the
   plastic efficiently.
          The ionomer may be made according to a process which
 5 comprises the following steps:
          (-i)       providing a polymer having a cyclic ester;
          (ii)        ionizing the cyclic ester; and
          (iii)   adding a transition metal              ion to said polymer
   to form a complex with the polymer and thereby form the
10 ionomer degradation agent.
          The    cyclic     ester    may     ionize,      resulting    in    ring
   opening due to hydrolysis of the maleic anhydride ring.
          The polymer       having    a   cyclic     ester may     be provided
   with a suitable solvent.          The solvent may be an alcohol or
15 an aromatic solvent.         The solvent may be a mixture of the
   alcohol and aromatic solvent. The alcohol may be selected
   from the group         consisting      of   ethanol,     propanol,    butanol
   and    pentanol.       The   alcohol      may     be    present    in    small
   proportions        to    reduce      the     solution      viscosity.      The
20 aromatic      solvent    may   be    toluene,      xylene   or   other    non
   polar solvents.
          The ratio of the aromatic solvent to the alcohol may
   be in    the range of about 8:1             (w/w)   to about 10:1       (w/w).
   In  one     embodiment,    the   ratio of the aromatic           solvent to
25 the alcohol is 9:1 (w/w).
          The solvent(s) may be heated to a temperature                   in the
   range of about        50C to about         1000C.    The temperature used
   is  dependent       on the type       of   polymer     and  the solvent(s)
   used.    In an embodiment where the polymer is                 PE-g-MAH and
30 the    solvents       used    are      n-butanol       and   toluene,      the
   temperature used is 800C          (under reflux).
          After the polymer is           mixed with the solvent(s),           the
   transition metal ion is           then     added to the mixture.          When
   the   transition      metal   is    iron,     the   transition    metal     ion

                                                 11
   may be added      in     the form of a               salt      such as        iron acetate,
   iron   chloride         or       iron       sulphate.            The       amount      of    the
   transition      metal        ion     to      be     added        to      the    solution       is
   dependent      on     the         degree        of        neutralization              (DN)     as

    transition metal ion is treated with a surfactant
              The degradation agent may comprise a surfactant.                                     The
25  surfactant         may     be   bonded      with    the    transition            metal       ion.
    The surfactant            may be       selected      from     the group          consisting

   surfactant is         polyethylene-polyethylene                   oxide.
          The molecular weight of the surfactant may be in                                    the
   range of about 500 Mw to about 3000 Mw.
 5        Synthesis          of the     clay     degradation         agent       may involve
   cation exchange            of the transition             metal     ion     into the clay
   structure,      followed by treatment                  (or bonding)           with a non
   ionic surfactant             to enhance dispersion               of the clay into a
   plastic blend.            According       to Scheme         2 below,        clay   such     as
10 nanoclay      (for       example,      montmorillonite)             is    first    treated
   with iron      (II)       to   form Fe-MMT.         The Fe-MMT         is    then  treated
   with a surfactant such as polyethylene-polyethylene oxide
   to   form    the      surfactant          modified        nano-clay.          Due   to     the
   above     modification            of     the    nanoclay,          the       interspacing
15 between the         clay platelets            increased       due      to the presence
   of   the    surfactant            modified       transition           metal      ion.      The
   interspacing         distance        may     be    increased        by     about    10A     to
   about 20A.

                                            Scheme 2
          The clay         degradation         agent may be          compounded         with a
   plastic in an            extruder and the compounded product may be
   formed    as   a film sheet via               a gas-film,         blow-film or thin
25 wall   injection moulding process.                      The   film      sheet may have

                                                   17
   a     thickness           of    about        15      Lm    to     about          35    pm.       The
   concentration             of  the      clay prodegradant               in     the blend          may
   be    in      the      range    of     about      1    wt%    to     about         6  wt%.       The
   presence          of     the    surfactants            in    the     clay        may      aid      to
 5 improve         the      dispersion         of    the     clay      in      the      compounded
   plastic.            Hence,     the       resultant          composite            may     exhibit
   properties            such   as    higher        heat     distortion           temperatures,
   enhanced         flame resistance,              increased modulus                and improved
   barrier properties.                   The clay degradation agent functions
10 by    absorbing           UV  light       and     accelerates          the      breakdown          of
   the      plastic         into     smaller         fragments         that        can     be     then
   broken down by naturally occurring microorganisms.
            The clay degradation                 agent may be made according                          to
   a process which comprises the following steps:
15           (i) providing a metal ion intercalated clay;
             (ii)        adding       a       surfactant           to       the        metal        ion
   intercalated clay to form a mixture;                            and
             (iii)       applying        pressure        to    the     mixture          from       step
    (ii) to obtain the clay degradation agent.
20          The process may further comprise the steps of:
             (iv)       intercalating          a    transition         metal         ion    between
   the     platelet          sheets      of    the    clay     to    form       the      metal      ion
   intercalated clay.
            The       transition          metal       ion    may      be       provided         as      a
25 transition            metal   salt       and mixed        with     the       clay     particles
   in    a    suitable        solvent        such     as   water.      As      the      mixture       is
   stirred,          the     transition         metal      ion     dissociates            from      the
   salt     and intercalates               between       the    platelet          sheets      of the
   clay        via        cation       exchange          with       the        clay.        In      one
30 embodiment,             the   transition           metal       ion      is      Fe3     and      the
   transition metal salt is iron                         (III) chloride.                In another

               The     ion-exchanged                clay       may      be     then        dried       and
     subjected         to ball        milling.           The    ball milling             step may be
     carried        out    at a      speed        of     about     2500      rpm     to    about     3500

               The    clay     degradation              agent      is     then      obtained       as     a

   Analysis Protocols
   Accelerated UV exposure
          Film    samples         were      placed      into    QUV-A       weatherometers
15  (Q-Panel,     340  nm       lamps)      using     a  20h UV       /   4h  condensation
   exposure     cycle       in      accordance        with    ASTM       D5208.     The   film
   samples     were    previously            cut    into     tensile        bar    specimens
   and   taped     onto      metal        backing     plates       for     insertion      into
   the   QUV   sample        holders.         A short       condensation          cycle     was
20 chosen to simulate conditions of natural outdoor moisture
   exposure,        such       as       simulated        sunlight          in    the     short
   wavelength region from around 365 nm down to 295 nm.
   Carbonyl index
25        Infrared absorbance                spectra      were analysed via            Perkin
   Elmer    FTIR      Spectrum            100    spectrometer.             6   scans      were
   collected      from     4000        to  450- cm.       The     extent      of oxidation
   was determined         by measuring the level                     of   ketone    carbonyl
   absorbance       peak       relative        to   the     C-H      stretching       of    the
30 polyolefin,        which         remains      essentially           unchanged       during
   oxidation.      Typically,            the absorbance          peak      for the     ketone
   carbonyl     formed       during        UV   exposure       was      observed     at   1713
   cm~1.   The     carbonyl           index     was     calculated         by   taking      the
   ratio of the carbonyl absorbance to the absorbance of the

                                               23
   CH   stretching         at     1464     cm~1.     This       provides         a   means    of
   quantifying        the        oxidative        degradation              over      time.    In
   general   the thickness              of   the     film analyzed             was    about   25
   pm  3.
 5
   Tensile
         Tensile        testing         was    conducted           by     using      Universal
   Testing     Machine           (UTM)      according           to      ASTM      D882.     Film
   samples were        cut      into rectangular              shape      with the       size  of
10 25.4 mm x      150 mm.         Cross head         speed was           set    at   500mm/min
   and load cell used was 500 N.
   Composting      (Biodegradation Analysis)
         After     exposure         to UV,      oxidized          samples were          exposed
15 to   aerobic      composting          conditions            (AS      IS014855,       Plastic

20       Oxidized        test materials             were      collected        and cut      into
   coupons     less        than       5    mm     x     5     mm,       to    minimize       any
   variability         in       the     speed       of       biodegradation            due    to
   differences       in      their     shapes      or     sizes.          Microcrystalline
   cellulose     powder was           used     as   positive          reference       material
25 for   the    biodegradation               process.          Compost         samples      were
   collected     from piles           of 2    to 3 months mature                  compost and
   transported        to      the    lab     within        an     hour      of    collection.
   Compost    characteristics               were     tested         in    accordance        with
   the   requirements            of   Australian            standard        AS     ISO   14855.
30 Compost   was     sieved through             a   sterile        brass sieve         with an
   8-mm   aperture         size      (Endecotts) and               any     glass     or    stone
   pieces   were     manually          removed.        Compost         pH   was     determined
   as  8.7, moisture 51.5%,               total organic carbon 18.4%, total

   nitrogen       1.8% and volatile              solids were          estimated as 47.9%
   of dry weight.
            Approximately          300        g   of    the       compost       (source     of
   innoculum)         was' filled         in    2L  glass      bottles       (bioreactors)
 5 and approximately             25    g    of   each    oxidized        film    sample    was
   added      and mixed well             (2   replicate        samples      were    used   for
   each test specimen).
            The     bioreactors          containing         the      test    mixture      were
   incubated in         a water bath maintained at 56+2 0C and set up
10 to     allow continuous           supply of         C0 2 -free      humidified     air   to
   bioreactors         and discharge            of   respired        gases to     a C02    gas
   analyzer.          The   bottles          were   shaken       at    regular     intervals
   to keep the system well aerated.
15 Molecular Weight Analysis                    (Gel Permeation Chromatography)
            Gel   permeation         chromatography             (GPC)    was   employed     to
   determine the molecular weights of the samples before and
   after exposure to UV
            Solutions of each sample                  were prepared by adding               15
20 mL of solvent to 15 mg of sample.                          For samples containing
   20wt% starch, 15 mL of solvent was added to 19 mg of the
   sample       to    maintain        a     similar     concentration           of   soluble
   polymer.       The    samples were            heated     at    190'C    for   20 minutes
   whilst. shaking,         then cooled to 160)C.                     The solutions were
25 filtered        through      a   1    pm glass       fibre       mesh    at   1600C    qand
   part of the filtered solution                      transferred to glass sample
   vials.       The     vials      were        placed       on     an   autosampler        and
   injection         of   part       of      the    contents         of   each     vial    was
   carried out automatically.

20 Synthesis of Fe-nanoclay
          Montmorillonite               K10     is     a    commercially          available
   catalytic        grade      of    smectite        clay,     which     has   been       acid
   treated      with       sulfuric       acid.       Referring        to    Fig.      1,    the
   processing         method          to     synthesize           Fe-nanoclay          is     as
25 follows:
          As    represented by.Step                1-1,    200g     of Montmorillonite
   K10,   405g of Iron Chloride                 (FeCl  3 ) and 2000ml of distilled
   water     was     added        into     a    4L    beaker.        The    solution         was
   stirred using the top mechanical stirrer for 24 hours. As
30 represented        in     Step    1-2,     the    solution       was   then    filtered,
   and the solid was repeatedly washed using distilled water
   until    it    was      free     of    chloride        ions.      (This    was     checked
   using     AgNO 3 ,     where       the      formation        of    AgCl     precipitate
   indicated that there were still chloride ions present.)

             The     ion-exchanged             clay       (Fe-Ki)           was     dried       in      the
                        0
   oven      at    105 C for          12    hours      subsequently,              as     represented
   in    Step 1-3.         Using the speed mixer,                      the dried Fe-K1O                 was
   ball-milled            (100g     at     a   time)       at    a    speed       of    3000rpm         for
 5 20s,        repeated        five        times        for       each        100g       portion         as
   represented in            Step 1-4.
             For      the     intercalation               of       polyethylene-block-poly
    (ethylene-glycol)               into       Fe-K10,        pellets          of    polyethylene
   block-poly            (ethylene-glycol)               were       placed       in     the     grinder
10 cup and immersed               in    liquid nitrogen to cool                       the pellets.
   Once      all     of   the    liquid        nitrogen          has     evaporated,           the      cup
   was fitted           into the        grinder and             the pellets           were      grinded
   to powder. The powder was dried at 50'C for 24 hours.
             75     g    of    Fe-K10         was      then        combined          with       25g      of
15 polyethylene-block-poly                       (ethylene-glycol)                in     the      powder
   mixer and mixed              for      20s     as   shown        in    Step 1-5.          The mixed
   powder was transferred into a steel mould, and pressed in
   the pressing            machine         until      the pressure              reached        500      psi
   at room temperature.                   The pressed            powder was placed                  in   an
20 oven of         95*C    for     12 hours.         The pressing and drying                        steps
   are      represented        by      Step      1-6    in     Fig.      1   to   finally         obtain
   Fe-nanoclay pro-degradant 100.
             The     ion-exchange            reaction          was      confirmed          via      X-ray
   diffraction               (XRD)           in       which           the         dOl           spacing
25  (corresponding            to     the      intergallery            spacing         between          clay
   platelets)           was   shown to increase                  slightly          (from 9.992           to
   10.000A),          use of an inductively                   coupled plasma               (ICP)      also
   confirmed          the increase            in    Fe content            from 2.16 to 3.14%.
   Further         expansion          of      the     intergallery              spacing          (up     to
30 18.303n) was also observed with the addition of the three
   different          molecular         weight       PE-PEO         non-ionic          surfactants.
   It     is     believed      that       this      expansion           is    the     precursor          to
   improving           the   dispersion             of     these       clay      platelets            when

    Synthesis of Fe-ionomer
              Referring        now to Fig.             2,    there    is   shown a       flowchart
    providing         the      steps      for      the      synthesis       of   Fe-ionomer            in
  5 accordance to one embodiment                          disclosed herein.
              The    introduction             of      iron       into     PE-g-MAH,       commonly
    referred         to      as    "neutralization",                  was     carried       out        in
     solution.        Firstly,         30    g    of     PE-g-MAH       was   dissolved         under
    reflux        at 80      'C   in    300     g    of    toluene       and n-butanol          mixed
10  solvent          (9:1      w/w),        represented              by    Step       2-1.      After
    complete        dissolution,           the required amount of aqueous                         iron
    acetate        solution        was     introduced            to   the    polymer      solution
     (1.58      g   of    iron       acetate         in     30    mL   deionised        water)        as
    represented by Step 2-2. The amount of iron acetate added
15  was      equivalent         to a theoretical                 degree    of neutralization
     (DN)      of   100%,       as    calculated            by    equations       (I)    and       (II)
    above.
              After addition of the aqueous iron acetate solution,
    the two phase             solution was vigorously                     stirred      for 1 hour
20  at      80   *C.    Thereafter,            about        one    third     of   the     solution
    mixture was distilled off under vacuum and the equivalent
    amount        of   fresh       mixed        solvent         was    added.     The     reaction
    mixture        was    again      refluxed          at    80   0C   for   another hour           and
    about       one   third of the solvent                     was distilled         off and the
25  equivalent           amount         of      fresh         solvent      was     added.        This
    process was          repeated for a total                    of 8 times until no iron
    acetate         precipitate             remained.             Recovery      of      the      iron
    ionomer         from      solution           was       done     via     precipitation             in
    acetone        drop     wise      to    obtain         a   fine     powder.     The     ionomer
30  precipitate           was     then      filtered           under     vacuum     followed          by
    washing        with      deionised           water.         The    wet    precipitate           was
    dried       under       vacuum        at      40      OC    overnight.       The      washing,
    filtration         and drying            steps        are    represented        by Step         2-3
    in Fig. 2 to finally obtain Fe-ionomer pro-degradant 200.

   Compounding
          Pro-degradant          additives        were     compounded          with    HDPE
 5 via   Theysohn     twins      screw      extruder       (Theysohn         030 mm,     L/D
   40)    with    screw       configuration             of     two     mixing       zones.
   Temperature was set at 170/                 180/ 200       OC from feeding zone
   to die zone. The compounds were extruded at a screw speed
   of   85rpm.   Compounded          samples       then    were      blown      into   film
10 sheet    using    YEI    HDM      series      of   single        screw     blown    film
   extruder. The temperature                was    set from        180   to    195*'C with
   the output     of 10 kg/hour.            The thickness          of the film sheet
   is  25  5 pm.
15 Result
   Tensile after UV
          Effect of pro-degradant system on tensile properties
   of  HDPE   film     is   showed       in   Fig.    3 and       4.   In    general,      it
20 can   be  observed       that      most      of   the    films      including       HDPE
   showed     decreasing           tensile        and      elongation           at    break
   properties as the UV exposure time increased. Exposure of
   polymer    film      to   UV     had     generated       free'     radical      on    the
   polymer chain and then initiated chain oxidation. Tensile
25 and      elongation            properties            of        Fe-ionomer           film
   significantly         dropped      after      48   hours       QUV    exposure.       The
   decrease    of   the     Fe-ionomer         film    properties         is    more   than
   50%  from its original properties                   (prior to UV exposure).
          As  can  be     observed,         Fe-ionomer       at    0.2% demonstrated
30 remarkable     film      degradation          as   compared        to     0.2% EcoAdd
   and   0.2% Fe-nanoclay,             indicating        that     the    efficiency       of
   Fe-ionomer     additives         as   a photo 'degradation              agent.     While
   not    being     bound         by      theory,       it      is     believed        that
   incorporation         of    PE-g       MAH    ionomer        into      Fe    particles
35 introduced     carbonyl         group      such     as    carboxylic          acid    and

                                             30
   anhydride         which      could       induce        chain           oxidation        more
   rapidly.      In    addition,      the presence          of      this     ionomer      could
   also      improve        the     dispersion           of        the        pro-degradant
   additives         in    HDPE      film.       The       reduction            of    tensile
 5 properties        for   0.2   Fe-nanoclay         systems         is     slightly      lower
   than Fe-ionomer.
          It   was found that both of Fe-ionomer                          and Fe-nanoclay
    films were disintegrated               after     144    hours         of UV     exposure.
   The photo of films disintegration                     is shown in            Fig 5.
10        A comparison         of   HDPE film degradation                    properties        at
   different       Fe-ionomer       dosage      is    also     shown        in   Fig.    6   and
   7.    Referring       to   these     Figs.,       increasing            the    Fe-ionomer
   dosage     did     not    seem    to    give     significant             effect     on    the
   degradation rate of the film as the trend in                                the decrease
15 in   the tensile properties               was   almost the             same.    The trend
   demonstrated          that    lower       dosage       of      Fe-ionomer          offered
   better    Fe dispersion          in   HDPE     film and generated                 the same
   amount      of     free    radical       in    polymer         chain        with     higher
   dosage     (3% of weight) .          Presence       of free          radical rendered
20 significant degradation to the film.

   analysis        was     used      to    provide         information             regarding
25 accumulation of carbonyl               containing product                 as a function
   of    UV   exposure        time.      In    general,         the        carbonyl      index
   provides      a    quantitative         measure       of    film        degradation.         A
   higher       carbonyl          index        value          demonstrates              higher

   exposure      time.     Referring        to   Fig.      8,    it      can    be   observed
   that    there      had   been    an    increase        in    carbonyl         index     over
   time    for     the    0.2% Fe-ionomer             film     as       compared       to    the
   benchmark       samples     of    0.2% EcoAdd and             the       neat    HDPE    film

   without       any pro-degradant               additives.             The    increase       in    the
    carbonyl      index       for    Fe-ionomer             film was         obvious       after      96
   hours    of UV exposure.              It    had been proven                 in    the previous
    tensile result that incorporation                            and reaction           of ionomer
 5  in  Fe     particles          has    led     to        a    significant           increase        in
    carbonyl      index      and degradation,                 which       indicated         that    the
    activity        of   this      pro-degradant                appeared          to   be    greater
   than other pro-degradant system.
          Referring            to    Fig.       9,        it      can      be     observed         that
10  increasing        the     Fe-ionomer         dosage          resulted        in an increase
    in the carbonyl             index value, particularly after 48 hours
   of   UV.     However,        at    144    hours,          increasing           the   Fe-ionomer
   dosage       did     not      seem     to     have         a    significant           effect      on
    carbonyl       index      as    the     results          obtained         did     not    show     an
15 appreciable          difference.           As       shown       in     tensile       properties
   result,      carbonyl groups presented at lower dosage of 0.2%
   Fe-ionomer         after 144 hours UV yield about similar results
   to higher         dosage       of   Fe-ionomer            pro-degradant.             The    result
   demonstrated          that       PE-g-MAH          ionomer          used     in    this     system
20 might      improve       Fe     dispersion            in     polymer        chain      and     as    a
   result       provide         higher       degradation               rate      even     at     lower
   dosage of additive.
   Biodegradation results
25        Results        obtained         after         323      days      revealed        that     the
   cellulose         sample        reached        more         than       90% biodegradation
   within      45    days     of compositing.                This      indicates        that there

    Conclusion
10            The      above        example       discusses           the       HDPE      film
    degradation           performance      at different         pro-degradant         system
    under      an    accelerated       UV   exposure       weatherometer.          Decrease
    in    the     tensile        properties     and     increase       in    the   carbonyl
    index were apparently observed for the Fe-ionomer system,
15  which       indicated         the   improved         efficiency         of    this     Fe
    ionomer            in        decomposing           hydrocarbon              chain        or
    hydroperoxides,               leading     to      the      generation         of     free
    radicals.          Presence      of   ionomer        (PE-g-MAH)        increased       the
    degradation           rate    by introducing         the    carbonyl       group which
20  accelerated            photo    degradation       of    the     polymer      chain.      On
    the     other      hand,     the presence       of    ionomer       improved     the     Fe
    dispersion          in    HDPE and this led to            a similar degradation
    rate      of the       film even when       lower dosage           of pro-degradant
    was     used.      In    addition,     use    of    clay    particles,        which      is
25  good in        barrier properties           in   Fe-Nanoclay          systems,     could
    minimize and control degradation rate of the polymer.

    Reactive Extrusion of Fe-ionomer
30            Reactive       extrusion was       performed        on a Theysohn          twin

  a  liquid       injection    port   and   venting    zone.   The   melt
  temperature       used  depended   on   the  blend   of  polymer   used
  with   PE-g-MA.        Since  LLDPE   was   used  as   the  additional

          The above results showed that a high level of Fe was
   achieved in this method. The results also showed that the

   Characterisation of Fe-ionomer
10 ATR-FTIR
          ATR-FTIR        was      used      to     confirm         the      degree     of
   neutralization           of    the    samples        made      in     the    reactive
   extrusion      method.          This    was    compared        with     the    samples
   made in the method according to Example 1.
15        As   seen    in    Fig.   10,   the peaks,          located between        1500
   and   1900    cm-1,     are    due   to   carbonyl         functionalities.         The
   main peak appearing at 1708 cm'                   was due to free C=O bonds
   of   the     hydrolysed          anhydride         ring.          From      the   peak
   intensities,         complete       neutralization            was    not    achieved,
20 even    for   the    samples      made     by   the     solution       method.    This
   incomplete          neutralization             is       commonly          found      in
   literature.
          The peaks        or   shoulders       that    appear      at    1600   to  1650
   cm    had    been     identified       as     Fe-carboxylate          groups.       The
25 presence     of    peaks      or    shoulders       within      this      region    was
   seen for all samples, confirming that the iron had bonded
   with     the     carboxyl        groups       from       the    anhydride        ring.
   Comparing the         spectra      of LLDPE-Fe-ionomer             blend made       via
   the   two    different         methods,       no    appreciable          differences
30 were   observed,        confirming       that     reactive       extrusion       was  a
   suitable     synthesis         method     without       the    use     of   solvents.
   It  is also to be noted that the use of                       ascorbic acid        (AA)
   did    not     affect       the     neutralization            reaction,       as    the
   spectra of that with and without AA was identical.

          As   seen     in   Table      3   above,      it    can be         observed     that
   the     molecular         weight         of     the       Fe-ionomer            decreased
   significantly          after     exposure         to     500      hours      of   UV.      A
   further    exposure        to an additional              500     hours of UV         (total
20 1000    hours)      decreased        the     molecular           weight      of   the   Fe
   ionomer      even       further       to     8,045.           This       represented       a
   reduction      in   molecular        weight       of    96% as         compared     to  the
   original      polymer.       As     the      molecular         weight       appeared     to
   have increased when comparing between                           the samples exposed
25 for    1000     hours      and     1500      hours,       the       molecular       weight
   distribution        for    the    Fe-ionomer         film       exposed       up  to   1500
   hours was determined, as can be seen in Fig. 13.
          For   the     film    sample       exposed       to    1500      hours,    Fig.   13
   shows    that     a    significant          reduction         in     molecular      weight
30 had   occurred.           The   molecular          weight        polydispersity         had

                                              37
   increased     slightly and two peaks were                      apparent        after   1000
   hours.     The GPC data            revealed that             about     60% of      the   Fe
   ionomer    containing         film had a           molecular         weight      of below
   5000.    This    result     is     very     positive         since     the     guidelines
 5 for   ASTM    D6954       suggest         this      as    the       target      molecular
   weight reduction for oxo-biodegradable polymers.

   Synthesis of Clay Degradation Agent from FeSO 4
10        200 g of Clay-KiO and 40g of FeSO                        4   (30 wt% solution,
   obtained from Alfa Aesar of Ward Hill of Massachusetts of
   the United States of America) were added into a 4L beaker
   with 2L deionized water.                The      solution        was   stirred      with    a
   top-head      mechanical             stirrer          for       24     hours.            The
15 precipitation        was     filtered          and     washed       repeatedly        using
   deionized     water     three       times.         The Fe-clay-K10              was   dried
   in  an   oven    at   70'C      for    12    hours.          The    iron     content     was
   analysed using ICP and the resulting %Fe was 2.6%.
         The   dried      Fe-K10       was     then      mixed      with polyethylene
20 block poly(ethylene             glycol)        Mw=1400       with weight         ratio    of
   0.25     using      a     blender,           and       then       pressed        at    room
   temperature at a pressure of 500 psi.                             The pressed powder
   was   heated     in   an   oven        at    a   temperature          of     90'C   for   12
   hours.      The     intercalated             Fe-KlO       was      grounded       using     a
25 speed   mixer/ball        milling         method       at    a    speed     of   3000    rpm
   for 30 seconds.          This process was repeated three times.
         Film    samples       were       placed       in    a.   QUV-A     weatherometer

 5 Starch-based Samples
             CPO treated Tapioca starch was premixed with polymer
   pellets         then       fed      into     hopper.        The      samples           used       are
   labeled         as       "20%       starch",         "50ppm        Fe-ioncmer+AA+                 20%
   starch",        "50ppm         Fe-ionomer        no    AA+20%      starch"           and    "50ppm
10 Fe-K10+20% starch".                  Tapioca      starch      was     obtained          from the
   Manildra Group.
             Here,       HDPE       and    EcoAdd       were     used       as      the      control
   samples.            HDPE        and     EcoAdd        were      obtained              from        the
   respective suppliers as mentioned in Example 1 above. The
15 HDPE and EcoAdd films were extruded at a thickness                                          of 270
   pm.        The    extruded          HDPE    film     was   prepared          using       a    haake
   Rheocord         single         screw      extruder       with       sheet         die      (19    mm
   simple        conveying          screw     with screw        ratio       2:1)    .      The film
   was      extruded        using       a   water     cooled     3    roller          system       with
20 positive        tension.           The    screw     rpm   was      set      at      70   rpm      for
   most      samples and the temperature profile                            from the feeding
   zone to die was 170, 210, 210 and 180 0 C.
   UV Trial
25           Samples       of 270        pm thickness         were      removed          from     a   Q

             Infrared         absorbance          spectra       were        collected            on     a

   on    an    average         of    2   to   3   areas     of   film.          Images         of    the
   degraded        films        after      499    hours     are    shown        Fig.       14.     From
   Fig.      14,    it    can      be   seen that        the   samples         containing            Fe-

   significant             degradation.                Similarly,              the       sample
   containing         Fe-K10       (sample     6)     showed          obvious        signs     of
   degradation.            The   sample    containing             starch alone          (sample
 5 3)   also     showed       signs    of   degradation,              although        visually
   this    did    not      appear    as   bad     as    the        samples      containg       Fe
   degradation agents.              The EcoAdd sample                (sample 2) did not
   appear to be visually degraded.

          The results             from Table         4   appeared       to   show that          the
   starch     containing              samples       showed         higher     levels        of      %
   biodegradation             compared         to     the     films      without        starch.
 5 This    may     be      due     to    the     faster      degradation          of    starch.
   However,        it      should        be     noted       that      these       films        were
   significantly           thicker        at   270      pm compared        to    the    thinner
   100    pm     films.               In    addition,          there      was      still        80%
   polyolefin          in    these        films      that      surrounded         the     starch
10 particles,         so that         an   immediate        loss     of   starch will           not
   be   apparent.
          Film samples             (1) and      (3) were further subjected to a
   SEM    analysis.              These      samples       were      recovered        carefully
   from    the      post-degradation                compost         and    were      carefully
15 rinsed     with        de-ionised          water      or   ethanol       to    remove        any
   surface debris that may have adhered to the post degraded
   samples.         Pieces        of    the    degraded        samples      were     carefully
   mounted onto a sample puck using                          conductive        tape and the
   samples     were        coated       with    iridium.        SEM    analysis       was      then
20 carried out according to the protocol described above.
          Fig.     15(a)        and- Fig.       15(b)     .showed the        SEM    images        of
   samples     (1)      and      (3)    respectively.           It   could be seen             that
   the surface of sample                  (3)   was     colonized by microorganisms
   and   that there           is     evidence     that      these microorganisms                had
25 removed     mass        from      the    polymer       as   depicted       by    the     arrow
   which       indicated               significant           degradation            or         hole
   formation.            Fig.      15(b)      also      clearly      showed     that      sample
    (3)  contained filamentous                  microorganisms           that are typical
   of   fungi     (as      shown       by   the    dotted       arrow) .       In    contrast,
30 the neat HDPE film of Fig. 15(a) did not show any sign of
   microbial         colonization             and      only     showed      minor       surface
   defects.         These        results      strongly        suggested       that      given       a
   longer    time period,               sample      (3)    can be      expected       to    fully

   Molecular Weight Analaysis
10        Gel permeation          chromatography                (GPC)     was    employed      to
   determine the molecular weights of the                             samples before         and
   after      exposure       to    UV         for      500     hours.           The    samples
   determined       here     are     (1)      neat      HDPE      (thickness       of   100    pm

          The    results       from       this        analysis       are     summarized        in
   Fig. 16 and 17.
          The    initial        molecular              weight       for     the     unexposed
   samples      was   typically            200,000.         After       500    hours     of    UV
25 exposure,      this      value       decreased           significantly.           The   data
   for the 100       pm films         (see Fig.           16)    showed the        Fe-ionomer
   film    being    reduced       to     a     molecular         weight     of    12,950     and
   that of the Fe-K1O film being reduced to 13,850.
           For the 270 pm films                  (see Fig. 17),          the exposed neat
30 HDPE-film was        found to have a molecular                        weight of       26,900
   while     the   film      containing             Fe-ionomer        and     starch     had     a
   molecular      weight      of   11,500.             This     represented        a  loss     of
   about    94% in    molecular weight                  of  the polymer.            A similar
   decrease      was    also      observed            for     the    Fe-K10       and    starch

   The  film    containing         starch     alone      showed      a     reduction        to
   18,700 while EcoPlus was 16,650.

   invention        may      be     applied         in      numerous           industrial
   applications,       not     least    in   any     products       which       have     been
   made   from     plastics,        for    example,         packaging          materials,
10 films,   shock absorbing materials,                  or blow-molded             bottles,

         The   use    of    clay particles           in   the    degradation           agent
   of  the   present       invention       minimizes         and    provides         better
   control     of     the       degradation           rate      of       the       polymer.
15 Advantageously,         the      degradation          agent     of       the     present
   invention     is   environmentally            friendly       and      contains        non
   toxic or low toxicity components.
         More     advantageously,            the      presence         of      functional
   groups   on  the    ionomer degradation              agent    results         in  better
20 adhesion    between        the    degradation         agent     and       the    plastic
   polyolefin,       which     in   turn    results       in   plastic         polyolefin
   with    enhanced        degradation          performance.                  Even       more
   advantageously, the degradation                  rate of the polyolefin                  is
   maintained even when a low dosage of the pro-degradant is
25 used.
         It will be apparent that various other modifications
   and adaptations        of the invention              will   be apparent           to the
   person    skilled      in     the    art   after       reading       the      foregoing
   disclosure without departing from the spirit and scope of
30 the    invention         and      it    is     intended         that         all       such
   modifications        and     adaptations        come      within       the     scope     of
   the appended claims.
