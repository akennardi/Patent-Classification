      METHODS OF DETECTING NEUROLOGICAL OR NEUROPSYCHIATRIC
                                     DISEASES OR CONDITIONS
   This application is a divisional of Australian Application No. <removed-apn>, the entire
   contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
    Related Application Data
    [0001]        This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application
 5  No. 61/367,056, filed on July 23, 2010 and is hereby incorporated herein by
    reference in its entirety for all purposes.
    Field of the Invention
    [0002]     This invention relates generally to methods of using phagocytic cells
    alone or in combination with non-phagocytic cells in the diagnosis, prognosis, or
10  monitoring of neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases or conditions. The
    invention also relates to methods of using phagocytic cells alone or in combination
    with non-phagocytic cells to identify markers of neurological or neuropsychiatric
    diseases or conditions.
    Background of the Invention
15  [0003]     Early diagnosis of a disease often increases the likelihood of successful
    treatment or cure of such disease. Current diagnostic methods, however, depend
    largely on population-derived average values obtained from healthy individuals.
    Personalized diagnostic methods are needed that enable the diagnosis, especially
    the early diagnosis, of the presence of a disease or a condition in individuals who
20  are not known to have the disease or who have recurrent disease. This is of
    particular importance in neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases or conditions,
    which affect up to one billion people worldwide.
     [0004]     Leukocytes begin as pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells in the bone
    marrow and develop along either the myeloid lineage (monocytes, macrophages,
25  neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) or the lymphoid lineage (T and B
    lymphocytes and natural killer cells). The major function of the myeloid lineage
    cells (e.g., neutrophils and macrophages) is the phagocytosis of infectious
    organisms, live unwanted damaged cells, senescent and dead cells (apoptotic and
    necrotic), as well as the clearing of cellular debris. Phagocytes from healthy
                                          1

   animals do not replicate and are diploid, i.e., have a DNA index of one. On
   average, each cell contains <10 ng DNA, <20 ng RNA, and <300 ng of protein.
   [0005]    One object of the present invention is to provide diagnostic methods that
   can facilitate the detection of neurological or neuropsychiatric disease or
 5 condition-specific markers, e.g., nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and/or
   lipids and the like by using phagocytic cells alone, or in combination with non
   phagocytic cells. Another object of this invention is to provide methods of
   identifying neurological or neuropsychiatric disease or condition-specific markers
   and further use such markers alone or together with any known markers to
10 diagnose diseases or conditions.
   Summary of the Invention
   [0006]    We have invented new and useful methods for detecting/diagnosing
   neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases or conditions by using phagocytic cells
   alone or in combination with non-phagocytic cells. In some embodiments,
15 phagocytic cells serve as surrogates for diseased cells and non-phagocytic cells
   serve as control cells. In other embodiments, two sub-populations of phagocytic
   cells are used, wherein the phagocytic cells that have a DNA content greater than
   2n ( the >2n phagocytic cells) serve as surrogates for diseased cells, while the
   phagocytic cells that have a DNA content of 2n ( the =2n phagocytic cells) serve as
20 control cells.

   In some embodiments, the one or more markers of said disease or condition are not
   present in the cellular contents of the =2n phagocytic cells. In some embodiments,
   the phagocytic cells express at least one of the one or more markers of said disease
   or condition. In some embodiments, the >2n phagocytic cells express at least one
15 of the one or more markers of said disease or condition.

   comparing the identified difference of c) to a repository of one or more known
   markers of said disease or condition (e.g., data obtained by data mining).
   [0033]     In some embodiments, the phagocytic cells are professional phagocytic

   [0037]     FIG. 1A schematically depicts one embodiment of a method of the
   invention for diagnosing or aiding in the diagnosis of a neurological or
   neuropsychiatric disease or condition. In this embodiment, phagocytic cells and
25 non-phagocytic cells are separated from white blood cells of a subject. The
   phagocytic cells serve as surrogates for diseased cells, while the non-phagocytic
   cells serve as control cells.
   [0038]     FIG. 1B schematically depicts one proposed pathway leading to
   acquisition of a neurological or neuropsychiatric disease-specific DNA, RNA,

   circulating diseased cells, apoptotic diseased cells, and/or fragmented diseased
   cells. Accordingly, the disease-specific markers (e.g., DNAs, RNAs, proteins, or
   lipids) that are contained within these diseased cells/fragments are also internalized
   by phagocytic cells. By contrast, non-phagocytic cells do not internalize these
 5 diseased cells/fragments, and, therefore, do not contain and/or express the disease
   specific markers.

   invention for diagnosing or aiding in the diagnosis of a neurological or
   neuropsychiatric disease or condition. In this embodiment, a blood sample is
   withdrawn from an individual to be diagnosed. After a centrifugation step, white
15 blood cells are isolated from the blood sample and further separated into two
   populations of phagocytic cells: phagocytic cells (e.g., macrophages or
   neutrophils) having a DNA content more than 2n (>2n phagocytic cells) and
   phagocytic cells (e.g., macrophages or neutrophils) having a DNA content of 2n
   (=2n phagocytic cells). The >2n phagocytic cells serve as surrogates for diseased
20 cells and the 2n phagocytic cells serve as control cells.

   acquisition of neurological or neuropsychiatric disease or condition-specific
   markers (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein and lipid markers) by phagocytic cells. Blood
   phagocytes engulf viable circulating diseased cells, apoptotic diseased cells, and/or
25 fragmented diseased cells. Accordingly, the neurological or neuropsychiatric
   disease or condition-specific markers (e.g., DNAs, RNAs, proteins, or lipids) that
   are contained within these diseased cells/fragments are also internalized by
   phagocytic cells, which then become >2n phagocytic cells containing and/or
   expressing these specific markers. By contrast, phagocytic cells that do not
30 internalize these diseased cells/fragments, and thus, do not contain or express these
   markers, and remain DNA content of 2n.

   "comprises" or "comprising" will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated
   integer (or components) or group of integers (or components), but not the
10 exclusion of any other integer (or components) or group of integers (or
   components).
   [0054]    The singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include the plurals unless the
   context clearly dictates otherwise.
   [0055]    The term "including" is used to mean "including but not limited to".
15 "Including" and "including but not limited to" are used interchangeably.

15 Description of Methods of the Invention
   [0061]    The present invention provides methods for diagnosing or aiding in the
   diagnosis of a neurological or neuropsychiatric disease or condition by comparing
   profiles (e.g., gene/protein/lipid/carbohydrate expression profiles, genotypes, gene
   copy number, gene dosage, DNA methylation, etc.) of disease or condition
20 associated markers (e.g., nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, metabolites)
   between phagocytic cells having different DNA contents (>2n vs. =2n) taken from
   the same individual, or between phagocytic cells and non-phagocytic cells taken
   from the same individual.
   [0062]    This invention also provides methods for assessing the risk of developing
25 a neurological or neuropsychiatric disease or condition, prognosing said disease,
   monitoring said disease progression or regression, assessing the efficacy of a
   treatment, or identifying a compound capable of ameliorating or treating said
   disease or condition.
                                              18

   [0063]     Such a subject-specific profile comparison eliminates the dependence on
   a population-derived average profile for a particular disease or condition, which
   may introduce error into the detection or diagnosis of a particular disease or
   condition in the subject. The methods of this invention allow detection, diagnosis,
 5 and treatment to be personalized to the individual.
   [0064]    The methods of this invention (i) have high specificity, sensitivity, and
   accuracy and are capable of detecting disease or condition-specific markers present
   within a bodily fluid sample, cells or tissues; and (ii) eliminate the "inequality of
   baseline" that is known to occur among individuals due to intrinsic (e.g., age,
10 gender, ethnic background, health status and the like) and temporal variations in
   marker expression. Accordingly, in certain aspects, the invention provides non
   invasive assays for the early detection of a disease or condition, i.e., before the
   disease can be diagnosed by conventional diagnostic techniques, e.g., imaging
   techniques, and, therefore, provide a foundation for improved decision-making
15 relative to the needs and strategies for intervention, prevention, and treatment of
   individuals with such disease or condition.
   [0065]    The methods of this invention can be used together with any known
   diagnostic methods, such as physical inspection, visual inspection, biopsy,
   scanning, histology, radiology, imaging, ultrasound, use of a commercial kit,
20 genetic testing, immunological testing, analysis of bodily fluids, or monitoring
   neural activity.
   [0066]    Phagocytic cells that can be used in the methods of this invention include
   all types of cells that are capable of ingesting various types of substances (e.g.,
   apoptotic cells, infectious agents, dead cells, viable cells, cell-free DNAs, cell-free
25 RNAs, cell-free proteins). In some embodiments, the phagocytic cells are
   professional phagocytic cells, such as neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes,
   dendritic cells, foam cells, mast cells, or eosinophils. In some embodiments, the
   phagocytic cells are non-professional phagocytic cells, such as epithelial cells,
   endothelial cells, fibroblasts, or mesenchymal cells. In other embodiments, the
30 phagocytic cells can be a mixture of different types of phagocytic cells. Non
                                               19

   phagocytic cells that can be used in this invention include, but are not limited to, T
   cells, B cells, null cells, basophils, or mixtures thereof.
   [0067]    As used herein, "the >2n phagocytic cells" refer to phagocytic cells that
   have a DNA content of greater than 2n, while "the =2n phagocytic cells" refer to
 5 phagocytic cells that have a DNA content of 2n. According to the present
   invention, some phagocytic cells engulf live/dying/dead diseased cells (and sub
   cellular fragments thereof) and/or cell-free disease-specific nucleic acids, proteins,
   carbohydrates and/or lipids present in bodily fluids. Such phagocytosis leads to the
   internalization of these disease markers into the phagocytic cell and, therefore, the
10 DNA content of these phagocytic cells will become greater than 2n. By contrast,
   some phagocytic cells have not engulfed living/dying/dead diseased cells or
   fragments and/or cell-free disease-specific nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and/or
   carbohydrates present in bodily fluids. The DNA contents of this group of
   phagocytic cells remain 2n. In some embodiments, the disease-specific markers
15 (e.g., DNA with disease-specific mutations) can be expressed by the >2n
   phagocytic cells. For example, the mutated DNA of diseased cells is integrated
   into the normal DNA of the >2n phagocytic cells. The subsequent transcription of
   the "integrated" DNA of the >2n phagocytic cells into RNA and the translation of
   the latter into proteins produces a phenotype different from the phagocytic cells
20 that have not phagocytosed the diseased cells (i.e., the =2n phagocytic cells). In
   other embodiments, the internalized disease-specific markers are not expressed by
   the >2n phagocytic cells. The markers may be translocated onto the membranes of
   the >2n phagocytic cells, or secreted out by the >2n phagocytic cells.
   [0068] As used herein, a "profile" of a marker of a disease or condition can
25 broadly refer to any information concerning the marker. This information can be
   either qualitative (e.g., presence or absence) or quantitative (e.g., levels, copy
   numbers, or dosages). In some embodiments, a profile of a marker can indicate the
   absence of this marker. The profile can be a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA or RNA)
   profile, a protein profile, a lipid profile, a carbohydrate profile, a metabolite
30 profile, or a combination thereof. A "marker" as used herein generally refers to an
   analyte which is differentially detectable in phagocytes and is indicative of the
                                                20

   presence of a disease or condition. An analyte is differentially detectable if it can
   be distinguished quantitatively or qualitatively in phagocytes.
   [0069]    The methods of this invention can be applied to various neurological or
   neuropsychiatric diseases or conditions. As used herein, "neurological or
 5 neuropsychiatric disease or condition" can refer to any disease, disorder, or
   condition affecting or associated with the nervous system. Examples of
   neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases or conditions include, but are not limited
   to head trauma, stroke, a neurodegenerative disorder, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic
   stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intra cranial hemorrhage, transient ischemic

   [0071]    As used herein, "treating" a disease or condition refers to taking steps to
   obtain beneficial or desired results, including clinical results. Beneficial or desired
   clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or
   more symptoms associated with neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases or
 5 conditions.
   [0072]    As used herein, "administering" or "administration of' a compound or an
   agent to a subject can be carried out using one of a variety of methods known to
   those skilled in the art. For example, a compound or an agent can be administered,
   intravenously, arterially, intradermally, intramuscularly, intraperitonealy,
10 intravenously, subcutaneously, ocularly, sublingually, orally (by ingestion),
   intranasally (by inhalation), intraspinally, intracerebrally, and transdermally (by
   absorbtion, e.g., through a skin duct). A compound or agent can also appropriately
   be introduced by rechargeable or biodegradable polymeric devices or other
   devices, e.g., patches and pumps, or formulations, which provide for the extended,

   performed, for example, once, a plurality of times, and/or over one or more
   extended periods. In some aspects, the administration includes both direct
   administration, including self-administration, and indirect administration, including
   the act of prescribing a drug. For example, as used herein, a physician who
20 instructs a patient to self-administer a drug, or to have the drug administered by
   another and/or who provides a patient with a prescription for a drug is
   administering the drug to the patient. In some embodiments, a compound or an
   agent is administered orally, e.g., to a subject by ingestion, or intravenously, e.g.,
   to a subject by injection. In some embodiments, the orally administered compound
25 or agent is in an extended release or slow release formulation, or administered
   using a device for such slow or extended release.
   [0073]    In certain embodiments, markers used in the methods of invention are
   up-regulated or activated in the phagocytic cells compared to the non-phagocytic
   cells. In certain embodiments, markers used in the methods of invention are
30 down-regulated or inhibited in the phagocytic cells compared to the non
   phagocytic cells. In certain embodiments, markers used in the methods of

   =2n phagocytic cells. In certain embodiments, markers used in the methods of
   invention are down-regulated or inhibited in the >2n phagocytic cells compared to
   the =2n phagocytic cells. Different diseases or conditions can be associated with
 5 either up-regulation (or activation) or down-regulation (or inhibition) of different
   markers. As used herein, "up-regulation or up-regulated" can refer to an increase
   in expression levels (e.g., gene expression or protein expression), gene copy
   numbers, gene dosages, and other qualitative or quantitative detectable state of the
   markers. Similarly, "down-regulation or down-regulated" can refer to an increase
10 in expression levels, gene copy numbers, gene dosages, and other qualitative or
   quantitative detectable state of the markers. As used herein, "activation or
   activated" can refer to an active state of the marker, e.g., a phosphorylation state, a
   DNA methylation state, or a DNA acetylation state. Similarly, "inhibition or
   inhibited" can refer to a repressed state or an inactivated state of the marker, e.g., a
15 de-phosphorylation state, a ubiquitination state, a DNA de-methylation state.

   [0076]    In certain embodiments, methods of this invention further comprise
10 comparing the identified difference of the disease or condition-specific markers to
   a repository of at least one markers known in the art. Such comparison can further
   confirm the presence of the disease or condition. In some embodiments, the
   repository of the known markers can be obtained by data mining. The term "data
   mining", as used herein, refers to a process of finding new data patterns, relations,
15 or correlations derived from the known data of the databases and of extracting
   practicable information in the future. Typically a computer-based system can be
   trained on data to perform the data mining, e.g., to classify the input data and then
   subsequently used with new input data to make decisions based on the training
   data. These systems include, but are not limited, expert systems, fuzzy logic, non
20 linear regression analysis, multivariate analysis, decision tree classifiers, and
   Bayesian belief networks.
   [0077]    In certain embodiments, the phagocytic cells (e.g., the >2n and the =2n

   phagocytic cells are separated from a population of phagocytic cells.
   [0078]     In the methods of this invention, cell separation/isolation/purification
 5 methods are used to isolate populations of cells from bodily fluid sample, cells, or
   tissues of a subject. A skilled worker can use any known cell
   separation/isolation/purification techniques to isolate phagocytic cells or non
   phagocytic cells from a bodily fluid, or to separate phagocytic cells from non
   phagocytic cells, or to separate >2n phagocytic cells from =2n phagocytic cells.

   embodiments, the phagocytic cells and the non-phagocytic cells are isolated by
   using a cell surface target (e.g., receptor protein) on the surface of phagocytic cells.
   In some embodiments, the cell surface target is a protein that has been engulfed by
20 the phagocytic cells. In some embodiments, the cell surface target is expressed by
   the phagocytic cells on their plasma membranes. In some embodiments, the cell
   surface target is an exogenous protein that is translocated on the plasma
   membranes, but not expressed by the phagocytic cells. In some embodiments, the
   cell surface target is a marker of the disease or condition to be detected.
25 [0080]    In certain embodiments, the >2n phagocytic cells and the =2n phagocytic
   cells are isolated by using a product secreted by the >2n phagocytic cells. In
   certain embodiments, the >2n phagocytic cells and the =2n phagocytic cells are
   isolated by using a cell surface target (e.g., receptor protein) on the surface of
   phagocytic cells. In some embodiments, the cell surface target is a protein that has
30 been engulfed by the >2n phagocytic cells. In some embodiments, the cell surface
   target is expressed by the >2n phagocytic cells on their plasma membranes. In

   [0100]    In some embodiments of the invention, a lipid profile can be determined

   (SIMS), radioimmunoassays, microfluidic chip-based assay, detection of
   fluorescence, detection of chemiluminescence, or a combination thereof. Further
   methods for analyzing lipid content in a biological sample are known in the art
   (See, e.g., Kang et al. (1992) Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1128:267; Weylandt et al.
10 (1996) Lipids 31 :977; J. Schiller et al. (1999) Anal. Biochem. 267:46; Kang et
   al. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98:4050; Schiller et al. (2004) Prog.
   Lipid Res. 43:499). One exemplary method of lipid analysis is to extract lipids
   from a biological sample (e.g. using chloroform-methanol (2:1, vol/vol)
   containing 0.005% butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, as an antioxidant)), prepare
15 fatty acid methyl esters (e.g., using 14% BF3-methanol reagent), and quantify the
   fatty acid methyl esters (e.g., by HPLC, TLC, by gas chromatography-mass
   spectroscopy using commercially available gas chromatographs, mass
   spectrometers, and/or combination gas chromatograph/mass spectrometers). Fatty
   acid mass is determined by comparing areas of various analyzed fatty acids to that
20 of a fixed concentration of internal standard.
   [0101]    In some embodiments of the invention, a carbohydrate profile can be
   determined by chromatography, liquid chromatography, size exclusion

   [0102]    In some embodiments of the invention, a metabolite profile can be
   determind by chromatography, liquid chromatography, size exclusion

   [0103] As used herein, the "difference" between different profiles detected by the
   methods of this invention can refer to different gene copy numbers, different DNA,
   RNA, protein, lipid, or carbohydrate expression levels, different DNA methylation
   states, different DNA acetylation states, and different protein modification states.
20 The difference can be a difference greater than 1 fold. In some embodiments, the
   difference is a 1.05-fold, 1.1-fold, 1.2-fold, 1.3-fold, 1.4-fold, 1.5-fold, 2-fold, 2.5
   fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, or 10-fold difference. In
   some embodiments, the difference is any fold difference between 1-10, 2-10, 5-10,
   10-20, or 10-100 folds.
25 [0104]    A general principle of assays to detect markers involves preparing a
   sample or reaction mixture that may contain the marker (e.g., one or more of DNA,
   RNA, protein, polypeptide, carbohydrate, lipid, metabolite, and the like) and a
   probe under appropriate conditions and for a time sufficient to allow the marker
   and probe to interact and bind, thus forming a complex that can be removed and/or
30 detected in the reaction mixture. These assays can be conducted in a variety of
   ways.
                                               36

   [0105]    For example, one method to conduct such an assay would involve
   anchoring the marker or probe onto a solid phase support, also referred to as a
   substrate, and detecting target marker/probe complexes anchored on the solid
   phase at the end of the reaction. In one embodiment of such a method, a sample
 5 from a subject, which is to be assayed for presence and/or concentration of marker,
   can be anchored onto a carrier or solid phase support. In another embodiment, the
   reverse situation is possible, in which the probe can be anchored to a solid phase
   and a sample from a subject can be allowed to react as an unanchored component
   of the assay.
10 [0106]    There are many established methods for anchoring assay components to a
   solid phase. These include, without limitation, marker or probe molecules which
   are immobilized through conjugation of biotin and streptavidin. Such biotinylated
   assay components can be prepared from biotin-NHS(N-hydroxy-succinimide)
   using techniques known in the art (e.g., biotinylation kit, Pierce Chemicals,
15 Rockford, IL), and immobilized in the wells of streptavidin-coated 96 well plates
   (Pierce Chemical). In certain embodiments, the surfaces with immobilized assay
   components can be prepared in advance and stored.
   [0107]    Other suitable carriers or solid phase supports for such assays include any
   material capable of binding the class of molecule to which the marker or probe
20 belongs. Well known supports or carriers include, but are not limited to, glass,
   polystyrene, nylon, polypropylene, nylon, polyethylene, dextran, amylases, natural
   and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides, gabbros, and magnetite.
   [0108]    In order to conduct assays with the above mentioned approaches, the non
   immobilized component is added to the solid phase upon which the second
25 component is anchored. After the reaction is complete, uncomplexed components
   may be removed (e.g., by washing) under conditions such that any complexes
   formed will remain immobilized upon the solid phase. The detection of
   marker/probe complexes anchored to the solid phase can be accomplished in a
   number of methods outlined herein.
                                              37

   [0109]     In certain exemplary embodiments, the probe, when it is the unanchored
   assay component, can be labeled for the purpose of detection and readout of the
   assay, either directly or indirectly, with detectable labels discussed herein and
   which are well-known to one skilled in the art.
 5 [0110]     It is also possible to directly detect marker/probe complex formation
   without further manipulation or labeling of either component (marker or probe),
   for example by utilizing the technique of fluorescence energy transfer (see, for
   example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,631,169 and 4,868,103). A fluorophore label on the
   first, 'donor' molecule is selected such that, upon excitation with incident light of
10 appropriate wavelength, its emitted fluorescent energy will be absorbed by a
   fluorescent label on a second 'acceptor' molecule, which in turn is able to fluoresce
   due to the absorbed energy. Alternately, the 'donor' protein molecule may simply
   utilize the natural fluorescent energy of tryptophan residues. Labels are chosen
   that emit different wavelengths of light, such that the 'acceptor' molecule label may
15 be differentiated from that of the 'donor'. Since the efficiency of energy transfer
   between the labels is related to the distance separating the molecules, spatial
   relationships between the molecules can be assessed. In a situation in which
   binding occurs between the molecules, the fluorescent emission of the 'acceptor'
   molecule label in the assay should be maximal. An FET binding event can be
20 conveniently measured through standard fluorometric detection means well known
   in the art (e.g., using a fluorimeter).
   [0111]     In another embodiment, determination of the ability of a probe to
   recognize a marker can be accomplished without labeling either assay component
   (probe or marker) by utilizing a technology such as real-time Biomolecular
25 Interaction Analysis (BIA) (see, e.g., Sjolander, S. and Urbaniczky, C, 1991, Anal.
   Chem. 63:2338 2345 and Szabo et al, 1995, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 5:699
   705). As used herein, "BIA" or "surface plasmon resonance" is a technology for
   studying biospecific interactions in real time, without labeling any of the
   interactants (e.g., BlAcore). Changes in the mass at the binding surface (indicative
30 of a binding event) result in alterations of the refractive index of light near the
   surface (the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)), resulting in
                                                 38

   a detectable signal which can be used as an indication of real-time reactions
   between biological molecules.
   [0112]     Alternatively, in another embodiment, analogous diagnostic and
   prognostic assays can be conducted with marker and probe as solutes in a liquid
 5 phase. In such an assay, the complexed marker and probe are separated from
   uncomplexed components by any of a number of standard techniques, including
   but not limited to: differential centrifugation, chromatography, electrophoresis and
   immunoprecipitation. In differential centrifugation, marker/probe complexes may
   be separated from uncomplexed assay components through a series of centrifugal
10 steps, due to the different sedimentation equilibria of complexes based on their
   different sizes and densities (see, for example, Rivas and Minton (1993) Trends
   Biochem. Sci. 18:284). Standard chromatographic techniques may also be
   utilized to separate complexed molecules from uncomplexed ones. For example,
   gel filtration chromatography separates molecules based on size, and through the
15 utilization of an appropriate gel filtration resin in a column format, for example,
   the relatively larger complex may be separated from the relatively smaller
   uncomplexed components. Similarly, the relatively different charge properties of
   the marker/probe complex as compared to the uncomplexed components may be
   exploited to differentiate the complex from uncomplexed components, for example
20 through the utilization of ion-exchange chromatography resins. Such resins and
   chromatographic techniques are well known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g.,
   Heegaard (1998) J. Mol. Recognit. 11 :141; Hage and Tweed (1997) J.
   Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Sci. Appl. 12:499). Gel electrophoresis may also be
   employed to separate complexed assay components from unbound components
25 (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, ed., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley
   & Sons, New York, 1987 1999). In this technique, protein or nucleic acid
   complexes are separated based on size or charge, for example. In order to maintain
   the binding interaction during the electrophoretic process, non-denaturing gel
   matrix materials and conditions in the absence of reducing agent are typically
30 preferred. Appropriate conditions to the particular assay and components thereof
   will be well known to one skilled in the art.
                                               39

   [0113]    In certain exemplary embodiments, the level of mRNA corresponding to
   the marker can be determined either by in situ and/or by in vitro formats in a
   biological sample using methods known in the art. Many expression detection
   methods use isolated RNA. For in vitro methods, any RNA isolation technique
 5 that does not select against the isolation of mRNA can be utilized for the
   purification of RNA from blood cells (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, ed., Current
   Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New York 1987 1999).
   Additionally, large numbers of cells and/or samples can readily be processed using
   techniques well known to those of skill in the art, such as, for example, the single
10 step RNA isolation process of Chomczynski (1989, U.S. Patent No. 4,843,155).
   [0114]    Isolated mRNA can be used in hybridization or amplification assays that
   include, but are not limited to, Southern or Northern analyses, polymerase chain
   reaction analyses and probe arrays. In certain exemplary embodiments, a
   diagnostic method for the detection of mRNA levels involves contacting the
15 isolated mRNA with a nucleic acid molecule (probe) that can hybridize to the
   mRNA encoded by the gene being detected. The nucleic acid probe can be, for
   example, a full-length cDNA, or a portion thereof, such as an oligonucleotide of at
   least 7, 15, 30, 50, 100, 250 or 500 nucleotides in length and sufficient to
   specifically hybridize under stringent conditions to an mRNA or genomic DNA
20 encoding a marker of the present invention. Other suitable probes for use in the
   diagnostic assays of the invention are described herein. Hybridization of an
   mRNA with the probe indicates that the marker in question is being expressed.
   [0115]    In one format, the mRNA is immobilized on a solid surface and contacted
   with a probe, for example by running the isolated mRNA on an agarose gel and
25 transferring the mRNA from the gel to a membrane, such as nitrocellulose. In an
   alternative format, the probe(s) are immobilized on a solid surface and the mRNA
   is contacted with the probe(s), for example, in a gene chip array. A skilled artisan
   can readily adapt known mRNA detection methods for use in detecting the level of
   mRNA encoded by the markers of the present invention.
30 [0116]    An alternative method for determining the level of mRNA corresponding
   to a marker of the present invention in a sample involves the process of nucleic
                                              40

   acid amplification, e.g., by RT-PCR (the experimental embodiment set forth in
   U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,195 and 4,683,202), COLD-PCR (Li et al. (2008) Nat.
   Med. 14:579), ligase chain reaction (Barany, 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,
   88:189), self sustained sequence replication (Guatelli et al., 1990, Proc. Natl.
 5 Acad. Sci. USA 87:1874), transcriptional amplification system (Kwoh et al.
   (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:1173),          Q- Beta Replicase  (Lizardi et al.
   (1988) Bio/Technology 6:1197), rolling circle replication (U.S. Patent No.
   5,854,033) or any other nucleic acid amplification method, followed by the
   detection of the amplified molecules using techniques well known to those of skill
10 in the art. These detection schemes are especially useful for the detection of
   nucleic acid molecules if such molecules are present in very low numbers. As used
   herein, amplification primers are defined as being a pair of nucleic acid molecules
   that can anneal to 5' or 3' regions of a gene (plus and minus strands, respectively,
   or vice-versa) and contain a short region in between. In general, amplification
15 primers are from about 10 to 30 nucleotides in length and flank a region from
   about 50 to 200 nucleotides in length. Under appropriate conditions and with
   appropriate reagents, such primers permit the amplification of a nucleic acid
   molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence flanked by the primers.
   [0117]    For in situ methods, mRNA does not need to be isolated from the sample
20 (e.g., a bodily fluid (e.g., blood cells)) prior to detection. In such methods, a cell or
   tissue sample is prepared/processed using known histological methods. The
   sample is then immobilized on a support, typically a glass slide, and then contacted
   with a probe that can hybridize to mRNA that encodes the marker.
   [0118]    As an alternative to making determinations based on the absolute
25 expression level of the marker, determinations may be based on the normalized
   expression level of the marker. Expression levels are normalized by correcting the
   absolute expression level of a marker by comparing its expression to the
   expression of a gene that is not a marker, e.g., a housekeeping gene that is
   constitutively expressed. Suitable genes for normalization include housekeeping
30 genes such as the actin gene, or epithelial cell- specific genes. This normalization
   allows the comparison of the expression level in a patient sample from one source
                                                41

   to a patient sample from another source, e.g., to compare a phagocytic blood cell
   from an individual to a non-phagocytic blood cell from the individual.
   [0119]    In one embodiment of this invention, a protein or polypeptide
   corresponding to a marker is detected. In certain embodiments, an agent for
 5 detecting a protein or polypeptide can be an antibody capable of binding to the
   polypeptide, such as an antibody with a detectable label. As used herein, the term
   "labeled," with regard to a probe or antibody, is intended to encompass direct
   labeling of the probe or antibody by coupling (i.e., physically linking) a detectable
   substance to the probe or antibody, as well as indirect labeling of the probe or
10 antibody by reactivity with another reagent that is directly labeled. Examples of
   indirect labeling include detection of a primary antibody using a fluorescently
   labeled secondary antibody and end-labeling of a DNA probe with biotin such that
   it can be detected with fluorescently labeled streptavidin. Antibodies can be
   polyclonal or monoclonal. An intact antibody, or a fragment thereof (e.g., Fab or
15 F(ab')2) can be used. In one format, antibodies, or antibody fragments, can be used
   in methods such as Western blots or immunofluorescence techniques to detect the
   expressed proteins. In such uses, it is generally preferable to immobilize either the
   antibody or proteins on a solid support. Suitable solid phase supports or carriers
   include any support capable of binding an antigen or an antibody. Well known
20 supports or carriers include glass, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene,
   dextran, nylon, amylases, natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides,
   gabbros, magnetite and the like.
   [0120]    A variety of formats can be employed to determine whether a sample
   contains a protein that binds to a given antibody. Examples of such formats
25 include, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive immunoassay,
   enzyme immunoassay (EIA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), antigen capture assays,
   two-antibody sandwich assays, Western blot analysis, enzyme linked
   immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA), a planar array, a colorimetric assay, a
   chemiluminescent assay, a fluorescent assay, and the like. Immunoassays,
30 including radioimmmunoassays and enzyme- linked immunoassays, are useful in
   the methods of the present invention. A skilled artisan can readily adapt known
                                             42

   protein/antibody detection methods for use in determining whether cells (e.g.,
   bodily fluid cells such as blood cells) express a marker of the present invention.
   [0121]    One skilled in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding
   antibody or antigen, and will be able to adapt such support for use with the present
 5 invention. For example, protein isolated from cells (e.g., bodily fluid cells such as
   blood cells) can be run on a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immobilized
   onto a solid phase support such as nitrocellulose. The support can then be washed
   with suitable buffers followed by treatment with the detectably labeled antibody.
   The solid phase support can then be washed with the buffer a second time to
10 remove unbound antibody. The amount of bound label on the solid support can
   then be detected by conventional means.
    [0122]   In certain exemplary embodiments, assays are provided for diagnosis,
   prognosis, assessing the risk of developing a disease, assessing the efficacy of a
   treatment, monitoring the progression or regression of a disease, and identifying a
15 compound capable of ameliorating or treating a disease. An exemplary method for
   these methods involves obtaining a bodily fluid sample from a test subject and
   contacting the bodily fluid sample with a compound or an agent capable of
   detecting one or more of the markers of the disease or condition, e.g., marker
   nucleic acid (e.g., mRNA, genomic DNA), marker peptide (e.g., polypeptide or
20 protein), marker lipid (e.g., cholesterol), or marker metabolite (e.g., creatinine)
   such that the presence of the marker is detected in the biological sample. In one
   embodiment, an agent for detecting marker mRNA or genomic DNA is a labeled
   nucleic acid probe capable of hybridizing to marker mRNA or genomic DNA. The
   nucleic acid probe can be, for example, a full-length marker nucleic acid or a
25 portion thereof. Other suitable probes for use in the diagnostic assays of the
   invention are described herein.
   [0123]    As used herein, a compound capable of ameliorating or treating a
   neurological or neuropsychiatric disease or condition can include, without
   limitations, any substance that can improve symptoms or prognosis, prevent
30 progression of the disease or condition, promote regression of the disease or
   condition, or eliminate the disease or condition.
                                               43

   [0130]    An exemplary method for detecting the presence or absence of an analyte
   (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, polypeptide, carbohydrate, lipid or the like)
   corresponding to a marker of the invention in a biological sample involves
   obtaining a bodily fluid sample (e.g., blood) from a test subject and contacting the
 5 bodily fluid sample with a compound or an agent capable of detecting one or more
   markers. Detection methods described herein can be used to detect one or more
   markers in a biological sample in vitro as well as in vivo. For example, in vitro
   techniques for detection of mRNA include Northern hybridizations and in situ
   hybridizations. In vitro techniques for detection of a polypeptide corresponding to
10 a marker of the invention include enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs),
   Western blots, immunoprecipitations and immunofluorescence. In vitro techniques
   for detection of genomic DNA include Southern hybridizations. Furthermore, in
   vivo techniques for detection of a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the
   invention include introducing into a subject a labeled antibody directed against the
15 polypeptide. For example, the antibody can be labeled with a radioactive marker
   whose presence and location in a subject can be detected by standard imaging
   techniques. Because each marker is also an analyte, any method described herein
   to detect the presence or absence of a marker can also be used to detect the
   presence or absence of an analyte.
