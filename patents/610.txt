    Field of Invention
  5
    The invention relates to an apparatus for discharging flour from a liner bag in a cargo container.
    Background
  0 Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an
    admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field.
    Historically, the transportation of flour is carried out from individual bags weighing typically 10 to
    25kgs each. These bags are manually packed into cargo containers for transportation and are
  5 manually unpacked at the destination. This process of transporting flour in individual bags is inefficient
    as it requires time and manpower to physically load and unload the bags from the cargo containers.
    Often, in the process of handling the bags, the bags are inevitably subject to much wear, sometimes
    resulting in breakage, loss and/or contamination of the flour in the bags. The individual bags are also
    generally not moisture proof and are not suitable for the long term storage of the flour. Where the flour
 .0 is to be stored on a long term basis or repackaged into smaller bags for sale, the bags will have to be
    unloaded into storage bins or silos. Again, the manual process of unloading individual bags of flour
    requires much time and manpower.
    The use of liner bags in cargo containers has been introduced. Liner bags are large flexible bags for
 .5 lining the insides of cargo containers and containing liquid or powdered goods such as flour during
    transportation. At the destination, the liquid or powdered goods are then discharged from the liner
    bags into conveying pipelines or other transport systems and transported into the relevant storage
    bins/silos. However, it has been found that conventional methods of discharging powdered goods,
    such as applying a tilt to the container to discharge the powdered goods by gravitational force does
  0 not work well with some type of flours. For example, the discharge of wheat flour using such a method
    may take up to 5 hours.
    There exists a prior art apparatus (illustrated in Fig. 1A, 1B and 10; International Publication No. WO
    2011/019320 Al) with a sheath body for discharging flour from a cargo container. However, the
 .5 productivity of the prior art apparatus in terms of flour discharging is at best satisfactory.
    Summary
    It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of
 +O the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.
    In accordance with one aspect of an example of the present disclosure, there is provided an
    apparatus for discharge of flour from a liner bag in a cargo container, the apparatus comprising: a
    sheath body being in contact with a discharge outlet of the liner bag, the sheath body having an inlet
45  for receiving the discharge outlet of the liner bag or an inlet received by the discharge outlet; and an
    agitator for providing an agitation action to the sheath body, wherein the inlet having a width ranging
    from substantially 750 mm to substantially a width of an entrance opening of the cargo container.
    Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words
50  "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an
    exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of "including, but not limited to".

   Detailed Description
15
   Fig. 1A shows a prior art apparatus 100 for the discharge of flour from a liner bag (not shown) in a
   cargo container (not shown). The apparatus 100 includes a sheath body 10 with an inlet 15 and an
   outlet portion 19. The sheath body 10 is formed in the shape of a funnel with a wider inlet portion 15
   of rectangular or generally rectangular shape that tapers down to the narrower outlet portion 19. As
30 the taper of the funnel develops, the rectangular shape of the funnel becomes generally octagonal
   defined by the edges 11a, lb, 11c, 1Id. The surfaces between the edges 11a, 1lb, 1lc and 1ld
   may be flat or somewhat rounded. At the outlet portion 19 of the sheath body 10, the shape of the
   outer surface of the sheath body 10 transforms to a circular or generally circular cross-section. The
   sheath body 10 is in contact with a discharge outlet of the liner bag in the cargo container body such
55 that agitation action from the sheath body 10 may be provided to the discharge outlet. The apparatus
   100 also includes an agitator 12 for providing an agitation action to the sheath body 10. In the present
   example, the agitator 12 is a vibration motor mounted on the surface of the sheath body 10. Vibrating
   action is provided from the vibration motor 12 to the sheath body 10 and the discharge outlet. The
   vibrating action causes any flour that may be stuck on the inside surfaces of the discharge outlet or
30 clumped together inside the discharge outlet to be broken up for discharging from the liner bag into a

   flexible pipe 22 connected to the outlet portion 19 of the sheath body 10 for further processing or
   storage. Retaining elements 14 such as steel cables or straps are further provided and attached to
   the sheath body 10 to hold the sheath body 10 in position over a cargo container opening providing
   access to the liner bag, specifically over the discharge outlet. The apparatus 100 of Fig. 1A includes a
 5 support frame 30 for mounting over the cargo container opening providing access to the liner bag.
   Provided on the body of the support frame 30 are frame securing elements 32 such as releasable
   clamps for mounting the support frame 30 over the cargo container opening (not shown). The support
   frame 30 also provides support to the liner bag (not shown) and holds it in place in the cargo
   container (not shown) when the cargo container (not shown) is tilted at an angle during the flour
 0 discharging process.
   With reference to Fig. 1B and Fig. 1C, to prevent the vibration energy from the agitation action of the
   agitator 12 from being absorbed and dissipated by the body of the support frame 30, resilient
   elements 34 are provided. The resilient elements 34 may be provided on the support frame 30 at a
 5 location for mounting the sheath body 10 onto the support frame 30 for absorption of vibration energy.
   With the presence of the resilient elements 34, the vibration energy of the agitation action is isolated
   to the sheath body 10 and the discharge outlet (not shown) of the liner bag (not shown) and loss of
   vibration energy by absorption by the support frame 30 and the cargo container body (not shown) is
   minimised. The apparatus 100 further includes a rotary valve 42 secured to the support frame 30 and
 0 the flexible pipe 22 connecting the outlet portion 19 of the sheath body 10 to an inlet 44 of the rotary
   valve 42. The rotary valve 42 further includes a first outlet 46 and rotating segmented compartments
   53 for transporting and segregating flour entering the inlet 44 to a first outlet 46. The first outlet 46 of
   the rotary valve 42 is connected to a conveying pipeline 50 having air flowing therethrough from a
   pneumatic air pump (not shown). Flour enters the rotary valve 42 from inlet 44 of the rotary valve 42
 5 and is rotated in the segmented compartments 53 to the first outlet 46 of the rotary valve 42 where it
   falls by gravity into the conveying pipeline 50. The rotary valve optionally includes a second outlet 48
   which is connected to an air filter 52. The second outlet 48 allows air pressure and flour dust
   accumulated in the segmented compartments 53 of the rotary valve 42, after the segmented
   compartment 53 has rotated past the first outlet 46 of the rotary valve 42, to escape and the flour dust
 0 is captured by the air filter 52.
   Width dimension of 748 mm of the sheath body 10 of Fig. 1A and, the distance of 2260mm between
   one end of the support frame 30 to another end of the support frame 30 is shown for reference
   purposes. This distance of 2260mm actually corresponds to the distance between the centre points of
 5 left and right corner castings of the apparatus 100. Additionally, the width of a typical cargo container
   entrance opening of 2350 mm is marked out in Fig. lA for reference purposes.
   Fig. 2A shows a front view of an apparatus 200 for the discharge of flour from a liner bag (902 in Fig.
   9) in a cargo container 20 according to an example of the present disclosure. Fig. 9 is a see-through
   top view showing a sheath body 10 of the apparatus 200, a discharge outlet 16 of the liner bag 902
.0 and the liner bag 902 located within the cargo container 20. The liner bag 902 is accessible from an
   entrance opening of the cargo container 20. Fig. 2B is a side view of the apparatus 200 of Fig. 2A. Fig.
   3A is a see-through view of the side view of the apparatus 200 in Fig. 2B. For easy reference, the
   reference numerals of elements in the apparatus 100 of Fig. 1A, 1B and 1C that have similar function
   as the corresponding elements in the apparatus 200 shown in Fig. 2A onwards will be reused.
45 However, it is noted that there are differences/improvements in some of the elements in the apparatus
   200 having the same reference numerals as the corresponding elements in Fig. IA, 1B and 1C. Such
   differences/improvements will be discussed as follows. Additional features in Fig. 2A onwards that are
   not present in Fig. 1A, 1B and 1C will be numbered differently.
50 With reference to Fig. 2A, 2B, 3A and Fig. 9, the apparatus 200 includes the sheath body 10 with an
   inlet 15 and an outlet portion 19, both formed of rigid or semi-rigid materials such as stainless steel or
   aluminium sheets. The sheath body 10 may be formed of other materials as long as the material is
   sufficiently rigid to allow the transmission of agitation action and energy such as vibration without loss.
   The sheath body 10 may be formed in the shape of a funnel with a wider inlet portion 15 of
55 rectangular or generally rectangular shape that tapers down to a narrower outlet portion 19 of circular
   cross-section. As the taper of the funnel develops, the rectangular shape of the funnel may become
   generally octagonal with edges similar to the edges 11a, 11b, 11c, and 1ld of Fig. 1A (not shown in
   Fig. 2A, 2B and 3A). At the outlet portion 19 of the sheath body 10, the shape of the outer surface of
   the sheath body 10 may transform to a circular or generally circular cross-section. However, other
30 shapes of the sheath body 10 may be used as long as the sheath body 10 is able to receive and fit

                                                        14
   over a discharge outlet 16 of the liner bag 902 in the cargo container body and the sheath body 10 is
   in contact with the discharge outlet 16 such that agitation action from the sheath body 10 may be
   provided to the discharge outlet 16. The discharge outlet 16 of the liner bag 902 may also be fitted
   over the inlet 15 as long as there is sufficient contact between the discharge outlet 16 and the sheath
 5 body 10 such that agitation action from the sheath body 10 may be provided to the discharge outlet
   16. The apparatus 200 also includes an agitator 12 (shown in Fig. 3A) for providing an agitation action
   to the sheath body 10. In the present example, the agitator 12 is a vibration motor mounted on the
   surface of the sheath body 10. When the vibration motor 12 is switched on, a vibrating action is
   provided from the vibration motor 12 to the sheath body 10 and the discharge outlet 16. The vibrating
 0 action causes any flour that may be stuck on the inside surfaces of the discharge outlet 16 or clumped
   together inside the discharge outlet 16 to be broken up for discharging from the liner bag 902 into a
   flexible pipe 22 connected to the outlet portion 19 of the sheath body 10 for further processing or
   storage.
 5 In the use of the apparatus 200, the discharge outlet 16 of the liner bag 902 is inserted into the inlet
   15 of the sheath body 10 and pulled through, perhaps as far as the outlet portion 19 of the sheath
   body 10 and folded over the outlet portion 19 of the sheath body 10 but operation may still proceed as
   long as the discharge outlet 16 is received in the inlet 15 of the sheath body 10. The flexible pipe 22 is
   then connected over the outlet portion 19 of the sheath body 10 on one end of the flexible pipe 22 and
 0 to a conveying pipeline/system 50 on the other end of the flexible pipe 22. When the agitator 12 is
   activated, agitation action in the form of vibration energy is transmitted from the agitator 12 to the
   sheath body 10 and the discharge outlet 16 by contact. The vibration energy assists to facilitate the
   flow of the flour in the discharge outlet 16 into the flexible pipe 22 for further processing or storage in
   a silo or flour storage facility. In other arrangements, the agitator 12 need not be mounted directly on
 5 the sheath body 10, as long as the agitation action is transmitted to the sheath body 10.
   The apparatus 200 includes a support frame 30 configured to support elements of the apparatus 200.
   The support frame 30 is configured for mounting over the entrance opening of the cargo container 20
   providing access to the liner bag.
 0 One or more top hook 500 may be provided for securing a top portion of the support frame 30 over
   the opening of the cargo container 20. In the present example, there are two top hooks 500 and each
   top hook 500 is configured to engage a top opening in a top corner casting 204 located at the top of
   the entrance opening of the cargo container 20.
 5 One or more locking mechanism 600 may be provided for securing a bottom portion of the support
   frame 30 to the cargo container 20. In the present example, there are two locking mechanisms 600
   and each locking mechanism 600 is configured to engage a side opening in a bottom corner casting
   206 located at a bottom side of the entrance opening of the cargo container 20.
 0 The one or more top hook 500 and the one or more locking mechanism 600 provide more secured
   mounting of the support frame 30 compared to the retaining elements 14 and the frame securing
   elements 32 of the apparatus 100 of Fig. 1A, 1B and 1C.
   Two doors 202 of the cargo container 20 are pivoted all the way to the rear to provide the apparatus
15 200 with access to the entrance opening of the container 20. One or more container door stopper 700
   may be fixed to the support frame 30 to prevent the two doors 202 from swinging back to the front
   after the two doors 202 are pivoted all the way to the rear.
   The support frame 30 may also provide support to the liner bag (not shown) and hold it in place in the
50 cargo container 20 when the cargo container 20 is tilted at an angle during the flour discharging
   process. Tilting of the cargo container 20 may be done by machinery/mechanisms on board a prime
   mover or truck carrying the cargo container 20. The sheath body 10 may optionally be provided with
   retaining elements (not shown) such as steel cables or straps to further secure the sheath body 10 to
   the support frame 30 or the body of the cargo container 20.
55
   To prevent the agitation action from the agitator 12 from being absorbed and dissipated by the body
   of the support frame 30, one or more resilient element 34 are provided. The one or more resilient
   element 34 may be compression spring, compressible rubber or other devices such as hydraulic or
   pneumatic pistons. The one or more resilient element 34 may be provided at a location of the support
30 frame 30 where the sheath body 10 is mounted. Additionally, the one or more resilient elements 34

                                                         t
   may be provided at a location of the inlet 15 of the sheath body 10. This is preferable in the case of a
   sheath body 10 with larger width dimension as a larger sheath body will have more vibration. In the
   present example, two of such resilient elements 34 can be seen at two upper corners of the sheath
   body 10 in Fig. 2A. It is appreciated that one or both of the two bottom corners may also be mounted
 5 with the one or more resilient element 34. The compressive action of the compression spring,
   compressible rubber or the compressible fluid medium of the hydraulic or pneumatic pistons making
   up the one or more resilient element 34 allow the sheath body 10 to vibrate without the vibration
   energy of the sheath body being absorbed and dampened by the body of the support frame 30. With
   the presence of the resilient elements 34, the vibration energy of the agitation action is isolated to the
 0 sheath body 10 and the discharge outlet 16 of the liner bag 902 and loss of vibration energy by
   absorption by the support frame 30 and the body of the cargo container 20 are minimised.
   The apparatus 200 further includes a rotary valve 42 secured to the support frame 30 and to the
   flexible pipe 22 connecting the outlet portion 19 of the sheath body 10 to an inlet 44 of the rotary valve
 5 42. The rotary valve 42 includes a first outlet 46 located at the bottom of the rotary valve 42. The
   inside of the rotary valve 42 comprises movable rotating segmented compartments 53 for transporting
   and segregating flour entering the inlet 44 to the first outlet 46. There are several segmented
   compartments 53 as shown in Fig. 3A. The first outlet 46 of the rotary valve 42 is connected to a
   conveying pipeline/system 50 having air flowing therethrough from a pneumatic air pump (not shown).
 0 Flour enters the rotary valve 42 from the inlet 44 of the rotary valve 42 and is rotated in the
   segmented compartments 53 to the first outlet 46 of the rotary valve 42 where it falls by gravity into
   the conveying pipeline 50. One end of the conveying pipeline 50 is connected to the pneumatic air
   pump and the other end is connected to a flour silo or a storage facility for storing flour (not shown).
   The pneumatic air pump is configured to blow the flour falling through the first outlet 46 into the
 5 conveying pipeline 50 in the direction of the flour silo or the storage facility.
   Each segmented compartment 53 works like a scoop for scooping flour from the inlet 44 of the rotary
   valve 42 to the first outlet 46 of the rotary valve 42. After flour is deposited into the conveying pipeline
   50 from one segmented compartment 53 filled with flour, the segmented compartment 53 will be
 0 empty and will contain pressurised air and flour dust. The inlet 44 of the rotary valve 42 is connected
   to a conduit 48. The conduit 48 comprises 3 open ends. A first open end of the conduit 48 is
   connected to an air filter 52, a second open end is connected to the flexible pipe 22 and a third open
   end is connected to the inlet 44 of the rotary valve 42. Flour is drawn in from the flexible pipe 22
   through the second open end of the conduit 48 to the third open end connected to the inlet 44 of the
 5 rotary valve 42. In the flour discharging process, air pressure and flour dust accumulate in the
   segmented compartments 53 of the rotary valve 42 that have rotated passed the first outlet 46 and
   that have deposited flour through the first outlet 46. The air pressure and flour dust accumulated in
   the segmented compartments 53 escape through the conduit 48 in the direction of the third open end
   to the first open end of the flexible pipe 22 and the escaped flour dust is captured by the air filter 52.
.0
   The support frame 30 may be configured to mount an overhead shelter 800. In Fig. 2A, 2B and 3A,
   the overhead shelter 800 is deliberately drawn to be see-through so as not to cover other features of
   the apparatus 200. The overhead shelter 800 is meant for sheltering at least the air filter 52 from
   weather conditions. In the present example, the air filter 52 comprises two filter sleeves 208 to assist
i5 in the escape of pressurized air that needs sheltering. The filter sleeves 208 have good air
   permeability to allow air to escape. The overhead shelter 800 prevents rain, hail or snow from
   entering the outlets of the two filter sleeves 208, which will choke and/or damage the air filter 52.
   A key difference between the sheath body 10 of the apparatus 100 of Fig. 1A, lB and 1C, and the
50 sheath body 10 of the apparatus 200 is that the width dimension X of the sheath body 10 of the
   apparatus 200 has a preferred width ranging from substantially 750 mm to substantially a width of the
   entrance opening of the cargo container 20. The width of the entrance opening of the cargo container
   would vary depending on the size of the cargo container. In the present example, the usable width
   dimension X shown in Fig. 2A is about 2350mm, which is almost the width of the entrance opening of
55 a typical cargo container. The inventor of the present invention has discovered that adjusting the
   sheath body 10 to have the width dimension ranging from substantially 750 mm to substantially the
   width of an entrance opening of the cargo container can improve productivity quite well and quite
   significantly for larger width in the range. Numerous adjustments have to be made to accommodate
   the larger sheath body 10. For instance, the discharge outlet 16 and the liner bag 902 opening have
30 to be correspondingly adjusted to fit the larger width dimension of the sheath body 10 falling in the

   preferred range. A larger and stronger agitator 12 has to be utilised as the surface area of the sheath
   body 10 to vibrate has increased. The support frame 30 also needs to be built with, for instance, more
   beams or support structures for supporting the larger sheath body. For instance, the one or more top
   hook 500 and the one or more locking mechanism 600 provide secured mounting of the support
 5 frame 30. The height of the sheath body 10 can remain unchanged like the case of the sheath body
   10 in Fig. 1A, 1B and 1C. However, it is appreciated that the height of the sheath body 10 may also
   be increased to further improve productivity. The air filter 52 has to be larger as well to handle escape
   of higher pressure air and more flour dust. This explains the presence of the two filter sleeves 208 in
   the air filter 52 in Fig. 2A, 2B and 3A but not in the air filter 52 of Fig. 1B and 1C. The pneumatic air
 0 pump (not shown) has to operate with higher blow rate.
   In summary, the sheath body 10 can be said to be a flour discharging mechanism through a pipeline.
   The pipeline comprises the flexible pipe 22 and the conduit 48. The flour discharging mechanism is
   the rotary valve 42 working in conjunction with the pneumatic air pump (not shown) and the conveying
 5 pipeline 50.
   Fig. 3B shows a focused view of the circled location marked A in Fig. 3A. Fig. 3B is used to show
   differences between the conduit 48 of Fig. 1B and 1C and the conduit 48 of Fig. 2A, 2B and 3A.
   Specifically, in the present example, Fig. 3B illustrates an inner wall 300 formed in the conduit 48 of
 0 the apparatus 200 that is not found in the conduit of the apparatus 100 of Fig. 1B and 1C. The first
   open end 314 of the conduit 48 is connected to the air filter 52. The second open end 310 is
   connected to the flexible pipe 22. The third open end of the conduit 48 that is connected to the inlet 44
   of the rotary valve 42 actually comprises two separate open ends 312 and 308. The open end 308
   has a smaller opening compared to the open end 312. The inner wall 300 splits the conduit 48 to form
 5 two separate channels, a first channel running from the open end 308 to the first open end 314 and
   the second channel running from the second open end 310 to the open end 312. The first channel is
   mainly for flour to move in a direction from the second open end 310 to the open end 312 during flour
   discharge. Flour moving out from the open end 312 during flour discharge will flow into one of the
   segmented compartments 53 to be rotated and moved to the outlet 46 of the rotary valve 42. The
 0 second channel is mainly for pressurized air and/or flour dust to escape from a segmented
   compartment 53 that has already deposited flour through the outlet 46 and rotated to the location of
   the open end 308. The presence of the two dedicated channels advantageously improves productivity.
   Fig. 3C, 3D, 3E and 3F are provided for better understanding of the two channels and their
   construction in the present example. Fig. 3C is a top view of the conduit 48 of Fig. 38. Fig. 3D is a
 5 perspective view of the conduit 48 of Fig. 3B. Fig. 3E is a side view of the conduit of Fig. 38. Fig. 3F is
   a front view of the conduit of Fig. 3B. The reference numerals of the elements in Fig. 3B are shown in
   Fig. 3C, 3D, 3E and 3F.
   In summary, the conduit 48 comprises at least two channels, a first channel for flour to move in a
.0 direction from the sheath body to the flour discharging mechanism and a second channel for
   pressurized air and/or flour dust to escape. Size of the open end 308 of the second channel for
   receiving the pressurized air and/or flour dust may be smaller than the open end 312 of the first
   channel for outputting flour to the flour discharging mechanism. Advantageously, the conduit 48
   channels flour and pressurized air and/or flour dust separately. This improves productivity quite
15 significantly because flour can be discharged from the liner bag 902 at a faster rate and operation
   time is reduced. Although one construction of the conduit 48 is discussed, it is appreciated that other
   suitable design of the conduit 48 for achieving the same function is also possible.
   Fig. 4A shows a focused view of the flexible pipe 22 of the apparatus 200. In one example, the pipe
50 22 is a flexible pipe, but rigid piping may also be used. The flexible pipe 22 of the apparatus 200 is
   different from the flexible pipe 22 of the apparatus 100 of Fig. 1A, 1B and 1C in that the flexible pipe
   22 of the apparatus 200 is of quick release type. The flexible pipe 22 of the apparatus 100 is not of
   quick release type and is slower to mount to the inlet 44 and the sheath body 10 compared to the
   flexible pipe 22 of the apparatus 200. Hence, the flexible pipe 22 of the apparatus 200 provides an
55 advantageous over that the flexible pipe 22 of the apparatus 100. In the present example, the quick
   release is implemented using a plurality of quick release catches 400 located on both open ends of
   the flexible pipe 22. In the present example, three quick release catches 400 are evenly spaced along
   a perimeter of each open end of the flexible pipe 22, each about 120 degrees away from one another.
   Fig. 48, 4C, 4D and 4E are provided for better understanding of the quick release flexible pipe 22 and
30 its construction in the present example. Specifically, Fig. 4B is a cutaway top view of the quick release

   flexible pipe 22 of Fig. 4A in connection to the conduit 48 of Fig. 3B. Fig. 4C is a cutaway perspective
   view of the quick release flexible pipe 22 of Fig. 4A in connection to the conduit 48 of Fig. 3B. Fig. 4D
   is a cutaway side view of the quick release flexible pipe 22 of Fig. 4A in connection to the conduit 48
   of Fig. 3B. Fig. 4E is a cutaway front view of the quick release flexible pipe 22 of Fig. 4A in connection
 5 to the conduit 48 of Fig. 3B. In Fig. 4B to 4E, the open end of the quick release flexible pipe 22 for
   connection to the outlet portion 19 of the sheath body 10 in Fig. 4A is the part that is cutaway and not
   shown.
   Fig. 4F is a perspective view of an example of a quick release catch 400 of the quick release flexible
 0 pipe 22 of Fig. 4A. Fig. 4G is a bottom view of the quick release catch 400 of Fig. 4F. Fig. 4H is a side
   view of the quick release catch 400 of Fig. 4F. With reference to Fig. 4F to 4H, the quick release catch
   400 may comprise a handle 406 for locking or unlocking the flexible pipe 22 from or to the conduit 48
   in Fig. 4A or the outlet portion 19 of the sheath body 10 in Fig. 4A. The quick release catch 400 may
   further comprise a hook 402 for mounting to the conduit 48 in Fig. 4A or the outlet portion 19 of the
 5 sheath body 10 in Fig. 4A. The hook 402 is for hooking through a hoop 410 configured to be pivotable
   about a first joint 412 that is pivotably joined to the handle 406. The hoop 410 is configured to be
   substantially T-shaped with the top of the T-shape forming the first joint 412 and the bottom of the T
   shape connecting to the hoop 410. The handle 406 is pivotable about a second joint 408 connected to
   a plate 404. The plate 404 is to be mounted to each respective open end of the quick release flexible
 0 pipe 22. The handle 406 in the present example is substantially U-shaped with the closed end of the
   U-shape configured for user handling and the open end of the U-shape pivotably joined to the second
   joint 408. The handle 406 is pivotable about the second joint 408 between a first configuration for
   moving the hoop 410 towards the hook 402 to enable the hoop 410 to be hooked by the hook 402 and
   a second configuration for moving the hoop 410 away from the hook 402 to lock the hoop 410 to the
 5 hook 402. The hoop 410 is configured to extend from the first joint 412 sufficiently to enable the
   locking of the hoop 410 to the hook 402 in the second configuration. The second joint 408 may
   optionally comprise biasing means for securing the handle 406 in the second configuration and force
   is required to overcome the biasing means in order to move the first configuration. Quick release of
   the quick release catch 400 is accomplished by moving from the second configuration to the first
 0 configuration.
   In summary, the sheath body 10 of the apparatus 200 is configured to connect to a pipe (22 of Fig. 4A
   to 4H) that is configured with one or more quick release catch (400 of Fig. 4A to 4H) for quick release
   from the sheath body 10. Although one construction of the pipe 22 is discussed, it is appreciated that
 5 other suitable design of the pipe 22 for achieving the same function is also possible.
   Fig. 5A shows a focused view of one top hook 500 fixed to the support frame 30 of the apparatus 200.
   In one example, the top hook 500 is configured to engage a top opening (covered by the top hook 500
   in Fig. 5A) in a top corner casting 204 located at the top of the entrance opening of the cargo
.0 container 20. Fig. 5B, 5C, 5D and 5E are provided for better understanding of the top hook 500 and
   its construction in the present example. Fig. 5B is a top view of the top hook 500 of Fig. 5A. Fig. 5C is
   a perspective view of the top hook 500 of Fig. 5A. Fig. 5D is a side view of the top hook 500 of Fig. 5A.
   Fig. 5E is a front view of the top hook 500 of Fig. 5A. With reference to Fig. 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D and 5E,
   the top hook 500 of the present example comprises two limbs or sections and is substantially L
45 shaped. The top hook 500 comprises a pin 502 extending from one limb or section of the top hook
   500. The protruding pin 502 is configured for engaging the opening in the top corner casting 204 at
   the top of the entrance opening of the cargo container 20. The number of such top hook 500 to
   provide may correspond with the number of container top corner castings. In the present example,
   there are 2 top corner castings and correspondingly 2 top hooks 500. The top hook 500 may each be,
50 for example, a steel structure (hollow section steel).
    In summary, the support frame 30 of the apparatus 200 may comprise one or more hook 500 of Fig.
   5A to 5E configured to engage the top opening of the corner casting 204 of the cargo container 20.
   Although one construction of the top hook 500 is discussed, it is appreciated that other suitable
55 design of the top hook 500 for achieving the same function is also possible.
    Fig. 6A shows a focused view A of one locking mechanism 600 of the apparatus 200 for securing a
   bottom portion of the support frame 30 to the cargo container 20. In the present example, the locking
   mechanism 600 is configured to engage a side opening 604 in a bottom corner casting 206 located at
30 a bottom side of the entrance opening of the cargo container 20. Fig. 6B, 6C, 6D and 6E are provided

                                                          0
   for better understanding of the locking mechanism 600 and its construction in the present example.
   Fig. 6B is a top view of the locking mechanism 600 of Fig. 6A. Fig. 6C is a perspective view of the
   locking mechanism of Fig. 6A. Fig. 6D is a front view of the locking mechanism 600 of Fig. 6A. Fig. 6E
   is a side view of the locking mechanism 600 of Fig. 6A.
 5
   With reference to Fig. 6A to 6E, the locking mechanism 600 in one example comprises a bracket 610
   pivotable about a joint 608 at the bottom portion of the support frame 30 between a first configuration
   for locking the support frame 30 to the bottom corner casting 206 of the cargo container 20 and a
   second configuration for unlocking the support frame 30 from the bottom corner casting 206 of the
 0 cargo container 20. On one major surface side of the bracket 610, a catch 602 substantially oval or
   elliptical in shape is provided on one end of an elongate extension 614 projected through a center of
   the bracket 610. On a flip side of the major surface side of the bracket 610, the other end of the
   extension 614 is a substantially L-shaped lever 612. The extension 614 is rotatable about a
   longitudinal axis 616 (shown only in Fig. 68) of the extension 614 by rotating one limb of the locking
 5 lever 612 about the other limb. When the lever 612 is rotated to rotate the extension 614 about the
   longitudinal axis 616, the catch 602 rotates about the longitudinal axis 616 as well. Conversely, the
   catch 602 does not rotate about the longitudinal axis 616 if the extension 614 is not rotated. A wheel
   handle 606 welded on a nut is configured to lock and prevent rotational movement of the extension
   614 about the longitudinal axis 616. The locking is activated by rotating the wheel handle 606. Shapes
 0 other than oval or elliptical of the catch 602 are fine as well as long as the catch 602 is of a shape and
   size allowing the catch 602 to be slotted or inserted into the side opening 604 when the catch 602 is
   rotated in a first instance to a specific configuration about the longitudinal axis 616. Furthermore, after
   the catch 602 is inserted into the side opening 604, the catch 602 is able to be held in the corner
   casting 206 (similar to a twistlock or cone) when rotated in a second instance about the longitudinal
 5 axis 616 by a specific angle from the specific configuration of the first instance. In the present
   example, the specific angle ranges from 0 to 90 degrees.
   In summary, the support frame 30 of the apparatus 200 comprises one or more locking mechanism
   600 of Fig. 6A to 6E configured to lock the support frame 30 to the side opening 604 of the corner
 0 casting 206 of the cargo container 20. Although one construction of the locking mechanism 600 is
   discussed, it is appreciated that other suitable design of the locking mechanism 600 for achieving the
   same function is also possible.
   Fig. 7A shows a focused view of one container door stopper 700 of the apparatus 200. A door 202 of
 5 the cargo container 20 can be pivoted all the way to the rear to provide the apparatus 200 with access
   to the entrance opening of the container 20. The container door stopper 700 in the present example is
   fixed to the support frame 30 to hold in place the door 202 of the cargo container 20 that has been
   pivoted rearwards. In the present example, there are two container door stoppers 700 in use for
   holding back two doors 202. They prevent the two doors 202 from swinging back to the front in a
.0 closing direction of the doors 202. Fig. 78, 7C, 7D and 7E are provided for better understanding of the
   container door stopper 700 and its construction in the present example. Fig. 7B is a left side view of
   the container door stopper 700 of Fig. 7A. Fig. 7C is a perspective view of the container door stopper
   700 of Fig. 7A. Fig. 7D is a top view of the container door stopper 700 of Fig. 7A. Fig. 7E is a right
   side view of the container door stopper 700 of Fig. 7A.
45
   As the cargo container 20 may be tilted during flour discharge, there is a tendency that the opened
   container door 202 would swing back in closing direction. Hence, generally, the shape of the
   container door stopper 700 should be made to fit the shape of the support frame 30 and the container
   door 202 to enable the container door stopper 700 to prevent the container door 202 from swing back
50 in closing direction when the support frame 30 is mounted to the cargo container 20.
   With reference to Fig. 7A to 7E, the container door stopper 700 in one example is a thin metal plate
   substantially L-shaped comprising a substantially square edge 708 extending from one limb of the L
   shape, a triangular edge 712 extending from the other limb of the L-shape. Furthermore, a rectangular
55 edge 710 extends between the substantially square edge 708 and the triangular edge 712 away from
   the corner of the L-shape. The corner of the L-shape of the container door stopper 700 is rounded for
   safety reason. The pointed end of the triangular edge 712 is rounded for safety reason as well. In the
   substantially square portion of the substantially square edge 708, there is present a protrusion 704
   protruding in a direction orthogonal to a major plane of the container door stopper 700. In the
30 rectangular portion of the rectangular edge 708, there is present a protrusion 702 protruding in the

   same direction as the protrusion 704 from the major plane of the container door stopper 700. The
   protrusions 702 and 704 are made to fit into corresponding holes of a horizontally disposed plate 706
   of the support frame 30. The protrusions 702 and 704 are welding points to be welded to the
   horizontally disposed plate 706 of the support frame 30. The triangular edge 712 is to be pointed in
 5 the direction of the container door 202. The rectangular edge 710 is configured to fit in a stepped
   recess formed by the container door 202 and the support frame 30 when the support frame 30 is
   mounted to the container entrance opening. The slanted side of the triangular edge 712 is made to
   accommodate the contour of the container door 202. The substantially square edge 708 is shaped
   accordingly to fit the container door stopper 700 to a substantially quadrilateral cross-section of a
 0 beam of the support frame 30.
   In summary, the support frame 30 comprises one or more container door stopper 700 configured to
   prevent the container door 202 from swinging in a closing direction of the container door 202 when
   the support frame 30 is mounted to the cargo container 20. Although one construction of the container
 5 door stopper 700 is discussed, it is appreciated that other suitable design of the container door
   stopper 700 for achieving the same function is also possible.
   Fig. 8A shows a see-through focused view B of an overhead shelter 800 of the apparatus 200. In one
   example, the support frame 30 is configured with beams for mounting the overhead shelter 800. The
 0 overhead shelter 800 may be in the form of a tent that is made of plastic, canvas, and the like. Fig. 8A,
   the overhead shelter 800 is deliberately drawn to be see-through so as not to cover other features of
   the apparatus 200 such as the air filter 52. The overhead shelter 800 is meant for sheltering at least
   the air filter 52 as well as other elements such as the pipe 22 shown in earlier Figures, which may be
   made of cloth material, to prevent damage or impact to operation arising from weather conditions
 5 such as rain, hail or snow. Fig. 8B, 8C, and 8D are provided for better understanding of the overhead
   shelter 800 and its construction in the present example. Fig. 8B is a top view of the overhead shelter
   800 of Fig. 8A. Fig. 8C is a perspective view of the overhead shelter 800 of Fig. 8A. Fig. 8D is a side
   view of the overhead shelter 800 of Fig. 8A.
 0 In summary, the support frame 30 comprises an overhead shelter 800 configured to at least shelter
   the air filter 52 extending from a pipeline (that may comprise the conduit 48) connected to the sheath
   body 10 from weather conditions. Although one construction of the overhead shelter 800 is discussed,
   it is appreciated that other suitable design of the overhead shelter 800 for achieving the same function
   is also possible.

   Although a support frame 30 is discussed with reference to Fig. 2A, 2B, 3A, 5A to 5E 6A to 6E, 7A to
   7E, and 8A, it should be appreciated that the support frame 30 is an optional structure. In one
   example, the support frame 30 can be absent and all the elements of the apparatus 200 that are not
   features of the support frame 30 are fixed/mounted/installed on a platform or base (not shown in any
,0 Figure) placed on the ground. The platform may be a fixed station or wheeled so as to provide a
   mobile station. In the case of the mobile station, the wheels may be stowed away when the platform is
   in use to prevent unnecessary movement. Similarly, the sheath body 10 is of similar size as described
   for apparatus 200 in the figures earlier and is able to receive and fit over the discharge outlet 16 of the
   liner bag 902 in the cargo container body. The platform may be configured with mechanisms and
15 machinery, for example, hydraulic/pneumatic booms, to tilt as the container 20 is tilted to facilitate
   flour discharge.
   It is to be understood that the foregoing description of the apparatus of the invention is intended to be
   purely illustrative of the principles of the invention, rather than exhaustive thereof, and that changes
50 and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and that the present invention is not intended
   to be limited other than as expressly set forth in the following claims.
