   Background of the Invention
   Cell therapy using freshly isolated, ex vivo expanded or in vitro induced Tregs in
   models of autoimmune diseases or organ transplants have demonstrated that adoptive
   transfer of Tregs can restore the balance of Tregs versus effector T cells, thereby
10 controlling autoimmunity associated with these diseases (Allan et al., (2008)
   Immunol. Rev. 223:391-421; Jiang et al., (2006) Expert review of clinical immunology
   2:387-392; Riley et al., (2009) Immunity 30:656-665 ; Tang et al., (2012) Journal of
   molecular cell biology 4:11-21). However, the use of adoptive transfer as a
   therapeutic strategy presents several challenges to translation into the clinic. The
15 number of autologous Tregs that can be isolated from peripheral blood of a human
   subject is limiting and extensive ex vivo expansion of the Tregs may alter their
   functionality and/or purity. As the isolated Tregs are polyclonal, they can exert a pan
   immune suppressive function on non-target effector T cells. Importantly, the
   plasticity of Tregs poses a significant challenge (Bluestone et al., (2009) Nat Rev
20 Immunol 9:811-816; Zhou et al., (2009a) Curr Opin Immunol 21:281-285), as
   adoptively transferred Tregs can lose Foxp3 expression and redifferentiate into Thl7
   cells (Koenen et al., (2008) Blood 112:2340-2352.) or pathogenic memory T cells
   (Zhou et al., (2009b) Nat Immunol 10:1000-1007) which raises the risk of aggravating
   the autoimmunity or inflammation.
25 A therapeutic that induces the generation of Tregs in an antigen-specific manner in
   situ would have advantages over adoptive Treg cell therapy. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte
   associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4; CD 152) is a well-established negative regulator of the
   T cell response, is important for the maintenance of T cell homeostasis and self
   tolerance. CTLA-4 is homologous to the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 and shares
30 the same ligands, CD80 (B7.1) and CD86 (B7.2), which are expressed on the surface
   of antigen presenting cells (APCs). However, differential binding of CD80/CD86 on
                                                1

   APCs to CD28 and CTLA-4 on effector T cells leads to opposing outcomes, with
   CD28 triggering T cell activation and CTLA-4 causing T cell inhibition.
   Because CD28 is constitutively expressed on T cells and the expression of CTLA-4 is
   only induced following T cell activation, peaking 2-3 days later (Jago et al., (2004)
 5 Clinical& ExperimentalImmunology, 136: 463-47 1), extensive T cell activation
   would have occurred prior to CTLA-4 engagement. Hence, the main role of CTLA-4
   is to act as a safeguard against an excessive T cell response rather than to inhibit T
   cell activation. However, early engagement of CTLA-4 by its ligand and its
   subsequent crosslinking to the T cell receptor (TCR) can prematurely dampen TCR
10 signaling, causing T cell inhibition and hyporesponsiveness, or anergy. This concept
   has been validated experimentally using a variety of methods, including the
   following: (i) crosslinking T cell-activating antibodies (anti-CD3/antiCD28) using an
   agonistic anti-CTLA-4 antibody by co-immobilization on a bead or via a secondary
   antibody (Blair et al., (1998) J Immunol. 160: 12-15; Krummel and Allison, (1996) J
15 Exp Med 183:2533-2540; Walunas et al., (1996) J Exp. Med. 183:2541-2550); (ii)
   molecularly engineering a surface-linked agonistic scFv against CTLA-4 on an APC
   (Fife et al., (2006) J Clin. Invest. 116(8):2252- 61; Griffin et al., (2001) J Immunol.
   Methods. 248(1-2):77-90; Griffin et al., (2000) J Immunol. 164(9):4433-42); and (iii)
   chemically crosslinking antibodies that recognize specific antigens on an APC to an
20 agonistic anti-CTLA-4 antibody (Li et al., (2007). J Immunol. 179(8):5191-203; Rao
   et al., (2001) Clin. Immunol. 101(2):136-45; Vasu et al., (2004) J Immunol.
   173(4):2866- 76).
   Restoring the balance of Tregs versus effector T cells is a promising means of treating
   autoimmune disease. However, cell therapy involving transfer of Tregs has certain
25 limitations. Accordingly, therapeutics that can induce the generation of Tregs (e.g.,
   CTLA-4) in an antigen-specific manner for the treatment of autoimmune disease are
   urgently required.
   Summary of the Invention
   The present invention relates to ligands which crosslink ligand-engaged cytotoxic T
30 lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) to the T cell receptor (TCR) during the early phase
   of T cell activation and thereby attenuate TCR signaling, leading to T cell inhibition.
   To develop an agent that can inhibit T cell activation, a bispecific fusion protein
                                                2

   comprising moieties that selectively bind and activate CTLA-4 and co-ligate it to the
   TCR was generated. In contrast to the approaches of the prior art, the bispecific fusion
   protein was engineered to crosslink MHC to CTLA-4; both are then drawn to the
   TCR, generating the CTLA-4/MHCII/TCR tri-molecular complex within the immune
 5 synapses.
   Crosslinking ligand-engaged cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) to the TCR
   with a bispecific fusion protein (BsB) comprising a mutant mouse CD80 and
   lymphocyte activation antigen-3 in an allogenic MLR attenuated TCR signaling and
   direct T cell differentiation towards Foxp3 regulatory T cells (Tregs). As described
10 herein, antigen-specific Tregs can also be induced in an antigen-specific setting.
   Treatment of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with a short course of BsB moderately
   delayed the onset of autoimmune type 1 diabetes (TID) with a transient increase of
   Tregs in blood. However, a longer course of treatment of NOD animals with BsB
   significantly delayed the onset of disease as well as reduced the incidence of animals
15 presenting with diabetes. Histopathological analysis of the pancreata of BsB-treated
   mice that remained non-diabetic revealed the presence of Tregs that were intermixed
   with other CD3 T cells and non-T cell leukocytes around the islets. This peri-insulitis
   was associated with minimal invasive insulitis and no notable destruction of the
   insulin-producing p-cells. Thus, bifunctional proteins capable of engaging CTLA-4
20 and MHCII and indirectly co-ligating it to the TCR may induce antigen-specific Tregs
   in vivo to protect mice from TID or other autoimmune diseases.
   In particular, the invention describes bispecific fusion proteins which cross-link
   CTLA-4 to the pMHCII complex. For example, there is described a bispecific fusion
   protein comprising a mutant mouse CD80 (CD80w88a) and lymphocyte activation
25 antigen-3 (LAG-3) which is engineered to concurrently engage CTLA-4 and crosslink
   it to the TCR via pMHCII. In a first aspect, therefore, there is provided a bispecific
   biologic comprising a ligand specific for CTLA-4 and a ligand specific for a pMHC
   complex.
   In one aspect, the invention provides a bispecific biologic comprising a ligand
30 specific for CTLA-4 and a ligand specific for a pMHC complex. The bispecific
   biologic according to the invention is capable of cross-linking CTLA-4, present on T
   cells, with the peptide MHC (pMHC) complex on antigen-presenting cells (APC).
   The peptide MHC complex is bound by the cognate T-cell receptor (TCR) on T-cells,
                                               3

   meaning that the bispecific biologic according to the invention gives rise to a tripartite
   CTLA-4/MHC/TCR complex.
   In various embodiments of the aspects delineated herein, the ligand specific for
   CTLA-4 is selected from an antibody specific for CTLA-4, and CD80 (B7-1) or
 5 CD86 (B7-2). In a particular embodiment, the antibody specific for CTLA-4, and
   CD80 (B7-1) or CD86 (B7-2) is an agonistic antibody. Antibodies specific for
   CTLA-4 can be engineered, and both CD80 and CD86 are natural ligands for CTLA
   4. In one aspect, CD80 or a mutant thereof is used, since CD80 binds preferentially to
   CTLA-4 over CD28, and thus promotes T-cell inactivation as opposed to activation.
10 In various embodiments of the aspects delineated herein, the ligand specific for the
   pMHC complex can be selected from an anti-MHC antibody and LAG-3. The LAG-3
   polypeptide is a natural ligand for the MHCII protein. In one embodiment, the MHC
   is MHC-II (which interacts with CD4+ T-cells). In another embodiment the MHC is
   MHC-I, which interacts with CD8+ T-cells.
15 In the bispecific biologic according to the invention, the ligand specific for CTLA-4
   and the ligand specific for the pMHC complex are preferably spaced apart by a linker.
   The linker can take the form of one or more of a polyamino acid sequence and an
   antibody Fc domain. A suitable polyamino acid sequence is G9 (Gly-9).
   In various embodiments of the aspects delineated herein, the ligand specific for
20 CTLA-4 is CD80, or a mutant thereof which is mutated to increase specificity for
   CTLA-4 over CD28. In one embodiment, the mutated CD80 comprises one or more
   mutations selected from W88A, K75G. K75V, Si 12G, R126S, R126D, G127L,
   S193A, and S204A, using sequence numbering in mouse CD80 precursor, or their
   human CD80 counterparts (W84A, K71G, K71V, S109G, R123S, R123D, G124L,
25 S190A, and S201A) and in addition R63A, M81A, N97A, E196A.
   In one embodiment, the bispecific biologic comprises CD80, which comprises the
   mutation W84A (human) or W88A (mouse).
   In a particular embodiment, the ligand specific for the MHCII complex is LAG-3.
   Advantageously, LAG-3 is mutated to increase specificity for pMHCII. For example,
30 LAG-3 comprises one or more mutations selected from R73E, R75A, R75E and R76E
   (Huard et al., (1997) Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 94(11): 5744-5749. In one
   embodiment, LAG-3 comprises the mutation R75E.
                                                4

   Preferential binding of the bispecific fusion protein to CTLA-4 over CD28 was
   attained using mutant CD80 (CD80w88a), which contains alanine instead of
   tryptophan at amino acid 88 (numbered in mouse CD80), as the ligand. CD80w88a
   binds CTLA-4 but exhibits minimal affinity for CD28 (Wu et al., (1997), J Exp. Med.
 5 185:1327-1335).
   Lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), a natural ligand of MHCII, was selected as
   the other binding component of the bispecific fusion protein (Baixeras et al., (1992) J
   Exp. Med. 176:327- 337; Triebel et al., (1990) J Exp. Med. 171:1393-1405). We
   show that a fusion protein with such bi-functionality effectively inhibits T cell
10 activation and stimulates anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF- production.
   More importantly, this bispecific fusion protein also directed T cell differentiation
   into highly suppressive Foxp3+ Tregs. This did not occur when the well-established
   co-stimulatory inhibitor CTLA-41g was used instead (Bluestone et al., (2006)
   Immunity 24:233-238; Linsley and Nadler (2009) Immunol. Rev. 229:307-321).
15 Therefore, early engagement of CTLA-4 and crosslinking of CTLA-4 to the TCR
   during T cell activation could actively influence T cell differentiation. Such bispecific
   fusion proteins might thus represent a novel class of biologics that could be used to
   control excessive T cell responses in autoimmune diseases.
   In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a bispecific biologic
20 comprising a ligand specific for CTLA-4 and a ligand specific for a pMHC complex
   according to the first aspect of the invention, for the tolerisation of a T-cell by
   contacting said T-cell with an antigen-presenting cell which is presenting a peptide
   derived from said antigen complexed to a MHC molecule and said bispecific biologic.
   In a third aspect, there is provided the use of a bispecific biologic comprising a ligand
25 specific for CTLA-4 and a ligand specific for a pMHC complex according to the first
   aspect of the invention, in the treatment of a disease selected from an autoimmune
   disease and transplant rejection.
   For example, the autoimmune disease is type 1 diabetes (TID, Systemic Lupus
   Erythematosus (SLE), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel disease
30 (IBD) (including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD)), multiple sclerosis
   (MS), scleroderma, and other diseases and disorders, such as PV (pemphigus
   vulgaris), psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, celiac disease, Chronic Obstructive Lung
                                                 5

   Guillain-Barre syndrome, Goodpasture's syndrome, Addison's disease, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, primary biliary sclerosis, sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune
   hepatitis, polymyalgia rheumatica. Raynaud's phenomenon, temporal arteritis, giant
 5 cell arteritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pernicious anemia, polyarteritis nodosa.
   Behcet's disease, primary bilary cirrhosis, uveitis, myocarditis, rheumatic fever,
   ankylosing spondylitis, glomerulenephritis, sarcoidosis, dermatomyositis, myasthenia
   gravis, polymyositis, alopecia areata, and vitilgo.
   In a fourth aspect, there is provided a method of tolerising a T-cell to an antigen,
10 comprising contacting said T-cell with an antigen-presenting cell which is presenting
   a peptide derived from said antigen complexed to a MHC molecule and a bispecific
   biologic according to the first aspect of the invention.
   In a fifth aspect, there is provided a method for treating a subject suffering from a
   condition selected from an autoimmune disease and transplant rejection, comprising
15 the steps of administering to a subject in need thereof a bispecific biologic comprising
   a ligand specific for CTLA-4 and a ligand specific for a pMHC complex according to
   the first aspect of the invention.
   For example, the autoimmune disease is Type 1 diabetes (TID).

                                                6

   harvested and assayed for IL-2. Only BsB and CTLA-41g inhibited T cell activation,
   as indicated by a decreased amount of IL-2 in the media. The figure is representative
   of more than five independent but similar studies.

   Figure 2, using naive CD4+CD62LhCD25-GFP" cells that had been isolated from
   Foxp3-EGFP knock-in mice in the presence of the test constructs. Five days post
   activation, CD4+ T cells were analyzed for GFP expression by flow cytometry. Tregs
   were gated as GFP and CD25* cells. Only BsB treatment led to GFP expression,
10 indicating induction of Foxp3 Tregs (middle left panel). Culture media were
   collected for cytokine analysis (right panels), which revealed elevated IL- 10 and
   TGF-P levels in the presence of BsB. The data are representative of numerous
   independent but similar studies. (B) Requirement of autocrine TGF-P for Treg
   induction is indicated by the complete blockade of Treg induction in the presence of a

20 peptide. Control mIgG2a, BsB, and BsB plus an anti-TGF-P antibody (aTGF-) were
   then added and tested as indicated (left panels). Cells were cultured for 5 days and
   then labeled with anti-CD25 and anti-Foxp3 antibodies before being analyzed by flow
   cytometry. IL-2, IL-10 and TGF- levels in the culture media were assayed by ELISA
   (right panels). (B) Monitoring of induced Tregs proliferation. Studies were conducted

   APCs were added to stimulate T cell activation. The results (mean + standard
   deviation) indicate the percentage of proliferating responder T cells (Tresp), based on
   a CFSE dilution without Tregs (Tresp + APC only) set to 100%. (B) Anti-IL- 10 and

   anti-TGF-     antibodies were added to cells in regular culture wells at a Tresp:Treg
   ratio of 1:1 to determine the cytokines' contribution to T cell proliferation. The anti
   TGF- antibody partially inhibited the suppressive function of TGF-j-induced Tregs
   (left panel) but did not affect BsB-induced Tregs (right panel). The figure is

   deemed not activated were cultured in wells coated with IgG only. The
10 phosphorylation status of AKT and mTOR was then monitored by flow cytometry
   after staining with fluorescently labeled antibodies to phosphorylated AKT and
   mTOR. MFI denotes mean fluorescent intensity. This figure represents one of three
   independent experiments.

   were cultured for 5 days to induce Tregs (left panels), which were then purified from
   the BsB-treated cells (red square) and re-stimulated in another round of culture in co
   coated wells, as above, for 5 days, before analysis by flow cytometry for GFP+ cells.
20 Re-culturing of purified Tregs with the mouse IgG control for 5 days resulted in a loss
   of Foxp37 expression in ~60% of cells (upper right quadrant of upper right panel),
   whereas less than 7% of the Tregs re-cultured with BsB had lost Foxp3 expression
   (upper right quadrant of bottom right panel). This figure represents one of three
   independent experiments.

   were predicted; other amino acids are presented as dots. Monosaccharide composition
 5 of BsB was also performed to determine the composition of the glycans fucose (Fuc),
   , N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), galactose (Gal), , mannose (Man), sialic acid (N
   acetylneuramic acid). A sialic acid:galactose ratio of 0.68 indicates that about a third
   of the galactose residues are available for binding to the asialoglycoprotein receptor.

20 number of Foxp3+ Tregs was detected after two weeks of treatment with BsB when
   compared to saline or mIgG2a-treated controls. However, treatment with CTLA-41g
   resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the number of Foxp3 Tregs in the
   blood. (B) Cumulative incidences of overt diabetes in animals treated with BsB or

   (p=0.0 4 ). However, no significant difference between the groups was noted at the end
   of the study. Data represent one of two separate studies with similar results, with total
   of 26 NOD mice in each group.

   pancreatic sections from diabetic NOD animals. Invasive insulitis was clearly evident
   and insulin-producing p-cells were completely destroyed (e). Some CD3 T cell
   infiltrations were also detected, along with few Tregs and many non-T cell leukocytes
   with blue nuclei (f). Panels g-i shows islets of BsB treated animals that remained non

   Detailed Description of the Invention

10 The term "antibody", unless indicated otherwise, is used to refer to entire antibodies
   as well as antigen-binding fragments of such antibodies. For example, the term
   encompasses four-chain IgG molecules, as well as antibody fragments.
   As used herein, the term "antibody fragments" refers to portions of an intact full
   length antibody - such as an antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody.
15 Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab      )2, and Fv fragments;
   diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules (e.g., scFv);
   multispecific antibody fragments such as bispecific, trispecific, and multispecific
   antibodies (e.g., diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies); binding-domain immunoglobulin
   fusion proteins; camelized antibodies; minibodies; chelating recombinant antibodies;
20 tribodies or bibodies; intrabodies; nanobodies; small modular
   immunopharmaceuticals (SMIP),       VHH   containing antibodies; and any other
   polypeptides formed from antibody fragments,for example as further described
   below.
   Antibodies may be of any class, such as IgG, IgA, or IgM; and of any subclass, such
25 as IgGI or IgG4. Different classes and subclasses of immunoglobulin have different
   properties, which may be advantageous in different applications.
   Specificity, in the context of the present invention, requires that the claimed antibody
   be capable of selectively binding its defined cognate antigen, which is either CTLA-4
   or the pMHC complex.
30 Naturally occurring immunoglobulins have a common core structure in which two
   identical light chains (about 24 kD) and two identical heavy chains (about 55 or 70
   kD) form a tetramer. The amino-terminal portion of each chain is known as the
                                                11

   variable (V) region and can be distinguished from the more conserved constant (C)
   regions of the remainder of each chain. Within the variable region of the light chain
   (also called the VL domain) is a C-terminal portion known as the J region. Within the
   variable region of the heavy chain (also called the VH domain), there is a D region in
 5 addition to the J region. Most of the amino acid sequence variation in
   immunoglobulins is confined to three separate locations in the V regions known as
   hypervariable regions or complementarity determining regions (CDRs) which are
   directly involved in antigen binding. Proceeding from the amino-terminus, these
   regions are designated CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3, respectively. The CDRs are held in
10 place by more conserved framework regions (FRs). Proceeding from the amino
   terminus, these regions are designated FRI, FR2, FR3 and FR4, respectively. The
   locations of CDR and FR regions and a numbering system have been defined by
   Kabat et al. (Kabat, E.A., et al., (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological
   Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S.
15 Government Printing Office, and updates thereof which may be found online.
   A humanized monoclonal antibody, as referred to herein, is an antibody which is
   composed of a human antibody framework, into which have been grafted CDRs from
   a non-human antibody. Procedures for the design and production of humanized
   antibodies are well known in the art, and have been described,for example, in Cabilly

   Constant regions may be derived from any human antibody constant regions.
30 Typically, variable region genes are cloned into expression vectors in frame with
   constant region genes to express heavy and light immunoglobulin chains. Such
   expression vectors can be transfected into antibody producing host cells for antibody
   synthesis.
                                               12

   Required antibody variable and constant regions may be derived from sequence
   databases. For example, immunoglobulin sequences are available in the IMGT/LIGM
   database (Giudicelli et al., (2006) Nucleic Acids Res. 34:(suppl. 1):D781-D784) or
   VBase (vbase.mrccpe.cam.ac.uk).
 5 "Nucleic acids" as referred to herein typically include DNA molecules which encode
   the antibodies of the invention. Preferred are expression vectors, which are suitable
   for expressing the antibody genes in a host cell. Expression vectors and host cells for
   antibody gene expression are known in the art; see,for example, Morrow, K.J. (2008)
   Genetic Engineering& Biotechnology News. (June 15, 2008) 28(12), and Backliwal,
10 G., et al. (2008) Nucleic Acids Res. 36(15): e96-e96.
   "CD80", as used herein, refers to mammalian CD80 antigen as well as to mutants
   thereof which have increased binding avidity or specificity for CTLA-4. See Linsley
   et al., (1994) Immunity 1:793-801, and Wu et al., (1997) J Exp. Med. 185(7):1327
   1335, incorporated herein by reference. Mammalian CD80 can be selected from
15 rodent, such as mouse, or human CD80.
   "CD86", as used herein, refers to mammalian CD86 antigen as well as to mutants
   thereof which have increased binding avidity or specificity for CTLA-4. See Linsley
   et al., (1994) Immunity 1:793-801, incorporated herein by reference. Mammalian
   CD86 can be selected from rodent, such as mouse, or human CD86.
20 "CTLA-4", as used herein, refers to mammalian cytotoxic lymphocyte-associated
   antigen-4 (CTLA-4). The sequence of human CTLA-4 can be found in GenBank,
   Accession number AAH74893.1, GI:4990474 1. Mammalian CTLA-4 can be selected
   from rodent, such as mouse, or human CTLA-4.
   "LAG-3", as used herein, refers to mammalian lymphocyte activation antigen 3
25 (LAG-3). The sequence for human LAG-3 can be found in Huard et al., (1997) Proc.
   Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 94:5744-5749, incorporated herein by reference. Mammalian
   LAG-3 can be selected from rodent, such as mouse, or human LAG-3.
   The "MHC" is the complex involved in the presentation of antigen derived peptides
   by antigen-presenting cells, which is recognised by the TCR. In a certain aspect, the
30 MHC is MHCII, which presents antigen to CD4* helper T-cells. See, for example,
   Wucherpfennig et al., CSHPerspect.Biol. 2(4): a005140, epub 2010 Mar 17.
                                               13

   A bispecific biologic, which may be referred to as a bispecific ligand, is a ligand
   which is capable of binding, or being bound by, two targets contemporaneously.
   Bispecific antibodies are known in the art, and are further described below. In the
   context of the present invention, the two targets are the CTLA-4 molecule on a T-cell
 5 and the MHC peptide complex on an APC. The bispecific biologic according to the
   invention can cross-link the two targets; by virtue of the pMHC binding to the TCR in
   the immune synapse, it therefore cross-links the CTLA-4 molecule to the TCR. A
   "biologic", in general, is a biological therapeutic or agent, which may be useful for,
   inter alia, therapeutic, diagnostic and/or research purposes.
10 A linker is any amino acid sequence which joins and separates two polypeptide
   domains in a protein. In the context of the bispecific ligand of the invention, the linker
   is the sequence which joins the CTLA-4 ligand to the MHC ligand. Exemplary linkers
   are sequences of amino acid, such as polyglycine,for example Gly-9. An alternative
   linker is an antibody Fc region. Such a linker spaces the two ligand domains by
15 approximately 120A.
   A ligand according to the invention may comprise antibody and non-antibody ligands
   in any combination. For example, the CTLA-4 ligand may be an anti-CTLA-4
   antibody, and the MHC ligand may be LAG-3. Alternatively, CD80 may be used as
   the CTLA-4 ligand, in combination with LAG-3 or an anti-MHC antibody. Both
20 ligands may be antibodies, or both may be the natural ligands, CD80 and LAG-3.
   Cytotoxic Lymphocyte-associated Antigen-4 (CTLA-4)
   Cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), also known as CD152, is a
   negative regulator of the T cell response, which plays an important role in the
   maintenance of T cell homeostasis and in the induction of self-tolerance (Karandikar
25 et al., (1996) JExp Med 184:783-788; Krummel and Allison, (1995) JExp Med
   182:459-465; Linsley and Golstein, (1996) Curr Biol 6:398-400; Walunas and
   Bluestone, (1998) JImmunol 160:3855-3860; Walunas et al., (1994) JImmunol
   160:3855-3860). Mice deficient in CTLA-4 develop multi-organ autoimmune disease
   and typically succumb to the ailment by 4 weeks of age (Tivol et al., (1995) Immunity
30 3:541-547; Waterhouse et al., (1995) Science 270:985-988). The molecular
   mechanisms through which CTLA-4 modulate T cell activity are multifaceted and are
   thought to occur either intrinsically on conventional T cells or extrinsically through
                                                14

   regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Ise et al., (2010) Nat Immunol 11:129-135; Jain et al.,
   (2010) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 107:1524-1528; Paterson and Sharpe, (2010) Nat
   Immunol 11:109-111).
   These mechanisms include competing with CD28 for ligand binding (Linsley et al.,
 5 (1994) Immunity 1:793-801), inducing the production of the tolerogenic enzyme
   indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase in APC (Grohmann et al., (2002) Nat Immunol 3:1097
   1101; Onodera et al., (2009) JImmunol 183:5608-5614), and displacing CD28 from
   the immunological synapse (Pentcheva-Hoang et al., (2004) Immunity 21:401-413).
   CTLA-4 is homologous to the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 and shares the same
10 ligands, CD80 (B7.1) and CD86 (B7.2), which are expressed on the surface of antigen
   presenting cells (APCs). However, differential binding of CD80/CD86 on APCs to
   CD28 and CTLA-4 on effector T cells leads to opposing outcomes, with CD28
   triggering T cell activation and CTLA-4 causing T cell inhibition. Engagement of
   CTLA-4 by its ligands (CD80/86) on APC also stimulates the recruitment of the
15 phosphatases SHP-1 (Guntermann and Alexander, (2002) JImmunol 168:4420-4429)
   and PP2A (Baroja et al., (2002) JImmunol 168:5070-5078; Chuang et al., (2000)
   Immunity 13:313-322) to the vicinity of the TCR of T cells undergoing activation.
   Consequent dephosphorylation of key signaling molecules associated with the TCR
   results in termination of T cell activation (Griffin et al., (2000) JImmunol 164:4433
20 4442). Moreover, interventions that promote early engagement of CTLA-4 with its
   ligands and crosslinking to the TCR result in premature dampening of key signaling
   signatures and consequent inhibition of T cell activation, leading to T cell
   hyporesponsiveness or anergy (Blair et al., (1998) Immunol 160:12-15; Griffin et al.,
   (2000) JImmunol 164:4433-4442; Krummel and Allison, (1996) JExp Med 182:459
25 465; Walunas et al., (1996) JExp Med 183:2541-2550).
   To promote crosslinking of CTLA-4 to the TCR during the early phase of T cell
   activation a bispecific fusion protein (designated as "BsB") comprising a mutant
   CD80 (CD80w88a) and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) was generated. BsB
   was designed to concurrently engage CTLA-4 and MHCII in the immune synapse and
30 thereby indirectly crosslink it to the TCR via the cognate pairing of MHCII with the
   TCR (Karman et al., (2012) JBiol Chem epub 2012 Feb 15). In an allogenic MLR,
   BsB was shown to be effective at inhibiting T cell activation. Surprisingly, BsB also
   induced the production of IL- 10 and TGF- and promoted the differentiation of T
                                                15

   cells undergoing activation to Tregs. IL-10 can exert broad immune suppressive
   properties through its ability to control the activation of macrophages and dendritic
   cells (DCs), as well as self-regulate Th1 cells (Ohata et al., (2007) Arthritis Rheum
   56:2947-2956). TGF- can act as an inhibitor of T cell differentiation (Kehrl et al.,
 5 (1986) JExp Med 163:1037-1050), macrophage activation (Tsunawaki et al., (1988)
   Nature 334:260-262; Wahl et al., (1990) Ann N YAcad Sci 593:188-196) and
   dendritic cell maturation (Steinman et al., (2003) Annu Rev Immunol 21:685-711). In
   addition to their anti-inflammatory functions, IL-10 and TGF- also purportedly can
   influence Treg function. For example, IL- 10 has been shown to induce IL- 10
10 producing Tr1 cells (Roncarolo et al., (2006) Immunol Rev 212:28-50) and to act on
   Foxp3+ Tregs to maintain expression of Foxp3 and thereby propagate their
   suppressive function (Murai et al., (2009) Nat Immunol 10:1178-1184). Similarly,
   TGF-P has been reported to be necessary for the induction of Tregs (Chen et al.,
   (2003) JExp Med 198:1875-1886; Zheng et al., (2002) JImmunol 169:4183-4189)
15 and in maintaining their suppressive function by promoting Foxp3 expression (Marie
   et al., (2005) JExp Med 201:1061-1067).
   Regulatory T cells (Tregs)
   Tregs are a functionally distinct subpopulation of T cells capable of controlling the
   immune responses to self and non-self antigens. A deficiency of Tregs results in a
20 heightened immune response and presentation of autoimmune diseases (Sakaguchi et
   al., (1995) JImmunol 155:1151-1164). Extensive research has established a role of
   these specialized T cells in controlling all aspects of immune responses, in particular
   in engendering self-tolerance. Without being bound to a particular theory, these
   findings indicate that agents capable of boosting the in situ production of Tregs or the
25 adoptive transfer of Tregs may be deployed to treat autoimmune diseases. Indeed,
   Treg cell-based therapies using freshly isolated or ex vivo expanded Tregs have been
   shown to be effective in treating animal models of type 1 diabetes (TID) (Tang et al.,
   (2004) JExp Med 199:1455-1465; Tarbell et al., (2007) JExp Med 204:191-201) and
   graft-versus-host disease (Anderson et al., (2004) ; Taylor et al., (2002) Blood
30 99:3493-3499; Zhao et al., (2008) Blood 112:2129-2138). In lieu of isolating and
   expanding Foxp3CD4+CD25+ Tregs (often designated as natural Tregs or nTregs)
   from peripheral blood or lymph nodes, Tregs can be induced from naive CD4+CD25
   T cells in the context of TCR activation and in the concomitant presence of TGF-.
                                                16

   These Tregs are often referred to as adaptive Tregs (aTregs) or induced Tregs
   (iTregs). They are also Foxp3 and purportedly exhibit equally potent suppressive
   functions as nTregs (Chen et al., (2003) JExp Med 198:1875-1886; Yamagiwa et al.,
   (2001) JImmunol 166:7282-7289; Zheng et al., (2002) JImmunol 169:4183-4189).
 5 Adoptive transfers of aTregs or iTregs have been shown to be effective in conferring
   protection against autoimmune disease in an animal model of collagen-induced
   arthritis (Gonzalez-Rey et al., (2006) Arthritis Rheum 54:864-876). However, it is
   becoming more evident that antigen-specific Tregs offer a significantly higher
   therapeutic quotient than polyclonal Tregs with a pan-TCR repertoire (Masteller et al.,
10 (2005) JImmunol 175:3053-3059; Tang et al., (2004) JExp Med 199:1455-1465;
   Tarbell et al., (2007) JExp Med 204:191-201), with less potential side effect on pan
   immune suppression. For this reason, we sought to evaluate the relative merits of
   BsB at producing antigen-specific Tregs in an antigen-specific T cell activation
   setting in vitro. Moreover, we tested its potential in treating autoimmune diabetes in
15 the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse.
   Type 1 Diabetes
   Type 1 Diabetes (TID) is an autoimmune disease caused by tissue specific destruction
   of insulin-producing pancreatic p-cells with consequent development of
   hyperglycemia. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice (female mice in particular)
20 spontaneously develop autoreactive T cells towards islet-specific self-antigens (e.g.
   insulin and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65). In concert with other lymphocytes,
   these autoreactive T cells initiate the development of peri-insulitis between 3 and 4
   weeks of age followed by invasive insulitis at 9 weeks and spontaneous overt diabetes
   between 12 and 35 weeks (Anderson and Bluestone, (2005) Annu Rev Immunol
25 23:447-485). NOD mice share many similarities to the disease in human subjects
   such as the production of pancreas-specific autoantibodies and activation of
   autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Susceptibility of these mice to autoimmunity, as
   in humans, is influenced by genes for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC),
   CTLA-4, and LAG-3. NOD mice harbor a unique major histocompatibility complex
30 (MHC) haplotype (H-2 7 ), which reportedly confers the highest risk for disease
   susceptibility (McDevitt et al., (1996) Hormone and metabolic research 28:287-288;
   Wicker et al., (1995) Annu Rev Immunol 13:179-200). CTLA-4 polymorphism has
   also been noted in NOD mice (Ueda et al., (2003) Nature 423:506-511) and in
                                                17

   humans (Qu et al., (2009) Genes and immunity 10 Suppl 1:S27-32) and a deficiency
   of LAG-3 on the NOD background accelerates TID onset with 100% penetrance
   (Bettini et al., (2011) JImmunol 187:3493-3498). Because BsB engages all these
   targets, the therapeutic merits of BsB were tested in this murine model of T ID.
 5 Antibodies
   The invention encompasses antigen-binding fragments of the antibodies set forth in
   the claims. As used herein, the term "fragments" refers to portions of the intact full
   length antibody - such as an antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody.
   Examples of antibody fragments are set forth above.
10 The term "fragments" as used herein refers to fragments capable of binding the targets
   specified, the CTLA-4 molecule or the pMHC complex. These fragments may lack
   the Fc fragment of an intact antibody, clear more rapidly from the circulation, and can
   have less nonspecific tissue binding than an intact antibody. These fragments can be
   produced from intact antibodies using well known methods,for example by
15 proteolytic cleavage with enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or
   pepsin (to produce F(ab )2 fragments), or expression of such fragments by
   recombinant technology.
   The antibodies and fragments also encompass single-chain antibody fragments (scFv)
   that bind to the CTLA-4 molecule or the pMHC complex. An scFv comprises an
20 antibody heavy chain variable region (VH) operably linked to an antibody light chain
   variable region (VL) wherein the heavy chain variable region and the light chain
   variable region, together or individually, form a binding site that binds CTLA-4
   molecule or the pMHC complex. An scFv may comprise a VH region at the amino
   terminal end and a VL region at the carboxy-terminal end. Alternatively, scFv may
25 comprise a VL region at the amino-terminal end and a VH region at the carboxy
   terminal end. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH,
   are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a
   synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL
   and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv)).
30 A scFv may optionally further comprise a polypeptide linker between the heavy chain
   variable region and the light chain variable region.
                                               18

   The antibodies and fragments also encompass domain antibody (dAb) fragments as
   described in Ward, E.S. et al. (1989) Nature 341:544-546 which consist of a VH
   domain.
   The antibodies and fragments also encompass heavy chain antibodies (HCAb). These
 5 antibodies can apparently form antigen-binding regions using only heavy chain
   variable region, in that these functional antibodies are dimers of heavy chains only
   (referred to as "heavy-chain antibodies" or "HCAbs"). Accordingly, antibodies and
   fragments may be heavy chain antibodies (HCAb) that specifically bind to the CTLA
   4 or pMHC targets.
10 The antibodies and fragments also encompass antibodies that are SMIPs or binding
   domain immunoglobulin fusion proteins specific for the CTLA-4 or pMHC targets.
   These constructs are single-chain polypeptides comprising antigen-binding domains
   fused to immunoglobulin domains necessary to carry out antibody effector functions
   (see WO 2005/017148).
15 The antibodies and fragments also encompass diabodies. These are bivalent
   antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain,
   but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the
   same chain. This forces the domains to pair with complementary domains of another
   chain and thereby creates two antigen-binding sites (see,for example, WO 93/11161).
20 Diabodies can be bispecific or monospecific.
   The antibody or antibody fragment thereof according to the invention does not cross
   react with any target other than the intended CTLA-4 or pMHC targets.
   The antibodies and fragments thereof may themselves be bispecific. For example,
   bispecific antibodies may resemble single antibodies (or antibody fragments) but have
25 two different antigen binding sites (variable regions). Bispecific antibodies can be
   produced by various methods - such as chemical techniques, "polydoma" techniques
   or recombinant DNA techniques. Bispecific antibodies may have binding specificities
   for at least two different epitopes,for example one epitope on each of the CTLA-4

30 Bispecific antibodies comprising complementary pairs of VH and VL regions are
   known in the art. These bispecific antibodies comprise two pairs of VH and VL, each
   VHVL pair binding to a single antigen or epitope. Such bispecific antibodies include
                                                19

   hybrid hybridomas (Milstein, C. and Cuello, A.C., (1983) Nature 305 (5934): 537
   40), minibodies (Hu et al., (1996) CancerRes. 56:.3055-3061), diabodies (Holliger et
   al., (1993) Proc. Natl. A cad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448; WO 94/13804), chelating
   recombinant antibodies (CRAbs) (Neri et al., (1995) J Mol. Biol. 246,367- 373),
 5 biscFv (e.g., Atwell et al., (1996) Mol. Immunol. 33:1301-1312), "knobs in holes"
   stabilised antibodies (Carter et al., (1997) ProteinSci. 6:781-788). In each case each
   antibody species comprises two antigen-binding sites, each fashioned by a
   complementary pair of VH and VL domains. Each antibody is thereby able to bind to
   two different antigens or epitopes at the same time, with the binding to each antigen
10 or epitope mediated by a VH and its complementary VL domain.
   Natural autoantibodies have been described that are polyreactive (Casali and Notkins
   (1989) Ann. Rev. Immunol. 7: 515-531), reacting with at least two (usually more)
   different antigens or epitopes that are not structurally related. It has also been shown
   that selections of random peptide repertoires using phage display technology on a
15 monoclonal antibody will identify a range of peptide sequences that fit the antigen
   binding site. Some of the sequences are highly related, fitting a consensus sequence,
   whereas others are very different and have been termed mimotopes (Lane and Stephen
   (1993) Current Opinion in Immunology 5:268-271). It is therefore clear that the
   binding site of an antibody, comprising associated and complementary VH and VL
20 domains, has the potential to bind to many different antigens from a large universe of
   known antigens.
   WO 03/002609 (Domantis) describes the production of dual specific antibodies in
   which each VHVL pair possesses a dual specificity, i.e., is able to bind two epitopes on
   the same or different antigens. The conformation can be open or closed; in an open
25 conformation, the two epitopes may be bound simultaneously, but in the closed
   conformation binding to the first epitope prevents or discourages binding to the
   second.
   Non-immunoglobulin proteins with multiple binding specificities are known in
   nature;for example, a number of transcription factors bind both DNA and other
30 protein molecules. However, methods for selecting binding peptides in the prior art
   only select peptides with single, not dual or multiple specificities.
                                                20

   Different research teams have previously tethered polypeptides with cysteine residues
   to a synthetic molecular structure (Kemp, D. S. and McNamara, P. E., (1985) J Org.
   Chem. Timmerman, P. et al., (2005) ChemBioChem. 6(5):821-4). Meloen and co
   workers had used tris(bromomethyl)benzene and related molecules for rapid and
 5 quantitative cyclisation of multiple peptide loops onto synthetic scaffolds for
   structural mimicry of protein surfaces (Timmerman, P. et al., (2005) ibid). Methods
   for the generation of candidate drug compounds wherein said compounds are
   generated by linking cysteine containing polypeptides to a molecular scaffold asfor
   example tris(bromomethyl)benzene are disclosed in WO 2004/077062 and WO
10 2006/078161. The selection of such molecules using display technology is described
   in WO 2009/098450. Dual specific embodiments are further described in WO
   2010/089117.
   The ligand, such as an antibody or fragment thereof, may be modified in order to
   increase its serum half-life,for example, by adding molecules - such as PEG or other
15 water soluble polymers, including polysaccharide polymers to increase the half-life.
   In one embodiment, an antibody Fc region may be added to the bispecific linker
   according to the invention, to increase circulating half-life.
   Antibody production
   Antibody production can be performed by any technique known in the art, including
20 in transgenic organisms such as goats (see Pollock et al. (1999) J Immunol. Methods
   231:147- 157), chickens (see Morrow, KJJ (2000) Genet. Eng. News 20:1 -55), mice
   (see Pollock et al. ibid) or plants (see Doran PM (2000) Curr. Opinion Biotechnol.
   11:199-204; Ma, JK-C (1998) Nat.Med. 4:601-606; Baez, J. et al. (2000)
   BioPharm.13:50-54; Stoger, E. et al. (2000) PlantMol. Biol. 42:583-590). Antibodies
25 may also be produced by chemical synthesis; however expression of genes encoding
   the antibodies in host cells is preferred.
   A polynucleotide encoding the antibody is isolated and inserted into a replicable
   construct or vector such as a plasmid for further propagation or expression in a host
   cell. Constructs or vectors (e.g., expression vectors) suitable for the expression of a
30 humanized immunoglobulin according to the invention are available in the art. A
   variety of vectors are available, including vectors which are maintained in single copy
   or multiple copies in a host cell, or which become integrated into the host cell's
                                                21

   chromosome(s). The constructs or vectors can be introduced into a suitable host cell,
   and cells which express a humanized immunoglobulin can be produced and
   maintained in culture. A single vector or multiple vectors can be used for the
   expression of a humanized immunoglobulin.
 5 Polynucleotides encoding the antibody are readily isolated and sequenced using
   conventional procedures (e.g., oligonucleotide probes). Vectors that may be used
   include plasmid, virus, phage, transposons, minichromsomes of which plasmids are a
   typical embodiment. Generally such vectors further include a signal sequence, origin
   of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter and
10 transcription termination sequences operably linked to the light and/or heavy chain
   polynucleotide so as to facilitate expression. Polynucleotides encoding the light and
   heavy chains may be inserted into separate vectors and introduced (e.g., by
   transformation, transfection, electroporation or transduction) into the same host cell
   concurrently or sequentially or, if desired both the heavy chain and light chain can be
15 inserted into the same vector prior to such introduction.
   A promoter can be provided for expression in a suitable host cell. Promoters can be
   constitutive or inducible. For example, a promoter can be operably linked to a nucleic
   acid encoding a humanized immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin chain, such that it
   directs expression of the encoded polypeptide. A variety of suitable promoters for
20 prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are available. Prokaryotic promoters include lac, tac,
   T3. T7 promoters for E. coil; 3- phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes
   e.g., enolase, glyceralderhyde 3- phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate
   decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose 6 phosphate isomerase, 3
   phosphoglycerate mutase and glucokinase. Eukaryotic promoters include inducible
25 yeast promoters such as alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase,
   metallothionein and enzymes responsible for nitrogen metabolism or
   maltose/galactose utilization; RNA polymerase II promoters including viral promoters
   such as polyoma, fowlpox and adenoviruses (e.g., adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma
   virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus (in particular the immediate early gene
30 promoter), retrovirus, hepatitis B virus, actin, rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter and
   the early or late Simian virus 40 and non-viral promoters such as EF-1 alpha
   (Mizushima and Nagata (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18(17):5322). Those of skill in the
                                               22

   art will be able to select the appropriate promoter for expressing a humanized
   antibody or portion thereof of the invention.
   Where appropriate, e.g., for expression in cells of higher eukaroytes, additional
   enhancer elements can be included instead of or as well as those found located in the
 5 promoters described above. Suitable mammalian enhancer sequences include
   enhancer elements from globin, elastase, albumin, fetoprotein, metallothionine and
   insulin. Alternatively, one may use an enhancer element from a eukaroytic cell virus
   such as SV40 enhancer, cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, polyoma enhancer,
   baculoviral enhancer or murine IgG2a locus (see WO 04/009823). Whilst such
10 enhancers are typically located on the vector at a site upstream to the promoter, they
   can also be located elsewhere e.g., within the untranslated region or downstream of
   the polyadenylation signal. The choice and positioning of enhancer may be based
   upon compatibility with the host cell used for expression.
   In addition, the vectors (e.g., expression vectors) typically comprise a selectable
15 marker for selection of host cells carrying the vector and, in the case of a replicable
   vector, an origin of replication. Genes encoding products which confer antibiotic or
   drug resistance are common selectable markers and may be used in prokaryotic (e.g.,
   p-lactamase gene (ampicillin resistance), Tet gene (tetracycline resistance) and
   eukaryotic cells (e.g., neomycin (G418 or geneticin), gpt (mycophenolic acid),
20 ampicillin, or hygromycin resistance genes). Dihydrofolate reductase marker genes
   permit selection with methotrexate in a variety of hosts. Genes encoding the gene
   product of auxotrophic markers of the host (e.g., LEU2, URA3, HIS3) are often used
   as selectable markers in yeast. Use of viral (e.g., baculovirus) or phage vectors, and
   vectors which are capable of integrating into the genome of the host cell, such as
25 retroviral vectors, are also contemplated.
   In eukaryotic systems, polyadenylation and termination signals are operably linked to
   polynucleotide encoding the antibody of this invention. Such signals are typically
   placed 3' of the open reading frame. In mammalian systems, non-limiting examples of
   polyadenylation/termination signals include those derived from growth hormones,
30 elongation factor-I alpha and viral (e.g., SV40) genes or retroviral long terminal
   repeats. In yeast systems, non-limiting examples of polydenylation/termination
   signals include those derived from the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and the
   alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH) genes. In prokaryotic systems polyadenylation
                                                23

   signals are typically not required and it is instead usual to employ shorter and more
   defined terminator sequences. The choice of polyadenylation/termination sequences
   may be based upon compatibility with the host cell used for expression. In addition to
   the above, other features that can be employed to enhance yields include chromatin
 5 remodeling elements, introns and host-cell specific codon modification. The codon
   usage of the antibody of this invention thereof can be modified to accommodate
   codon bias of the host cell such to augment transcript and/or product yield (e.g.,
   Hoekema, A. et al. (1987) Mol Cell Biol. 7(8):2914-24). The choice of codons may be
   based upon compatibility with the host cell used for expression.
10 The invention thus relates to isolated nucleic acid molecules that encode the
   humanized immunoglobulins, or heavy or light chains, thereof, of this invention. The
   invention also relates to isolated nucleic acid molecules that encode an antigen
   binding portion of the immunoglobulins and their chains.
   The antibodies according to this invention can be produced,for example, by the
15 expression of one or more recombinant nucleic acids encoding the antibody in a
   suitable host cell. The host cell can be produced using any suitable method. For
   example, the expression constructs (e.g., one or more vectors, e.g., a mammalian cell
   expression vector) described herein can be introduced into a suitable host cell, and the
   resulting cell can be maintained (e.g., in culture, in an animal, in a plant) under
20 conditions suitable for expression of the construct(s) or vector(s). Suitable host cells
   can be prokaryotic, including bacterial cells such as E. coli (e.g., strain DH5aTM
   (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), PerC6 cells (Crucell, Leiden, NL), B. subtilis and/or other
   suitable bacteria; eukaryotic cells, such as fungal or yeast cells (e.g., Pichiapastoris,
   Aspergillus sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomycespombe, Neurospora
25 crassa), or other lower eukaryotic cells, and cells of higher eukaryotes such as those
   from insects (e.g., Drosophila Schnieder S2 cells, Sf9 insect cells (WO 94/126087
   (O'Connor), TN5BI-4 (HIGH FIVETM) insect cells (Invitrogen), mammals (e.g., COS
   cells, such as COS-I (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1650) and COS-7 (ATCC
   Accession No. CRL-165 1), CHO (e.g., ATCC Accession No. CRL-9096), CHO
30 DG44 (Urlaub, G. and Chasin, LA., (1980) Proc.Natl. Acac. Sci. USA, 77(7):4216
   4220), 293 (ATCC Accession No. CRL- 1573), HeLa (ATCC Accession No. CCL-2),
   CVI (ATCC Accession No. CCL-70), WOP (Dailey, L., et al., (1985) J Virol.,
   54:739-749), 3T3, 293T (Pear, W. S., et al., (1993) Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA.
                                                24

   90:8392-8396), NSO cells, SP2/0 cells, HuT 78 cells and the like, or plants (e.g.,
   tobacco, lemna (duckweed), and algae). See, for example, Ausubel, F.M. et al., eds.
   CurrentProtocolsin Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and John
   Wiley & Sons Inc. (1993). In some embodiments, the host cell is not part of a
 5 multicellular organism (e.g., plant or animal), e.g., it is an isolated host cell or is part
   of a cell culture.
   Host cells may be cultured in spinner flasks, shake flasks, roller bottles, wave
   bioreactors (e.g., System 1000 from wavebiotech.com) or hollow fibre systems but it
   is preferred for large scale production that stirred tank bioreactors or bag bioreactors
10 (e.g., Wave Biotech, Somerset, New Jersey USA) are used particularly for suspension
   cultures. Typically stirred tank bioreactors are adapted for aeration using e.g.,
   spargers, baffles or low shear impellers. For bubble columns and airlift bioreactors,
   direct aeration with air or oxygen bubbles maybe used. Where the host cells are
   cultured in a serum free culture medium, the medium can be supplemented with a cell
15 protective agent such as pluronic F-68 to help prevent cell damage as a result of the
   aeration process. Depending on the host cell characteristics, microcarriers maybe used
   as growth substrates for anchorage dependent cell lines, or the cells maybe adapted to
   suspension culture. The culturing of host cells, particularly vertebrate host cells, may
   utilize a variety of operational modes such as batch, fed-batch, repeated batch
20 processing (see Drapeau et al (1994) Cytotechnology 15: 103-109), extended batch
   process or perfusion culture. Although recombinantly transformed mammalian host
   cells may be cultured in serum-containing media such media comprising fetal calf
   serum (FCS), it is preferred that such host cells are cultured in serum free media such
   as disclosed in Keen et al (1995) Cytotechnology 17:153-163, or commercially
25 available media such as ProCHO-CDM or UltraCHO TM (Cambrex NJ, USA),
   supplemented where necessary with an energy source such as glucose and synthetic
   growth factors such as recombinant insulin. The serum-free culturing of host cells
   may require that those cells are adapted to grow in serum free conditions. One
   adaptation approach is to culture such host cells in serum containing media and
30 repeatedly exchange 80% of the culture medium for the serum-free media so that the
   host cells learn to adapt in serum free conditions (see e.g., Scharfenberg K .et al
   (1995) in Animal Cell Technology Developments Towards the 21st Century (Beuvery
   E.C. et al eds), pp619-623, Kluwer Academic publishers).
                                               25

   Antibodies according to the invention may be secreted into the medium and recovered
   and purified therefrom using a variety of techniques to provide a degree of
   purification suitable for the intended use. For example, the use of therapeutic
   antibodies of the invention for the treatment of human patients typically mandates at
 5 least 95% purity as determined by reducing SDS-PAGE, more typically 98% or 99%
   purity, when compared to the culture media comprising the therapeutic antibodies. In
   the first instance, cell debris from the culture media is typically removed using
   centrifugation followed by a clarification step of the supernatant using e.g.,
   microfiltration, ultrafiltration and/or depth filtration. Alternatively, the antibody can
10 be harvested by microfiltration, ultrafiltration or depth filtration without prior
   centrifugation. A variety of other techniques such as dialysis and gel electrophoresis
   and chromatographic techniques such as hydroxyapatite (HA), affinity
   chromatography (optionally involving an affinity tagging system such as
   polyhistidine) and/or hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) (see US
15 5,429,746) are available. In one embodiment, the antibodies of the invention,
   following various clarification steps, are captured using Protein A or G affinity
   chromatography followed by further chromatography steps such as ion exchange
   and/or HA chromatography, anion or cation exchange, size exclusion chromatography
   and ammonium sulphate precipitation. Typically, various virus removal steps are also
20 employed (e.g., nanofiltration using, e.g., a DV-20 filter). Following these various
   steps, a purified preparation comprising at least 10mg/mI or greater e.g., 100mg/mI
   or greater of the antibody of the invention is provided and therefore forms an
   embodiment of the invention. Concentration to 100mg/ml or greater can be generated
   by ultracentrifugation. Such preparations are substantially free of aggregated forms of
25 antibodies of the invention.
   Bacterial systems are particularly suited for the expression of antibody fragments.
   Such fragments are localized intracellularly or within the periplasm. Insoluble
   periplasmic proteins can be extracted and refolded to form active proteins according
   to methods known to those skilled in the art, see Sanchez et al. (1999) J Biotechnol.
30 72:13-20; Cupit, PM et al. (1999) Lett. Apple. Microbiol.29:273-277.
   The present invention also relates to cells comprising a nucleic acid, e.g., a vector, of
   the invention (e.g., an expression vector). For example, a nucleic acid (i.e., one or
   more nucleic acids) encoding the heavy and light chains of a humanized
                                                 26

   immunoglobulin according to the invention, or a construct (i.e., one or more
   constructs, e.g., one or more vectors) comprising such nucleic acid(s), can be
   introduced into a suitable host cell by a method appropriate to the host cell selected
   (e.g., transformation, transfection, electroporation, infection), with the nucleic acid(s)
 5 being, or becoming, operably linked to one or more expression control elements (e.g.,
   in a vector, in a construct created by processes in the cell, integrated into the host cell
   genome). Host cells can be maintained under conditions suitable for expression (e.g.,
   in the presence of inducer, suitable media supplemented with appropriate salts,
   growth factors, antibiotic, nutritional supplements, etc.), whereby the encoded
10 polypeptide(s) are produced. If desired, the encoded humanised antibody can be
   isolated,for example, from the host cells, culture medium, or milk. This process
   encompasses expression in a host cell (e.g., a mammary gland cell) of a transgenic
   animal or plant (e.g., tobacco) (see e.g., WO 92/03918).
   CD80 Ligands
15 The design and construction of CD80 ligands is intended to maximise the specificity
   of the ligand for CTLA-4 over CD28. The sequence of CD80 is known in the art,
   cited example in Wu et al., 1997. CD80 comprises an extracellular Ig-V variable-like
   domain, and an intracellular IgC constant-like domain. In a preferred embodiment, the
   extracellular domain of CD80 is used as a ligand. For example, see SEQ ID NO: 15,
20 especially residues 1-241.
   Mutations can be made in human CD80 to improve binding affinity, and to improve
   selectivity for CTLA4 over CD28. See, for example, Wu et al., 1997.
   Mutants other than W84A may be made, including K71G, K71V, S109G, R123S,
   R123D, G124L, S190A, S201A, R63A, M81A, N97A, E196A. See Peach et al., JBC
25 1995. 270(6): 21181-21187. Assessment of binding affinity of mutants for both
   CTLA-4 and CD28 can be effected by site-directed mutagenesis followed by
   expression of the mutant polypeptides, and determination of Kd by surface plasmon
   resonance using CTLA-4 and CD28 Biacore chips. See, for example. Guo et al.,
   (1995) J Exp. Med. 181:1345-55.
30 Mutants having advantageous binding and selectivity profiles can be selected, and
   further assessed in cell based assays. For example, flow cytometry can be used to
   assay the effect of wild-type or mutant CD80 transfected into the cells.
                                                27

   LAG-3 Ligands
   LAG-3 has been described in the art, and the binding site to the MHCII protein
   characterised. See Huard et al., (1997) Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94(11):5744-9.
   LAG-3 has four extracellular ig-like domains, and mutations can be introduced into
 5 these domains to optimise binding to MHCII.
   The effectiveness of mutations can be analysed as described above in respect of CD80
   ligands.
   In one aspect, only domains 1 and 2 (D1 and D2) of the four lg-like domains of LAG
   3 are used in a ligand according to the invention. It is believed that these domains are
10 responsible for interaction with the MHCII protein.
   Bispecific Ligand Constructs
   The construction of a bispecific ligand follows the general formula "ligand-linker
   ligand". Bispecific antibodies are known in the art, and are described above.
   Construction of bispecific ligands preferably involved construction and expression of
15 an appropriate gene encoding the desired polypeptide. Other methods of constructing
   by mixing the two polypeptides under conditions that permit covalent, ionic, or
   hydrophobic bonding. In preferred embodiments, it comprises covalently bonding the
   polypeptides. Where a bispecific molecule comprising three components is
   constructed, such as a CTLA-4 ligand, a linker and an MHC ligand, two of the three
20 may be combined, bound together, and the third polypeptide subsequently added to
   the fusion product, and bound to create a fusion product comprising all three
   polypeptides.
   Polypeptides in accordance with the present invention can be produced by any desired
   technique, including chemical synthesis, isolation from biological samples and
25 expression of a nucleic acid encoding such a polypeptide. Nucleic acids, in their turn,
   can be synthesised or isolated from biological sources, and modified by site-directed
   mutagenesis if desired.
   The invention thus relates to vectors encoding a bispecific ligand according to the
   invention, or a fragment thereof. The vector can be,for example, a phage, plasmid,
30 viral, or retroviral vector.
                                              28

   Nucleic acids according to the invention can be part of a vector containing a
   selectable marker for propagation in a host. Generally, a plasmid vector is introduced
   in a precipitate, such as a calcium phosphate precipitate, or in a complex with a
   charged lipid.
 5 If the vector is a virus, it can be packaged in vtro using an appropriate packaging cell
   line and then transduced into host cells.
   The nucleic acid insert is operatively linked to an appropriate promoter, such as the
   phage lambda PL promoter, the E. coli lac, trp, phoA and tac promoters, the SV40
   early and late promoters and promoters of retroviral LTRs. Other suitable promoters
10 are known to those skilled in the art. The expression constructs further contain sites
   for transcription initiation, termination, and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome
   binding site for translation. The coding portion of the transcripts expressed by the
   constructs preferably includes a translation initiating codon at the beginning and a
   termination codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end of the
15 polypeptide to be translated.
   As indicated, the expression vectors preferably include at least one selectable marker.
   Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase, G418 or neomycin resistance for
   eukaryotic cell
   culture and tetracycline, kanamycin or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in E.
20 coil and other bacteria. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include, but are
   not limited to, bacterial cells, such as E. coli, Streptomyces and Salmonella
   typhimurium cells; fungal cells, such as yeast cells (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae or
   Pichia pastoris); insect cells such as Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sf9 cells; animal
   cells such as CHO. COS, HEK293, and Bowes melanoma cells; and plant cells.
25 Appropriate culture media and conditions for the above-described host cells are
   known in the art and available commercially.

   Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate
   transfection. DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated
   transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection, or other methods. Such methods
10 are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Sambrook et al., referred
   to above. A polypeptide according to the invention can be recovered and purified
   from recombinant cell cultures by well-known methods including ammonium
   sulphate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange
   chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction
15 chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin
   chromatography. Most preferably, high performance liquid chromatography
   ("HPLC") is employed for purification.
   Polypeptides according to the present invention can also be recovered from biological
   sources, including bodily fluids, tissues and cells, especially cells derived from
20 tumour tissue or suspected tumour tissues from a subject.
   In addition, polypeptides according to the invention can be chemically synthesised
   using techniques known in the art (for example, see Creighton, 1983, Proteins:
   Structures and Molecular Principles, W. H. Freeman & Co. , N. Y. , and Hunkapiller
   et al., (1984) Nature, 310:105-111). For example, a polypeptide comprising all or part
25 of a bispecific ligand according to the invention can be synthesised by use of a
   peptide synthesiser.
   Bispecific ligands in accordance with the invention are described in detail in the SEQ
   IDs appended hereto. SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2 provide the mouse surrogate DNA and
   protein sequences of bispecific ligands in which the CTLA-4 ligand CD80w88a is
30 paired with the MHC ligand LAG-3, separated by the IGg2a Fc region and a Gly-9
   (G9) sequence. A terminal His tag (H6) sequence is provided at the C-terminus. SEQ
   ID NOs: 3 and 4 provide mouse surrogate DNA and protein sequences for the same
                                               30

   constructs as SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2, except that the IgG2a Fc region is placed C
   terminal to the LAG-3 polypeptide, such that the CD80 and LAG-3 peptides are
   separated by G9 alone. The two arrangements, with the Fc region between the ligands
   or C-terminal thereto, are referred to as gene 1 and gene 2 constructs, respectively.
 5 SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6 provide human DNA and protein sequences in which wild-type
   sequence has been preserved. No mutations are made, either to CD80 or LAG-3.
   In SEQ ID NOs: 7 and 8, a W84A mutation has been made to human CD80 (the
   equivalent of W88A in mouse) and an R75E mutation has been made in LAG-3. The
   remaining SEQ IDs (NOs: 7- 14) describe other mutations in the CD80 and LAG-3
10 sequences.
   Therapeutic Applications
   Suppression of T cell activity is desirable in a number of situations in which
   immunosuppression is warranted, and/or an autoimmune condition occurs.
   Accordingly, targeting of the CTLA4/MHC interaction is indicated in the treatment of
15 diseases involving an inappropriate or undesired immune response, such as
   inflammation, autoimmunity, and conditions involving such mechanisms. In one
   embodiment, such disease or disorder is an autoimmune and/or inflammatory disease.
   Examples of such autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases are set forth above.
   In one embodiment, such disease or disorder is Type 1 Diabetes (TID).
20 In another embodiment, the ligands according to the invention are used to aid
   transplantation by immunosuppressing the subject. Such use alleviates graft-versus
   host disease. For a description of existing treatments for graft-versus-host disease, see
   Svennilson, (2005) Bone Marrow Transplantation35:S65-S67, and references cited
   therein. Advantageously, the antibodies of the invention may be used in combination
25 with other available therapies.
   With regard to the treatment of autoimmune diseases, combination therapy may
   include administration of a ligand of the present invention together with a
   medicament, which together with the ligand comprise an effective amount for
   preventing or treating such autoimmune diseases. Where said autoimmune disease is
30 Type 1 diabetes, the combination therapy may encompass one or more of an agent
   that promotes the growth of pancreatic beta-cells or enhances beta-cell
   transplantation, such as beta cell growth or survival factors or immunomodulatory
                                               31

   antibodies. Where said autoimmune disease is rheumatoid arthritis, said combination
   therapy may encompass one or more of methotrexate, an anti-TNF-a antibody, a
   TNF-a receptor-Ig fusion protein, an anti-IL-6, or anti-IL 17, or anti-IL-15 or anti-IL
   21 antibody, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), or a disease
 5 modifying anti- rheumatic drug (DMARD). For example, the additional agent may be
   a biological agent such as an anti-TNF agent (e.g., Enbrel@, infliximab (Remicade@
   and adalimumab (Humira@) or rituximab (Rituxan@). Where said autoimmune
   disease is hematopoietic transplant rejection, hematopoietic growth factor(s) (such as
   erythropoietin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-11, thrombopoietin, etc.) or
10 antimicrobial(s) (such as antibiotic, antiviral, antifungal drugs) may be administered.
   Where said autoimmune disease is psoriasis, the additional agent may be one or more
   of tar and derivatives thereof, phototherapy, corticosteroids, Cyclosporine A, vitamin
   D analogs, methotrexate, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, as
   well as biologic agents such as anti-TNF-ca agents and Rituxan@. Where said
15 autoimmune disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as,for example,
   Crohn's Disease or ulcerative colitis, the additional agent may be one or more of
   aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, antibiotics, or biologic agents
   such as Remicade@ and Humira@.
   The combination treatment may be carried out in any way as deemed necessary or
20 convenient by the person skilled in the art and for the purpose of this specification, no
   limitations with regard to the order, amount, repetition or relative amount of the
   compounds to be used in combination is contemplated. Accordingly, the antibodies
   according to the present invention for use in therapy may be formulated into
   pharmaceutical compositions. The present invention is also related to pharmaceutical
25 compositions comprising peptides according to the present invention.
   Pharmaceutical Compositions
   In a preferred embodiment, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition
   comprising a bispecific ligand according to the invention, or a ligand or ligands
   identifiable by an assay method as defined in the previous aspect of the invention.
30 Ligands may be immunoglobulins, peptides, nucleic acids or small molecules, as
   discussed herein. They are referred to, in the following discussion, as "compounds".
                                               32

   A pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is a composition of matter
   comprising a compound or compounds capable of modulating T-cell activity as an
   active ingredient. Typically, the compound is in the form of any pharmaceutically
   acceptable salt, or e.g., where appropriate, an analog, free base form, tautomer,
 5 enantiomer racemate, or combination thereof. The active ingredients of a
   pharmaceutical composition comprising the active ingredient according to the
   invention are contemplated to exhibit excellent therapeutic activity,for example, in
   the treatment of graft-versus-host disease, when administered in amount which
   depends on the particular case.
10 In another embodiment, one or more compounds of the invention may be used in
   combination with any art recognized compound known to be suitable for treating the
   particular indication in treating any of the aforementioned conditions. Accordingly,
   one or more compounds of the invention may be combined with one or more art
   recognized compounds known to be suitable for treating the foregoing indications
15 such that a convenient, single composition can be administered to the subject. Dosage
   regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response.
   For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be
   proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.
   The active ingredient may be administered in a convenient manner such as by the
20 oral, intravenous (where water soluble), intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal,
   intradermal or suppository routes or implanting (e.g., using slow release molecules).
   Depending on the route of administration, the active ingredient may be required to be
   coated in a material to protect said ingredients from the action of enzymes, acids and
   other natural conditions which may inactivate said ingredient.
25 In order to administer the active ingredient by other than parenteral administration, it
   will be coated by, or administered with, a material to prevent its inactivation. For
   example, the active ingredient may be administered in an adjuvant, co administered
   with enzyme inhibitors or in liposomes. Adjuvant is used in its broadest sense and
   includes any immune stimulating compound such as interferon. Adjuvants
30 contemplated herein include resorcinols, non-ionic surfactants such as
   polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n-hexadecyl polyethylene ether. Enzyme inhibitors
   include pancreatic trypsin.
                                                33

   Liposomes include water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as conventional
   liposomes.
   The active ingredient may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally.
   Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and
 5 mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these
   preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.
   The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions
   (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous
   preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. In all cases the form must be
10 sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable
   under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the
   contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be
   a solvent or dispersion medium containing,for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for
   example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like),
15 suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained,
   for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the
   required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants.
   The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various
   antibacterial and antifungal agents,for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol,
20 sorbic acid, thirmerosal, and the like. In certain cases, it may be preferable to include
   isotonic agents,for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the
   injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents
   delaying absorption,for example, aluminium monostearate and gelatin.
    Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active ingredient in the
25 required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients
   enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally,
   dispersions are prepared by incorporating the sterilized active ingredient into a sterile
   vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients
   from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of
30 sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying
   and the freeze-drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus
   any additional desired ingredient from previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.
                                                34

   As used herein "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or diluent" includes any and
   all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic
   and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for
   pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any
 5 conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, use thereof in
   the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can
   also be incorporated into the compositions.
   It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form
   for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein
10 refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian
   subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material
   calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required
   pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the novel dosage unit forms of the
   invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of
15 the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the
   limitations inherent in the art of compounding such as active material for the
   treatment of disease in living subjects having a diseased condition in which bodily
   health is impaired.
   The principal active ingredients are compounded for convenient and effective
20 administration in effective amounts with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable
   carrier in dosage unit form. In the case of compositions containing supplementary
   active ingredients, the dosages are determined by reference to the usual dose and
   manner of administration of the said ingredients.
   In order to facilitate delivery of peptide compounds, including antibodies, to cells,
25 peptides may be modified in order to improve their ability to cross a cell membrane.
   For example, US 5,149,782 discloses the use of fusogenic peptides, ion-channel
   forming peptides, membrane peptides, long-chain fatty acids and other membrane
   blending agents to increase protein transport across the cell membrane. These and
   other methods are also described in WO 97/37016 and US 5,108,921, incorporated
30 herein by reference.
   In a further aspect there is provided the active ingredient of the invention as
   hereinbefore defined for use in the treatment of disease either alone or in combination
                                                35

   with art recognized compounds known to be suitable for treating the particular
   indication. Consequently there is provided the use of an active ingredient of the
   invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of disease associated
   with an aberrant immune response.
 5 Moreover, there is provided a method for treating a condition associated with an
   aberrant immune response, comprising administering to a subject a therapeutically
   effective amount of a ligand identifiable using an assay method as described above.
   The invention is further described, for the purposes of illustration only, in the
   following examples.
10 Examples
   Example 1
   Design of a bispecific fusion protein that engages CTLA-4 and crosslinks it to the
   TCR via MHC 11.
   To generate a bispecific fusion protein that selectively and agonistically engages
15 CTLA-4 and simultaneously ligates it to the TCR, mutant CD80 (CD80w88a, referred
   to hereafter as CD80wa) that binds CTLA-4 but has minimal affinity for CD28 (Wu et
   al., 1997) was fused to LAG-3, a natural ligand of MHCII (Baixeras et al., 1992;
   Triebel et al., 1990). CD80wa was joined to LAG-3 using a linker composed of nine
   glycines, which in turn was attached to the Fc portion of mouse IgG2a to purportedly
20 increase its circulating half-life (Fig. 1A). In response to a ligand of this
   configuration, CTLA-4 engagement and ligation to the TCR were expected to occur
   indirectly, via formation of the tri-molecular complex (CTLA-4/MHCII/TTCR) in the
   immune synapses during early T cell activation (Fig. 1B). Conceptually, outside of
   the context of the immune synapse, binding of the bispecific fusion protein to either
25 CTLA-4 or MHCII alone or to both CTLA-4 and MHCII should not lead to inhibition
   of T cell activity. The engagement of CTLA-4 by CD80wa was designed to trigger
   CTLA-4 signaling via the recruitment of phosphatases to the cytoplasmic tail of
   CTLA-4. Meanwhile, binding of LAG-3 to MHCII was intended to bring CTLA-4
   into the proximity of the cognate TCR, which binds the pMHCII complex in the
30 immune synapse (Fig. IB). The combination of these two binding events was
   expected to deliver an inhibitory signal to the TCR. A control fusion protein
                                                36

   comprising CD80wa and IgG2a Fc was also constructed (Fig. 1A), which should not
   be capable of crosslinking CTLA-4 to the TCR (Fig. IC) as it lacks LAG-3.
   The test and control fusion proteins were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells
   and purified with affinity chromatography on a protein G column. Aggregates were
 5 removed using size exclusion chromatography. The test bispecific fusion protein
   (CD80wa-LAG-3-Fc) is referred to as BsB (nucleotide sequence: SEQ ID NO. 3;
   amino acid sequence: SEQ ID NO: 4), and the control construct (CD80wa-Fc) is
   known as BsBA (nucleotide sequence: SEQ ID NO. 16; amino acid sequence: SEQ
   ID NO: 17). As expected, both fusion proteins appeared as dimers on non-reducing
10 SDS-PAGE gels (BsB, 200 kDa; BsBA 140 kDa) and as monomers (BsB, 100 kDa;
   BsBA 70 kDa) on reducing SDS-PAGE gels. Their identities were further confirmed
   by Western blotting, using antibodies against LAG-3 and CD80.
   Example 2
   BsB inhibits T cell activation in an allogenic mixed lymphocyte reaction.
15 The relative ability of BsB and BsBA to inhibit T cell activation was assessed in an
   allogenic mixed lymphocyte reaction by measuring the production of IL-2. Naive
   CD4+CD25 CD62LhighCD44"           T cells that had been purified from BALB/c mice
   were mixed with APCs isolated from C57BL/6 mice in the presence or absence of the
   BsB or BsBA. Murine IgG2a and CTLA-41g, a co-stimulation inhibitor that binds to
20 CD80/86 and blocks their binding to CD28, were included as negative and positive
   controls, respectively. Inclusion of BsB but not BsBA in the mixed lymphocyte
   reaction inhibited IL-2 production albeit not to the same extent as that achieved by
   CTLA-41g (Fig. 2). This difference was likely the result of BsB-mediated T cell
   inhibition occurring later than CTLA-41g-mediated inhibition. More specifically, for
25 BsB, inhibition only occurred after CTLA-4 was upregulated following T cell
   activation. The inability of BsBA to reduce IL-2 production strongly suggests that
   engagement of CTLA-4 alone is insufficient to prevent T cell activation because
   concurrent crosslinking to the TCR is required. To exclude the possibility that the
   LAG-3 portion of BsB plays a role in T cell inhibition, LAG-31g was tested in this
30 assay and verified not to inhibit T cell activation.
   Example 3
   BsB directs T cell differentiation into Tregs.
                                                37

   Early termination of TCR signaling by withdrawal of antigen stimulation, inhibition
   of mTOR signaling, suboptimal TCR stimulation due to a low affinity antigen, or
   weak co-stimulation during T cell activation have been shown to induce Foxp3+
   expression and skew T cell differentiation toward a Treg phenotype (Delgoffe et al.,
 5 (2009) Immunity 30:832-844; Haxhinasto et al., (2008) J Exp. Med. 205:565-574;
   Sauer et al., (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105:7797-7802). As BsB forces early
   engagement of the TCR by activation-induced CTLA-4 with consequent attenuation
   of TCR signaling, its ability to generate Foxp3+ Tregs was also evaluated. Naive
   CD4+CD62LhighGFP" T cells prepared from Foxp3-EGFP knock-in mice (Haribhai et
10 al., (2007) J. Immunol 178:2961-2972) were mixed with LPS-treated allogenic APCs
   in the presence of BsB or BsBA. Flow cytometry analysis of the cells after five days
   of culture revealed a large number of CD4+CD25+GFP+ T cells among the BsB
   treated cells (Fig. 3A, middle left panel) but not among cells treated with mouse
   IgG2a (Fig. 3A, top left panel) or the BsBA control (Fig. 3A, bottom left panel),
15 suggesting that these CD4+CD25+GFP T cells were Foxp3 Tregs. To confirm this
   finding, cell culture media were collected and assayed for the signature Treg
   cytokines, IL-10 and TGF- (Cools et al., (2008) J Cell Mo. Med. 12:690-700).
   Large amounts of IL-10 and TFG-p were detected in the media of BsB-treated cells
   (Fig. 3A, left panels) but not in media of cells treated with BsBA or mIgG2a.
20 Surprisingly, CTLA-41g did not induce generation of GFP+ Tregs or IL-10 and TGF
   production. Without being bound to a particular theory, the mechanism by which
   CTLA-41g curtails the T cell response is different from that of BsB. LAG-31g alone
   or in combination with BsBA also failed to induce generation of GFP+ Tregs,
   suggesting that BsB-mediated crosslinking of CTLA-4 with the TCR was required for
25 Treg induction.
   Example 4
   Induction of Tregs by BsB requires self-stimulated TGF-P
   The concurrent detection of elevated levels of IL- 10 and TGF- following treatment
   with BsB raised the possibility that the cytokines, TGF- in particular, played a role in
30 facilitating the generation of Tregs (Fig.3A). To address this, culture media were
   collected over a period of five days and analyzed for cytokine and Foxp3 Treg
   content. Elevated IL-10 and TGF- levels were detected as early as day 2 post
   treatment, and Foxp3 Tregs were detected after day 3. Without being bound to a
                                               38

   particular theory, the endogenous production of TGF- presumably stimulated by
   BsB, is involved in Treg differentiation. Addition of an anti-TGF- antibody (clone
   ID 11), but not an isotype control IgG (clone 13C4), to the Treg induction assay
   completely blocked the appearance of Foxp3+ Tregs (Fig. 3B). Without being bound
 5 to a particular theory, the early engagement of CTLA-4 and its subsequent
   crosslinking to the TCR by BsB stimulated endogenous TGF- production, which in
   turn encouraged Treg differentiation. Crosslinking of CTLA-4 and the TCR has been
   previously reported to induce TGF- production (Chen et al., (1998) J Exp. Med.
   188:1849-1857), although Treg differentiation was not assessed in this study.
10 Tregs have shown considerable therapeutic potential in modulating the disease
   manifestations in several animal models of autoimmune diseases. However, the
   importance of the specificity of the induced Tregs against the relevant antigens has
   been highlighted. Non-antigen specific Tregs that will not be activated against
   particular autoantigens in the context of autoantigen-specific reactive T cells are
15 presumably not functionally immunosuppressive. Hence, approaches that facilitate
   the generation of large numbers of antigen-specific Tregs are highly desirable for
   treating these ailments. Moreover, strategies that facilitate the de novo induction of
   antigen-specific Tregs in situ (e.g. in islets of pancreas for T ID or in the lamina
   propria for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) are preferred over the use of adoptive
20 transfer of in vitro differentiated or expanded Tregs.
   Example 5
   BsB-induced Tregs are functionally suppressive in a cell-cell contact-dependent
   manner.
   To assess whether the BsB-induced Tregs were functionally suppressive, BsB
25 induced Tregs and TGF-j-induced Tregs, which served as a control, were purified
   using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and mixed with CFSE-labeled
   syngeneic responder T cells at different ratios and allogenic APCs. Cells were co
   cultured for three days in either transwells or regular culture wells, after which the
   proliferation of responder T cells was analyzed using flow cytometry. As
30 summarized in Fig. 5A, both BsB- and TGF-j-induced Tregs cultured in regular
   culture wells almost completely inhibited the proliferation of the responder T cells.
   The potency of the suppressive activity of the BsB-induced Tregs was comparable to
                                                 39

   that of TGF-j-induced Tregs. In contrast, Tregs generated by either BsB or TGF- did
   not significantly inhibit the proliferation of responder T cells when the T cells were
   separated from the Tregs in a transwell. Without being bound to a particular theory,
   Treg suppressive activity depended on cell-cell contact and was not mediated by
 5 secreted cytokines or other factors. Supporting this notion, inclusion of an antibody
   to IL-10 (clone JES5-2A5) in the regular culture well did not affect the suppressive
   activity of either the BsB- or the TGF-j-induced Tregs (Fig. 5B). The addition of an
   antibody to TGF-j 1D 11 also did not affect the suppressive activity of BsB-induced
   Tregs, although it partially reduced suppression by TGF-j-induced Tregs (Fig. 5B).
10 Example 6
   BsB directs differentiation of OT-II T cells into antigen-specific Tregs.
   As it was found that a bifunctional fusion protein comprising CD80wa and LAG3
   (BsB) that crosslinks CTLA-4 to the TCR (via MHCII) can induce the production of
   Foxp3 Tregs in an allogenic MLR, the potential of BsB at eliciting the production of
15 antigen-specific Tregs was examined. To investigate this prospect, naive OT-II T
   cells were purified from transgenic mice harboring transgenes encoding the TCR (a
   and P- subunits) specific for a chicken ovalbumin peptide (323-339) (Bamden et al.,
   1998) and mixed with syngeneic APCs in the presence of Ova323-339. After 5 days
   of culture, significantly greater amounts of Foxp3 Tregs were detected in OT-II T
20 cells that had been treated with BsB (Fig. 4A, middle left panel) than by the mIgG
   control (Fig. 4A, upper left panel) or by CTLA-41g (data not shown). This induction
   of Tregs was inhibited by the inclusion of anti-TGF- antibody in the cultures (Fig.
   4A, bottom left panel). Without being bound to a particular theory, differentiation
   was mediated by endogenously produced TGF- in an autocrine or paracrine manner.
25 Levels of IL-2 were decreased while those of IL-10 and TGF- were increased in the
   media of BsB-treated cells (Fig. 4A, right panels).
   To monitor the proliferative activity of the induced Tregs, OT-II cells were preloaded
   with the fluorescent tracer, CFSE. As shown in Fig. 4B, BsB-induced Foxp3 Tregs
   were determined to be proliferative as indicated by a dilution of the CFSE signal. As
30 expected, the addition of CTLA-41g, a co-stimulatory blocker, reduced T cell
   proliferation. Hence, BsB was able to inhibit T cell activation and induce the
   production of Tregs in both an allogenic MLR and antigen-specific setting.

   Example 7
   Induction of Tregs by BsB may involve attenuation of the AKT/mTOR signaling
   pathway.
   Recent reports have indicated that the AKT and mTOR signaling pathways play
 5 important roles in determining T cell fate. The presence of constitutively active AKT
   in T cells diminishes Treg differentiation in a rapamycin-sensitive manner
   (Haxhinasto et al., 2008), suggesting that the AKT and mTOR signaling pathways
   intersect to influence Treg fate. Moreover, T cells deficient in mTOR differentiate to
   Tregs more readily than normal control T cells (Delgoffe et al., (2009) Immunity
10 30:832-844). An obligatory role for the co-inhibitory molecules PD-i/PD-Li in
   controlling adaptive Treg development by antagonizing AKT/mTOR has also been
   reported (Francisco et al., (2009) J Exp. Med. 206:3015-3029). To determine if these
   pathways are also involved in BsB-mediated induction of Tregs, anti-CD3 and anti
   CD28 antibodies were co-immobilized with BsB, mIgG, or PD-Li on 96-well plates,
15 onto which naive T cells were seeded. Eighteen hours post-activation, the cells were
   stained with fluorescently-labeled antibodies against phosphorylated AKT and mTOR
   and analyzed by flow cytometry. Phosphorylation of both AKT and mTOR was
   attenuated by BsB and PD-LI co-immobilization (Fig. 6). Without being bound to a
   particular theory, signaling events mediated by CTLA-4 and PD-LI inhibitory
20 molecules may converge at some point along the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
   during T cell activation to regulate Treg differentiation.
   Example 8
   Exposure to BsB sustains Foxp3+ expression in induced Tregs.
   In vitro-induced Tregs, unlike fully committed natural Tregs, are reportedly less
25 stable and can lose Foxp3 expression upon extended culture in the absence of the
   initial inducer (e.g., TGF- or retinoic acid) (Selvaraj and Geiger, (2007) J. Immunol.
   178:7667-7677). In the current study, BsB-induced Tregs showed similar instability,
   with some cells losing Foxp3 expression following repeated culture (Fig. 7). To test
   whether re-stimulation by BsB could prolong Foxp3 expression, Tregs were first
30 induced by coating 96-well plates with both anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies and BsB.
   Purified Tregs were then subjected to an additional round of culture in the presence or
   absence of BsB. Re-stimulation of the purified Tregs with BsB allowed for
                                               41

   maintenance of a large population (~93% of total Tregs) of Foxp3 Tregs (Fig. 7,
   bottom right panel), compared to ~40% Foxp3 expression in response to the IgG
   control (Fig. 7, upper right panel).
   Example 9
 5 Pharmacokinetics of BsB in mice.
   Prior to testing the therapeutic utility of BsB in animal models of autoimmune
   diseases, its pharmacokinetic profile was determined to help design a dosing regimen
   in vivo. Intraperitoneal injection of BsB into C57BL/6 mice resulted in a measurable
   rise in circulating levels followed by rapid clearance with an estimated plasma half
10 life (t1/ 2 ) of~12 hr (Fig. 8A). This profile was unexpected since the pharmacokinetics
   of Fc-containing fusion proteins or antibodies is typically more prolonged. As
   binding of antibodies to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is primarily responsible for
   their prolonged half-lives (Roopenian and Akilesh, 2007), the relative abilities of BsB
   and a control mouse IgG2a to bind FcRn were compared. Figure 8B shows that the
15 binding characteristics of both proteins to the FcRn were very similar indicating that a
   defect in the binding of BsB to FcRn was unlikely to be the cause of its rapid
   clearance from the circulation.
   Another potential explanation for the rapid clearance of BsB could be due to its
   uptake by carbohydrate receptors on non-target cells. Examples of such receptors
20 include the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on hepatocytes (Weigel, 1994) and
   the mannose receptor on macrophages and endothelial cells of the reticuloendothelial
   system (Pontow et al., 1992). Analysis of BsB using the NetNGlyc server suggested it
   has the potential to harbor up to 10 asparagine-linked oligosaccharide side chains per
   monomer (Fig. 9). A monosaccharide composition analysis indicated that BsB
25 contained approximately 37 mannose residues, and all the predicted asparagine-linked
   glycosylation sites may have been used because each of these asparagine-linked
   oligosaccharide glycans contains the core-mannose structure with three mannose
   residues (a total of 30 mannose residues). In addition, a small amount of high
   mannose type oligosaccharides may also exist to account for the extra mannose
30 residues. Indeed, significant amounts of under-sialylated tri- and tetra-antennary
   asparagine-linked, as well as some high-mannose type oligosaccharides were
   identified by mass spectrometry of permethylated glycans released from the protein.
                                                  42

   This projection is also consistent with BsB's molecular weight of 100 kDa as
   indicated by an SDS-PAGE analysis, as opposed to BsB's calculated weight of 80
   kDa. The added presence of oligosaccharides contributed to the difference (20 kDa)
   in molecular weight. Moreover, BsB exhibited a ratio of sialic acids to galactose of
 5 0.68 (Fig. 9), indicating that the glycans were incompletely sialylated. Without being
   bound to a particular theory, the carbohydrate-mediated clearance of BsB by the
   ASGPR contributed to its rapid clearance from circulation.
   Example 10
   A short course of treatment with BsB delayed the onset of autoimmune diabetes
10 in NOD mice.
   As the EC5 0 of BsB for inducing Tregs in vitro was estimated to be about 100 nM and
   its circulating half-life was short (t 1 / 2 at -12h), BsB was tested in NOD mice in a late
   prevention paradigm. NOD mice were administered BsB over a short interval (every
   other day for 4 weeks) when they were between 9 and 12 weeks of age. At this age,
15 autoreactive T cells and insulitis are already evident but the mice have yet to develop
   overt diabetes. As shown in Figure 10A, NOD mice treated for 2 weeks with BsB
   showed a modest but statistically significantly increase (25%) in the number of
   Foxp3 Treg in the blood when compared to saline-treated controls. However, this
   increase in Tregs was transient as a difference in the number of Tregs after 4 weeks of
20 treatment or at later times points was unable to be detected. A similar transient
   increase in Tregs in lymphoid organs was noted previously following treatment of
   NOD mice with an anti-CD3 antibody (Nishio et al., 2010). Without being bound to a
   particular theory, the BsB-induced Tregs may have reverted to Foxp3 T cells after
   cessation of treatment. They may also have been recruited by specific target tissues
25 (e.g. pancreas) to execute their function. Regardless, this short course of treatment
   with BsB in a late prevention treatment paradigm appears to modestly delay the onset
   of disease and decrease the number of mice presenting with overt TID (Fig. 10B).
   The modest response noted may have been due to the presence of active insulitis in
   the 9 week-old NOD mice prior to commencement of therapy. An inflammatory
30 milieu has been shown to favor the conversion of activating T cells to Thl7 cells and
   suppress their conversion to Tregs. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 or IL-4 have
   also been shown to inhibit Treg conversion and promote the loss of Foxp3+ expression
                                                     43

   in Tregs (Caretto et al., 2010; Kastner et al., 2010; Koenen et al., 2008). To
   circumvent these challenges, NOD mice were treated starting at an earlier age (4
   week-old) prior to overt induction of auto-reactive T cells and insulitis. CTLA-41g
   was also included as a positive control in this study as Bluestone and colleagues
 5 (Lenschow et al., 1995) had demonstrated a benefit using this agent in this model;
   mIgG2a was used as an additional negative control to saline. In contrast to the results
   in older mice (Fig. 10A), the number of Foxp3+ Tregs in the peripheral blood of
   younger NOD mice treated for 2 weeks with BsB was not increased over those
   administered saline or mIgG (Fig. 11 A). Without being bound to a particular theory,
10 this might be because the number of auto-reactive T cells in 4 week-old NOD mice
   (in contrast to 9-12 week old mice used in the earlier study) was very low. The
   number of induced antigen-specific Tregs was likely too small to register beyond the
   basal levels present in the animals. A significantly lower incidence of TID was noted
   in NOD mice administered BsB when compared to the saline-treated controls prior to
15 24 weeks of age (Fig. 1 IB). However, this benefit was reduced at the later time
   points.
   Consistent with the report of NOD mice administered CTLA-41g (Salomon et al.,
   2000), the levels of Tregs in the blood (Fig. 11 A) were significantly depressed
   presumably because of CTLA-41g's effects on CD28/B7 signaling (Tang et al., 2003).
20 Treatment with CTLA-41g also aggravated the disease with mice exhibiting an earlier
   onset of disease (Fig. 1 IB) and higher penetrance of disease when compared to the
   saline- and mIgG-treated controls (Fig. 1 IB). The reason for the discrepancy between
   these findings and those reported by Bluestone and colleagues (Lenschow et al., 1995)
   is unclear but may be due to the differences in the CTLA-41g used or the dosing
25 regimen employed. In the present studies, a dose of 10 mg/kg of human CTLA-41g
   (Orencia) was used instead of 2.5 mg/kg of mouse CTLA-41g by Bluestone and
   colleagues. Moreover, BsB treatment was not extended beyond 7 weeks. Without
   being bound to a particular theory, the use of a higher dose of CTLA-41g afforded a
   more complete blockade of the co-stimulatory signal required for Treg homeostasis.
30 Example 11
   A longer course of treatment with BsB significantly delayed the onset and
   reduced the incidence of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice.
                                               44

   Potential reasons for the observed modest benefits of BsB at addressing the disease in
   NOD mice in the earlier studies include the deployment of a relatively short-course of
   treatment, the moderate potency of BsB at inducing the production of Tregs (EC 5o at
   > 100 nM), and the short circulating half-life of BsB that may have limited its
 5 exposure. As the potency and circulating half-life of BsB are intrinsic to the molecule
   and therefore not amenable to facile change, a longer course of treatment was tested.
   To this end, NOD mice were treated with BsB for 10 weeks instead of 4 weeks
   starting when the mice were at 4 weeks of age. As shown in Figure 12A, NOD mice
   treated for 10 weeks with BsB exhibited a significant delay in the onset of TID.
10 Importantly, by 35 weeks of age, only ~13 % of BsB-treated NOD mice developed
   TID as compared to over 70% in the saline-treated controls. Thus, extended
   treatment of NOD mice with BsB appeared to have protected the animals from
   developing autoimmune diabetes.
   At the conclusion of the study (when mice were 35 week-old), the animals were
15 sacrificed and their pancreata were collected for histopathological analysis. Adjacent
   serial sections were stained with H&E for a general assessment of the islets, probed
   with an anti-insulin antibody to detect the presence of insulin in the p-cells, and
   double stained with anti-CD3 and anti-Foxp3 antibodies to locate T cells and Tregs.
   Due to the genetic heterogeneity of the NOD mice, a small number of the untreated
20 animals did not develop disease at 35 weeks of age. Analysis of the islets of these
   non-diabetic animals (from the saline-treated cohort) showed the p-cells were intact
   with no obvious evidence of lymphocytic infiltration or insulitis, (Fig. 12B, panels a
   c). A few Foxp3 Treg cells were present in the islets of these mice (arrows in panel
   c). In contrast, islets from diabetic NOD mice (from the saline-treated cohort)
25 revealed the presence of invasive insulitis (Fig. 12B, panel d) and complete
   destruction of the p-cells (panel e). In addition to CD3 T cells and Foxp3 Tregs,
   large numbers of non-T cell lymphocytes were also evident (Fig. 12B, panel f).
   Similar histopathological findings were noted in the corresponding BsB-treated mice
   that remained disease-free at the end of the study or that developed TID during the
30 study. Interestingly, in ~50% of the islets of BsB-treated NOD mice that remained
   non-diabetic, evidence of peri-insulitis were noted (Fig. 12B, panel g); however, the
   p-cells were well preserved (Fig. 12B, panel h). Staining with antibodies indicated
   that the cells at the periphery of the islets comprise primarily CD3 T cells and Tregs.
                                                 45

   (Fig. 12B, panel i). An enlargement of a section of the image (red square in Fig. 12B,
   panel i) clearly revealed the presence of numerous Foxp3 Tregs (yellow arrows in
   Fig. 12B, panel j) that were interspersed with non-Foxp3 but CD3 T cells (black
   arrow heads in Fig. 12B, panel j) as well as non-T cell mononucleocytes (blue nuclei).
 5 The development of peri-insulitis has been noted in young (4-10 week-old) NOD
   mice (Anderson and Bluestone, 2005) and in older mice treated with other efficacious
   therapeutic agents that delayed or reversed new onset TID in NOD mice (Chatenoud
   et al., 1994; Daniel et al., 2011; Simon et al., 2008; Vergani et al., 2010). Hence, a
   longer course of treatment of NOD mice with BsB protected the animals from
10 developing invasive insulitis and overt TID. Without being bound to a particular
   theory, this was mediated, at least in part, by the de novo and possibly in situ
   induction of islet antigen-specific Tregs.
   Crosslinking CTLA-4 and TCR via MHCII using a novel bispecific fusion protein
   (BsB) efficiently induced the production of antigen-specific Tregs as well as the anti
15 inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-        . Previous studies showed that Tregs are
   critical for conferring immune tolerance and that antigen-specific Tregs are more
   efficacious in animal models of autoimmune diseases. BsB was further evaluated in
   animal models of autoimmune diseases, such as T ID. Without being bound to a
   particular theory, it was hypothesized that if BsB promoted the induction of antigen
20 specific Tregs during the early phase of activation of autoreactive T cells in NOD
   mice it can delay the onset or halt the progression of disease by converting the
   autoreactive T cells that are undergoing activation to Tregs.
   Despite BsB exhibiting a modest potency (due to its moderate affinity for the MHC-II
   and TCR) and a short circulating half-life (which limited its exposure), a short course
25 of treatment reproducibly delayed the onset of TID in NOD mice treated at an early
   age (between 4-6 weeks of age) and when they were older (between 9-12 weeks of
   age). However, the observed benefits were modest and unsustained. A longer course
   of treatment (10 weeks) of NOD mice (between 4 and 13 weeks of age) with BsB
   significantly delayed the onset of disease and the incidence of animals developing
30 TID. Without being bound to a particular theory, this benefit was imparted by the de
   novo generation of induced Tregs that were either produced locally (e.g. in the
   pancreas or pancreatic draining lymph nodes) or distally that were then recruited to
   the pancreas to protect the islets from destruction by autoreactive T cells and other
                                                46

   non-T cell leukocytes. Immunohistochemical staining of sections of pancreatic tissues
   of 35 week-old BsB-treated mice that remained non-diabetic clearly indicated an
   increase in the number of Foxp3+ Tregs at the periphery of the islets. Visually, they
   appeared to be preventing CD3+ T cells and non-T cell lymphocytes from entering the
 5 islets. This phenomenon was observed in ~50% of the islets of BsB-treated NOD
   mice that remained non-diabetic at the end of the study but in none of the islets of
   diabetic animals in the control group. The islets of a few non-diabetic mice in the
   control group remained devoid of lymphocytic infiltrations and were insulitis-free. It
   is known that because of the genetic heterogeneity of NOD mice, a few animals in a
10 cohort of this size never develop diabetes within this timeframe. In the remaining
    ~50% of the non-diabetic animals in the BsB-treated group, the islets were also
   devoid of lymphocytic infiltrations and insulitis-free. Possibilities for the disease-free
   status of these mice include BsB treatment and the genetic background.
   Consistent with the histopathological findings, a small but statistically significant
15 increase in the number of Foxp3+ Tregs was detected in the blood of BsB-treated
   animals (treated from 9-12 weeks of age) when compared to untreated controls. This
   increase was not evident in mice that started treatment at a younger age (4 week-old).
   Without being bound to a particular theory, this may be because more autoreactive T
   cells were undergoing activation in the 9 week-old than in the 4 week-old mice. The
20 low levels of autoreactive T cells in the 4 week-old mice might have precluded
   detection of induced Tregs beyond that in the existing milieu of Tregs. The increase
   in Tregs was also transient in nature. As a similar observation was noted in animals
   subjected to anti-CD3 therapy (Nishio et al., 2010), it is possible that the induced
   Tregs were unstable and lost expression of Foxp3. It is more conceivable that the
25 Tregs were recruited from circulation to affected target tissues. In contrast, NOD
   mice treated with CTLA-41g exhibited a significant decrease in the number of
   circulating Tregs. Treatment also aggravated the disease as evidenced by an
   expedited onset of disease and a higher incidence of animals displaying overt disease.
   This is consistent with previous reports showing that the co-stimulatory pathway is
30 involved in Treg homeostasis and that a lack of co-stimulation reduces the production
   of Tregs. Blocking or knocking-out CD80 or CD86 in NOD mice also results in an
   earlier onset of TID (Salomon et al., 2000; Tang et al., 2003).
                                               47

   The appearance of peri-insulitis is typically observed in the pancreas of NOD mice
   between 4 and 9 weeks of age. If uncontrolled, invasive insulitis ensues leading to the
   complete destruction of p-cells and the development of overt diabetes between 12 and
   35 weeks of age. The pancreata of non-diabetic NOD mice that had been treated for
 5 10 weeks with BsB and analyzed at 35 weeks of age exhibited evidence of peri
   insulitis that appeared to be arrested in their progression. No indication of invasive
   insulitis or excessive destruction of insulin-producing p-cells was noted. There are
   other reports of different therapeutic interventions similarly delaying or preventing
   disease in NOD mice (Shoda et al., 2005). The results here are most akin to those
10 reported by Lee et al. (2010), who showed that transfer of diabetogenic CD4+CD25
   BDC2.5 T cells depleted of CD4+CD25+ Tregs into female NOD/SCID mice
   expedited the development of invasive insulitis when compared to mice administered
   total CD4+ T cells containing CD4+CD25+ Tregs. Invasive insulitis was largely
   dominated by infiltration of dendritic cells (DC) rather than by BDC2.5 T cells per se.
15 The authors surmised from their study that Tregs regulated the invasiveness of DCs
   into the islets by modulating, at least in part, the chemotaxis of DCs in response to the
   chemokines CCL 19 and CCL21 secreted by the islets. The immunohistochemical
   staining patterns for Foxp3 Tregs, CD3 T cells and non-T cell leukocytes noted in
   the pancreatic sections of BsB-treated, non-diabetic NOD mice are consistent with
20 their findings (Fig. 12B). Without being bound to a particular theory, Tregs produced
   in NOD mice in response to BsB likely acted to halt the migration of autoreactive T
   cells and non-T cell lymphocytes into the islets. A longer course of treatment with
   BsB was more effective because this generated a more robust and sustained induction
   of Tregs. That continuous stimulation of induced Tregs with BsB in cell cultures
25 extended the expression of Foxp3 in Tregs is supportive of this notion (Karman et
   al., 2012).
   Cell therapy using freshly isolated, ex vivo expanded or in vitro induced Tregs in
   animal models of autoimmune diseases or organ transplants have demonstrated that
   adoptive transfer of Tregs can restore the balance of Tregs versus effector T cells,
30 thereby controlling the exuberant autoimmunity associated with these diseases (Allan
   et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2006; Riley et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2012). However, the use
   of adoptive transfer as a therapeutic strategy presents several challenges to translation
   into the clinic. Firstly, the number of autologous Tregs that can be isolated from
                                                  48

   peripheral blood of a human subject is limiting. Hence extensive ex vivo expansion of
   the Tregs is often necessary, which may alter their functionality and purity. Secondly,
   as the isolated Tregs are polyclonal, they can exert a pan-immune suppressive
   function on non-target effector T cells. Thirdly, and most importantly, the plasticity
 5 of Tregs poses a significant challenge (Bluestone et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2009a). It
   has been shown that adoptively transferred Tregs can lose Foxp3 expression and
   redifferentiate into Thl7 cells (Koenen et al., 2008) or pathogenic memory T cells
   (Zhou et al., 2009b) which raises the risk of aggravating the autoimmunity or
   inflammation. Consequently, a therapeutic that induces the generation of Tregs in an
10 antigen-specific manner in situ is more advantageous over adoptive Treg cell therapy.
   The results presented herein demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of such an agent
   (BsB) that crosslinks CTLA-4 to MHCII in the context of a mouse model of TID.
   The combined demonstration of production of IL-10, TGF- and Tregs in response to
   treatment with BsB as well as efficacy in the NOD mouse model of Ti D has the
15 potential to provide a novel therapeutic concept. BsB also offers additional
   advantages over other immune modulators in that it does not affect resting T cells or
   other lymphocytes. The numbers and percentages of CD4+ T cells and CD 19+ B cells
   in the periphery remained the same in all our NOD studies. Without being bound to a
   particular theory, this approach is effective in delaying or halting disease progression.
20 The development of BsB variants that are more potent and that harbor a more
   favorable pharmacokinetic profile should confirm these studies. Thus, this concept
   may also be applied towards the management of other immune-mediated diseases.

   performed as previously reported (Karman et al., 2012). For antigen-specific T cell
   activation, 105 naive OT-II T cells were mixed in round-bottom 96-well plates with
   105 irradiated syngeneic APCs in the presence of Ova 3 2 3 -3 2 9 at 0.5 pg/ml and 1 pg/ml
30 soluble anti-CD28 (clone 37.51, eBioscience). The test constructs, mouse IgG2a, or
   mouse CTLA-41g were added to the cultured cells at a saturating concentration of 100
   pg/ml. The cells were cultured for 5 days to induce production of Tregs and analyzed
                                                  50

   by flow cytometry. Media were collected for analysis of IL-2, IL-10 and TGF- using
   ELISA kits per the manufacturer's instructions. To assess T cell proliferation,
   purified naive OT-II T cells were labeled with 5 ptM CFSE for 5 min at 37C. They
   were then washed to remove unbound CFSE and used in Treg induction assays as
 5 described above. Cells were cultured for 5 days to allow them to divide before being
   analyzed by flow cytometry. To detect Foxp3 in T cells, cells were stained for
   surface markers as described above followed by permeabilizing with Fix/Perm buffer
   (eBioscience) and staining with PE-Cy7 conjugated anti-Foxp3 antibody (clone FJK
   16s, eBioscience).
10 Pharmacokineticsmeasurements ofBsB in mice. The pharmacokinetics of BsB was
   determined in 8 week-old C57BL/6 mice. 20 mg/kg of BsB was administered into
   mice by intraperitoneal injection. Blood was collected by saphenous vein bleeding at
   1 hr, 5 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, and 72 hr after administration. The levels of BsB at each time
   point were measured using an ELISA assay. Briefly, 100 pl (1 pg/ml) of an anti
15 mouse CD80 antibody in PBS were coated onto 96-well plates and incubated
   overnight at 4'C. Plates were blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum for 1 h, after which
   they were washed 4 times with PBS. 100 pl of blood samples at various dilutions
   were then added into the wells. The plates were incubated for 2 hr with gentle
   shaking at room temperature and washed 4 times with PBS. Biotinylated anti-mouse
20 LAG-3 antibody (1 pg/ml) was added and incubated for 2hr. The plates were washed
   4 times with PBS after which streptavidine-HRP was added. After 30 min, the plates
   were washed 6 times with PBS and developed for colorimetric measuring. Purified
   BsB diluted in assay diluent at various concentrations were used as standards.
   Treatment ofNOD mice with BsB. In the short course treatment, 4 week-old female
25 NOD mice were treated with saline, 20 mg/kg BsB, 20 mg/kg mouse IgG2a, or 10
   mg/kg human CTLA-41g (Orencia) three times a week by intraperitoneal injection
   over a period of 2.5 weeks. For the late prevention model, 9-12 week-old NOD mice
   were treated with saline or 20 mg/kg BsB as above for 4 weeks. For longer course
   treatment, NOD mice were treated with BsB or saline as above for 10 weeks from age
30 of 4 weeks to 13 weeks. Non-fasting blood glucose levels were monitored weekly
   starting at 8 weeks of age. Mice were deemed diabetic when their glucose readings
   were greater than 300 mg/dL for three consecutive readings. Foxp3 Tregs in
   peripheral blood was examined after two weeks of treatment by flow cytometry.
                                                51

   Briefly, 50 pl of whole blood was blocked with unlabeled anti-FcyRIIb and FcgRIII
   (clone 93, eBioscience) for 20 min. Cells were subsequently stained with
   fluorescently-labeled anti-CD4 antibody for 30 min and then washed. Red blood cells
   were lysed using FACS Lysing solution (BD Biosciences) for 5 min. After washing,
 5 cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with a FITC-labeled anti-Foxp3 antibody
   for 30 min as described above. Pancreata were dissected in half with one half fixed in
   neutral buffer formalin and the other placed into OCT compound and then frozen on
   dry ice.
   Statisticalanalysis. Cumulative incidences of NOD mice presenting with TiD and
10 hyperglycemia following treatment with BsB or controls were compared using the
   log-rank (Cox-Mantel) test in Prism 5 (Graphpad, city and state). A value ofp<0.05
   was considered statistically significant.
   Histopathologicalanalysis. Neutral buffer formalin-fixed pancreata was stained for
   CD3, Foxp3m cells using an automated processer. Tissue sections were dewaxed
15 using xylene-ethanol, the antigens retrieved by incubating for 25 min in citrate buffer
   and then blocked with serum. Slides were incubated with an anti-CD3 antibody for 45
   min, followed by a goat anti-rabbit horse radish peroxidase polymer for 20 min.
   Chromogen visualization of CD3 was obtained by incubating with 3,3'
   diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride for 2-4 min. To detect Foxp3, sections were re
20 blocked with serum, followed by exposure to an anti-Foxp3 antibody for 45 min.
   Slides were then incubated with a rabbit anti-rat IgG antibody for 30 min, followed by
   a goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase polymer. Chromogen visualization was
   achieved using Fast Red for 10 min. Tissue sections were counterstained using
   hematoxylin for 2 min and washed 3 times with 0.05% Tween-20/Tris buffered saline
25 between steps. Adjacent serial sections were stained using an anti-insulin antibody as
   described above. Pictures were taken using a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescent
   microscope with an attached digital camera from Diagnostic Inc. and images acquired
   using the Spot Advanced software.
