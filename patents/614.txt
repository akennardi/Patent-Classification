The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent Application No. 2013265288, the entire
disclosure of which is incorporated into the present specification by this cross-reference.
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of N-[5-(3,5-difluoro-benzyl)-1H-indazol-3-yl]-4-(4-methyl
piperazin-1-yl)-2-(tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylamino)-benzamide. Novel solid forms of this compound, their utility in treating
diseases caused by deregulated protein kinase activity and pharmaceutical compositions containing them are also object
of the present invention.
The malfunctioning of protein kinases (PKs) is the hallmark of numerous diseases. A large share of the oncogenes and
proto-oncogenes involved in human cancers encode for PKs. The enhanced activities of PKs are also implicated in many
non-malignant diseases, such as benign prostate hyperplasia, familial adenomatosis, polyposis, neuro-fibromatosis,
psoriasis, vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, arthritis,
glomerulonephritis and post-surgical stenosis and restenosis.
PKs are also implicated in inflammatory conditions and in the multiplication of viruses and parasites. PKs may also play
a major role inthe pathogenesis and development of neurodegenerative disorders.
For a general reference to PKs malfunctioning or deregulation see, for instance, Current Opinion in Chemical Biology
 1999, 3, 459 - 465; Nature Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; and Carcinogenesis 2008, 29, 1087-1091.
A subset of PK is a group of membrane receptors with intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity (RPTK). Upon binding of
growth factors, RPTKs become activated and phosphorylate themselves and a series of substrates in the cytoplasm.
Through this mechanism, they can transduce intracellular signallings for proliferation, differentiation or other biological
changes. Structural abnormalities, over-expression and activation of RTPKs are frequently observed in human tumors,
suggesting that constitutive ignition of the signal transduction leading to cell proliferation can result in malignant
transformation. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor belonging to the insulin receptor
subfamily of RTKs: the ALK gene is located on cromosome 2 and is expressed mainly in neuronal cells, especially
during development. The ALK gene is involved in a balanced chromosomal translocation with the Nucleophosmin (NPM)
gene on cromosome 5 in a large subset of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphomas (ALCL). In the ALK+ ALCL, as a result of
the translocation, the NPM ubiquitous promoter drives an ectopic expression of the fusion protein in which the NPM
moiety dimerizes and the ALK kinase domain undergoes auto-phosphorylation and becomes constitutively active.
Many data from the literature have demonstrated that the NPM-ALK fusion protein has a strong oncogenic potential and
its ectopic expression is responsible for cellular transformation. Moreover, the constitutive expression of human NPM
ALK in mouse T-cell lymphocytes is sufficient for the development of lymphoid neoplasia in transgenic animals with a
short period of latency.
ALCL is a defined disease characterized by the surface expression of the CD30 antigen (Ki-1), and accounts for 2%of
adult and 13% of pediatric non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, affecting predominantly young male patients. ALK+ ALCL

                                                                -2
accounts for 70% of all ALCLs and is an aggressive disease with systemic signs, and frequent extranodal involvement
(bone marrow, skin, bone, soft tissues).
About 15-20% of ALK-expressing ALCLs were found to bear a different chromosomal translocation, involving the
cytoplasmic portion of ALK, with different N-terminal moieties, all resulting in constitutive activation of the ALK kinase
domain.
Moreover, cell lines established from solid tumors of ectodermal origin like melanomas, breast carcinomas, as well as
neuroblastomas, glioblastomas, Ewings sarcomas, retinoblastomas, were found to express the ALK receptor.
In conclusion, interfering with the ALK signalling likely represents a specific and effective way to block tumor cell
proliferation in ALCL and possibly other indications.

the treatment of a variety of cancers and cell proliferative disorders.
The preparations of this compound are described in example 2 (step i') and in example 7 of the above noted patent
application.
The known preparation of the compound of formula (1),as described in example 2 (step i') of the above noted patent
application comprises, essentially, adding a solution of 5-(3,5-difluoro-benzyl)-1H-indazol-3-ylamine to the 4-(4-methyl
piperazin-1-yl)-2-[(tetrahydro-pyran-4-yl)-(2,2,2-trifluoro-acetyl)-amino]-benzoic acyl chloride and then deprotecting with
an organic base at high temperature the obtained compound to give the desired amide of formula (1),after purification by
column chromatography and crystallization.
The known preparation of the compound of formula (1)as described in example 7 of the above noted patent application
comprises,       essentially,   reacting    2-amino-N-[5-(3,5-difluoro-benzyl)-1H-indazol-3-yl]-4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)
benzamide       with   tetrahydro-pyran-4-one    in presence        of  trifluoroacetic acid    and   tetramethylammonium
triacetoxyborohydride to give the desired amide of formula (1),after purification by column chromatography.
In this respect, we have now surprisingly found that the compound of formula (1)can be advantageously prepared
through a process which allows obtaining the desired product in an industrially advantageous and highly reproducible
manner, with high purity, with characteristics suitable for administration to humans and at a reduced cost. Inaddition, the
new process is more suitable for application in large-scale production. Finally, said compound isobtained in defined solid
forms.

Therefore, it is a first aspect of the present invention a process for preparing the compound of formula (1)as defined
above,
which process comprises:
    a)adding in a stoichiometric manner the acyl chloride of formula (II):
                                                           CF
                                                                 30

     to the indazol-3-ylamine of formula (Ill):
                                                           N-NH
                                                    H2N N
                                                                       \F
                                                                F
    blocking the addition when the indazol-3-ylamine of formula (Ill) is completely reacted;
    b)deprotecting under mild basic conditions 100C the resulting compound of formula (IV):
                                                    CF
                                               O                  H

                                                                               F
                                                  N

    to obtain the desired compound of formula (1),which is isolated in amorphous form;
    the desired crystalline form isthen obtained either
    c1) treating the resultant amorphous compound of formula (1)with a mixture of ethanol and water in presence of
    seeds, to give the desired compound of formula (1)in crystalline form 1
    or
    c2) treating the resultant amorphous compound of formula (1)with a mixture of ethanol and water, to give the
    desired compound of formula (1)in crystalline form 2, and
    optionally
    d) converting the resultant compound obtained in step b), in step c1) or in step c2) into a pharmaceutically
    acceptable salt.

                                                             -4
The new procedure allows obtaining a compound of formula (1)with high purity without chromatographic purifications and
controlling the solid form.
Due to the order of addition and to the stoichiometric addition of the acyl derivative of formula (II) to the indazolylamine
derivative of formula (Ill), followed by an isolation work up with appropriate solvents mixture, the protected intermediate
of formula (IV) obtained in step a) is purer than in the previous process. As a matter of facts, this new procedure
considerably reduces the formation of impurities, such as for example the formation of undesired regioisomers and
products of double addition, thus avoiding the need to purify the so obtained product of formula (IV)by the use of
chromatography columns, not suitable for large-scale preparations because of the time and costs associated with this
procedure.
Furthermore, in step b), transforming the product of formula (IV)into the final product of formula (1),the mild deprotection
conditions consisting of low temperature aqueous hydrolysis with inorganic bases, prevent the by-products formation
observed in the previous procedure due to the high temperature treatment with organic bases in methanol.
Finally in step c1) or step c2) the compound of formula (1),obtained at first in an amorphous form, is then converted
respectively in crystalline form 1 by seeding or in crystalline form 2 by treatment with the appropriate solvents. In the
previous process at this point, the purity of the compound and the isolation procedures by insolubilization and/or by
chromatographic purification were such to prevent the conversion to either crystalline form 1 or crystalline form 2.
According to step a), the compound of formula (II) is suspended in solvents such as THFor DCM, preferably it is
suspended in dry DCM, and then the suspension is added slowly and gradually to a solution of the compound of formula
(Ill) in pyridine.
Preferably the reaction is carried out at a temperature between -200C and -400C, preferably operating at a temperature
between -30 C and -400 C.
At the reaction end, solvents are evaporated and the residue treated with solvents like DCM, MTBE, MeOH in a
predefined ratio between 1/1/1 and 30/30/1, preferably the treatment is made with ratios DCM/MTBE/MeOH between
8/8/1 and 30/30/1, to obtain the precipitation of a pure compound of formula (IV).
According to step b), the deprotection of the compound of formula (IV)may be carried out by mild basic conditions such
as aqueous or aqueous/methanolic alkaline carbonates or hydroxides, preferably a solution of K2 CO3 in water/methanol
is used.
Preferably the reaction is carried out at a temperature between 200C and 50C, preferably operating at about 100C.
The desired compound of formula (1)is then isolated in amorphous form by dropping into water, at a temperature
between 50 C and 250 C, preferably at a temperature between 50C and 100 C.
According to step c1) the amorphous compound of formula (1)is treated at first with ethanol heating to reflux and distilling
part of the solvent, then with water and crystalline form 1 seeds at a temperature between 100C and 300C, preferably at
a temperature between 200C and 250C. The obtained compound of formula (1)is in crystalline form 1.
According to step c2) the product obtained according to step b) is treated sequentially with ethanol, at a temperature
between 100C and 300C, preferably at a temperature between 200C and 250C, and then with water at a temperature
between 100C and 300C, preferably at a temperature between 200C and 250C. The obtained compound of formula (1)is
in crystalline form 2.

                                                               -5
The starting compounds and the reagents employed in the process of the present invention are known compounds or
can be obtained from known compounds using well known methods. In particular, the preparation of the compounds of
formula (II)and (Ill) as defined above is described in the above cited patent application.
No solid form, amorphous or crystal, is mentioned in example 2 (step i') and in example 7 of the above noted patent
application. The present inventors have studied and found that the compound of formula (1)prepared as described in
example 2 (step i') is a crystal solvate that hereinafter is referred to as crystalline form 3 for convenience; the compound
of formula (1)prepared as described in example 7 isamorphous and hereinafter is referred to as amorphous form.
Moreover, the present inventors have found that the compound of formula (1)prepared as described in example 1, step
b)of the present application is amorphous; the compound of formula (1)prepared as described in example 1, step c1) of
the present application is a crystal that hereinafter is referred to as crystalline form 1; finally the compound of formula (1)
prepared as described in example 1, step c2) of the present application is a crystal that hereinafter is referred to as
crystalline form 2.
Then, in a further aspect, the present invention relates to novel and stable crystalline forms of the compound of formula
(1),i.e. crystalline form 1 and crystalline form 2, prepared by the process described above.
Crystalline form 3 isa solvate with EtOAc and n-hexane and is not suitable for human administration due to the presence
of unacceptable amounts of solvents; the amorphous form is a hygroscopic solid, that is less suitable for development of
an oral formulation.
Moisture uptake is a significant concern for pharmaceutical powders. Moisture has been shown to have a significant
impact, for example, on the physical, chemical and manufacturing properties of drugs, excipients and formulations. It is
also a key factor in taking decisions related to packaging, storage, handling and shelf life and successful development
requires a sound understanding of hygroscopic properties.
For instance, conversion from an anhydrous to a hydrate form may be observed when the relative humidity exceeds a
critical level and moisture content rapidly increases in the solid. This has not only an impact on the physical and
pharmaceutical properties of the drug per se, but also on its biopharmaceutical perspective. Moreover, it is well known,
that hydrate forms usually tends to be less soluble with respect to a homologous anhydrous form, with potential
detrimental effect also on the dissolution rate properties of the active compound per se and on its absorption profile
through the gastrointestinal tract. At the same manner, conversion from an amorphous form to a crystalline form may be
observed in presence of humidity, with potential disadvantages in terms of physical stability. The amorphous active drug
substance, if deliquescent, can for instance absorb relatively large amounts of water from the atmosphere up to its
dissolution while also its chemical stability can be affected since the amorphous structure, being thermodynamically
activated, is more prone to chemical degradation and to chemical interaction with other chemical species. Thus the
performance and the efficacy of both formulation and active ingredient may be significantly changed.
Accordingly, there is a need in therapy of solid forms of the compound of formula (1)suitable for human administration
that do not contain unacceptable amounts of residual solvents and endowed with low hygroscopicity, as well as good
and reproducible biopharmaceutical properties for allowing a safer and efficacious oral administration.
The present inventors have solved the above-described technical problem by providing novel crystalline forms of the
compound of formula (1)being suitable for human administration and having improved physicochemical properties. In

                                                              -6
fact, the novel crystalline forms do not retain solvents and are less hygroscopic than the amorphous form, in addition to
possessing all the other advantages, in particular therapeutic advantages, exhibited by the known forms.

                       amorphous form
To     a suspension        of   4-(4-methylpiperazin-1 -yl)-2-[tetrahydro-2H-piran-4-yl(trifluoroacetyl)-amino]-benzoic    acid
trifluoroacetate (3.7 Kg, 7 mol) in dry DCM (36 L)and N,N-dimethylformamide (14 mL), oxalyl chloride (1.78 L,21 mol) is
added. The mixture is stirred for about 1.5 hours and evaporated to oily residue; dry DCM isthen added and evaporated
twice.
The acyl chloride of formula (II) issuspended in dry DCM and the suspension isadded slowly and gradually to a solution
of 5-(3,5-difluoro-benzyl)-1H-indazol-3-ylamine (1.6 Kg, 6.1 mol) in dry pyridine (16 L) at -40/-300C. The addition is
blocked when the 5-(3,5-difluoro-benzyl)-1H-indazol-3-ylamine is completely reacted. After about 1 hour the solvent is
evaporated and DCM (55 L), methanol (6.5 L), and MTBE (55 L) are sequentially added. The purified protected
compound of formula (IV)is filtered, washed with a mixture 10/10/1 of DCM/MTBE/MeOH and dried under vacuum (3.8
Kg).

2,2,2-trifluoro-acetyl)-amino]-benzamide, with HPLC purity > 95%, is dissolved in methanol and added with a solution of
K2CO3 in water/methanol at 100C. The solution is filtered and dropped into water; the precipitate amorphous N-[5-(3,5
difluorobenzyl)-1 H-indazol-3-yl]-4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-(tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylamino)-benzamide is filtered, washed
with water and dried under vacuum (2.88 Kg).
5.5 g of the dried amorphous N-[5-(3,5-difluorobenzyl)-1H-indazol-3-yl]-4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-(tetrahydro-pyran
4-ylamino)-benzamide are suspended in 130 mL of ethanol and heated to reflux for 10 minutes; about 70 mL of ethanol
are distilled before cooling to room temperature. 110 mL of water are added and the suspension is seeded with 55 mg of
crystalline form 1. The suspension isstirred for about 72 hours sampling to monitor conversion into crystalline crystalline
form 1 by DSC. The suspension isthen filtered and dried to give 4.3 g of the desired crystalline form 1.

Example 2: Analytical results by means of Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD)
The crystalline form 3, amorphous form, crystalline form 1 and crystalline form 2 of compound (1),were characterized by
powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD) performed using a Thermo/ARL XTRA apparatus, irradiating powder samples with a
CuKu source (45 kV, 40 mA, 1.8 kW - Kal radiation, wavelength k= 1.54060 Angstrom) between 20 and 400 2-theta at
room temperature.
The scan rate was of 1.20 0 /min (0.0200 step with count time of 1 seconds per step).
In the X-Ray diffractograms, the angles of diffraction 2-theta are plotted on the horizontal axis (x-axis) and the line
intensity on the vertical (y-axis).
In the paragraphs defining the X-ray powder diffraction peaks for the crystalline forms of compound of formula (1),the
term 'at about' is used in the expression '...at about 2-theta angles reported in table...' to indicate that the precise
positions of peaks (i.e. the recited 2-theta angle values) should not be considered as being absolute values because, as
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the precise position of the peaks may vary slightly between one machine
and another, from one sample to another, or as a result of slight variations in measurement conditions utilised.
It is also stated in the preceding paragraphs that the amorphous form and the crystalline forms of compound of formula
(1)provide X-ray powder diffraction patterns substantially the same as the X-ray powder diffraction patterns shown in
Figure 1,2, 3 and 4 and have substantially the most prominent peaks at the 2-theta angle values shown in tables 1,2, 3
and 4. It shall be appreciated that the use of the term 'substantially' in this context is also intended to indicate that the 2
theta angle values of the X-ray powder diffraction patterns may vary slightly from one machine to another, from one
sample to another, or as a result of slight variations in measurement conditions, so the peak positions shown in the
figures or quoted in the tables are again not to be as absolute values.
In this regard, it is known in the art that an X-ray powder diffraction pattern may be obtained which has one or more
measurement errors depending on measurement conditions (such as, for example, equipment and/or sample
preparation). In particular, it is generally known that intensities in an X-ray powder diffraction pattern may vary depending
on measurement conditions and sample preparation.
For example, persons skilled in the art of X-ray powder diffraction will realise that the relative intensity of peaks can be
affected by, for example, grains above 30 microns in size and non-unitary aspect ratios, which may affect analysis of
samples.
The skilled person will also realise that the position of reflections can be affected by the precise height at which the
sample sits in the diffractometer and the zero calibration of the diffractometer.
The surface planarity of the sample may also affect the result.
Hence a person skilled in the art will appreciate that the diffraction pattern data presented herein are not to be
considered as absolute (for further information see "Fundamentals of Powder Diffraction and Structural
Characterization", Pecharsky and Zavalij, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003). Therefore, it shall be understood that the
amorphous form and the crystalline forms of compound of formula (1)described in the present invention are not limited to

                                                             - 13
the amorphous and the crystals that provide X-ray powder diffraction patterns identical to the X-ray powder diffraction
patterns shown in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 and any sample or batch of amorphous form or crystalline forms of compound of
formula (1)providing X-ray powder diffraction patterns substantially the same as that shown in Figures 1,2, 3 and 4 fall
within the scope of the present invention. A person skilled in the art of X-ray powder diffraction is able to judge the
substantial identity of X-ray powder diffraction patterns.
Generally, a measurement error of a diffraction angle in an X-ray powder diffractogram isabout 2-theta = 0.5 deg or less
(or, more suitably, about 2-theta = 0.2 deg or less) and such degree of a measurement error should be taken into
account when considering the X-ray powder diffraction pattern in figures 1,2, 3, and 4 and when comparing the patterns
or interpreting the peak positions referred to both in the text and in tables 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Therefore, where it is stated, for example, that the crystalline forms of compound of formula (1),have an X-ray powder
diffraction pattern with at least one specific peak at about 2-theta = 20.1 deg (or any one of the other mentioned angles)
then this can be interpreted as being 2-theta = 20.1 deg plus or minus 0.5 deg, or 2-theta = 20.1 deg plus or minus 0.2
deg.
The X-ray diffraction diagrams of crystalline form 3, the amorphous form, crystalline form 1 and crystalline form 2 are
reported in Figure 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The X-ray diffraction peak positions of crystalline form 3, crystalline form 1
and crystalline form 2 are reported in tables 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

DSC analyses were carried out with a Mettler Toledo Star system apparatus. Aluminum DSC pans were loaded with 2-4
mg of sample. The temperature range of the analyses was between 250C and a maximum value of 3000C. The samples
were analyzed under nitrogen static condition at a heating rate of 100 C/min.
Figure 5 reports DSC thermograms of the amorphous form, crystalline form 1and crystalline form 2.
The observed melting endotherm for crystalline form 1 is at approximately in the range 1880C-196'C (peak
temperature) with Delta H in the range 54 - 64 J/g. The observed melting endotherm for crystalline form 2 is at
approximately in the range 1970C-198.50C (peak temperature) with Delta H in the range 72 - 78.5 J/g. It will be
understood that the onset and/or peak temperature values of the DSC may vary slightly from one apparatus to another,
one method to another or from one sample to another, and so the values quoted are not to be considered as absolute. In
fact, observed temperatures will depend on the rate of temperature change as well as sample preparation technique and
the particular instrument employed. It will be estimated and taken into account that the temperature values obtained
applying such different conditions may vary by plus or minus about 40 C.
 Example 4: analytical results by means of Dynamic Vapour Sorption (DVS)
The observed water uptake was investigated by submitting a sample of such substances to a hygroscopicity test by
means of a DVS 1000 (SMS). The apparatus is a "controlled atmosphere microbalance" where the weighed sample is
exposed to programmed variations of the relative humidity (RH) at a constant and controlled temperature. The measured
parameters (weight, time and RH), reported in Excel worksheets, allow obtaining hygroscopicity curves over the tested
RH range. For example, sorption/desorption cycles between 0% and 90% RH can be performed at controlled
temperature of 250C. Progressive variations of RH can be, for example, of 10% and 3% and are operated by the
software at the equilibration of the sample weight. This condition can be defined at a constant rate of percent weight
variation such as, for example, 0.005%/min.
Figure 6 reports the DVS profiles of the amorphous form, crystalline form 1 and crystalline form 2 of the compound of
formula (1).Relative Humidity (RH, %)values are reported on the x-axis while Change In Mass (%)is reported on the y
axis. The curves are related to the sorption step between 0%RH and 90%RH at 250 C.
The experimental results show that crystalline form 1 and crystalline form 2 of the compound (1)are respectively
characterized by water uptakes of 0.6% and 0.2% at 250 C/90%RH. Such water uptakes are reversible by lowering RH at
constant temperature of 250 C. The crystalline forms 1 and 2 of the compound (1) can be considered of low
hygroscopicity.
The experimental results also show that the amorphous form of the compound (1)is characterized by a water uptake of
2.5% at 250 C/90%RH that is reversible by lowering RH at constant temperature of 250 C. The amorphus form of the

compound (1)shows higher hygroscopicity than the crystalline forms 1 and 2. The water uptake of the amorphous form of
the compound (1)is higher than the crystalline forms 1 and 2. As a further aspect, the water uptake of the amorphus form
of the compound (1)is greater than 1%from RH values that are lower than 30%RH with a subsequent slope increase in
the region of high RH values.
Example 5: analytical results by means of Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
TGA analyses were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 apparatus. Aluminum DSC pans were loaded with 5 10 mg
of sample. The temperature range of the analyses was between 300 and a maximum value of about 2500C. The
samples were analyzed under nitrogen flow (to eliminate oxidative and pyrolitic effects) at a heating rate of 20 C/min.
Example 6: NMR analyses
The 1H NMR experiments were performed at a constant temperature of 280C, on a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer for
the crystalline form 3 sample (see Fig. 8) and at a constant temperature of 280C, on a Varian Inova 400 spectrometer for
the crystalline form 1 sample ( see Fig. 7). A small amount of each sample was dissolved in 0.75 mL of DMSO-d 6 and
transferred into a 5-mm NMR tube for subsequent analysis.
As the same 1H NMR spectrum is obtained from different crystalline forms, i.e. crystalline form 1 and 2 have the same 1H
NMR spectrum, only the spectrum of the crystalline form 1 is reported. The spectrum of crystalline form 3 is reported
only to show the presence of residual solvents whose signals are clearly distinguished from the signals of the product
and are highlighted by arrows in Figure 8.
