CROWD HAIR
 Description:
GrowHair is a unique formula which is delivered to the consumer in a foam pump bottle, the product is
applied to the scalp/hair which can then be used to style the hair while you watch the magic unfold over
the weeks as hair starts to thicken up and grow in places you thought you'd lost it.
This product will be a ground-breaking discovery for men and women across the world, curing
depression and baldness.
The reason I am applying for a innovative patent is because these chemicals both already exist to aid
hairloss, however I have produced them together in a easy to use foam which has no chemical smell and
can be used to style the hair.

GROWD HAIR
Claims:
GrowHair claims to regrow hair by using 2 main ingredients; Minoxidil (10%) & Finasteride (0.1%), we
have tested on 5 participents with great results and will be hitting the market with our product come
December,
The 2 listed ingredients is what we would like to patent in the mixed form, as Minoxidil regrows hair by
drawing blood to the area, and Finasteride reduces hair loss by neutralizing a hormone called DHT,
which is the cause of hair loss.
