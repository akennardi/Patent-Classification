   A train loading system for loading material onto cars of a
   train is disclosed.   The system comprises a material bin
 5 arranged to receive material to be loaded onto the train,
   a closure device arranged to facilitate control by an
   operator of the amount of material loaded into each car
   from the material bin, and a car mass estimator arranged
   to estimate the mass of material loaded into each car.
10 The system also comprises a display arranged to
   communicate to the operator the estimated mass of material
   loaded into each car.   A corresponding method is also
   disclosed.

                                 1
                      A TRAIN LOADING SYSTEM
   Field of the Invention
 5 The present invention relates to a train loading system
   for loading mined material onto a train at a mine
   operation.
   Background of the Invention
10
   It is known to provide a mine operation such as a mine
   site with a train loading facility arranged to facilitate
   loading of material onto dedicated material transport
   trains by train loadout operators.
15
   Typically, the cars of such trains have an associated
   overload mass limit that for safety reasons should not be
   exceeded, and train loadout operators are typically
   responsible for ensuring that the mass of each train car
20 is below the overload limit.
   However, the task of ensuring that each car mass is below
   the overload mass limit is not simple because the material
   tends to be loaded into the cars at high speed, and the
25 density of the material loaded into the cars is variable.
   In addition, each car is typically weighed when the car
   has moved away from the material flow, for example 4 car
   lengths away.  As a consequence, the mass of material in a
   car can vary significantly and a car overload situation
30 may not be detected until several more cars have been
   filled.
   When a car mass overload is detected, it is necessary to
   stop the train loading process in order that the excess
35 material in the car can be removed, but this causes undue
   delays.

                                2
   In order to reduce the likelihood of stoppages during the
   train loading process, operators tend to load the train
   cars conservatively, and while the likelihood of train
   stoppages is much reduced as a result, a consequence is
 5 that at least some of the train cars are loaded
   significantly under the mass overload limit, and this
   equates to a significant loss of production.

   Description of an Embodiment of the Invention
   An embodiment of a train loading system will now be
30 described with reference to mine operations in the form of
   mine sites, although it will be understood that other mine
   operations wherein train loading operations occur are
   envisaged.
35 An example conceptual diagram illustrating a train loading
   facility 10 is shown in Figure 1.

                                  7
   The train loading facility 10 includes a train loading
   system 11 arranged to load a train 12 with material, in
   this example ore derived from one or more mine sites.
 5 Each train 12 includes a plurality of cars 14 and at least
   one, and typically three  (3),   locomotives 16.  Material to
   be disposed in the cars 14 is transported to the train
   loading facility 10 using a conveyor 18 that delivers the
   material to a material bin 20.     In this example, the
10 material bin 20 is of a type arranged to hold about 2000
   tonnes, although it will be understood that other types of
   material bin are possible.
   The bin 20 is associated with a closure device, in this
15 example in the form of a clam 22,    that is controllable
   using a closure control device 24.     In this example, the
   closure control device 24 is arranged to automatically
   open the clam 22 when a car 14 arrives under the clam 22,
   and to automatically close the clam 22 before the car
20 moves away from the clam 22.     The closure control device
   24 in this example uses signals from train location
   sensors 33 to synchronise opening and closing of the clam
   22 with movement of the train 12.     The closure control
   device 24 is also arranged such that the amount of
25 material delivered to a car 14 is manually adjustable by
   an operator by enabling the operator to open or close the
   clam 22 early, or override automatic opening of the clam
   22 in response to the position of the car and allow the
   operator to open or close the clam late, that is, after
30 the clam 22 is intended to automatically open or close in
   response to the position of the car determined by the
   train location sensors 33.
   The train loading system 11 also includes a dust filter
35 26, a moisture analyser 34 and a car weigher 28 arranged
   to weigh each train car 14 as the train car 14 passes.
   The car weigher 28 is disposed a sufficient distance away

                                 8
   from the bin 20 so as to avoid undue interference caused
   by material loading, in this example a distance equivalent
   to 4 cars away from the bin 20.
 5 The train loading system 11 also includes a weightometer
   30 arranged to weigh material on the conveyor 18 as the
   material is transported on the conveyor 18 to the bin 20.
   In this example, the weightometer 30 produces a mass value
   indicative of the mass flow rate of material that passes
10 over the weightometer 30.
   The train loading system 11 also includes at least one bin
   mass sensor 32, in this example arranged to measure a
   change in mass of the bin 20 as a result of differences
15 between the mass of material flowing into the bin 20 and
   material flowing out of the bin 20.
   Using the mass value produced by the weightometer 30, the
   speed of the conveyor 18, and a mass change value produced
20 by the bin mass sensor(s) 32,   the train loading system 11
   calculates an estimated mass value indicative of an
   estimate of the mass of material that has been loaded into
   each car 14 and stores the estimated mass values.
25 In conventional train loading in a mine operation, a train
   arrives at a train loading facility and a clam associated
   with a loading bin opens as a train car arrives under the
   clam to commence loading.   The train then continues to
   move slowly relative to the clam until an end of the car
30 is disposed under the clam.   When this occurs, the clam
   automatically closes.
   Typically, a car weigher is provided at least 4 cars ahead
   to weigh the loaded car.
35
   As the car moves under the clam and material is added to
   the car, the operator is able to modify the amount of

                                 9
   material in the car by causing the clam 22 to open before
   the clam 22 is set to automatically open in response to
   the position of the car, and/or by closing the clam 22
   before the clam 22 is automatically closed in response to
 5 the position of the car 14.   The operator may also be able
   to override automatic operation of the clam by opening the
   clam 22 after the clam is intended to automatically open
   in response to the position of the car 14,  and/or closing
   the clam 22 after the clam is intended to automatically
10 close in response to the position of the car 14.
   The operator controls the clam in this way based on past
   experience and previous car masses measured by the car
   weigher.   If previous car masses have been relatively
15 high, the tendency of the operator is to be cautious and
   fill the cars at a relatively low level.
   Graphs illustrating first and second examples of loading
   performance of a conventional train loading facility are
20 shown in Figures 2 and 3.   The graphs include car mass
   values 40,  48 indicative of actual mass values of train
   cars measured by the car weigher, an overload probability
   plot 42,  50 indicative of the calculated probability of
   overload based on the variability of the car mass values
25 40, 48,  and an aim mass plot 44, 52 indicative of a
   relatively safe mass that the operator should have aimed
   for in order for the likelihood of a car mass overload to
   be statistically small, in this example a probability of
   0.01.   Arrows 46, 54 illustrate the aim overload
30 probability, in this example 0.01
   For each of the graphs shown in Figures 2 and 3, the
   defined car overload mass is 120 tonnes.
35 It is apparent from Figure 2 that the average car mass was
   too high for the illustrated sample of car mass values 40,
   and in particular in view of the standard deviation of the

                                        10
   car mass values 40.    The car mass values 40 shown in
   Figure 2 have a relatively large standard deviation and
   therefore a relatively high degree of variability.            As a
   consequence, in order to reduce the likelihood of
 5 overloads, a more conservative average car mass was
   required to be selected by a train loading operator in
   order to provide a relatively low likelihood of car
   overload.    This is illustrated by the aim mass plot 44
   which shows an aim car mass that is generally lower than
10 the car mass values 40, and the overload probability plot
   42 which illustrates that the overload probability has
   significantly increased beyond the defined acceptable
   overload probability limit 0.01.
15 It is apparent from Figure 3 that the average car mass was
   too low for the illustrated sample of car mass values 48,
   and in particular in view of the standard deviation of the
   car mass values 48.    The car mass values 48 shown in
   Figure 3 have a relatively small standard deviation and
20 therefore a relatively low degree of variability.            As a
   consequence, a higher average car mass could have been
   selected after   about the    7 5 th  car whilst still   maintaining
   a relatively low likelihood of overload.             This is
   illustrated by the aim mass plot 52 which shows an aim car
25 mass after   about the 7 5 th  car that is    generally higher than
   the car mass values 48, and the overload probability plot
   50 which illustrates that the overload probability has
   decreased significantly below the defined acceptable
   overload probability limit 0.01.          With the example shown
30 in Figure 3, approximately 380 tonnes could have been
   loaded into the train cars without increasing the
   probability of overload beyond the target level 0.01.
   It will be appreciated that the variability of the car
35 mass values, in this example represented by the standard
   deviation, has a significant effect on the probability of
   occurrence of an overload.          This is because a larger

                                11
   standard deviation corresponds to a greater variation of
   car mass values, and therefore for a given average car
   mass value more car mass values above the overload mass
   level.  It therefore follows that for car mass values that
 5 have a relatively large standard deviation, the desired
   average car mass, that is the aim car mass,  should be
   reduced in order that the likely number of car mass values
   above the overload mass is maintained relatively low, and
   for car mass values that have a relatively small standard
10 deviation, the desired average car mass, that is the aim
   car mass, should be increased in order that a more optimum
   level of material is loaded into a car whilst still
   maintaining the likely number of car mass values above the
   overload mass relatively low.   Accordingly, by
15 appropriately selecting the aim car mass in view of the
   standard deviation of recent car mass values, the mass of
   material loaded into a train can be increased without
   unduly affecting the probability of train overloads.
20 Referring to Figure 4, a block diagram 60 of the train
   loading system 11 is shown.   The train loading system
   includes a control unit 62 for controlling and
   coordinating operations in the train loading system, and a
   display 64 for displaying train loading information to an
25 operator during a train loading operation.
   The control unit 62 may include associated data storage 63
   and memory necessary for storing data and/or programs
   usable by the control unit 62 to implement desired
30 functionality.  In this example, the control unit 62 is
   arranged to control automatic opening and closing of the
   clam 22 in response to signals received from the train
   position sensors 33; to facilitate manual opening and/or
   closing of the  clam 22 by an operator so as to modify the
35 total amount of material in a car 14;  to store car mass
   values produced by the car weigher 28 and calculate a mass
   variability value indicative of the variability of the

                                 12
   measured car mass values, in this example in the form of a
   standard deviation of the measured car mass values;   to
   calculate estimated mass values for each car 14 based on
   the conveyor weightometer 34,   conveyor speed 35 and the
 5 bin level sensors 32; to calculate an estimated aim set
   point indicative of a suggested average car mass that a
   train loading operator should aim for in order to maintain
   an overload probability at a defined level, in this
   example 0.01, whilst achieving a relatively high car mass;
10 and to control display of train loading information on the
   display 64.
   Functional components 65 implemented by the train loading
   system, in this example using the control unit 62 are
15 shown in Figure 5.  The functional components 65 include a
   car mass estimator 66 arranged to calculate the estimated
   mass value for each car 14 based on the conveyor
   weightometer 34 and the bin level sensors 32;   an aim set
   point estimator 68 arranged to calculate an aim set point
20 indicative of a suggested average car mass that a train
   loading operator should aim for in order to maintain an
   overload probability at a defined level; a data plotter 70
   arranged to control display of the train loading
   information on the display 64; and a reliability
25 calculator 72 arranged to calculate a reliability value
   based on the degree of correlation between the measured
   car mass values and the corresponding estimated car mass
   values.
30 The aim set point is calculated in this example by the aim
   set point estimator 68 which determines a variability
   value indicative of the variability of the measured car
   values, in this example the standard deviation of the
   measured car mass values and estimated car mass values,
35 and uses the variability value with a defined probability
   of occurrence of an overload to determine a car set point
   mass value to be used by an operator as a target car mass.

                                13
   Railcar masses tend to approximate a normal distribution,
   and as such a 1% probability of exceeding a defined value
   occurs at a value equal to the mean value of the mass
 5 values plus 2.33o, where o is the standard deviation of
   the mass values.  Accordingly, for mass values that have
   high variability, the average railcar mass must be lower
   than for mass values that have low variability, in order
   to maintain the same 1% probability of overload.   By
10 calculating the standard deviation of the measured and
   estimated mass values, and defining a desired probability
   that corresponds to a defined overload mass, an average
   mass value can be calculated that is appropriate to use as
   the aim mass value.
15
   As shown in Figure 6, the train loading information
   displayed to an operator includes a full train graph 76
   and a recent cars graph 78.   Each of the graphs includes
   an estimated mass values plot 80 indicative of the
20 estimated mass values for each car 14,  an aim set point
   plot 84, and a car overload level 86.   Also displayed on
   the recent cars graph 78 are measured values 82 for each
   car 14.  In this example, the recent cars graph 78 shows
   information for the last 20 cars of a train.
25
   The train loading information may also include a
   reliability indicator 88  (not shown) used to communicate
   the reliability value to the operator.
30 It will be appreciated that the estimated mass values plot
   80 is 4 cars ahead of the measured mass values 82 because
   the car weigher 28 is 4 cars ahead of the bin 20 and
   associated clam 22.
35 It will be understood that by using the displayed train
   loading information an operator is able to obtain an
   indication as to how close the recent actual car masses

                                14
   are to the aim car mass, the reliability of the displayed
   estimated masses, and thereby whether the operator can
   confidently increase the amount of material loaded into a
   car to a level closer to the aim car mass, or whether the
 5 operator should reduce the amount of material loaded into
   a car to a level closer to the aim car mass so as to
   reduce the likelihood of an overload.
   Functional components of the car mass estimator 66 are
10 shown in Figure 7.  In this example, the functional
   components 66 include a conveyor model 90 arranged to
   calculate a mass value indicative of the mass that is
   added to the bin 20 by the conveyor 18 based on the mass
   data provided by the weightometer 30.
15
   The functional components 66 also include processing
   components 92 arranged to process bin level information
   from the bin level sensors 32 in order to produce a
   processed bin level value indicative of a mass change of
20 the bin 20 as material is loaded into the bin 20 and
   material is removed from the bin 20 during loading.   The
   processing components 92 are arranged to at least
   partially compensate for interference to bin level
   measurement caused by rapid movement of large quantities
25 of material, and movement of the trains 12 adjacent the
   bin 20.
   Using the mass value indicative of the mass added to the
   bin 20 and the processed bin level value indicative of the
30 bin mass change, an estimated car mass value 94 is
   produced that is stored and shown on the display 64.
   The estimated car mass value is equal to the mass of ore
   delivered to the bin while the car is present minus the
35 change in bin mass during this time.
   An example algorithm for calculating an estimated value

                                15
   for the mass added to the bin 20 is shown in Figure 8.
   The algorithm includes applying a first saturation filter
   104 to the mass flow rate value received from the
 5 weightometer 30 to remove spurious values from the mass
   flow rate, and applying a second saturation filter 106 to
   the belt speed 100 to remove spurious values from the belt
   speed 100.
10 A divider 108 divides the mass flow rate produced by the
   weightometer 30 by the belt speed 100 to produce a mass
   value indicative of the mass per metre on the conveyor 18.
   A divider 110 divides the distance between the
   weightometer 30 and the bin 20 by the belt speed 100 to
15 produce a time value indicative of the amount of time
   taken for the mass of material on the weightometer 30 to
   reach the bin 20.  Essentially, the distance between the
   weightometer 30 and the bin 20 is treated as a series of
   consecutive material portions with each portion having an
20 associated mass per metre value associated with it.
   A delay component 112 applies the calculated delay to the
   mass per metre value, and a multiplier 114 multiplies the
   delayed mass per metre value by the belt speed 100 to
25 produce an estimated value for the mass added to the bin
   20.
   As shown in Figure 5, the functional components also
   include an overload controller 74 that in this example is
30 implemented by the control unit 62.  However, as an
   alternative it will be understood that the overload
   controller 74 may be implemented by a separate component
   to the control unit 62.
35 The overload controller 74 is arranged to cause the clam
   22 to close before a signal to close the clam 22 is
   received from the train position sensors 33, if the

                                16
   current mass of the car 14 estimated using the conveyor
   weightometer 34 and the bin level sensors 32 indicates
   that the car 14 is likely to overload.
 5 In the present example, as shown in Figure 9, the overload
   controller 74 is arranged to cause the clam 22 to close
   when the estimated mass reaches 110 tonnes.
   A train loading mass graph 120 is shown in Figure 10.   The
10 graph 120 shows an overload mass level 122,  in this
   example set at 123 tonnes, and includes several plots 124,
   126, 128 of estimated car mass over time.   As shown, a
   first plot 124 indicates a car mass that increases to a
   relatively low but acceptable final car mass of about 118
15 tonnes, second plots 126 indicate car masses that increase
   to acceptable final car masses of about 122 and 123 tonnes
   respectively, and third plots 128 indicate car masses that
   are increasing too quickly and have reached the overload
   limit 122 after only 85% of the full travel distance of a
20 car during loading.  When the overload mass level 122 is
   reached, the overload controller 74 causes the clam 22 to
   close.  In the present example, this equates to closing
   the clam 22 1.5 seconds early.
25 With this example, a digital filter algorithm that has a
   time constant of about 3.2s and a gain of 1.2 is applied
   to an instantaneous car mass value by the overload
   controller to filter out any spurious values, and when the
   filtered signal reached about 123 tonnes, the clam 22 is
30 caused to close.
   It will be appreciated that by providing an overload
   controller 74 arranged to intervene if a car is expected
   to overload, in effect the normal distribution of loaded
35 car masses centered around the aim car mass is skewed
   towards higher car masses whilst providing a very low
   probability of occurrence of an overloaded car.   In other

                                17
   words, providing an overload controller has the effect of
   automatically increasing the aim car mass if the overload
   controller is successful because preventing car overloads
   from occurring has the effect of causing the standard
 5 deviation to reduce.  The system is also self-correcting
   in that if an overload situation occurs, the aim car mass
   is not increased.
   It will also be appreciated that providing an overload
10 controller 74 provides a high probability that the train
   loading system will fail well in that car overloads are
   prevented from occurring even if the decision made by the
   operator in relation to opening or closing of the clam is
   incorrect, because in an overload situation the clam 22 is
15 closed prematurely by the overload controller 74.
   It will also be appreciated that although actual car
   masses are not known until 4 cars later, by providing and
   displaying estimated car masses useful loading information
20 can be communicated to the operator which can be used by
   the operator when making decisions in relation to loading
   of subsequent cars.  The displayed loading information and
   in particular the overload controller are particularly
   useful for loading the first 4 cars because no historical
25 actual mass data is available.
   At least the control unit 62 may be implemented using
   appropriate hardware, for example a personal computing
   type architecture or using a programmable logic controller
30  (PLC).
   A flow diagram 130 illustrating steps 132 to 148 of a
   example method of loading a train is shown in Figure 11,
   and a flow diagram illustrating steps 152 to 170 of an
35 example method of assisting an operator to load a train
   car according to the method of Figure 11 is shown in
   Figure 12.

                                18
   During use, when a train 12 arrives 132 at the train
   loading facility 10, the train 12 is caused to move slowly
   relative to the train loading system 11 so that material
 5 such as ore can be controllably loaded onto cars 14 of the
   train 12.
   For the first 4 cars 14, that is,  until the first car 14
   reaches the car weigher 28, the operator monitors the cars
10 14 and has manual control of the clam 22.   The system then
   calculates and displays car mass estimate values 136, and
   the operator views 138 the displayed car mass estimates,
   and adjusts automatic clam opening and closing settings
   using the estimated values with a view to preventing car
15 mass overloading. The operator then activates automatic
   control 140.
   During automatic control mode, in response to signals
   provided by the train position sensors 33, the clam is
20 caused to automatically open 142 as the train 12 reaches a
   defined location relative to the clam 22,  which causes
   material in the bin 20 to flow into the car 14.
   As material is loaded into a car 14, the mass of material
25 in the car 14 is estimated 152,  stored 154 and displayed
   156.  When the cars reach the car weigher 28,  the actual
   mass of material in the cars is then measured and stored
   160 and a variability value, in this example a standard
   deviation, is calculated 162 based on the measured car
30 mass values and the estimated car mass values.   The
   variability value is used with a defined overload
   probability value to calculate 164 the aim mass set point
   indicative of a suggested average car mass that a train
   loading operator should aim for.   A reliability value is
35 also calculated 166 based on the estimated mass values and
   the measured mass values, and the car mass values 82, the
   aim mass set point 84 and a reliability indicator 88 are

                                19
   displayed 168 to an operator as train loading information.
   The operator views 143 the train loading information shown
   on the display, and makes a decision 138 using the train
 5 loading information as to whether the clam should be
   opened late and/or early and/or closed late and/or early
   in order to maintain a relatively high car mass whilst
   maintaining a low probability of car overload, for example
   that is less than the defined amount 0.01.
10
   If the operator does not intervene to close the clam 22
   early, but the car reaches an auto close position, the
   clam is caused to automatically close 144, 148.
15 Notwithstanding that the operator has used the displayed
   train loading information to control the amount of
   material flowing into a car 14, if the overload controller
   74 nevertheless determines 146 that the car 14 is likely
   to overload before automatic closure of the clam 22, the
20 overload controller 74 intervenes, overrides the automatic
   clam control process and causes the clam 22 to close
   prematurely 148, thereby preventing a car overload from
   occurring.
25 Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a
   skilled addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the
   present invention.
