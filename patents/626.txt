   RELATED APPLICATION
 5              This application is a divisional application of
   standard patent application 2014305639 and the disclosure

10 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
                The present invention relates to an assembly for
   generating electricity.
15 DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART
                International publication WO00/23708 in the name of
   the applicant discloses an invention of a water-driven
   assembly for generating electricity.                    The assembly takes
20 advantage of energy of water flowing in a vortex, with the
   energy being the result of a combination of factors
   including the Coriolis force from the rotation of the
   Earth.                This energy, which can be described as rotational
   kinetic energy, is different to energy generated by the
25 fall of water.
                The applicant has carried out substantial research and
   development work in relation to the invention.
30              Part of this work has focused on developing an
   assembly that takes advantage of the Coriolis force that
   can be manufactured and transported and installed
   effectively and efficiently in or beside a wide range of
   bodies of water and can operate for long periods of time
35 with minimal maintenance.

                In addition, part of this work has focused on
   developing an assembly taking advantage of the Coriolis
   force that can operate in applications requiring relatively
   small amounts of electricity.

   SUMMARY OF INVENTION
                The present invention, which is described by the
   applicant as the KCT Mark 2 invention, provides an assembly
10 for generating electricity that is adapted to be positioned
   in fluid communication with a flowing stream of a fluid,
   such as water.
                The fluid may be any suitable fluid.        Water is
15 mentioned above as an example of a suitable fluid.                 Other
   suitable fluids include, by way of example, slurries,
   wastewater, seawater, sewerage, and mud. The following
   description of the invention focuses on water. It is
   emphasised that the water is an example only and the
20 invention extends to fluids generally.
                The water may be flowing in a pipe or water in a body
   of water or beside a body of water.
25              The assembly includes a chamber having a base, a side
   wall extending from the base, a water inlet, and a water
   outlet, a rotor unit having a shaft and a rotor mounted to
   the shaft located in               and rotatable in the chamber in
   response to water flow through the chamber,               and an
30 electrical generator coupled to the rotor unit for
   generating electricity in response to rotation of the
   rotor.
                The dimensions of the inlet, the outlet and the
35 chamber and the positions of the inlet, the outlet and the
   rotor are selected to promote the formation of a vortex
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                       -3
   within the chamber when in use the assembly is located in
   fluid communication with a flowing stream of the fluid,
   such as water flowing in a pipe or a body of water or
   beside a body of water and there is a flow of water through
 5 the chamber from the inlet to the outlet.
                The assembly takes advantage of energy of water
   flowing in the vortex, with the energy being the result of
   a combination of factors including the Coriolis force from
10 the rotation of the Earth.
                The chamber may be completely enclosed, i.e. not open
   to the air.
15              The chamber may be open to the air.
                The flowing stream of water may be water flowing
   through the pipe for supplying water to a house, apartment
   or other types of buildings, including manufacturing
20 plants, such as processing plants, such as water treatment
   plants.
                In this application, in use, the assembly is adapted
   to generate relatively small amounts of electrical power
25  (for example, in a range between 0.1 and 5W).
                In addition, in this application, in use, the assembly
   is adapted to generate electricity to operate a device that
   is directly associated with or indirectly associated with
30 the flowing stream of water in the water pipe and can
   operate for long periods of time with minimal maintenance.
                The device may be a water meter.  The device may be a
   battery charger for a water meter.
35
                In this context, one use of the assembly is to provide
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                       -4
   electrical energy to a water meter, such as smart metering
   device, water that, in use is supplied to the house,
   apartment or other types of buildings, including
   manufacturing plants, such as processing plants, such as
 5 water treatment plants.
                The assembly can be installed as part of the
   installation of a water meter, such as a smart metering
   device.
10
                The assembly can be retrofitted to the same pipe on
   which a water meter, such as a smart metering device, is
   located and charge the battery for that water meter.
15              In this context, a "smart metering device" is
   understood herein to be a device that is installed onto a
   water pipe to measure the flowrate of the water through
   that water pipe. The device then records and uploads usage
   information to a water supplier via a wireless network or
20 otherwise and is processed as required.
                The device may be a battery charger for a gas meter.
   Therefore, another use for the assembly is to charge the
   battery for a gas meter for gas pipes supplying gas to a
25 house, apartment or other types of buildings, including
   manufacturing plants, such as processing plants, such as
   water treatment plants.
                The device may be a battery charger for other powered
30 devices proximate to the assembly or the device may be
   these other powered devices. Therefore, another use for the
   assembly is to charge the other powered devices directly or
   via the battery charger.
35              The body of water may be any one or more than one of a
   lake, dam, river, stream, creek, canal, and any other water
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                                    -5
   way.
                The assembly is straightforward to manufacture,
   transport and install.                       The chamber and the other
 5 components of the assembly can be made from any suitable
   materials.                       The assembly is an uncomplicated design that is
   robust and reliable and requires low maintenance.
                The assembly may be adapted to be connected to a water
10 pipe so that water flows through the assembly and, in
   effect, the assembly is part of the water connection to a
   house, apartment or other types of building or pipes
   leading to installations of machinery, e.g. water treatment
   plants.
15
                The assembly may be adapted to be a free-standing unit
   within a body of water or beside a body of water, in a
   waterway or beside a waterway, within an enclosed water
   conduit or beside an enclosed water conduit.
20
                The assembly may be adapted to be transported as a
   unit from a manufacturing site to an end-use location.
                The assembly may be any suitable size depending on a
25 range of factors including but not limited to the body of
   water in which the assembly is to be located or placed
   beside and the electrical power requirements for the
   assembly.
30              One, although not the only feature of the assembly,
   which is linked in part to the way in which the assembly is
   powered by water flow, is that a number of the assemblies
   can be positioned in a waterway or beside a waterway, such
   as a river, a canal or a pipe, along the length of a
35 section of the waterway and/or across a width of the
   waterway with minimum impact on the flow of water along the
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                                   -6
   waterway.                      Therefore, a single relatively small unit that
   can be manufactured at a manufacturing site and then
   transported without significant issues from the
   manufacturing site to an end use location can be used in
 5 small scale operations, and a plurality of the same size
   assemblies can be used for larger-scale operations without
   creating issues for water flow in the waterway.
                The dimensions of the inlet, the outlet and the
10 chamber and the positions of the inlet, the outlet and the
   rotor may be selected to promote the formation of a vortex
   within the chamber that is in the form of multiple spirals
   of water down the height of the chamber between the inlet
   and the outlet.
15
                There does not need to be a substantial flow rate of
   water in the body of water for the assembly to be able to
   generate electricity.                      The invention relies on the
   formation of a vortex within the chamber.                       Vortex formation
20 requires water flow through the chamber and a chamber
   structure that promotes the formation of the vortex.                       When
   the vortex is formed, the energy that can be extracted from
   the vortex movement is related to the mass of water moving
   in the vortex in the chamber and not simply to the flow
25 rate of water into and from the chamber.
                The assembly can operate effectively across the
   spectrum of flow rates of water in the water pipe or in the
   body of water from substantially no flow to high flow
30 rates.
                In a start-up phase of the assembly, with the chamber
   initially empty or full and control valves for the inlet
   and the outlet selectively opened so that the water level
35 in the chamber builds up or flows out to a point where a
   vortex forms in the chamber.                       The vortex is indicated by a
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                                    -7
   conical air space within the chamber that extends
   downwardly to the outlet, with the water in the chamber
   flowing in one or multiple spirals of water down the height
   of the chamber between the inlet and the outlet.                       Once
 5 there is a stable vortex in the chamber, the control valves
   are adjusted as required.
                The side wall may have a cylindrical internal surface
   to promote the formation of the vortex in the chamber.
10
                The chamber may include formations, such as vanes
   and/or baffles, to promote the formation of the vortex in
   the chamber.                       The formations may be supported by or be part
   of the side wall and/or the base.
15
                The assembly may include a structure that is adapted
   to support and locate the assembly in fluid communication
   with the flowing stream of water.
20              For example, the structure may be water inlet and
   water outlet fittings that can connect the assembly to a
   water pipe.
                The structure may be adapted to support and locate the
25 assembly in the body of water or on the ground or in the
   ground beside the body of water.
                The support structure may include a plurality of
   members such as legs that, in use of the assembly, extend
30 downwardly from the base and are adapted to locate the
   assembly on the bed of the body of water or on the ground
   or in the ground beside the body of water.
                The support structure may include a framework that is
35 adapted to support other components of the assembly.
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                       -8
                The framework may be formed to cradle the base and the
   side wall of the chamber.
                The framework may include a plurality of members
 5 beneath the base or on the side of the chamber to support
   the chamber
                The rotor unit may be positioned so that the shaft is
   located centrally in the chamber.
10
                The rotor may include a plurality of vanes extending
   radially outwardly from the shaft towards the side wall.
                The vanes may be curved vanes. The vanes may be any
15 other suitable profile.
                Each vane may sweep rearwardly from an inner edge that
   is connected to the shaft and an outer edge.
20              The vanes may be concave when viewed in a direction of
   water flow within the chamber.
                The inlet and/or the outlet may include a flow control
   valve to control the flow of water into the chamber via the
25 inlet or out the chamber via the outlet.
                The inlet may be in the side wall.
                The inlet may be at any suitable height of the side
30 wall to promote the formation of the vortex in the chamber
   when water flows into the chamber via the inlet.
                For example, depending on the circumstances, the inlet
   may be in an upper section of the side wall, a central
35 section of the side wall or a lower section of the side
   wall.
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                                   -9
                The inlet and the vanes may be positioned relative to
   each other so that, in use, at least a part of the water
   flowing into the chamber from the inlet flows directly
 5 towards the vanes.
                The inlet             may be formed in relation to the chamber to
   promote the formation of the vortex in                      the chamber when
   water flows into the chamber via the inlet.
10
                The inlet             may be formed to supply water into the
   chamber so that the water flows in a spiral pathway within
   the chamber around the central shaft and downwardly to the
   outlet in                   the base of the chamber
15
                The inlet may be formed to supply water into the
   chamber at an inward angle of up to 100.
                The inlet may be formed to supply water into the
20 chamber at an inward angle of 70.
                The inlet may include an inlet pipe for supplying
   water into the chamber.
25              The inlet pipe may have a straight section.
                The inlet may include an inlet funnel to maximise the
   flow of water into the chamber from the waterway or body of
   water and the flow of water drawn into the chamber by the
30 vortex.
                The assembly may include a plurality of inlets.
                The plurality of inlets may be at the same height of
35 the chamber and spaced around the perimeter of the chamber.

                                       -10
                The plurality of inlets may be at a number of
   different heights of the chamber.
                The outlet may include a flow control valve to control
 5 the flow of water from the outlet.
                The outlet may be in the base.
                The outlet may be positioned in a central part of the
10 base.
                The outlet may include an outlet funnel positioned
   within the chamber.
15              The shape and size of the outlet funnel may be
   selected to promote and stabilize the formation of the
   vortex within the chamber.            In particular, the outlet
   funnel may be a shallow funnel, typically having an angle
   of less than 200, typically 5-150, to a horizontal axis
20 when the assembly is in an upright position in order to
   form the vortex as a stable vortex that does not move
   around within the chamber after it has been established.
                The outlet may include an outlet pipe that extends
25 from the chamber.
                The outlet pipe may include a first section that
   extends downwardly from the base and a second section that
   extends perpendicular to the first section.
30
                The inlet and the outlet may describe an angle of 135
   1800 when viewed from above the assembly.
                The outlet pipe may be formed so that water flow
35 through the outlet and the outlet pipe minimises disruption
   to the vortex in the chamber.

                                            -11
                By way of example, the outlet pipe may include a
   rifled internal surface, i.e. a surface with a series of
   spiral ridges in the internal surface.
 5
                The transverse cross-sectional area of the outlet may
   be greater than the transverse cross-sectional area of the
   inlet.                This is an important feature when the assembly is
   used in waterways having sufficiently high flow rates that
10 in effect contribute a load to the system that results in a
   pumping action of water from the chamber via the outlet.
   In a pilot plant operation of the applicant located in a
   waterway that was a fast-flowing waterway at different
   times, the pilot plant assembly had a 300mm diameter inlet
15 and a 400mm diameter outlet to avoid overflow situations in
   the chamber at high water flow rate times.                In addition,
   the pilot plant operation found that when the assembly was
   placed under electrical load, this also results in a
   pumping action of water from the chamber via the outlet,
20 thereby increasing the outflow.
                The chamber may be any suitable size.
                In any application, the size, i.e. width and height,
25 of the chamber is a function of a number of parameters
   including the volumetric flow rate through the water pipe,
   the diameter of the pipe, and the required electricity
   output.
30              In the water pipe application, in some applications
   considered by the applicant, and taking the above
   parameters into account, the assembly may have a maximum
   width of 20 cm and typically a maximum width of 10 cm.                 It
   is noted that the width may be different in different
35 applications.

                In larger scale applications, the chamber may have a
   maximum width of less than 30 meters.
                In a situation in which the side wall has a
 5 cylindrical inner surface, the maximum width is the
   diameter of the chamber.
                The maximum width of the chamber may be 25 meters.
10              The maximum width of the chamber may be 20 meters.
                The maximum width of the chamber may be 15 meters.
                The maximum width of the chamber may be 10 meters.
15
                The maximum width of the chamber may be 5 meters.
                The maximum width of the chamber may be greater than
   0.5 meters.
20
                The maximum width of the chamber may be greater than
   0.1 meters.
                The maximum width of the chamber may be greater than
25 0.01 meters.
                In the water pipe application, the assembly may have a
   maximum height of 15 cm and typically a maximum height of
   10 cm.
30
                In larger scale applications, the chamber may have a
   maximum height of 10 meters.
                The chamber may have a maximum height of 5 meters.

                The chamber may have a maximum height of 1 meter.

20 DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT
                The embodiments of the electricity generation assembly
   3 shown in the Figures are two of a number of possible
   embodiments of the invention.
25
                The embodiments are described in the context of water
   being a working fluid.             However, it is noted that the
   invention is not confined to water as the fluid.
30              The first embodiment described in relation to Figures
   1-14 is adapted to be positioned in a body of water or
   beside a body of water as a free-standing unit.
                The second embodiment described in relation to Figures
35 15-21 is adapted to be connected to a water pipe for
   supplying water to a house, apartment or other types of
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                              -19
   buildings, including manufacturing plants, such as
   processing plants, such as water treatment plants, to
   generate electricity for charging a battery of a water
   meter for the water pipe.
 5
                With reference to Figures 1-14, the assembly 3
   includes a chamber 5 having a base 7, a cylindrical side
   wall 13                 (having a cylindrical internal surface) extending
   upwardly from the base 7, an inlet 15 in the side wall 13,
10 an outlet 17 in the base 7, a rotor unit having a shaft 19
   and a rotor 21 mounted to the shaft 19 and located in and
   rotatable within the chamber 5 in response to water flow
   through the chamber 5, and an electrical generator 25
   coupled to the rotor unit for generating electricity in
15 response to rotation of the rotor unit.
                The assembly 3 is open to the atmosphere.
                The assembly 3 may also include a gear box          (not shown)
20 coupled to the rotor unit and the electrical generator 25
   to tune the output of the rotor unit to requirements of the
   electrical generator.                  The gear box may be any suitable
   gear box.
25              The assembly 3 also includes a structure that supports
   the components of the assembly and is adapted to locate the
   assembly in a body of water.                   The support structure is
   formed to define a cradle for the chamber 5 that supports
   the chamber 5 and the other assembly components in                  a stable
30 way.           With reference to Figure 14, the support structure is
   a steel framework that includes a plurality of upright
   posts 27 arranged in a circle and interconnected by upper
   and lower steel rings 31.                  The support structure also
   includes a series of brackets 29 that extend inwardly from
35 the posts 27 and define a series of supports for the base 7
   of the chamber 5.                  The lower sections of the posts 27
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                                    -20
   define support members in the form of legs for locating the
   assembly on the bed of a body of water.
                The support structure also includes a platform 11 that
 5 supports the generator 25 and the rotor unit.                         The platform
   11 is a steel framework that is supported by opposed pairs
   of posts 27 and extends across the chamber 5.                         More
   particularly, the rotor unit is suspended from the platform
   11 with the rotor shaft 19 in the centre of the chamber 5
10 and the rotor 21 in a lower section of the chamber 5 and
   clear of the base 7 of the chamber 5.
                The chamber 5 is formed from a plastics material.                 The
   chamber may be formed from any other suitable material.
15
                The rotor 21 includes a plurality of vanes 33 that
   extend radially outwardly from the shaft 19 towards the
   side wall 13.                       The vanes 33 are curved vanes that sweep
   rearwardly from an inner edge that is connected to the
20 shaft 19 and an outer edge.                         The vanes 33 are concave when
   viewed in a direction of water flow within the chamber 5 (a
   clockwise direction as viewed in Figure 1).
                The inlet 15 is in an upper section of the side wall
25 13.          The inlet 15 is formed to promote the formation of a
   vortex in                   the chamber 5 when water flows into the chamber 5
   via the inlet                      15.  In particular,   the inlet 15 is formed to
   supply water into the chamber 5 to promote water flow in a
   vortex, i.e. a spiral pathway within the chamber 5 around
30 the rotor shaft 19 and downwardly to the outlet 17 in the
   base 7 of the chamber 5.                       Movement of water in this
   pathway, preferably with multiple spirals of water down the
   height of the chamber 5 between the inlet 15 and the outlet
   17, results in the water contacting and moving the rotors
35 21 and therefore powers the generator 25 and produces
   electricity. Vortex formation makes it possible to extract
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                                 -21
   rotational kinetic energy that is the result of a
   combination of factors including the Coriolis force from
   the rotation of the Earth.                     As noted above, the energy that
   can be extracted from the vortex movement is related to the
 5 mass of water moving in the vortex in the chamber 5 and not
   simply to the flow rate of water into and from the chamber
   5.
                The inlet 15 includes a flow control valve             (not shown)
10 to control the flow of water into the chamber 5 via the
   inlet          15.
                The inlet 15 includes a pipe that has a straight
   section 35 and a funnel section 37.                      The purpose of the
15 funnel section 37 is to draw as much water as possible
    (within the overall assembly design) into the chamber 5.                     A
   high water flow rate within the chamber 5 is one factor in
   moving from essentially linear flow within the chamber 5
    (such as in a water-wheel) to the formation of a vortex
20 with the chamber 5.                     The straight section 35 facilitates
   directing the flow of water into the chamber as described
   above, i.e. to promote water flow in a spiral pathway,
   preferably with multiple spirals of water down the height
   of the chamber 5 between the inlet 15 and the outlet 17.
25 In order to further facilitate achieving a desired flow of
   water within the chamber 5, the pipe 35 is positioned at an
   inward angle of 70,                    as can be seen in Figure 7.
                The outlet 17 is positioned in a central part of the
30 base 7 of the chamber 5.                     The outlet 17 includes a flow
   control valve (not shown) to control the flow of water from
   the outlet 17.                     The inlet 15 and the outlet 17 are
   positioned with respect to each other to describe an angle
   of approximately 1450 when viewed from above the assembly.
35 The outlet includes an outlet funnel section 47 located in
   the chamber 5 (see Figure 5).                     The rotor shaft 19 and the
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                                   -22
   outlet funnel section 47 are located to be co-axial.                       The
   outlet funnel section 47 is formed as a shallow funnel,
   typically having an angle of less than 200, typically 5
   150, to a horizontal axis to promote the formation of a
 5 vortex within the chamber 5 as a stable vortex that does
   not move around within the chamber 5 after it has been
   established.                       The outlet 17 includes an outlet pipe that
   includes a first section 39 that extends downwardly from
   the base 7 and a second section 41 that extends
10 perpendicular to the first section 39.                       As can best be seen
   in Figures 12 and 13, the outlet 17 includes a rifled
   internal surface, i.e. a surface with a series of spiral
   ridges 43 in the internal surface, to improve water flow
   through the outlet 17.                       The rifled internal surface is one
15 example of a number of options for ensuring that water flow
   through the outlet 17 and the outlet pipe 39, 41 minimises
   disruption to the vortex in the chamber 5.
                The dimensions of the inlet 15, the outlet 17 and the
20 chamber 5 and the positions of the inlet 15 and the outlet
   17 and the rotor 21 are selected to promote the formation
   of a vortex, i.e. a downwardly spiraling flow of water,
   within the chamber, preferably with multiple spirals of
   water down the height of the chamber 5 between the inlet 15
25 and the outlet 17, when in use the assembly is located in a
   body of water and there is a flow of water through the
   chamber from the inlet 15 to the outlet 17.                       In this
   regard, relevant factors include but are not limited to                       (a)
   providing the side wall 13 with a cylindrical internal
30 surface, (b) the direction of water flow from the inlet 15
   into the chamber 5 to promote rotational movement of water
   within the chamber, (c) positioning the inlet 15 in an
   upper section of the chamber 5 at a height just above the
   rotor 21,                    (d) providing the inlet 15 with a funnel section
35 37 that maximises water flow into the chamber 5, (e) the
   shape and location of the vanes 33 of the rotor 21, and (f)
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                                   -23
   providing the outlet 17 with a funnel section 47 that
   promotes the formation of the vortex as a stable vortex
   that does not move around within the chamber 5.
 5              The assembly 3 is straightforward to manufacture,
   transport and install.                       The chamber and the other
   components of the assembly can be made from any suitable
   materials.                       The assembly is an uncomplicated design that is
   robust and reliable and requires low maintenance.                        The
10 assembly 3 is a free-standing unit within a body of water.
                In use, the assembly 3 is located in a body of water
   with the inlet 15 and the outlet 17 submerged in the water
   and the side wall 13 extending above the water level.
15 Water flows through the chamber 5 from the inlet 15 to the
   outlet 17 and forms a vortex, preferably with multiple
   spirals of water down the height of the chamber 5 between
   the inlet 15 and the outlet 17 that drives the rotor unit
   and the generator 25 and produces electricity.                       In a start
20 up phase of the assembly, with the chamber initially empty
   and control valves for the inlet and the outlet selectively
   opened so that the flow of water into the chamber builds up
   to a point where a vortex forms in                      the chamber.   The vortex
   is indicated by a conical air space within the chamber that
25 extends downwardly to the outlet, with the water in the
   chamber flowing in one or multiple spirals of water down
   the height of the chamber between the inlet and the outlet.
   Once there is a stable vortex in the chamber, the control
   valves are adjusted so that the flow rate of water into and
30 out of the chamber is the same.
                The second embodiment described in relation to Figures
   15-21 is essentially a smaller scale assembly compared to
   the embodiment described in relation to Figures 1-14.
35
                The smaller scale assembly shown in Figures 15-21 is
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                                   -24
   adapted to be connected to a water pipe for supplying water
   to a house, apartment or other types of buildings,
   including manufacturing plants, such as processing plants,
   such as water treatment plants, to generate electricity for
 5 powering a water meter for the water pipe.
                It is noted that this is not the only possible
   application for the smaller scale assembly of the
   invention.                       Basically, the smaller scale assembly can be
10 used in relation to any pipe carrying a flow of a fluid,
   such as water, and can be installed as part of an initial
   installation of the pipe or as a retro-fit and take
   advantages of the fluid flow to generate electricity which,
   typically up to 20 W, typically 0.1-10 W, and more
15 typically 0.2-5 W.
                With reference to Figures 15-21, the same reference
   numerals are used in both embodiments to describe the same
   structural features.
20
                The smaller scale assembly shown in Figures 15-21 has
   the same basic structural features as the embodiment shown
   in Figures 1-14.
25              The main difference between the embodiments is that
   the smaller scale assembly shown in Figures 15-21 has
   fittings, such as screw thread fittings 61 shown in the
   Figure 21, on the inlet 15 and the outlet 17 that allow the
   assembly to be connected to pipework.
30
                The chamber 15 of the smaller scale assembly shown in
   Figures 15-21 is completely enclosed, i.e. not open to the
   air, noting that this is not necessary in all embodiments.
35              In addition, the assembly is adapted to control either
   the inlet 15 or the outlet 17 to "start" the formation of
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                                  -25
   the vortex, either via controlling water flow entering the
   chamber 15 or via controlling water flow leaving the
   chamber 15.
 5              In addition, the assembly can generate electricity in
   direct current                     (DC) or alternating current (AC).
                In addition, the assembly can be "integrated" into the
   water meter or may be a retrofitted part of the water
10 meter.
                In any application of the invention, the size, i.e.
   width and height, of the chamber is a function of a number
   of parameters including the volumetric flow rate through
15 the water pipe, the diameter of the pipe, and the required
   electricity output.
                In the case of the smaller scale assembly shown in
   Figures 15-21, typically the chamber 15 has a maximum width
20 of 20 cm and typically a maximum width of 10 cm, and a
   maximum height of 15 cm, and typically a maximum height of
   10 cm.
                With reference to Figure 21, the Figure a top view of
25 a water meter that includes the smaller scale assembly 3 as
   a component of the water meter.                      The water meter also
   includes                  (a) an ultrasonic chamber 63 through which water
   passes and (b) ultrasound generators and receptors                      (not
   shown) that measure the flow rate and speed of the passing
30 water.                 In the embodiment shown in Figure 21, there is a 20
   mm diameter connector 61 between the ultrasonic chamber 63
   and the assembly 3.                      Water flows via the connector 61 from
   the ultrasonic chamber 63 into and through the assembly 3
   and generates electricity in the assembly 3 that powers the
35 ultrasound generators and receptors. There is also another
   20 mm connector 61 at the outlet 17 of the smaller scale

                                              -26
   assembly to connect the assembly 3 to a water pipe that
   connects to a house, apartment or other types of buildings,
   including manufacturing plants, such as processing plants,
   such as water treatment plants.
 5
                Many modifications may be made to the embodiment of
   the invention described above without departing from the
   spirit and scope of the invention.
10              By way of example, whilst the embodiment is shown as
   having particular relative dimensions of the height and the
   width of the chamber 5, a particular configuration of the
   rotor 21, and particular configurations of the inlet 15 and
   the outlet 17 and the other components of the assembly, the
15 present invention is not so limited and extends to any
   suitable arrangements.
                By way of example, whilst the side wall 13 in the
   embodiment described in relation to Figures 1-14 has a
20 cylindrical internal surface to promote the formation of
   the vortex in the chamber 5, the invention is not limited
   to this arrangement and the chamber 5 may include
   formations, such as vanes and/or baffles, to promote the
   formation of the vortex in the chamber.                  The formations may
25 be supported by or be part of the side wall and/or the
   base.
                By way of example, whilst the embodiment described in
   relation to Figures 1-14 includes a particular structure
30 that supports the components of the assembly and is adapted
   to locate the assembly in a body of water, the present
   invention is not limited to this arrangement.                  By way of
   particular example, the series of brackets 29 that extend
   inwardly from the posts 27 and define a series of supports
35 for the base 7 of the chamber 5 is one of a number of
   suitable options.                  Another option is to provide a series of
   10394553_1 (GHMatters) P94496.AU.3

                                      -27
   cross-members extending between spaced apart posts 27.
                By way of example, whilst the embodiments include one
   rotor unit only, the present invention is not limited to
 5 this arrangement and may include a plurality of rotor units
   within one chamber or a plurality of generator units within
   one chamber, with the assembly being formed to promote the
   formation of a separate vortex formation associated with
   each rotor unit.
10
                By way of example, whilst the embodiment described in
   relation to Figures 1-14 is described as being adapted to
   be located on the bed of a body of water, the present
   invention is not so limited and extends to embodiments that
15 are adapted to be located on the ground or in the ground
   beside the body of water.          These embodiments include pipe
   work connecting the body of water to the inlet 15 and the
   outlet 17 of the assembly 3.
20              By way of example, whilst the embodiment described in
   relation to Figures 1-14 is described as a stand-alone
   unit, the present invention is not so limited and extends
   to arrangements in which the assembly 3 is used in
   conjunction with other hydro-powered electricity generation
25 systems.
