   carrying a panel that is to be cut,                 a cutter bow fastened
   to the mount and presenting two parallel opposite sides
20 between which a cutter wire is tensioned, and an actuator
   mechanism using a cable and pulleys inside the bow in
   order to move the tensioned wire in a certain cutting
   direction perpendicular to the mount.
         The bow may be fastened to the mount in pivotal
25 manner in order to make various chamfer cuts.
   Summary of the invention
         The object of the invention is to improve such a
   hot-wire cutter machine to facilitate making a wider
30 variety of cuts.
         To this end, the invention provides a hot-wire
   cutter machine comprising a mount that extends in a plane
   in order to carry flat a panel for cutting, and a cutter
   structure fastened to the mount and having the cutter
35 wire tensioned thereon, the machine being characterized
   in that the cutter structure is a frame having four sides

                                 2
   between which two crossed cutter wires are tensioned, and
   in that the frame is fastened inside the mount at two
   fastening points that are offset on a line that crosses
   the frame.
 5      The hot-wire cutter machine of the invention may
   present the following features:
        - The fastening points may be offset pivots on which
   the frame is mounted to turn inside the mount.
        - The frame may be a rectangular frame having two
10 mutually parallel short sides between which a first
   cutter wire is tensioned that extends parallel to the
   plane of the mount, and two mutually parallel long sides
   between which a second cutter wire is tensioned that
   extends across the plane of the mount.
15      - An actuator mechanism, e.g. using cables and
   pulleys, may be provided inside the frame for moving said
   first and second cutter wires in two orthogonal cutting
   directions.
        - The mount may include a retractable stand forming
20 an easel, or indeed suspension hooks.
        With the arrangement of the invention, and without
   removing the panel from the mount,  it is easy to perform
   various cuts,  in particular U-shaped cuts, in all three
   dimensions  (thickness, width, length) of the panel.
25      In particular, with the second cutter wire that is
   tensioned between the two parallel long sides of the
   mount of the cutter structure, it is possible to make a
   U-shaped cut over a length of more than 120 centimeters
   (cm) along the length of a polystyrene  insulation panel
30 that is 250 cm long by 120 cm wide.

15 Description of embodiments
         In Figure 1, the cutter machine of the invention
   having two hot wires comprises a mount 1 that lies in a
   plane in order to carry flat a panel  for cutting   (not
   shown in Figure 1),  e.g. a polystyrene insulation panel
20 for insulating buildings.
         The mount 1 in this example is a tubular mount, e.g.
   made of aluminum forming a rectangular frame that is
   mounted on a retractable stand 2 in the form of an easel
   that is adjustable in height.
25       In Figure 1, the mount is in a sloping position,
   e.g. for work on scaffolding.
         The mount may also be provided with suspension hooks
   3  (only one being visible in Figure 1) in order to be
   suspended from the guard rail of a nacelle, for example.
30       In the invention, the mount 1 has fastened therein a
   cutter structure 4 forming a frame, e.g. a rectangular
   frame, for carrying two crossed cutter wires 5,   6.
         The frame of the cutter structure is fastened to the
   inside of the mount at two fastening points P1 and P2
35 that are offset along a line L crossing the frame.
         More particularly, and as can be seen in Figure    1,
   the fastening points P1 and P2 between the two opposite

                                 4
   short sides  1A and 1B of the mount and the two opposite
   short sides  4A, 4B of the cutter structure are offset
   along a line L that passes between the two opposite long
   sides 1C,  1D of the mount and the two opposite long sides
 5 4C,  4D of the cutter structure.
         These two fastening points P1, P2 are preferably
   pivot points that are offset to enable the frame of the
   cutter structure to occupy different angular positions
   relative to the plane of the mount so as to make
10 chamfered cuts in the panel or so as to retract the
   cutter structure completely into the inside of the frame
   of the mount.
         Figure 1 shows the rectangular frame 4 of the cutter
   structure with the two parallel opposite short sides   4A,
15 4B having tensioned between them the first cutter wire 5,
   which extends parallel to the plane of the mount, and the
   two opposite parallel long sides  4C, 4D having tensioned
   between them the second cutter wire  6, which extends
   across the plane of the mount and which crosses the
20 cutter wire 5, at right angles in this example, and
   without making contact therewith.
         In practice, the offset of the two pivot points P1,
   P2  from the long side 4D of the frame of the cutter
   structure is a few centimeters, e.g. 3 cm, such that the
25 second cutter wire 6 crosses the plane of the mount
   completely.
         The short sides 4A, 4B of the frame of the cutter
   structure have a length of about 50 cm so as to provide a
   depth of cut of about 40  cm, while the long sides 4C,  4D
30 of the frame of the cutter structure may have a length of
   about 150 cm, so as to obtain a length of cut of 135 cm.
         Turning of the frame 4 of the cutter structure in
   the frame of the mount is represented by double-headed
   arrow P in Figure  1.
35       Figure 1 also shows an angle bar 7 for holding the
   panel that is to be cut in a horizontal or  sloping
   position on the mount, the angle bar 7 being mounted to

                                 5
   be tiltable in the plane of the mount  in order to form
   chamfer cuts.
        Reference 8 designates a protractor for measuring
   the angle of inclination of the angle bar 7 in the plane
 5 of the mount.
        As can be seen in Figure 1, the angle bar 7 crosses
   the plane of the frame 4 of the cutter structure.   It  is
   cut facing the offset line L of the pivot points P1,   P2
   so as to allow the second cutter wire 6 to pass along the
10 full height of the frame 4 of the cutter structure.
        Figure 2 shows a polystyrene  insulation panel 9
   placed in the hot-wire cutter machine of the invention
   having two hot wires.
        In this figure, the angle bar 7 is horizontal and
15 the panel 9 extends horizontally lengthwise in the angle
   bar 7.
        Figure 2 shows a groove 10 formed in the width of
   the panel using the cutter wire 5 that is tensioned
   substantially vertically.
20      In order to make this groove 10,  the cutter wire 5
   is moved from the front towards the rear of the mount
   with the frame 4 of the cutter structure at 90*  relative
   to the plane of the mount.   Thereafter, the panel 9 is
   moved from right to left in Figure 2 while the cutter
25 wire 5 remains stationary in the cutter structure.
        There can also be seen a U-shaped notch 11 that has
   been made in the length of the panel using the cutter
   wire 6 that is tensioned substantially horizontally.
        In order to make this notch 11,  the cutter wire 6 is
30 moved downwards.   Thereafter, the panel is moved from
   right to left in Figure 2 while the cutter wire 6 remains
   stationary.   Finally the cutter wire 6 is moved upwards,
   the panel remaining stationary on the mount  1.
        Figure 3 shows another U-shaped notch 12 that is
35 made so as to be chamfered in the panel 9 by using the
   cutter wire 6.

                                 6
        In this example, the frame 4 of the cutter structure
   is sloped at 450  relative to the plane of the mount 1.
        In this example, the cutter wire 6 is located at
   half-height in the frame 4.
 5      The panel 9 is moved from left to right in Figure 3.
   Thereafter, the cutter wire 6 is moved upwards, while the
   panel 9 remains stationary on the mount 1.   Finally, the
   panel 9 is then moved from right to left in Figure 3,
   with the cutter wire 6 remaining stationary in the frame
10 4.
        Figure 4 shows a mechanism having cables 12 and
   pulleys 13 for moving the cutter wires 5 and 6 that cross
   in the frame 4 of the cutter structure.
        Each of the cutter wires 5 and 6 may be moved by
15 means of a cursor such as 14 sliding along a slideway
   carrying a millimeter scale.
        The cutter wires 5 and 6 may be heated by
   electricity delivered by a copper track 15 that is stuck
   to the inside of the frame 4 which has a profiled shape.
20      Electricity may be stored in a battery fastened to
   the mount.
        The two cutter wires 5 and 6 cross without making
   contact.   They move respectively in two parallel planes
   of the frame 4 that are spaced apart from each other by
25 1 cm, for example.
        Figure 5 shows the hot-wire cutter machine of the
   invention having two hot wires in a folded position when
   the frame 4 of the cutter structure is retracted into the
   frame of the mount 1.
30      In this folded position, the cutter machine of the
   invention is very compact.
        It may be suspended vertically from the guard rail
   of a shallow nacelle.
        This hot-wire cutter machine of the invention having
35 two hot wires is compact because the two cutter wires are
   movable in a single frame of the cutter structure.   The
   hot-wire cutter machine of the invention having two hot

                            7
wires may be fabricated at low cost out of welded
together metal tubes.
