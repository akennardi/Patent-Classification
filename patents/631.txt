    TECHNICAL FIELD
            This invention relates to launch tubes that have a sabot; and in more particular
    embodiments to launch tubes and canisters, report-suppressing launch tubes, and sabots, for
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

    BACKGROUND
            Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
    considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
    general knowledge in the field.
 0O         Typically UAVs are shipped to a launch site in an unassembled state. At the site they
    are assembled, tested, and launched. Launching is typically executed by hand, by an elastic
    tether, a powered wench, from a moving vehicle, or some combination thereof.             Such
    methods can be time consuming and/or cumbersome. Once launched, a UAV may receive
    uplinks and may be guided by a human-in-the-loop, a human intermittently up-linking course
25  corrections, e.g., via supervisory control, or by a preloaded intercept/strike point in
    combination with an onboard flight path guidance generator and outputs of inertial sensors
    and/or from a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver.
    SUMMARY
30          An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) launch tube apparatus is disclosed that may
    include at least one layer of prepeg substrate disposed about an aperture to form a tube, a
    sabot disposed in an interior of the tube, the sabot having a first clasp tab, and a clasp
    detachably coupled to the first clasp tab and contacting an inner circumferential wall of the
                                                   1

    tube so that the clasp is rotationally constrained by the inner circumferential wall and the first
    clasp tab. The sabot may also comprise an expandable skirt to provide a pressure seal with
    the inner circumferential wall of the tube. The expandable skirt may be axially restrained
    within the tube using an adhesive, and the adhesive may detachably bind the expandable skirt
 5  about a shell within the tube. In such an embodiment, the shell may consist of an exterior
    surface of a gas generator, the gas generator configured to generate gas to generate a high
    pressure volume between the expandable skirt and the shell, and wherein the generated
    pressure is sufficient to push the expandable skirt off of the shell by breaking the adhesive
    restraint between the exterior surface of the gas generator and the expandable skirt. The
 0  apparatus may also have a UAV seated on the sabot, the UAV having a second clasp tab
    detachably coupled to the clasp and wherein the clasp is rotationally constrained by the inner
    circumferential wall, the first clasp tab, and the second clasp tab. The sabot may be tethered
    to the tube. The sabot may include a base sabot configured to engage the UAV, the base
    sabot having a first plurality of expandable partial skirt seals, and a circumferential sabot skirt
 5  seated on the base sabot, the circumferential sabot skirt having a second plurality of
    expandable partial skirt seals, so that the first and second pluralities of expandable partial
    skirt seals complete the pressure seal with the inner circumferential wall. The expandable
    skirt may be axially restrained within the tube using an adhesive, and the adhesive may
    detachably bind the expandable skirt about a shell within the tube so that generation of gas by
 '0 the gas generator pushes the expandable skirt off of the gas generator by breaking the
    detachable binding of the adhesive. A UAV may be seated on the sabot, the UAV having a
    second clasp tab detachably coupled to the clasp, wherein the inner circumferential wall
    prevents the clasp from slipping off of the second clasp tab while the UAV is in the tube.
            A method of launching an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is disclosed that includes
25  generating gas in a gas generator, introducing the gas to a high-pressure volume between an
    expandable sabot skirt of a sabot and the gas generator to break an adhesive coupling that
    restrains the sabot in a launch tube, pushing the expandable sabot skirt against an inner
    circumferential wall of the launch tube using the gas, and driving the sabot up a launch tube
    using the gas. The method may also be defined wherein the adhesive coupling includes an
30  adhesive coupling between the expandable skirt and a shell surrounding the gas generator.
    The method may also include clasping a UAV to the sabot using a clasp, and restraining the
    clasp against the inner circumferential wall of the launch tube to prevent the clasp from
    decoupling from at least one of the UAV and the sabot. In some embodiments, the method
                                                     2

   may also include sliding the clasp past the inner circumferential wall to release at least one of
   the UAV and sabot from the clasp, and may include tethering the sabot to the launch tube to
   prevent the sabot from exiting the launch tube.
            In another embodiment, a method of launching an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
 5 includes restraining a sabot in a launch tube, introducing gas to a high-pressure side of an
   expandable sabot skirt of a sabot to break the restraint of the sabot in the launch tube,
   pushing the expandable sabot skirt against an inner circumferential wall of the launch tube
   using the gas, and driving the sabot up a launch tube using the gas. In such embodiments, the
   a sabot may be restrained using an adhesive, and the adhesive may be used to restrain an
 0 expandable skirt of the sabot to a shell surrounding a gas generator in the launch tube. The
   method may also include tethering said sabot to said launch tube. The expandable sabot skirt
   may also include a circumferential skirt protrusion that extends from said expandable sabot
   skirt toward an inner circumferential wall of said launch tube. The method may also include
   restraining the travel of said sabot by a tether configured to prevent said sabot from exiting
 5 said launch tube, and where the restrained travel of said sabot substantially retains said gas
   within said launch tube. In some embodiments, the tether may be attached to said sabot and
   said inner circumferential wall of said launch tube by a tether reel and/or a winding element.
            Another embodiment may include an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) launch tube
   apparatus, comprising: a first aperture portion, where said first aperture portion comprises a
 O constant cross-sectional area; a second aperture portion, where said second aperture portion
   comprises an enlarged cross-sectional area relative to said first aperture portion, and where
   said first aperture portion and said second aperture portion form a launch tube; a sabot
   disposed in said first aperture portion and configured to detachably couple to a UAV; where
   said sabot is configured to decouple from said UAV upon movement of said sabot from said
25 first aperture portion to said second aperture portion. The sabot may be configured to
   detachably couple to said UAV by a clasp, said clasp configured to detachably couple to a
   first clasp tab of said sabot and a second clasp tab of said UAV. Said clasp may be
   rotationally constrained by at least one of: an inner surface of said first aperture portion, said
   first clasp tab of said sabot, and said second clasp tab of said UAV. Said clasp may be
30 configured to decouple from said second clasp tab of said UAV upon movement of said sabot
   from said first aperture portion to said second aperture portion. Said clasp may be configured
   to decouple from said first clasp tab of said sabot upon movement of said clasp past an inner
   surface of said second aperture portion. Some embodiments may also comprise at least one
                                                    3

    gas generator, where said at least one gas generator is disposed in a bottom portion of said
    first aperture portion; and an expandable sabot skirt of said sabot, where a hollow end of said
    expandable sabot skirt is oriented toward said at least one gas generator, and where said
    expandable sabot skirt is axially restrained by a detachable restraint. Said at least one gas
 5  generator may be configured to generate gas, and said expandable sabot skirt may be
    configured to substantially retain said gas within said launch tube. Said generated gas may be
    configured to detach said expandable sabot skirt from said detachable restraint and propel
    said sabot from said first aperture portion to said second aperture portion. Said expandable
    sabot skirt may be configured to expand to said enlarged cross-sectional area of said second
 0  aperture portion and continue to substantially retain said gas in said second aperture portion
    of said launch tube. Some embodiments may further comprise a tether attached to said sabot
    and a bottom portion of said first aperture portion, where said tether may be configured to
    restrain a movement of said sabot such that said expandable sabot skirt substantially retains
    said gas from escaping past an opening in said launch tube.

 ,0 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
            An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) launch tube apparatus is disclosed that has prepeg
    substrate disposed about an aperture to form a tube, a sabot is disposed in the interior of the
    tube with the sabot having a first clasp tab, and a clasp is detachably coupled to the first clasp
    tab and contacts an inner circumferential wall of the tube so that the inner circumferential
25  wall restrains the clasp from slipping off of the first clasp tab while the UAV is in the tube.
    In this manner, the UAV may be assembled, tested and restrained in the launch tube prior to
    further transportation to a launch site.
            FIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment of a UAV 108 that is detachably restrained in a
    launch tube 100 for testing and/or further transportation to a launch site. The launch tube 100
30  may have inner and outer circumferential walls (102, 104) disposed about an aperture 106. In
    some embodiments, the launch tube 100 may be formed of a single walled structure. The
    UAV 108 is illustrated disposed in the aperture 106 adjacent the inner circumferential wall
    102, with the UAV 108 detachably coupled to a sabot 110 that is itself disposed in the launch
                                                     6

    tube 100.     The sabot 110 may be hollow having an open end 112 oriented toward a high
    pressure volume 114. A tether 116 may attach to the sabot 110, within a hollow of the sabot
    110, and also attach to the inner wall 102 of the launch tube 100.
             The UAV 108 may have a radial indentation 118 at a proximal end 120 of the UAV
 5  108 from which a UAV clasp tab 122 may extend radially toward the inner circumferential
    wall 102 for coupling to a fastener 124. Similarly, the sabot 110 may have a clasp tab 126
    extending radially toward the inner circumferential wall 102 from a radial indentation 128 at
    a proximal end 130 of the sabot 110 for coupling to the fastener 124. As illustrated in FIG. 1,
    the UAV and sabot clasp tabs (122, 126) may be rotationally aligned in complementary
 0  opposition to one another to enable the fastener 124, for example, a clasp 124 such as a u
    shaped clasp, to detachably embrace both the UAV and sabot clasp tabs (122, 126).          For
    example, each of the UAV and sabot clasp tabs (122, 126) may form a horizontal and planar
    surface,   or substantially horizontal and substantially planar surface,      upon which a
    complementary portion of the clasp 124 may rest when positioned to embrace the UAV and
 5  sabot clasp tabs (122, 126). Once the UAV 108, sabot 110 and clasp 124 are inserted into the
    launch tube 100, the inner circumferential wall 102 may rotationally restrain the clasp 124
    from falling off of both the UAV clasp tab 122 and sabot clasp tab 126 to accomplish a
    coupling between the UAV          108 and sabot 110 that is detachable once the inner
    circumferential wall 102 no longer rotationally restrains the clasp 124.
 10          In an alternative embodiment, the clasp 124 may be detachably coupled to the UAV
    clasp tab 122, and rotatably coupled to the sabot 110 at a hinge (not shown).       In such an
    embodiment, the clasp 124 may rotate about the hinge (not shown) as the rotational restraint
    of the clasp 124 by the inner circumferential wall 102 is removed by, for example, the UAV
    108 and clasp 124 beginning to exit the launch tube 100 or as the aperture 106 diameter is
25  suitably increased.
             The sabot 110 may be formed with, or assembled with, an expandable skirt 132 that
    may be axially restrained and detachably coupled to the inner wall 102 of the launch tube 100
    downstream from a gas generator 134. As illustrated in Figure 1, the expandable skirt 132
    may be detachably coupled to a circumferential shell 136 within the tube using an adhesive
30  coupling 138 to establish the high-pressure volume 114 between the expandable skirt 132
    and circumferential shell 136. The circumferential shell 136 may be defined by an exterior
    surface of the gas generator 134. During operation, gas from the gas generator 134 may be
    introduced to the high-pressure volume 114. The resultant gas pressure pushes out on and
                                                    7

    expands the expandable skirt 132 at the adhesive coupling 138 to break the expandable skirt
    132 free from the circumferential shell 136. The resulting gas pressure on the expandable
    skirt 132 may cause, or at least facilitate, the formation of a gas seal between the sabot 110
    and the inner circumferential wall 102 of the launch tube 100 to better drive the sabot 110
 5  along the inner wall 102 of the launch tube 100 by using the gas pressure differential between
    the high-pressure volume 114 and the side of the sabot opposite from the high-pressure
    volume . Formation of the pressure seal between the expandable skirt 132 and the inner
    circumferential wall 102 may be facilitated by a circumferential skirt protrusion 140 that may
    be formed in, and extend from, the expandable skirt 132 toward the inner circumferential wall
 0  102 of the launch tube 100. In certain embodiments, the sabot 110 may be configured to
    form gaps between the sabot 110 and the inner circumferential wall 102 to provide a desired
    amount of gas leakage to prevent the launcher from becoming too hot or from containing the
    launch gases such that the structural integrity of the launcher is compromised or breached.
    Accordingly, sabot 110 embodiments may be sized to limit gas leakage and/or to limit the
 5  sound propagation of the sonic waves generated during the UAV 108 launch process.
             The inner circumferential wall 102 may be formed of a prepeg substrate such as
    epoxy prepreg KevlarTM. The clasp 124 may be a rigid member formed of a thermoplastic
    polymer such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or formed of a metal such as aluminum or steel.
    The clasp 124 may be rotationally restrained by the inner circumferential wall 102 of the
 '0 launch tube 100 against the UAV 108 and sabot 110.
             FIG. 2 is an expanded view of the expandable skirt 132, adhesive coupling 138, and
    shell 136, first illustrated in Figure 1, as gas pressure builds in the high-pressure volume 114
    against the expandable skirt 132. The expandable skirt 132 may be detachably coupled to the
    shell 136 using the adhesive coupling 138. In an alternative embodiment, the adhesive
25  coupling 138 may be replaced with another coupling that is configured to break upon gas 200
    reaching a predetermined gas pressure within the high-pressure volume 114, for example, a
    suitable pin coupling the expandable skirt 132 to the shell 136. The circumferential skirt
    protrusion 140 may abut against the inner circumferential wall 102 as gas 200 is introduced
    into the hollow of the sabot.
30           FIG. 3 is an expanded view of the expandable skirt 132 and shell 136, first illustrated
    in Figure 1, where gas pressure in the high-pressure volume presses against the expandable
    skirt to break an adhesive coupling 138 that restrains the sabot in the launch tube 100. Upon
    reaching a predetermined pressure, the adhesive coupling 138 is insufficient to couple the
                                                      8

    expandable skirt 132 to the shell 136 and adhesive restraint is broken between the exterior
    surface of the shell 136 and the expandable skirt 132 to axially release the expandable skirt
    132 and sabot. The gas 200 continues to push the expandable skirt 132 against the inner
    circumferential wall 102 of the launch tube to reinforce the gas seal to drive the sabot up the
 5  launch tube. Although the expandable skirt 132 is illustrated as adhesively coupled to the
    shell 136 at a base 300 of the launch tube 100 and shell 136, the expandable skirt 132 may be
    coupled to a position higher on the shell 136. Also, although the adhesive coupling 138 is
    illustrated as having a bead or spheroid shape, the adhesive coupling 138 may take the form
    of a thin layer adhesive wherein the expandable skirt 132 may "rip" or peel away from the
 0  adhesive coupling 138 in response to the gas 200 reaching a predetermined gas pressure in
    the high-pressure volume 114 to push the expandable skirt 132 away from the shell 136.
             FIG. 4 depicts the sabot 100, illustrated in FIG. 1, after release of the expandable skirt
    132 from the shell 136 surrounding the gas generator 134. The gas generator 134 continues to
    generate gas 200 to pressurize the high-pressure volume 114 resulting in differential pressure
 5  against the expandable skirt 132 between the high-pressure volume 114 and the remainder of
    the launch tube to reinforce the gas seal that may exist between the circumferential skirt
    protrusion 140 and the inner circumferential wall 102. The sabot 110 may thus drive the
    UAV 108 through the aperture 106 and up the launch tube 100. The tether 116 coupled to the
    sabot 110 continues to spool outward to enable the sabot 110 to continue up the launch tube
 '0 100. The UAV 108 may remain detachably coupled to the sabot 110 through the clasp 124,
    with the clasp 124 rotationally constrained by the inner circumferential wall 102 so that the
    clasp 124 is prevented from decoupling from at least one of the UAV and sabot clasp tabs
    (122, 126). In FIG. 4, the aperture 106 is illustrated having a constant cross section. In an
    alternative embodiment, the aperture may have an expanding cross section in gradual
25  preparation for rotational release of the clasp 124 from the UAV clasp tab 122, the sabot
    clasp tab 126, or both.
             FIG. 5 depicts one embodiment of a launch tube 500 having a constant cross-sectional
    area along its length, with the sabot 510 detachably coupled to the UAV 512 using a clasp
    514 detachably connected to both the sabot 510 and UAV 512 and rotationally constrained by
30  the inner circumferential wall 516 of the launch tube 500. In this embodiment, the launch
    tube 500 is shown having an optional frangible seal 502 across a top opening of the launch
    tube 500. Two gas-generating canisters (504, 506) are shown disposed within a high-pressure
    volume 508 of the launch tube 500. In FIG. 5, the adhesive coupling that previously
                                                      9

    restrained the sabot 510 in the launch tube 500 has been broken (See FIG. 3), and the sabot
    510 has moved a distance axially up the launch tube in response to a pressure differential
    between the high-pressure volume 508 and the side of the sabot opposite from the high
    pressure volume. The UAV 512 is shown breaking the frangible seal 502 and beginning to
 5  exit the launcher 500 as the clasp 514 continues to be rotationally constrained by the inner
    circumferential wall 516 to maintain the detachable coupling between the sabot 510 and
    UAV 512.
             FIG. 6 depicts the UAV launch tube of FIG. 5, with the gas-generating canisters (504,
    506) increasing the pressure - as depicted by the gas 600 - within the high-pressure volume
 0  508 between the inner circumferential wall 516 of the launch tube 500 and the sabot 510. A
    tether 604 may be attached to the inner circumferential wall 516 and/or to an inner base wall
    606 via a tether reel or winding element 608. Relative to FIG. 5, the sabot 510 is shown
    displaced along the launch tube 500 - in this example a right parallelepiped volume -moving
    with the UAV 512, which is detachably coupled to the sabot 510 by the clasp 514. In one
 5  embodiment, generation of gas by the gas generators (504, 506) may be staggered, so that one
    gas generator starts later in time than the other, to increase or sustain the pressure as the UAV
    512 travels along and exits the launch tube 500.
             FIG. 7 depicts the launch tube of FIGS. 5 and 6 as the sabot 510 approaches full
    payout, or a maximum distance of travel, as limited by the tether 604, to prevent the sabot
 '0 510 from exiting the launch tube and to substantially retain the gas within the launcher
    volume for subsequent controlled gas seepage into the surrounding atmosphere. In some
    embodiments using hot or warm gas generators, the sabot 510 travels approximately no
    further than the location depicted in FIG. 7.          As the clasp 514 slides past the inner
    circumferential wall 516, the clasp 514 decouples from the UAV clasp tab 700 to allow the
25  UAV 512 to continue unhindered out of the launch tube. In some embodiments, the
    maximum travel of the sabot 510 may be extended to allow the clasp 514 to decouple from
    both the UAV clasp tab 700 and sabot clasp tab 702, such as by allowing the clasp 514 to
    entirely clear the inner circumferential wall 516. In such an embodiment, the sabot 510, or
    the expandable sabot skirt 704 portion of the sabot 510, may substantially retain the gas
30  within the launcher volume for subsequent controlled gas seepage into the surrounding
    atmosphere.     The sabot 510 may also be provided with a side depression (not shown) to
    facilitate controlled release of the gas past the sabot 510 at the full payout position, whether
    fully-clearing the clasp 514 or not.

            FIG. 8 depicts one embodiment of a launch tube 800 having an enlarged-aperture
    launch end. The clasp 514 is rotationally constrained by the inner circumferential wall 820 of
    the launch tube 800 along a portion of the launch tube length, rather than along the entire
    length as illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6. Two gas-generating canisters (802, 804) are shown
 5  disposed within a high-pressure volume 806 of the launch tube 800. A tethered sabot 808 is
    shown disposed between the gas generating canisters (802, 804) and the UAV 810.            The
    launch tube has a high-pressure aperture portion of constant cross-sectional area 812 to
    provide enhanced      launch velocity and an enlarged-aperture        launch portion 814 to
    accommodate a UAV payload 816 that may extend beyond the conventional fuselage of the
 0  UAV 810. For example, the UAV payload 816 may provide for cameras, sensors or other
    devices that extend beyond the fuselage of the UAV 810. The UAV 810 is shown breaking
    an optional frangible seal 818 and beginning to exit the launcher 800 as the clasp 514
    continues to be rotationally constrained by an inner circumferential wall 820 to maintain the
    detachable coupling between the sabot 808 and UAV 810.
 5          FIG. 9 depicts the enlarged-aperture launch portion 814 and UAV launch tube 800 of
    FIG. 8, with the gas-generating canisters (802, 804) increasing the pressure - as depicted by
    the gas 900 - within the high-pressure volume 806 between the sabot 808 and the gas
    generating canisters (802, 804). A tether 902 may be attached to the inner circumferential
    wall 820 and/or to an inner base wall 904 via a tether reel or winding element 906. Relative
 ,0 to FIG. 8, the sabot 808 is shown displaced along the launch tube 800 - in this example a
    right parallelepiped volume -moving with the UAV 810, which may be detachably coupled
    to the sabot 808 by the clasp 514. In the illustrated embodiment of FIGS. 8 and 9, the sabot
    808 has not yet approached the enlarged-aperture launch portion 814 and so the clasp 514 is
    still depicted as rotationally restrained by the inner circumferential wall 820 to detachably
25  couple the UAV 810 to the sabot 808.
            FIG. 10 depicts the clasp 514 illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9 falling away from the UAV
    810 to decouple the UAV 810 from the sabot 808 in the enlarged-aperture launch portion 814
    of the launch tube. As the clasp 514 slides past the high-pressure aperture portion of constant
    cross-sectional area 812, the clasp 514 may no longer be rotationally constrained by the inner
30  circumferential wall 820 and so the clasp 514 may fall away from the UAV clasp tab 1000 to
    allow the UAV 810 to continue unhindered out of the launch tube. In some embodiments, the
    sabot 808 has an expandable sabot skirt 1002 that may be configured to substantially retain
    the gas within the launcher volume to provide continued thrust of the sabot 808 substantially
                                                    11

   through the enlarged-aperture launch portion 814.
           FIGS. 11 and 12 depict one embodiment of a launch tube 1100 having an enlarged
   aperture launch portion 1104. The launch tube 1100 has a high-pressure aperture portion of
   constant cross-sectional area 1102 to provide enhanced launch velocity, and an enlarged
 5 aperture launch portion 1104 to accommodate a UAV payload 1106 that may extend beyond
   the fuselage of the UAV 1108. Unlike the launch tube illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9, the high
   pressure aperture portion of constant cross-sectional area 1102 extends substantially
   throughout the launch tube 1100 length. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 12,
   the enlarged-aperture launch end 1104 is introduced abruptly along the launch tube length to
 0 maximize the available high-pressure aperture portion length while accommodating the UAV
   payload 1106 toward the front of the UAV 1108. A clasp 1110 detachably couples the UAV
   1108 to a sabot 1112 and is rotationally constrained by an inner circumferential wall 1114 of
   the launch tube 1100 along a substantial portion of the launch tube length prior to reaching
   the enlarged-aperture portion 1104 so that the clasp 1110 does not rotate away from the UAV
 5 1108 and sabot 1112. As the clasp 1110 slides past the inner circumferential wall 1114 of the
   high-pressure aperture portion 1102, the clasp 1110 is no longer rotationally constrained by
   the inner circumferential sidewall 1114 and so the clasp 1110 may fall away from the UAV
   1108 to allow the UAV 1108 to continue unhindered out of the launch tube 1100.
           FIG. 13 depicts, in a bottom-side perspective view, an exemplary UAV in a pre
 0 launch state 1300, i.e., with its wing 1302 and tail surfaces 1304 folded beneath the fuselage
   of the vehicle. Also shown is a propeller hub 1306 about which a propeller may be rotatably
   mounted. The air vehicle may include a radio frequency (RF) antenna 1308 conformal with
   or extending from the vehicle. Whether the tube volume is a right cylinder, a right
   parallelepiped, or some other shape, the cross-section or cross-sections of the UAV may be
25 insufficient to maintain an air-tight fit between the vehicle and the inner walls of the launcher.
   Accordingly, for launches based on gas pressure, a sabot may be disposed between the gas
   source and the UAV.
           FIG. 14 depicts an exemplary UAV in a launched state 1400 with its airfoils 1302,
   1304 deployed and its pusher propeller 1402 rotating. The UAV may receive and/or send
30 signals through an antenna, for example, an RF antenna 1308, which may be conformal with
   or extending out from the launched UAV 1400.
