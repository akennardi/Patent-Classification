   MAGNESIUM ALLOY, METHOD FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF, AND USE
   THEREOF
   The invention relates to a magnesium alloy and to a method for production thereof and also
 5 to the use thereof.
   Technical background and prior art
   It is known that the properties of magnesium alloys are determined significantly by the
10 type and quantity of the alloy partners and impurity elements and also by the production
   conditions. The effects of the alloy partners and impurity elements on the properties of
   the magnesium alloys are presented           in C. KAMMER, Magnesium-Taschenbuch
   (Magnesium Handbook), p. 156-161, Aluminum Verlag Dusseldorf, 2000 first edition
   and are intended to illustrate the complexity of determining the properties of binary or
is ternary magnesium alloys for use thereof as implant material.
   The most frequently used alloy element for magnesium is aluminum, which leads to an
   increase in strength as a result of solid solution hardening and dispersion strengthening
   and fine grain formation, but also to microporosity. Furthermore, aluminum shifts the
20 participation boundary of the iron in the melt to considerably low iron contents, at which
   the iron particles precipitate or form intermetallic particles with other elements.
   Calcium has a pronounced grain refinement effect and impairs castability.
   Undesired accompanying elements in magnesium alloys are iron, nickel, cobalt and
25 copper, which, due to their electropositive nature, cause a considerable increase in the
   tendency for corrosion.
   Manganese is found in all magnesium alloys and binds iron in the form of AIMnFe
   sediments, such that local element formation is reduced. On the other hand, manganese is
30 unable to bind all iron, and therefore a residue of iron and a residue of manganese always
   remain in the melt.

                                                  -2
   Silicon reduces castability and viscosity and, with rising Si content, worsened corrosion
   behavior has to be anticipated. Iron, manganese and silicon have a very high tendency to
   form an intermetallic phase.
 5 This phase has a very high electrochemical potential and can therefore act as a cathode
   controlling the corrosion of the alloy matrix.
   As a result of solid solution hardening, zinc leads to an improvement in the mechanical
   properties and to grain refinement, but also to microporosity with tendency for hot crack
10 formation from a content of 1.5-2% by weight in binary Mg/Zn and ternary Mg/AI/Zn
   alloys.
   Alloy additives formed from zirconium increase the tensile strength without lowering the
   extension and lead to grain refinement, but also to severe impairment of dynamic
   recrystallization, which manifests itself in an increase of the recrystallization temperature
15 and therefore requires high energy expenditures. In addition, zirconium cannot be added to
   aluminous and silicious melts because the grain refinement effect is lost.
   Rare earths, such as Lu, Er, Ho, Th, Sc and In, all demonstrate similar chemical behavior
   and, on the magnesium-rich side of the binary phase diagram, form eutectic systems with
20 partial solubility, such that precipitation hardening is possible.
   The addition of further alloy elements in conjunction with the impurities leads to the
   formation      of    different   intermetallic    phases   in    binary  magnesium     alloys
   (MARTIENSSSEN,           WARLIMONT, Springer Handbook of Condensed Matter and
25 Materials Data, S. 163, Springer Berlin Heidelberg New York, 2005). For example, the
   intermetallic phase Mgi 7 A11 2 forming at the grain boundaries is thus brittle and limits the
   ductility. Compared to the magnesium matrix, this intermetallic phase is more noble and
   can form local elements, whereby the corrosion behavior deteriorates (NISANCIOGLU, K,
   et al, Corrosion mechanism of AZ91 magnesium alloy, Proc. Of 47th World Magnesium
30 Association, London: Institute of Materials, 41-45).

                                               -3
   Besides theses influencing factors, the properties of the magnesium alloys are, in addition,
   also significantly dependent on the metallurgical production conditions. Impurities when
   alloying together the alloy partners are inevitably introduced by the conventional casting
   method. The prior art (US 5,055,254 A) therefore predefines tolerance limits for impurities
 5 in magnesium alloys, and specifies tolerance limits from 0.0015 to 0.0024% Fe, 0.0010%
   Ni, 0.0010 to 0.0024% Cu and no less than 0.15 to 0.5 Mn for example for a
   magnesium/aluminum/zinc alloy with approximately 8 to 9.5% Al and 0.45 to 0.9% Zn.
   Tolerance limits for impurities in magnesium and alloys thereof are specified in% by

   It has been found that these tolerance specifications are not sufficient to reliably rule out
   the formation of corrosion-promoting intermetallic phases, which exhibit a more noble
   electrochemical potential compared to the magnesium matrix.
20
   The biologically degradable implants presuppose a load-bearing function and therefore
   strength in conjunction with a sufficient extension capability during its physiologically

                                                 -4
   required support time. The known magnesium materials however are far removed in
   precisely this respect from the properties that are achieved by permanent implants, such as
   titanium, CoCr alloys and titanium alloys. The strength Rm for permanent implants is
   approximately 500 MPa to > 1,000 MPa, whereas by contrast that of the magnesium
 5 materials was previously < 275 MPa or in most cases < 250 MPa.
   A further disadvantage of many commercial magnesium materials lies in the fact that they
   have only a small difference between the strength Rm and the proof stress Rp. In the case of
   plastically formable implants, for example cardiovascular stents, this means that, once the
10 material starts to deform, no further resistance opposes the deformation and the regions
   already plastically deformed are deformed further without a rise in load, whereby parts of
   the component may be overstretched and fracture may occur.
   Many magnesium materials, such as the alloys in the AZ group, also demonstrate a
is considerably pronounced mechanical asymmetry, which manifests itself in contrast to the
   mechanical properties, in particular the proof stress Rp under tensile or compressive load.
   Asymmetries of this type are produced for example during forming processes, such as
   extrusion, rolling, or drawing, for production of suitable semifinished products. If the
   difference between the proof stress Rp under tensile load and the proof stress Rp under
20 compressive load is too great, this may lead, in the case of a component that will be
   subsequently deformed multiaxially, such as a cardiovascular stent, to inhomogeneous
   deformation with the result of cracking and fracture.
   Generally, due to the low number of crystallographic slip systems, magnesium alloys may
25 also form textures during forming processes, such as extrusion, rolling or drawing, for the
   production of suitable semifinished products as a result of the orientation of the grains
   during the forming process. More specifically, this means that the semifinished product has
   different properties in different spatial directions. For example, after the forming process,
   there is high deformability or elongation at failure in one spatial direction and reduced
30 deformability or elongation at failure in another spatial direction. The formation of such
   textures is likewise to be avoided, since, in the case of a stent, high plastic deformation is
   impressed and a reduced elongation at failure increases the risk of implant failure. One

                                                 -5
   method for largely avoiding such textures during forming is the setting of the finest
   possible grain before the forming process. At room temperature, magnesium materials
   have only a low deformation capacity characterized by slip in the base plane due to their
   hexagonal lattice structure. If the material additionally has a coarse microstructure, that is
 5 to say a coarse grain, what is known as twin formation will be forced in the event of further
   deformation, wherein shear strain takes place, which transfers a crystal region into a
   position axially symmetrical with respect to the starting position.
   The twin grain boundaries thus produced constitute weak points in the material, at which,
10 specifically in the event of plastic deformation, crack initiation starts and ultimately leads
   to destruction of the component.
   If implant materials have a sufficiently fine grain, the risk of such an implant failure is then
   highly reduced. Implant materials should therefore have the finest possible grain so as to
is avoid an undesired shear strain of this type.
   All available commercial magnesium materials for implants are subject to severe corrosive
   attack in physiological media. The prior art attempts to confine the tendency for corrosion
   by providing the implants with an anti-corrosion coating, for example formed from
20 polymeric substances (EP 2 085 100 A2, EP 2 384 725 Al), an aqueous or alcoholic
   conversion solution (DE 10 2006 060 501 Al), or an oxide (DE 10 2010 027 532 Al,
   EP 0 295 397 Al).
   The use of polymeric passivation layers is highly disputed, since practically all
   corresponding polymers sometimes also produce high levels of inflammation in the tissue.
25 Thin structures without protective measures of this type do not achieve the necessary
   support times. The corrosion at thin-walled traumatological implants often accompanies an
   excessively quick loss of strength, which is additionally encumbered by the formation of
   an excessively large amount of hydrogen per unit of time. This results in undesirable gas
   enclosures in the bones and tissue.
30

                                                 -6
   In the case of traumatological implants having relatively large cross sections, there is a
   need to selectively control the hydrogen problem and the corrosion rate of the implant over
   its structure.
 5 Specifically in the case of biologically degradable implants, there is a desire for maximum
   body-compatibility of the elements, since, during degradation, all contained chemical
   elements are received by the body. Here, highly toxic elements, such as Be, Cd, Pb, Cr and
   the like, should be avoided in any case.
10 Degradable magnesium alloys are particularly suitable for producing implants that have
   been used in a wide range of embodiments in modem medical engineering. For example,
   implants are used to support vessels, hollow organs and vein systems (endovascular
   implants, for example stents), to fasten and temporarily fix tissue implants and tissue
   transplants, but also for orthopedic purposes, for example as pins, plates or screws. A
is particularly frequently used form of an implant is the stent.
   In particular, the implantation of stents has become established as one of the most effective
   therapeutic measures in the treatment of vascular diseases. Stents are used to perform a
   supporting function in a patient's hollow organs. For this purpose, stents of conventional
20 design have a filigree supporting structure formed from metal struts, which is initially
   provided in a compressed form for insertion into the body and is expanded at the site of
   application. One of the main fields of application of such stents is the permanent or
   temporary widening and maintained opening of vascular constrictions, in particular of
   constrictions (stenoses) of the coronary vessels. In addition, aneurysm stents are also
25 known for example, which are used primarily to seal the aneurysm. The supporting
   function is provided in addition.
   The implant, in particular the stent, has a main body formed from an implant material. An
   implant material is a non-living material, which is used for an application in the field of
30 medicine and interacts with biological systems. Basic preconditions for the use of a
   material as implant material that comes into contact with the bodily environment when
   used as intended is its compatibility with the body (biocompatibility). Biocompatibility is

                                                -7
   understood to mean the ability of a material to induce a suitable tissue response in a
   specific application. This includes an adaptation of the chemical, physical, biological and
   morphological surface properties of an implant to the receiver tissue with the objective of a
   clinically desired interaction. The biocompatibility of the implant material is also
 5 dependent on the progression over time of the response of the biosystem into which the
   material has been implanted. Relatively short-term irritation and inflammation thus occur
   and may lead to tissue changes. Biological systems therefore respond differently according
   to the properties of the implant material. The implant materials can be divided into
   bioactive, bioinert and degradable/resorbable materials in accordance with the response of
10 the biosystem.
   Implant materials comprise polymers, metal materials and ceramic materials (for example
   as a coating). Biocompatible metals and metal alloys for permanent implants include
   stainless steels for example (such as 316L), cobalt-based alloys (such as CoCrMo cast
is alloys, CoCrMo forged alloys, CoCrWNi forged alloys and CoCrNiMo forged alloys),
   pure titanium and titanium alloys (for example cp titanium, TiAl6V4 or TiAl6Nb7) and
   gold alloys. In the field of biocorrodible stents, the use of magnesium or pure iron as well
   as biocorrodible master alloys of the elements magnesium, iron, zinc, molybdenum and
   tungsten is recommended.
20
   The use of biocorrodible magnesium alloys for temporary implants having filigree
   structures is in particular hindered by the fact that the implant degrades very rapidly in
   vivo. Various approaches are under discussion for reducing the corrosion rate, that is to say
   the degradation rate. On the one hand, it is attempted to slow down the degradation on the
25 part of the implant material as a result of suitable alloy development. On the other hand,
   coatings are to temporarily inhibit the degradation. Although the previous approaches were
   very promising, it has not yet been possible to produce a commercially obtainable product.
   Rather, irrespective of the previous efforts, there is still an ongoing need for solution
   approaches that enable at least temporary reduction of the in vivo corrosion with
30 simultaneous optimization of the mechanical properties of magnesium alloys.

                                                -8
   With this prior art, the objects of the invention are to provide a biologically degradable
   magnesium alloy and a method for production thereof, which make it possible to keep the
   magnesium matrix of the implant in an electrochemically stable state over the necessary
   support time with fine grain and high corrosion resistance without protective layers and to
 5 utilize the formation of intermetallic phases that are electrochemically less noble compared
   to the magnesium matrix with simultaneous improvement of the mechanical properties,
   such as the increase in strength and proof stress as well as the reduction of the mechanical
   asymmetry, to set the degradation rate of the implants.
10 This object is achieved by a magnesium alloy having the features in claim 1 and by a
   method having the features in claim 12.
   Advantageous developments of the magnesium alloy according to the invention and of the
   method according to the invention for production of said magnesium alloy are possible by
is means of the features specified in the dependent claims.
   The solution according to the invention is based on the awareness of ensuring resistance to
   corrosion and resistance to stress corrosion and vibration corrosion of the magnesium
   matrix of the implant over the support period, such that the implant is able to withstand
20 ongoing multi-axial stress without fracture or cracking, and simultaneously to use the
   magnesium matrix as a store for the degradation initiated by the physiological fluids.
   This is achieved in that the magnesium alloy comprises:
   no more than 3.0% by weight of Zn, no more than 0.6% by weight of Ca, with the rest
25 being formed by magnesium containing impurities, which favor electrochemical potential
   differences and/or promote the formation of intermetallic phases, in a total amount of no
   more than 0.005% by weight of Fe, Si, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Al, Zr and P, wherein the alloy
   contains elements selected from the group of rare earths with the atomic number 21, 39, 57
   to 71 and 89 to 103 in a total amount of no more than 0.002% by weight.
30

                                                  -9
   The magnesium alloy according to the invention has an extraordinarily high resistance to
   corrosion, which is achieved as a result of the fact that the fractions of the impurity
   elements and the combination thereof in the magnesium matrix are extraordinarily reduced
   and at the same time precipitation-hardenable and solid-solution-hardenable elements are
 5 to be added, said alloy, after thermomechanical treatment, having such electrochemical
   potential differences between the matrix in the precipitated phases that the precipitated
   phases do not accelerate corrosion of the matrix in physiological media or slow down said
   corrosion.
10 Applicant has surprisingly found the following two aspects:
   First the alloy contains an intermetallic phase Ca 2 Mg6 Zn 3 and/or Mg 2 Ca in a volume
   fraction of close to 0 to 2.0% and the phase MgZn is avoided, if the content of Zn is
   preferably 0.1 to 2.5% by weight, particularly preferably 0.1 to 1.6% by weight, and the
   content of Ca is no more than 0.5% by weight, more preferably 0.001 to 0.5% by weight,
is and particularly preferably at least 0.1 to 0.45 % by weight.
   Second, compared to the conventional alloy matrices, intermetallic phases Mg 2 Ca and
   Ca 2 Mg6 Zn3 , in particular in each case in a volume fraction of at most 2%, are primarily
   formed, if the alloy matrix contains 0.1 to 0.3% by weight of Zn and also 0.2 to 0.6% by
20 weight of Ca and/or a ratio of the content of Zn to the content of Ca no more than 20,
   preferably no more than 10, more preferably no more than 3 and particularly preferably no
   more than 1.
   The alloy matrix has an increasingly positive electrode potential with respect to the
25 intermetallic phase Ca 2 Mg6 Zn 3 and with respect to the intermetallic phase Mg 2Ca, which
   means that the intermetallic phase Mg 2 Ca is less noble in relation to the intermetallic phase
   Ca 2 Mg6 Zn 3 and both intermetallic phases are simultaneously less noble with respect to the
   alloy matrix. The two phases Mg 2 Ca and Ca 2 Mg6 Zn 3 are therefore at least as noble as the
   matrix phase or are less noble than the matrix phase in accordance with the subject matter
30 of the present patent application. Both intermetallic phases are brought to precipitation in

                                                  - 10
   the desired scope as a result of a suitable heat treatment before, during and after the
   forming process in a regime defined by the temperature and the holding period, whereby
   the degradation rate of the alloy matrix can be set. As a result of this regime, the
 5 precipitation of the intermetallic phase MgZn can also be avoided practically completely.
   The last-mentioned phase is therefore to be avoided in accordance with the subject matter
   of this patent application, since it has a more positive potential compared to the alloy
   matrix, that is to say is much more noble compared to the alloy matrix, that is to say it acts
   in a cathodic manner. This leads undesirably to the fact that the anodic reaction, that is to
10 say the corrosive dissolution of a component of the material, takes place at the material
   matrix, which leads to destruction of the cohesion of the matrix and therefore to
   destruction of the component. This destruction therefore also progresses continuously,
   because particles that are more noble are continuously exposed by the corrosion of the
   matrix and the corrosive attack never slows, down, but is generally accelerated further as a
is result of the enlargement of the cathode area.
   In the case of the precipitation of particles which are less noble than the matrix, that is to
   say have a more negative electrochemical potential than the matrix, it is not the material
   matrix that is corrosively dissolved, but the particles themselves. This dissolution of the
20 particles in turn leaves behind a substantially electrochemically homogenous surface of the
   matrix material, which, due to this lack of electrochemical inhomogeneities, already has a
   much lower tendency for corrosion and, specifically also due to the use of highly pure
   materials, itself has yet greater resistance to corrosion.
25 A further surprising result is that, in spite of Zr freedom or Zr contents much lower than
   those specified in the prior art, a grain refinement effect can be achieved that is attributed
   to the intermetallic phases Ca 2 Mg6 Zn 3 and/or Mg 2 Ca, which block movement of the grain
   boundaries, delimit the grain size during recrystallization, and thereby avoid an undesirable
   grain growth, wherein the values for the yield points and strength are simultaneously
30 increased.

                                               - 11
   A reduction of the Zr content is therefore also particularly desirable because the dynamic
   recrystallization of magnesium alloys is suppressed by Zr. This result in the fact that alloys
   containing Zr have to be fed more and more energy during or after a forming process than
   alloys free from Zr in order to achieve complete recrystallization. A higher energy feed in
 5 turn signifies higher forming temperatures and a greater risk of uncontrolled grain growth
   during the heat treatment. This is avoided in the case of the Mg/Zn/Ca alloys free from Zr
   described here.
   Within the context of the above-mentioned mechanical properties, a Zr content of no more
10 than 0.0003% by weight, preferably no more than 0.0001% by weight, is therefore
   advantageous for the magnesium alloy according to the invention.
   The previously known tolerance limits for impurities do not take into account the fact that
   magnesium wrought alloys are in many cases subject to a thermomechanical treatment, in
is particular a relatively long annealing process, as a result of which structures close to
   equilibrium structures are produced. Here, the metal elements interconnect as a result of
   diffusion and form what are known as intermetallic phases, which have a different
   electrochemical potential, in particular a much greater potential, compared to the
   magnesium matrix, whereby these phases act as cathodes and can trigger galvanic
20 corrosion processes.
   The applicant has found that, if the following tolerance limits of individual impurities are
   observed, the formation of intermetallic phases of this type is reliably no longer to be
   expected:
25 Fe    0.0005% by weight,
   Si   0.0005% by weight,
   Mn      0.0005% by weight,
   Co     0.0002% by weight, preferably    0.0001% by weight,
   Ni    0.0002% by weight, preferably    0.0001% by weight,
30 Cu     0.0002% by weight,
   Al    0.001% by weight,
   Zr    0.0003% by weight, preferably    0.0001

                                                - 12
   P    0.0001% by weight, preferably      0.00005.
   With a combination of the impurity elements, the formation of the intermetallic phases
   more noble than the alloy matrix then ceases if the sum of the individual impurities of Fe,
 5 Si, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu and Al is no more than 0.004% by weight, preferably no more than
   0.0032% by weight, even more preferably no more than 0.002% by weight and particularly
   preferably no more than 0.001% by weight, the content of Al is no more than 0.001% by
   weight, and the content of Zr is preferably no more than 0.0003% by weight, preferably no
   more than 0.0001% by weight.
10
   The active mechanisms by which the aforementioned impurities impair the resistance to
   corrosion of the material are different.
   If small Fe particles form in the alloy as a result of an excessively high Fe content, these
is particles act as cathodes for corrosive attack; the same is true for Ni and Cu.
   Furthermore, Fe and Ni with Zr in particular, but also Fe, Ni and Cu with Zr can also
   precipitate as intermetallic particles in the melt; these also act as very effective cathodes
   for the corrosion of the matrix.
20
   Intermetallic particles with a very high potential difference compared to the matrix and a
   very high tendency for formation are the phases formed from Fe and Si and also from Fe,
   Mn and Si, which is why contaminations with these elements also have to be kept as low as
   possible.
25
   P contents should be reduced as far as possible, since, even with minimal quantities, Mg
   phosphides form and very severely impair the mechanical properties of the structure.
   Such low concentrations therefore ensure that the magnesium matrix no longer has any
30 intermetallic phases having a more positive electrochemical potential compared to the
   matrix.

                                                 - 13
   In the magnesium alloy according to the invention, the individual elements from the group
   of rare earths and scandium (atomic number 21, 39, 57 to 71 and 89 to 103) contribute no
   more than 0.001% by weight, preferably no more than 0.0003% by weight and particularly
   preferably no more than 0.0001% by weight, to the total amount.
 5
   These additives make it possible to increase the strength of the magnesium matrix and to
   increase the electrochemical potential of the matrix, whereby an effect that reduces
   corrosion, in particular with respect to physiological media, is set.
10 The precipitations preferably have a size of no more than 2.0 pm, preferably of no more
   than 1.0 pm, particularly preferably no more than 200nm, distributed dispersely at the
   grain boundaries or inside the grain.
   For applications in which the materials are subject to plastic deformation and in which high
15 ductility and possibly also a low ratio yield point (low ratio yield point  = yield point/tensile
   strength) - that is to say high hardening - is desirable, a size of the precipitates between
   100 nm and 1 pm, preferably between 200 nm and 1 pim, is particularly preferred. For
   example, this concerns vascular implants, in particular stents.
20 For applications in which the materials are subject to no plastic deformation or only very
   low plastic deformation, the size of the precipitates is preferably no more than 200 nm.
   This is the case for example with orthopedic implants, such as screws for osteosynthesis
   implants.   The precipitates     may    particularly  preferably   have   a   size, below     the
   aforementioned preferred range, of no more than 50 nm and still more preferably no more
25 than 20 nm.
   Here, the precipitates are dispersely distributed at the grain boundaries and inside the grain,
   whereby the movement of grain boundaries in the event of a thermal or thermomechanical
   treatment and also displacements in the event of deformation are hindered and the strength
30 of the magnesium alloy is increased.

                                                 - 14
   The magnesium alloy according to the invention achieves a strength of > 275 MPa,
   preferably > 300 MPa, a yield point of > 200 MPa, preferably > 225 MPa, and a ratio yield
   point of < 0.8, preferably < 0.75, wherein the difference between strength and yield point is
   > 50 MPa, preferably > 100 MPa, and the mechanical asymmetry is < 1.25.
 5
   These significantly improved mechanical properties of the new magnesium alloys ensure
   that the implants, for example cardiovascular stents, withstand the ongoing multi-axial load
   in the implanted state over the entire support period, in spite of initiation of the degradation
   of the magnesium matrix as a result of corrosion.
10
   For minimization of the mechanical asymmetry, it is of particular importance for the
   magnesium alloy to have a particularly fine microstructure with a grain size of no more
   than 5.0 ptm, preferably no more than 3.0 tm, and particularly preferably no more than 1.0
   ptm without considerable electrochemical potential differences compared to the matrix
15 phases.
   The object of the invention is also achieved by a method for producing a magnesium alloy
   having improved mechanical and electrochemical properties. The method comprises the
   following steps
20 a)   producing a highly pure magnesium by means of vacuum distillation;
   b)   producing a cast billet of the alloy as a result of synthesis of the magnesium according
        to step a) with highly pure Zn and Ca in a composition of no more than 3.0% by
        weight of Zn, no more than 0.6% by weight of Ca, with the rest being formed by
        magnesium containing impurities, which favor electrochemical potential differences
25      and/or promote the formation of intermetallic phases, in a total amount of no more
        than 0.005% by weight of Fe, Si, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Al, Zr and P, wherein the alloy
        contains elements selected from the group of rare earths with the atomic number 21,
        39, 57 to 71 and 89 to 103 in a total amount of no more than 0.002% by weight;
   c)   homogenizing the alloy at least once and, in so doing, bringing the alloy constituents
30      into complete solution by annealing in one or more annealing steps at one or more
        successively increasing temperatures between 300'C and 450'C with a holding period
        of 0.5 h to 40 h in each case;

                                                 - 15
   d)   optionally ageing the homogenized alloy between 100 and 450'C for 0.5 h to 20 h;
   e)   forming the homogenized alloy at least once in a simple manner in a temperature
        range between 150'C and 375'C;
   f)   optionally ageing the homogenized alloy between 100 and 450'C for 0.5h to 20 h;
 5 g)   selectively carrying out a heat treatment of the formed alloy in the temperature range
        between 100'C and 325'C with a holding period from 1 min to 10 h, preferred from
         1min to 6h, still more preferred from 1min to 3h.
   A content of from 0.1 to 0.3% by weight of Zn and from 0.2 to 0.4% by weight of Ca
10 and/or a ratio of Zn to Ca of no more than 20, preferably of no more than 10 and
   particularly preferably of no more than 3 ensures that a volume fraction of at most up to
   2% of the intermetallic phase and of the separable phases Ca 2 Mg 6 Zn 3 and Mg 2 Ca are
   produced in the matrix lattice. The electrochemical potential of both phases differs
   considerably, wherein the phase Ca 2 Mg6 Zn 3 generally has a more positive electrode
is potential than the phase Mg 2Ca. Furthermore the electrochemical potential of               the
   Ca 2 Mg6 Zn 3 phase is almost equal compared to the matrix phase, because in alloy systems,
   in which only the phase Ca 2 Mg6 Zn 3 is precipitated in the matrix phase, no visible corrosive
   attack takes place. The Ca 2 Mg 6 Zn 3 and/or Mg 2 Ca phases can be brought to precipitation in
   the desired scope before, during and/or after the forming in step e) - in particular
20 alternatively or additionally during the ageing process - in a regime preselected by the
   temperature and the holding period, whereby the degradation rate of the alloy matrix can
   be set. As a result of this regime, the precipitation of the intermetallic phase MgZn can also
   be avoided practically completely.
25

                                                 - 16
   This regime is determined in particular in its minimum value T by the following formula:
                                       T>(40 x (%Zn)+50)) (in.0 C)
   The aforementioned formula is used to calculate the upper limit value determined by the
 5 Zn content of the alloy, wherein the following boundary conditions apply however;
   -    for the upper limit value of the ageing temperature in method step d) and/or f), the
        following is true for T: 100 0 C     T    450'C, preferably T: 1000 C     T    350'C, still
        more preferred 100 C       T   275'C.
   -    in the case of the maximum temperature during the at least one forming step in method
10      step e), the following is true for T: 150'C   T    375'C.
   -    in the case of the above-mentioned heat treatment step in method step g), the
        following is true for T: 100 0 C   T   325'C.
   Specifically for the production of alloy matrices with low Zn content, attention may have
is to be paid, in contrast to the specified formula, to ensure that the aforementioned minimum
   temperatures are observed, since, if said temperatures are not met, the necessary diffusion
   processes cannot take place in commercially realistic times, or, in the case of method step
   e), impractical low forming temperatures may be established.
20 The upper limit of the temperature T in method step d) and/or f) ensures that a sufficient
   number of small, finely distributed particles not growing too excessively as a result of
   coagulation is present before the forming step.
   The upper limit of the temperature T in method step e) ensures that a sufficient spacing
25 from the temperatures at which the material melts is observed. In addition, the amount of
   heat produced during the forming process and likewise fed to the material should also be
   monitored in this case.
   The upper limit of the temperature T in method step g) in turn ensures that a sufficient
30 volume fraction of particles is obtained, and, as a result of the high temperatures, that a
   fraction of the alloy elements that is not too high is brought into solution. Furthermore, as a

                                                 - 17
   result of this limitation of the temperature T, it is to be ensured that the volume fraction of
   the produced particles is too low to cause an effective increase in strength.
   The intermetallic phases Ca 2 Mg 6 Zn 3 and Mg 2Ca, besides their anti-corrosion effect, also
 5 have the surprising effect of a grain refinement, produced by the forming process, which
   leads to a significant increase in the strength and proof stress. It is thus possible to dispense
   with Zr particles or particles containing Zr as an alloy element and to reduce the
   temperatures for recrystallization.
10 The vacuum distillation is preferably capable of producing a starting material for a highly
   pure magnesium/zinc/calcium alloy with the stipulated limit values.
   The total amount of impurities and the content of the additive elements triggering the
   precipitation hardening and solid solution hardening and also increasing the matrix
   potential can be set selectively and are presented in% by weight:
15
   a) for the individual impurities:
   Fe     0.0005; Si ! 0.0005; Mn    K 0.0005; Co     0.0002, preferably     0.0001% by weight; Ni
   <   0.0002, preferably     0.0001; Cu     K 0.0002; Al    K 0.001; Zr       0.0003, in particular
   preferably     0.0001; P   0.0001, in particular preferably     0.00005;
20
   b) for the combination of individual impurities in total:
   Fe, Si, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu und Al no more than 0.004%, preferably no more than 0.0032% by
   weight, more preferably no more than 0.002% by weight and particularly preferably 0.001,
   the content of Al no more than 0.001, and the content of Zr preferably no more than
25 0.0003, in particular preferably no more than 0.0001;
   c) for the additive elements:
   rare earths in a total amount of no more than 0.001 and the individual additive elements in
   each case no more than 0.0003, preferably 0.0001.
30
   It is particularly advantageous that the method according to the invention has a low number
   of forming steps. Extrusion, co-channel angle pressing and/or also a multiple forging can

                                                 - 18
   thus preferably be used, which ensure that a largely homogeneously fine grain of no more
   than 5.0 pm, preferably no more than 3.0 tm and particularly preferably no more than 1.0
   pm, is achieved.
 5 As a result of the heat treatment, Ca 2 Mg6 Zn 3 and/or Mg 2 Ca precipitates form, of which the
   size may be up to a few pm. As a result of suitable process conditions during the
   production process by means of casting and the forming processes, it is possible however
   to achieve intermetallic particles having a size between no more than 2.0 pLm, and
   preferably no more than 1.0 tm particularly preferably no more than 200 nm.
10
   The precipitates in the fine-grain structure are dispersely distributed at the grain boundaries
   and inside the grains, whereby the strength of the alloy reaches values that, at > 275 MPa,
   preferably > 300 MPa, are much greater than those in the prior art.
is The Ca 2 Mg 6 Zn 3 and/or Mg 2 Ca precipitates are present within this fine-grain structure in a
   size of no more than 2.0 n, preferably no more than 1.0 tm.
   A size of the precipitates between 100 nm and 1.0 pLm, preferably between 200 nm and 1.0
   rim, are particularly preferred for applications in which the materials are subject to plastic
20 deformation and in which high ductility and possibly also a low ratio yield point (low ratio
   yield point =  yield point/tensile strength) - that is to say high hardening - is desired. For
   example, this concerns vascular implants, in particular stents.
   Preferably for applications in which the materials are subject to no plastic deformation or
25 only very low plastic deformation, the size of the precipitates is no more than 200 nm. This
   is the case for example with orthopedic implants, such as screws for osteosynthesis
   implants.   The precipitates     may    particularly  preferably   have    a  size, below    the
   aforementioned preferred range, of no more than 50 nm and most preferably no more than
   20 nm.
30
   A third aspect of the invention concerns the use of the magnesium alloy produced by the
   method and having the above-described advantageous composition and structure in

                                                 - 19
   medical engineering, in particular for the production of implants, for example endovascular
   implants such as stents, for fastening and temporarily fixing tissue implants and tissue
   transplants, orthopedic implants, dental implants and neuro implants.

   This alloy, in solution, is subjected to homogenization annealing at a temperature of 400'C
   for a period of 1 h and then aged for 4 h at 200'C. The material is then subjected to

   a cardio vascular stent.

   precision tube for a cardiovascular stent.
20 Hardness-increasing Mg 2 Ca particles can be precipitated in intermediate ageing treatments;
   these annealing can take place at a temperature from 180 to 210'C for 6 to 12 hours and
   leads to an additional particle hardening as a result of the precipitation of a further family
   of Mg 2 Ca particles.
25 As a result of this exemplary method, the grain size can be set to < 5.0 pm or < 1 pm after
   adjustment of the parameters.

is This alloy, in solution, is subjected to a first homogenization annealing process at a
   temperature of 350'C for a period of 20 h and is then subjected to a second
   homogenization annealing process at a temperature of 400'C for a period of 6 h, and is
   then subjected to multiple extrusion at a temperature from 250 to 350'C to produce a
   precision tube for a cardiovascular stent. Annealing then takes place at a temperature from
20 250 to 300'C for 5 to 10 min. Metallic phases Ca 2 Mg6 Zn 3 are predominantly precipitated
   out as a result of this process from various heat treatments.

   < 270 MPa.
   Example 4:
   A further magnesium alloy having the composition 1.0% by weight of Zn and 0.3% by
30 weight of Ca, with the rest being formed by Mg with the following individual impurities
   in% by weight is to be produced:

   This alloy, in solution, is subjected to a first homogenization annealing process at a
   temperature of 350'C for a period of 20 h and is then subjected to a second

   then subjected to multiple extrusion at a temperature from 270 to 350'C to produce a
is precision tube for a cardio vascular stent. Alternatively to these steps, ageing at
   approximately at 250'C with a holding period of 2 hours can take place after the second
   homogenization annealing process and before the forming process. In addition, an
   annealing process at a temperature of 325'C can take place for 5 to 10 min as a completion
   process after the forming process. As a result of these processes, in particular as a result of
20 the heat regime during the extrusion process, both the phase Ca 2 Mg 6 Zn 3 and also the phase
   Mg 2 Ca can be precipitated.
   The grain size can be set to < 2.0 pm as a result of this method.

   as a result of the heat regime during the extrusion process the phase Mg 2 Ca can be
   precipitated.
