       A catheter shaft is produced by forming a first polymeric layer onto a flexible
5 inner core while maintaining the inner core in a solid state, and solidifying the first
  polymeric layer, wherein the solidified first polymeric layer fails to bond with the
  inner core and is slidable thereon upon flexion of the shaft. A second polymeric
  layer may be formed over the first polymeric layer, and is slidable thereon when
  the shaft bends.

    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
     1. Field of the Invention.
 L0        [0002]    This invention relates to instruments for performing medical exami
    nations of the interior of cavities or tubes of the body. More particularly, this in
    vention relates to a medical catheter constructed by a process for applying fluent
    materials to a surface or part of a surface.
    2. Description of the Related Art.
 L5        [0003]    It is common to map and ablate endocardial tissue in subjects hav
    ing electrical conduction abnormalities. The procedures are performed with an
    elongate catheter having a lumen extending longitudinally through it. One tech
    nique, described in U.S. Patent No. 5,993,462, involves inserting a core wire into a
    catheter via the lumen. The core wire includes a pre-shaped region. Such cathe
20  ters includes a proximal section that is sufficiently rigid to straighten the core wire
    when the core wire is disposed within the proximal section. A distal section of the
    catheter is significantly more flexible than the proximal section.
           [0004]    Deflectable catheters are widely used for a variety of applications.
    In the area of electrophysiology. However, due to their inherent flexibility and
25  limited kink resistance, catheters can be difficult to control as precisely as would
    be desired. Conventional approaches to increasing kink resistance include: in
    creasing wall thickness, reinforcing the wall with a coil, replacing a large open
    lumen with a multi-lumen arrangement, or changing the material so that it can
    stretch and bend more easily.

    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
          [0005]     According to disclosed embodiments of the invention, a catheter
    shaft is constructed using multiple film-cast, extruded or coextruded layers of ma
    terials that do not chemically bond together. The layers are in extremely good
  5 mechanical contact, but when the construction is bent, they are able to slip with
    respect to each other, which makes the tube more resistant to kinking.
          [0006]     There is provided according to embodiments of the invention a
    method of making a catheter shaft, which is carried out by forming a first polymer
    ic layer onto a flexible inner core while maintaining the inner core in a solid state,
 10 and solidifying the first polymeric layer, wherein the solidified first polymeric
    layer fails to bond with the inner core and is slidable thereon upon flexion of the
    inner core.
          [0007]     According to one aspect of the invention wherein forming the first
    polymeric layer is extruded.
 L5       [0008]     According to yet another aspect of the method, the first polymeric
    layer is film cast.
          [0009]     A further aspect of the method is carried out by forming a second
    polymeric layer onto the solidified polymeric first layer, and solidifying the sec
    ond polymeric layer, wherein the solidified second polymeric layer fails to bond
 )0 with the solidified first polymeric layer and is slidable thereon upon flexion of the
    inner core.
          [0010]     According to an additional aspect of the method, the second poly
    meric layer is extruded.
          [0011]     According to still another aspect of the method, the second poly
25  meric is film cast.
          [0012]     According to yet another aspect of the method, a kinetic coefficient
    of friction between the solidified first polymeric layer and the solidified second
    polymeric layer does not exceed 0.5.
          [0013]     According to still another aspect of the method the solidified first
30  polymeric layer and the solidified second polymeric layer are composed of iden
    tical materials.
                                                  2

           [0014]   According to an additional aspect of the method, the solidified first
    polymeric layer and the solidified second polymeric layer are composed of poly
    imide.
           [0015]   According to a further aspect of the method the solidified first pol
  5 ymeric layer and the solidified second polymeric layer are composed of different
    materials.
           [0016]   According to another aspect of the method, one of the solidified first
    polymeric layer and the solidified second polymeric layer is ultra-high-molecular
    weight polyethylene and another of the solidified first polymeric layer and the so
 LO lidified second polymeric layer is polyether block amide.
           [0017]   According to one aspect of the method, the inner core includes a
    metallic braid.
           [0018]   There is further provided according to embodiments of the inven
    tion a catheter shaft having a flexible inner core, a first polymeric layer formed
 L5 onto the flexible inner core, and a second polymeric layer onto the first polymeric
    layer, wherein upon flexion of the flexible inner core the first polymeric layer is
    slidable on the flexible inner core and on the second polymeric layer.

30  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
           [0023]   In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth
    in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various principles of the
                                                   3

    present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that not all
    these details are necessarily needed for practicing the present invention. In this
    instance, well-known circuits, control logic, and the details of computer program
    instructions for conventional algorithms and processes have not been shown in
  5 detail in order not to obscure the general concepts unnecessarily.
          [0024]     Documents incorporated by reference herein are to be considered
    an integral part of the application except that, to the extent that any terms are de
    fined in these incorporated documents in a manner that conflicts with definitions
    made explicitly or implicitly in the present specification, only the definitions in the
 LO present specification should be considered.
          [0025]     Turning now to the drawings, reference is initially made to Fig. 1,
    which is a schematic diagram of a medical catheter 10 according to an embodi
    ment of the invention. The catheter 10 comprises an elongated shaft 12 having a
    relatively stiff proximal section 14, relatively flexible distal section 16 with respect
 L5 to the proximal section 14 and an intermediate section 18. One or more electrodes
    or other devices are mounted on the distal section 16 for performing mapping, ab
    lation or another desired function, and a control handle 20 is located at the proxi
    mal section 14 of the shaft 12. An infusion tube 22 is provided to introduce fluid
    through a lumen (not shown) of the shaft 12. A luer hub 24 is mounted on the prox
 >0 imal end of the infusion tube 22 to facilitate introduction of the fluid into the cathe
    ter 10.
          [0026]     Reference is now made to Fig. 2, which is a cross sectional view of
    the shaft 12 (Fig. 1) in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The shaft
    is constructed by extrusion or coextrusion of thermoplastic materials, as de
25  scribed in the detailed description below. In the depicted embodiment, the
    shaft 12 includes lumens 26, 28, 30, 32 surrounded by a relatively soft inner extru
    sion 34, which is drawn through a metallic braid 36. While 4 lumens are shown, a
    catheter may comprise more or fewer lumens, depending on the application in
    tended.
30        [0027]     The inner extrusion 34 and braid 36 are surrounded by a series of
    layers. Respective outer, middle, and inner layers 38, 40, 42 are shown in the ex
    ample of Fig. 2; however, the shaft 12 may be constructed with more or fewer lay
    ers. The layers may be applied in successive extrusion operations using conven
                                                   4

    tional screw extruders, preferably having barrel cooling systems to obtain good
    mixing efficiency and melt uniformity, and to avoid surge effects. Dealing with
    these issues is well known in the extrusion art, and is not dealt with further herein.
    Alternatively, the layers may be coextruded with the inner extrusion 34.
  5        [0028]  It is important that the layers 38, 40, 42 and the inner extrusion 34
    do not bond to one another, although they are in close physical proximity; indeed
    in "contact with one another. This requirement enables the layers 38, 40, 42 and
    the inner extrusion 34 to slide upon one another when the shaft flexes. The lay
    ers 38, 40, 42 may be constructed of the same material, e.g., polyimide or a ther
 LO moplastic such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), Pebax®, Polyurethane," or
    NylonTM. If a thermoplastic is used, layers can be prevented from bonding to one
    another by keeping each successive inner layer below the melt point of a current
    ly extruding outer layer. When identical materials are used bonding can be
    avoided if the inner layer is cold and the outer extrusion is put on with at a tem
 15 perature that is barely high enough for the material to flow. In that case as soon as
    the outer extrusion touches the inner layer it cools immediately and does not melt
    into the inner core and form a bond. When film casting is used with polyimide, if
    the inner layer is solidified it does not make a bond with the outer layer.
           [0029]  Alternatively, the shaft 12 may be built up by alternating layers of
 >0 different materials that do not bond to each other, for example, ultra-high
    molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and a polyether block amide, such as
    Pebax.
           [0030]  Regardless of the materials chosen, it is desirable that there be a
    low kinetic coefficient of friction between adjacent layers 38, 40, 42 and also be
25  tween the layer 38 and the inner extrusion 34. A coefficient of friction of 0.5 is sat
    isfactory.
           [0031]  Reference is now made to Fig. 3, which is are schematic longitudinal
    sections of portions of the shaft 12 in accordance with an embodiment of the inven
    tion. In the upper portion of the figure, the shaft 12 is extended. On one side of the
30  shaft 12 marker 44 in the outer layer 38, marker 46 in middle layer 40 and mark
    er 48 in inner layer 42 are aligned with one another and with reference marker 50
    in the inner extrusion 34. On the opposite side of the shaft 12, marker 52 in the
                                                  5

    outer layer 38, marker 54 in the middle layer 40 and marker 56 in the inner lay
    er 42 are also aligned with reference marker 50.
           [0032]   In the lower portion of the figure the shaft 12 is in a state of flexion at
    an angle of nearly 90 degrees about a pivot point 58. The markers 44, 46, 48, and
  5 markers 52, 54, 56 are no longer in alignment with one another nor with the refer
    ence marker 50, because the layers 38, 40, 42 have slid over one another and in
    the case of inner layer 42, over the inner extrusion 34. At the right side of the
    shaft 12 the markers 44, 46, 48 are now axially displaced relative to the marker 50,
    generally toward the pivot point 58 in a direction indicated by arrow 60. The
 L0 marker 44 in the outer layer 38 has the largest displacement from the reference
    marker 50, with successively smaller displacements of the markers 46, 48. On the
    opposite side of the shaft 12, the markers 52, 54, 56 are also displaced relative to
    the marker 50, but in an opposite direction, generally away from the pivot point 58
    as indicated by arrow 62. Marker 52 in the outer layer 38 has the largest dis
 L5 placement from the reference marker 50, with successively smaller displacements
    of the markers 54, 56.
           [0033]   Of the three layers 38, 40, 42, the layer 38 is under the most com
    pression. The movement of the layers with respect to each other has prevented
    the shaft 12 from kinking tightly despite the flexion.
 )0 Alternate Embodiment.
           [0034]   Continuing to refer to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, in this embodiment the lay
    ers 38, 40, 42 are formed on the inner extrusion 34, which is now used as a man
    drel by a process of polymer solution casting or film casting, which is known in the
    art. The same materials used in the first embodiment are suitable, as they possess
25  desired characteristics of lubricity and durometer. Moreover, the layers can be
    prevented from bonding to one another by film casting an outer layer onto a solid
    ified inner layer.
           [0035]   It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present
    invention is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described
30  hereinabove.      Rather,  the  scope    of the   present    invention    includes    both
    combinations       and   sub-combinations     of  the   various     features   described
    hereinabove, as well as variations and modifications thereof that are not in the
                                                   6

prior art, which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the
foregoing description.
