                                                           BACKGROUND
   [0003]                  Human immunodeficiency virus infection and related diseases are a major
   public health problem worldwide. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) encodes
20 three enzymes which are required for viral replication: reverse transcriptase, protease, and
   integrase. Although drugs targeting reverse transcriptase and protease are in wide use and
   have shown effectiveness, particularly when employed in combination, toxicity and
   development of resistant strains have limited their usefulness (Palella, et al. N. Engl. J
   Med. (1998) 338:853-860; Richman, D. D. Nature (2001) 410:995-1001).
25
   [0004]                  A goal of antiretroviral therapy is to achieve viral suppression in the HIV
   infected patient. Treatment guidelines published by the United States Department of
   Health and Human Services provide that achievement of viral suppression requires the use
   of combination therapies, i.e., several drugs from at least two or more drug classes. In
30 addition, decisions regarding the treatment of HIV infected patients are complicated when
   the patient requires treatment for other medical conditions. Because the standard of care
   requires the use
                                                                 1

of multiple different drugs to suppress HIV, as well as to treat other conditions the patient
may be experiencing, the potential for drug interaction is a criterion for selection of a drug
regimen, As such, there is a need for antiretroviral therapies having a decreased potential for
drug interactions.

 [0047]       In the following description, certain specific details are set forth in order to
 provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the invention. However, one
 skilled in the art will understand that the invention may be practiced without these details,
 The description below of several embodiments is made with the understanding that the
 present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the claimed subject matter, and
 is not intended to limit the appended claims to the specific embodiments illustrated. The
 headings used throughout this disclosure are provided for convenience only and are not to be
 construed to limit the claims in any way. Embodiments illustrated inder any heading may be

are to be construed in an open, inclusive sense, that is as "including, but not limited to"
[0049]       Reference throughout this specification to "one embodiment" or "an embodiment"
means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the
embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the
appearances of the phrases "in one embodiment" or "in an embodiment" in various places
throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment,
Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any
suitable manner in one or more embodiments.
 [0050]      Embodiments that reference throughout this specification to "a compound" or
"eg. Formulas (I), (II), and/or (III)" includes the polymorphic, salt, co-crystal, and solvate
 forms of the formulas and/or compounds disclosed herein Thus, the appearances or the
phrases "a compound" or "eg. Formulas (I), (II), and/or (III)" includes Forms I-VIII of
Formula I, Form I of Formula II, Forms 1I-I of Formula III, and/or the fumaric acid, citric
acid, and oxalic acid co-crystals as described herein.
 [0051]      The invention disclosed herein is also meant to encompass all pharmaceutically
 acceptable compounds of Formulas (I), (II), and (III) being isotopically-labeled by having
 one or more atoms replaced by an atom having a different atomic mass or mass number.
 Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the disclosed compounds include isotopes
 of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as
 2H,       C , YH, 13,N1 "N, 5o, 17o, 18o,            P3 " S, 'gF, 36C, mi, and l, respectively.
 These radiolabeled compounds could be useful to help determine or measure the
 effectiveness of the compounds, by characterizing, for example, the site or mode of action, or
 binding affinity to pharmacologically important site of action. Certain isotopically-labeled
 compounds of Formulas (1), (II) and (III), for example, those incorporating a radioactive
 isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive
 isotopes tritium, i. , H, and carbon-14, Le. 1C, are particularly useful for this purpose in
 view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.
 [0052]       Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, may afford certain
 therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability. For example, in vivo half
 life may increase or dosage requirements may be reduced. Thus,'heavier isotopes may be
 preferred in some circumstances.

[0053]       Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as IC,      F, 1-O and 1N, can be
useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor
occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds of Fonnulas (I), (II), (I)        can generally be
prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes
analogous to those described in the Examples as set out below using an appropriate
isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.

methanopyrido[l2':4,5]pyrazino[2,1-b][1,3]oxazepin-8-olate may provide the advantage of
bioavailability and stability, suitable for use as an active ingredient in a pharmaceutical
cnnposition.    Variations in the crystal structure of a pharmaceutical drug substance or active
ingredient may affect the dissolution rate (which may affect bioavailability, etc.),
manufacturability (e.g, ease of handling, ability to consistently prepare doses of known
strength) and stability (e.g., thermal stability, shelf life, etc.) of a pharmaceutical drug product
or active ingredient. Such variations may affect the preparation or formulation of
pharmaceutical compositions in different dosage or delivery forms, such as solid oral dosage
form including tablets and capsules. Compared to other forms such as non-crystalline or
amorphous foms, crystalline forms may provide desired or suitable hygroscopicity, particle
size controls, dissolution rate, solubility, purity, physical and chemical stability,
manufacturability, yield, and/or process control. Thus, crystalline forms of potassium

XRPD Data
[0224]       In certain embodiments, the crystalline forms are characterized by the interlattice
plane intenrals determined by an X-ray powder diffraction pattern (XRPD), The
diffractogram of XRPD is typically represented by a diagram plotting the intensity of the
peaks versus the location of the peaks, i.e., diffraction angle 20 (two-theta) in degrees. The
 intensities are often given in parenthesis with the following abbreviations: very strong = vst;
 strong = st; medium = m; weak = w; and very weak = vw. The characteristic peaks of a given
 XRPD can be selected according to the peak locations and their relative intensity to
 conveniently distinguish this crystalline structure from others.
 [0225]      Those skilled in the art recognize that the measurements of the XRPD peak
 locations and/or intensity for a given crystalline form of the same compound will vary within
 a margin of error. The values of degree 20 allow appropriate error margins. Typically, the
 error margins are represented by "" For example, the degree 20 of about "8.7+0.3" denotes
 a range from about 8,7+0.3, i.e., about 9.0, to about 8.7-0.3, i.e., about 8.4. Depending on the
 sample preparation techniques, the calibration techniques applied to the instruments, human
 operational variation, and etc, those skilled in the art recognize that the appropriate error of
 margins for a XRPD can be               04 03; 0.2; 0,1;
                                      +0.5;                     005 or less. In certain
 embodiments of the invention, the XRPD margin of error is 0.2,

 10% RH and held until the so lid and atmosphere reached equilibration. The equilibrium test
was continued until passed or expired after 5 or 10 hours. At this point, RH was raised 10%
higher and the process was repeated until 90% RH was reached and equilibrated, During this
 period, the water sorption was monitored. For desorption, the relative humidity was
 decreased in a similar manner to measure a full sorption/desorption cycle. The cycle was
 optionally repeated. All experiments were operated in dmidt mode (mass variation over time)

as shown in the Tables below (e,g. 100(2) K or 200(2) K). A total number of reflections were
 collected covering the indices, (e.g. -9<=h<=10, -13<=k<=16, -37<=l<=36). Certain
 reflections were found to be symmetry independent, with a Ri value. Indexing and unit-cell
 refinement indicated a crystal system (e.g. monoclinic, triclinic, or orthorhombic lattice). The
 space group, which was uniquely defined by the systematic absences in the data, was found
 (e.g. P1, P2(1), C2, and P21212). The data were integrated using the Bruker SAINT software
 program and scaled using the SADABS software program. Solution by direct methods
 (SHELXT) produced a complete phasing model compatible with the proposed structure.
  [0321]      All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically by full-matrix least-squares
 (SHELXL-2014). All hydrogen atoms were placed using a riding model. Their positions were
 constrained relative to their parent atom using the appropriate HFIX command in SH-IELXL
  2014, Crystallographic data are summarized in tables below. The absolute stereochemistry
  was set to conform to previously studied samples of the same compound.
