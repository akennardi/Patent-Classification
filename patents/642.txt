25           BACKGROUND
             The human gastrointestinal (GI) microbial flora, also called microbiota, contains around
    3.3 million genes compared to around 25,000 genes the human microbiome contains. The total
    composition of these genes is called the Human Gut Microbiome. The wild type, or normal, GI
    microbiota contains in excess of 1,200 to 1,500 various species of bacteria and a small number of
30  viruses and some fungi. There are other components in the GI microbiota, including fibre
    proteins, small levels of unabsorbed carbohydrates, mucus, ash, mineral salts, trace elements,
    fats, micronutrients, dead bacteria and at times undigested food.

                The microbiota in terms of cell numbers make up a very large component of the
        living structures of the human body. The absolute numbers of living bacterial cells within
       the GI microbiota are said to be around 9 times more than all the living cells in the human
       body. Indeed, by cell count, we are 10% human and 90% bacterial flora.
   5            Human GI microbiota are therefore considered a 'virtual organ' which has the
       characteristics of a body organ being 'living', being within our body and having
       characteristics of organogenesis after birth, anatomy, physiology, pathology, and other
       features. The GI microbiota has the potential for being maldeveloped or being infected
       with various parasites, viruses, fungi or bacteria. Hence, treatments for such an organ
  10 need to be developed. Apart from antibiotics and as with other organs, transplantation is
      one possible treatment.
               It is this GI microbiota when invaded by various pathogens that can remain
      transiently or long term, even lifelong in the flora - that constitute the various illnesses
      referable to the small and large bowel which we have previously not realisedare caused
 15   by 'superinfection' of our largest organ, for example, causing Irritable Bowel Syndrome
      (IBS), C. difficile infection (CDI), diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis and others.
               There has recently been an enormous expansion in our understanding of bowel
      flora related conditions. Some of these conditions are easily understandable to be caused
      by abnormal bacteria e.g. Salmonella enteritis,whereas others such as obesity are more
 20 difficult to comprehend in terms of the mechanisms that might be playing a role in the
     causality of obesity yet originating in the bowel flora. Nonetheless, there is a growing list
     of various conditions that are now becoming tied to the GI microbiota, e.g., the intestinal
     microbiome. It is now recognized that conditions such as IBS, Colitis, Crohn's Disease,
     constipation, Metabolic Syndrome to name a few, are in no small part caused by
25   abnormal bowel flora, or abnormal GI microbiota.
               There is activity in the research community to attempt to repair the flora and to try
     and improve or cure such conditions that might be mediated by an abnormal GI
     microbiota, i.e., an abnormal bacterial composition populating the bowel. Antibiotics can
     give transient improvement, but often fail (for example, recurrent CDI), and these failures
30 point-to-a need for a fresh approach to treatment.
              A common underlying factor shared by all such disorders is that their onset is after
     some extraneous invading GI infection, albeit the patients may not remember this as it
     might have occurred decades before, for example, as with IBS or constipation. In many
                                                    2

       of these conditions the infection cannot be demonstrated by culture as there are more than
       3.3 million different microbial genes and commensurate large numbers of sub-species in
       the human GI microbiota, the GI flora, and so the diversity of microbial sub-species level
       composition is quite enormous, and only a small percentage of these can be cultured. It is
   5 therefore unlikely that the majority of these conditions are the result of a simple super
       infection with a specific single pathogen, e.g., as with CDI, and it is also unlikely that any
      time soon it can be determined which specific species and/or subspecies are responsible
      (pathogenic) for or involved in any particular disease or condition. Hence, the current
      thinking is that perhaps the best available therapy (e.g., with CDI) should be simply to
 10 find a proper composition and delivery system/s for infusing donor flora so that occult or
      pathogenic bacterial overgrowth conditions can be reversed or ameliorated.
               Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) previously known as "Fecal
      Bacteriotherapy" (see, e.g., Borody (2004) J. Clin. Gast. 38:475-483) represents a
      therapeutic method which allows the most rapid reconstitution of the normal composition
 15   of colonic microbial communities. It has been a therapy of last resort for patients with
     severe CDI and particularly with relapsing CDI. FMT is now becoming much more
     accepted medically; however, there is a need to improve on the deficiencies of FMT
     based therapeutics. While there is wide availability of good donor FMT material, design
     of a complex yet clinically active composition that is patient-acceptable, e.g., not
20 resemble crude, smelling stool, but rather a more acceptable pharmaceutical-like
     'biological' compositions that will gain wider patient and physician acceptance, is
     needed. Need for clinically active FMT compositions that are more acceptable to a wide
     patient and physician group are needed in fields where patient are not desperately ill
     (where acceptance is quite high). Implantation (e.g., transplantation) of crude
25 homogenised human stool has abolished CDI, and the donor flora implants for prolonged
     periods of time, see, e.g., Grehan (2010) J. Clin. Gastroenterol. 44(8):551-561.
                                              SUMMARY
              In alternative embodiments, the invention provides compositions, including
30 formulations, pharmaceutical compositions, foods, feeds, supplements, products of
     manufacture, and the like, comprising a treated or untreated human GI microbiota, or a
     partially, substantially or completely isolated human GI microbiota; and methods of
     making and using them.
                                                    3

                In alternative embodiments, the invention provides the following compositions,
        and methods for making, storing and using them, and the invention provides methods and
       uses for the following compositions:
            (1) A liquid preparation
   5            In alternative embodiments, the invention provides liquid preparations or
       formulations derived from a human fecal material (e'g., a stool) processed, e.g., filtered
       and/or centrifuged, such that all bacteria, fungal spores and viruses are removed, but
       retaining the native biologically active molecules from the fecal material, including for
       example, bacterial secretory products such as e.g., bacteriocins (including colicin,
 10 troudulixine or putaindicine, or microcin or subtilosin A), lanbiotics (including thuricin),
       nisin, subtilin, epidermin, mutacin, mersacidin, actagardine, cinnamycin), a lacticin and
      other pore-forming peptidic toxins; wherein these and/or other components of the liquid
      preparation can act as anti-spore (e.g., anti- Clostridium difflcile spore), antimicrobial
      and/or anti-inflammatory compounds (e.g., interleukins, cytokines); and also including
 15 other biologically active molecules (BAMs) produced by bacteria or other
      microorganisms of the microbiota. This level of filtration will nevertheless retain
      bacteriophages which are of sub-viral size and will contribute to the therapeutic capacity
      of this filtrate.
           (2) A "rough-". "incomplete-" or medium- filtered microbiota
20             In alternative embodiments, the invention provides a "rough-", "incomplete-" or
      medium- filtered microbiota which still comprises native physiological components or
      nutritive agents for the bacteria, e.g., retains native biologically and nutritionally active
      components, e.g., bacterial secretory products as discussed above, including e.g., anti
      microbial (e.g., anti-spore) and anti-inflammatory products. In one embodiment, a fecal
25 material (e.g., stool), is taken, dissolved and homogenised and passed through
     progressively smaller filter or a sieve sizes, stopping at to 0.1 mm sieve/ filter holes; thus
     retaining the biologically and nutritionally active native liquid components.
               This rough-", "incomplete-" or medium- filtered microbiota exemplary
     embodiment is in contrast to highly purified preparations, e.g., as described by Sadowsky,
30 et al., WO 2012/122478 Al, who prepared FMT material by filtering continued through
     ever smaller sieve holes until the stool was passed through a sieve down to 0.020 mm,
     resulting in a very highly purified microbiota mass with well over 95% of bacterial cells
                                                      4

       alone, while the surrounding native "biologically and nutritionally active" liquid material
       was discarded.
                In alternative embodiments this exemplary "rough filtered" or "medium filtered"
      composition maintains its physiological and also significantly, nutritional status, by
   5 keeping its native liquid components and small fibre molecules to supply nutrients to the
      flora of the microbiota. In this exemplary embodiment the donor flora is left
      "incompletely" filtered, e.g., finally down to about 0.1 mm sieve holes, to allow for some
      physiological "food" to remain for the bacteria and to retain the liquid components with
      their anti-microbial (e.g., anti-spore) and anti-inflammatory products.
 10        (3) Highly filtered or substantially purified microbiota with added back liquid
      preparations or formulations
               In alternative embodiments, the invention provides a highly filtered or
      substantially purified microbiota in combination with, or having added back, a liquid
      preparation or formulation of the invention (as summarized in category (1), above). By
 15   "adding back", or reconstituting, to the highly filtered or substantially purified microbiota
     a liquid preparation or formulation of the invention, the properties of the final
     composition or formulation are greatly enhanced, e.g., the highly filtered or substantially
     purified microbiota now has the properties of a liquid preparation or formulation of the
     invention, e.g., as summarized in category (1).
20             In alternative embodiments, this embodiment uses a substantially isolated or a
     purified fecal flora or entire (or substantially entire) microbiota that is (or comprises) an
     isolate of fecal flora that is at least about 90%, 91 %, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%,
     98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.6/, 99.7%, 99.8% or 99.9% isolated or pure, or having no more
     than about 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9% or 1.0% or more non
25 fecal floral material. In alternative embodiments, this embodiment uses a substantially
     isolated, purified, or substantially entire microbiota as described in $adowsky, et al., WO
     2012/122478 Al, or as described in Borody, et al., WO 2012/016287 A2.

      anaerobic conditions,
              In alternative embodiments the bacteria or microbiota component is cultured for
      about 2 to about 72 hours (hrs), or about I hour to 24 hours, or about 30 minutes to 12
   5 hours, to increase the numbers of the bacteria and their products without needing to use
      larger numbers of donors.

                                           DETAILED DESCRIPTION
              In alternative embodiments, the invention provides compositions, e.g.,
     formulations and pharmaceutical preparations, products of manufacture, and containers
                                                     14

      and delivery vehicles, and devices and delivery materials, comprising treated and/or
      isolated human GI microbiota for Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) (previously
      known as "Fecal Bacteriotherapy"). In alternative embodiments, formulations or
      pharmaceutical preparations of the invention are designed or formulated for implantation
  5 of living bacteria, or delivery of an active ingredient (e.g., a liquid preparation of the
      invention) into the distal small bowel and/or the colon.
              In alternative embodiments, the invention provides compositions and methods
      comprising use of both bacterial cells, e.g., a partial or a complete representation of the
      human GI microbiota, and an isolated, processed, filtered, concentrated, reconstituted
 10 and/or artificial liquid component of the flora (the microbiota) which comprises, among
     others ingredients, bacterial secretory products such as e.g., bacteriocins (proteinaceous
     toxins produced by bacteria, including colicin, troudulixine or putaindicine, or microcin
     or subtilosin A), lanbiotics (a class of peptide antibiotics that contain a characteristic
     polycyclic thioether amino acid lanthionine or methyllanthionine, and unsaturated amino
 15 acids dehydroalanine and 2-aminoisobutyric acid; which include thuricin (which is
     secreted by bacilli in donor stools), nisin, subtilin, epidermin, mutacin, mersacidin,
     actagardine, cinnamycin), a lacticin (a family of pore-forming peptidic toxins) and other
     antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory compounds and/or biologically active molecules
     (BAMs) produced by bacteria or other microorganisms of the microbiota, and/or which
20 are found in the "liquid component" of the microbiota. This "liquid component" of the
     invention is missing in the "cells only" Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) products,
    e.g., filtered FMT, described to date.
              This embodiment of the invention comprising a "liquid component" can be safer
    and/or more effective, e.g., can be "customized" for the treatment of a particular
25 condition, infection or disease, as compared to the implantation (e.g., transplantation) of
    crude homogenised human stool, which has been very successful in the cure of conditions
    such as chronic Clostridium difficile infection of the gut flora. CDI, particularly the
    relapsing forms, has been difficult to cure with antibiotics, but have been cured in over
    90% of patients implanted with crude "wild type" bacteria from normal flora collected
30 from a donor and infused in toto into a recipient, see e.g., Khoruts, et at. WO 2012
    122478. Compositions and methods of the invention comprising a reconstituted or co
    administered "liquid component" can have equal or great efficacy.
                                                    15

                Use of FMT in other conditions, for example, to treat a colitis, has required more
       aggressive and repeated crude "wild type" bacteria infusions, indicating that there are
       factors operating in such conditions that are different from the relatively easy cure of CDI
      with one or two FMT infusions. The embodiment of the invention comprising use of a
   5 "liquid component", e.g., a component with more than the cellular components of the
      microbiome, are effective where "cellular only" FMT formulations fail or lack sufficient
      efficacy. In alternative embodiments, the non-cellular "liquid component" of the
      invention, for example, secreted, execreted or otherwise liquid components or the
      microbiota, e.g., biologically active molecules (BAMs), which can be antibiotics or anti
 10 inflammatories, are preserved, retained or reconstituted in a flora extract, or a formulation
      of the invention together with the bacteriophages which will pass through the 22 micron
      filter described above. Thus, in alternative embodiments, non-cellular "liquid
      components" of the invention can help with the inflammatory processes, e.g., as types of
     bacterially-derived anti-inflammatory components of normal flora and have healthy
 15 bacteriophage anti-bacterial activity. In alternative embodiments, this non-cellular
     "liquid component" is specifically preserved, filtered, reconstituted and/or recreated (e.g.,
     synthetic) and is kept in a composition of the invention, or is or added to or administered
     with a composition of the invention.
               In alternative embodiments, the current invention provides improved
20 compositions and methods of putting together, formulating or reconstituting complete or
     substantially complete extracted flora, by also comprising, reconstituting or adding
     specific additions, e.g., a non-cellular "liquid component" and/or components thereof, to
     improve on the efficacy, performance and/or safety of the "cellular" component. In
     alternative embodiments, the compositions and methods of the invention provide not only
25 improved functionality but also new applications to various conditions not previously
     attended to.
              In alternative embodiments, the compositions and methods of the invention also
    provide for the disruption of biological films, e.g., biofilms, to improve implantation
    characteristics and have greater efficacy in reversing conditions.
30            In alternative embodiments, the compositions and methods of the invention
    comprising use of FMT therapy comprising a non-cellular "liquid component" and/or
    components thereof are used for conditions such as an autoimmune disease (e.g., an
    autoimmune colitis such as Ulcerative Colitis (UC), a multiple sclerosis (MS)), or an
                                                    16

       autism, and others. In alternative embodiments, the compositions and methods of the
       invention are used to treat, ameliorate, reverse or cure diseases, infections or conditions
       which are not treatable or curable with one or two infusions (as with CDI), but rather
       need prolonged administration to achieve cure or a maintenance therapy to maintain
   5 remission, e.g. Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Alternatively, the embodiment comprising a
       cellular and a liquid component composition, e.g., as the description of (3), above, can be
       used here to also implant (e.g., administer to a patient) the missing (in the patient) flora
      components seen in a health, or "wild type" (WT) individual. In alternative
      embodiments, the liquid component has a powerful anti-spore activity.
 10            In alternative embodiments, the compositions and methods of the invention can be
      formulated in any solid or liquid form, e.g., as a pharmaceutical, food or supplement
      formulation, e.g., an encapsulated preparation and/or a powdered yoghurt preparation
      (which can be encapsulated) to e.g., gain acceptance and for prolonged use. In alternative
      embodiments, the compositions and methods of the invention can be formulated as
 15 enemas. In alternative embodiments, the compositions and methods of the invention can
      be formulated as an oral product, e.g., in an encapsulated form. In alternative
      embodiments, compositions and methods of the invention comprises use of formulations
      comprising all the stool components, i.e., comprising a non-cellular "liquid component",
      or reconstituted or synthetic equivalent thereof, and not just the bacterial cellular
20 component.
              In alternative embodiments, the compositions of the invention comprise various
     biologically active molecules (BAMs), including anti-inflammatory components of the
     flora, or rmicrobiota. In alternative embodiments, the liquid or dissolved components are
     included in a cellular preparation or are added back to the cells, e.g., when the stool is
25 filtered down to its cellular mass alone. In alternative embodiments, the compositions of
     the invention comprise a representation of a cellular microbiota, e.g., a complete or
     substantially complete human microbiota, further comprising added components or "add
     backs" put into the compositions so as to give further utility, better efficacy and/or
     improved safety in the varying applications. For example, in alternative embodiments,
30 biologically active molecules (BAM's) that are "added back", including bacterial
     secretary products, anti-inflammatory reagents or other compositions (e.g., as secreted by
     the "host" bowel, e.g., interleukins, cytokines, leukotrienes, eicosanoids and the like),
     antibodies (e.g., IgAs, IgGs, IgMs, antigen-binding antibody fragments or synthetic
                                                    17

        antibody-like peptides or reagents), prebiotics, probiotics, anti-biofilm reagents or
       biofihm-dissolving reagents, and/or antimicrobials, antibiotics or antifungal agents. In
       alternative embodiments, these or other "added back" components can be man-made or
       pure or crude or concentrated non-cellular "liquid component" of a microbiota, e.g., such
   5 as bacterial secretory products such as: thuricin (which is secreted by bacilli in donor
       stools), bacteriocins (proteinaceous toxins produced by bacteria, including colicin,
       troudulixine or putaindicine, or microcin or subtilosin A), lanbiotics (including a nisin, a
       subtilin, an epidermin, a mutacin, a mersacidin, an actagardine and/or a cinnamycin), a
       lacticin or related pore-forming peptidic toxin, and/or other antimicrobial or anti
 10 inflammatory compounds and/or biologically active molecules (BAMs) produced by
      bacteria or other microorganisms of the microbiota. In alternative embodiments, one or
      all of these, or other, additives are-added to compositions of the invention, e.g., "added
      back" to such the final formulation closely or better simulates or has the same properties
      of or is a substantial representation of a normal or wild type human microbiota.
 15            In alternative embodiments, prior to treatment with the extracted flora, the
      physician may also choose to use a purgative to reduce the volume of the flora so that
      implantation is easier in an empty bowel.
      Additional Optional Ingredients
           Congealing agents
20             In alternative embodiments, following infusion of a composition of the invention
     (including any microbiota- or FMT-comprising composition of the invention), e.g.,
     following a transcolonoscopic infusion or infusion by an enema (particularly into the
     colon of patients with Ulcerative Colitis), or following an oral administration, a
     congealing agent is also used or administered. For example, when a patient is wheeled
25 into recovery the infused liquid moves down to the sigmoid colon, then into the rectum;
     this causes the patient to feel extreme urgency to the extent that many patients cannot
     hold the liquid and suffer fecal incontinence while in bed or while being transported to
     the bathroom. To prevent this, the invention includes the use of added congealing agents,
     e.g., including arrowroot or a plant starch, e.g., a powdered flour, a powdered potato or
30 potato starch, an absorbant polymer (e.g., an Absorbable Modified Polymer (AMP@),
     EndoClot, Santa Clara, CA), and/or a corn, flour or corn starch. This absorbs water
                                                    18

               In alternative embodiments, a formulation or pharmaceutical preparation of the
 15   invention is a powder that can be included into a tablet or a suppository. In alternative
      embodiments, a formulation or pharmaceutical preparation of the invention can be a
      'powder for reconstitution' as a liquid to be drunk placed down a naso-duodenal tube or
      used as an enema for patients to take home self-administer enemas for colitis for example.
      In alternative embodiments, a formulation or pharmaceutical preparation of the invention
20    is micro-encapsulated, formed into tablets and/or placed into capsules, especially enteric
      coated capsules.
              In alternative embodiments, in practicing the methods of the invention, biofilm
      disrupting compounds are administered before or during (co-administered), or co
      formulated with a composition or formulation of the invention. For example, in
25 alternative embodiments, a composition or formulation of the invention and a biofilm
     disrupting compound (and/or any other alternative component of the invention, as
     discussed herein) are co-formulated, e.g., as multiple layer tablet form or as a multi
     laminated tablet or capsule. In alternative embodiments of methods of the invention,
     biofilm disrupting compounds are separately formulated.
30        Feeds, drinks, candies, nutritional or a food or feed supplements
              In alternative embodiments, a formulation or pharmaceutical preparation of the
     invention is incorporated into a food, a feed, a candy (e.g., a lollypop or a lozenge) a
                                                      28

        drink, a nutritional or a food or feed supplement (e.g., liquid, semisolid or solid), and the
        like, as described e.g., in U.S. Pat. App. Publication No. 20100178413. In one
       embodiment, a formulation or pharmaceutical preparation of the invention is incorporated
       into (manufactured as) a beverage as described e.g., in USPN 7,815,956. For example, a
   5 composition of the invention is incorporated into a yogurt, an ice cream, a milk or
       milkshake, a "frosty", "snow-cone", or other ice-based mix, and the like.
                 In alternative embodiments, methods of the invention comprise pre-administration
       or co-administration of an acid inhibiting agent, e.g., an antacid, to facilitate implantation
       of the living bacteria of a composition of the invention, e.g., to facilitate administration or
 10    implantation of wild type microbiota and/or cultured bacteria of a composition of the
      invention. For example, in alternative embodiments, a composition or formulation of the
      invention and an acid inhibiting agent, e.g., an antacid, (and/or any other alternative
      component of the invention, as discussed herein) are co-formulated, e.g., as multiple layer
      tablet form or as a multi-laminated tablet or capsule. In alternative embodiments of
 15   methods of the invention, acid inhibiting agents are separately formulated.
                In alternative embodiments, a formulation or pharmaceutical preparation of the
      invention is a freeze-dried powder form added to a food, e.g., a yogurt, an ice cream, a
      milk or milkshake, a "frosty", "snow-cone", or other ice-based mix, and the like. In one
      form of this invention it can be kept in a lid-storage (e.g., of a yogurt or ice cream) such
20    that when it is twisted the powder falls into the product or formulation (e.g., yoghurt or
      ice cream) and then it can be stirred so as not to have the powder ferment 'standing on the
      shelf. Various flavourings can be added. In alternative embodiments, this is particularly
     important for administration of a composition of the invention, e.g., a wild type
     microbiota or a cultured bacteria, to a very young individual and/or a patient with autism
25   or related disease or condition.
               In alternative embodiments, these exemplary products are important when
     administered to babies who may have C. difficile or who may have acquired various
     pathogenic or abnormal bacteria, e.g., E. coli, Clostridiaor Disulfovibrio, e.g., in autism.

20
     Anaerobic processing and storing of microbiota
               In alternative embodiments, microbiota used in compositions of the invention, or
     used to practice methods of the invention, are isolated, stored and/or cultured under
     suitably oxygen free (or substantially oxygen free). For example, in one embodiment, a
25 fresh stool is transported via a stool collection device having a suitably oxygen free (or
     substantially oxygen free) appropriate container, e.g., a disposable leak proof
     ziplock/sealing bag. In alternative embodiments, the container can be made oxygen free
     by e.g., incorporating into the container a built in or clipped-on oxygen-scavenging
     mechanism, e.g., oxygen scavenging pellets as described e.g., in U.S. Pat. No: 7,541,091.
30 In another embodiment, the container itself is made of an oxygen scavenging material,
     e.g., oxygen scavenging iron, e.g., as described by 02BLOCK M , or equivalents, which
     uses a purified and modified layered clay as a performance-enhancing carrier of oxygen
                                                     31

        scavenging iron; the active iron is dispersed directly in the polymer. In one embodiment,
        oxygen-scavenging polymers are used to make the container itself or to coat the
        container, or as pellets to be added; e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub.
       20110045222, describing polymer blends having one or more unsaturated olefinic
   5 homopolymers or copolymers; one or more polyamide homopolymers or copolymers; one
       or more polyethylene terephthalate homopolymers or copolymers; that exhibit oxygen
       scavenging activity. In one embodiment, oxygen-scavenging polymers are used to make
       the container itself or to coat the container, or as pellets to be added; e.g., as described in
       U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 20110008554, describing compositions comprising a polyester, a
 10 copolyester ether and an oxidation catalyst, wherein the copolyester ether comprises a
      polyether segment comprising poly(tetramethylene-co-alkylene ether). In one
       embodiment, oxygen-scavenging polymers are used to make the container itself or to coat
      the container, or as pellets to be added; e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub.
      20100025523 1, describing a dispersed iron/salt particle in a polymer matrix, and an
 15   oxygen scavenging film with oxygen scavenging particulates.
                Alternatively, in addition to or in place of using an oxygen-scavenging
      mechanism, the air in the container is replaced (completely or substantially) with nitrogen
      and/or other inert non-reactive gas or gases. In alternative embodiments, the container
      simulates (creates) partially, substantially or completely an anaerobic environment.
20             In alternative embodiments, the stool (e.g., fecal sample) is held in an aesthetically
      acceptable container that will not leak nor smell yet maintain an anaerobic environment.
      In alternative embodiments, the container is sterile before receiving the fecal flora.
               In alternative embodiments, a microbiota-containing container is maintained
     below room temperature, e.g., refrigerated, during most or all of its preparation, but not
25 frozen; transportation and/or storage at e.g., a "stool bank" or at the site where the
     transplantation will take place. For example, once delivered to a "processing stool bank"
     it is stored in a cool room, cold container or refrigerator to minimize flora metabolism. In
     alternative embodiments, it is not frozen to prevent destruction of the bacterial cells of the
     microbiota-comprising formulation.
30             In alternative embodiments, stabilizing agents such as glycerol are added to the
     harvested and/or stored material. In one embodiment, the stool is frozen suddenly in
     liquid nitrogen or any similar coolant so e.g., it can be stored for prolonged periods of
    time while waiting processing.
                                                      32

                In alternative embodiments, the stool is tested for various pathogens, as noted
      above. In alternative embodiments, once cleared of infective agents, it is homogenized
      and filtered to remove large particles of matter, then further processes, as described
      herein. In alternative embodiments, it is subdivided into desired volumes, e.g., which can
   5 be between 5 cc and 3 or more liters. For example, in one embodiment, a container
      comprises a 50 gram (g) stool, which can be held in an appropriate oxygen resistant
      plastic, e.g., a metallized polyethylene terephthalate polyester film, or a metallized
      MYLARTM.
               In alternative embodiments, a composition of the invention is manufactured or
 10 processed under an inert gas cover or other anaerobic condition, and/or manufactured or
      processed in room air with some loss of activity. In alternative embodiments suitable
      gases include nitrogen, carbon dioxide, helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and/or radon.
      Defining or prescreening microbiota or fecal donors
               In alternative embodiments, the methods of the invention comprise a step or
 15  prerequisite of pre-screening, or defining, the fecal, microbiota or FMT donor, e.g., using
     defined donors, as appropriate or required. In alternative embodiments, this is of
     advantage, especially in those types of products to be used e.g. in obesity, metabolic
     syndrome or diabetes, in addition to the screening out of individuals with extant
     infections. In one embodiment, the donor should ideally not have had antibiotics in
20 childhood, as antibiotics in childhood are associated with obesity later in life because
     antibiotics alters the microbiota which no longer extract as much energy and also has
     other characteristics. In one embodiment, the donors are lean individuals. In alternative
     embodiments, the donor's age is between about 15 to 40 years of age, or about 10 to 50
     years of age, or about 5 to 60 years of age.
25            In one embodiment, the defined donors measure naturally occurring high
     concentrations of Bacteroidetesand Firmicutes;some can also contain higher levels of
     Bacillus thuringienesis,e.g., B. thuringensisstrain 4631 or a similar strain with bacterial
     activity against a C. difficile infection. Such donors could therefore contain thuricin CD,
     which in alternative embodiments is "added back", e.g., to lower-concentration extracts if
30 they did not contain it. In one embodiment, thuricin CD comprises a Trn -alpha or a Trn
    beta. In one embodiment, wild type (WT) strains of B. thuringiensisare acceptable. In
    one embodiment, defined donors, especially in CDI treatment, would avoid stool from
                                                    33

      relatives as they may carry silent C. difficile infection. Furthermore, they would avoid
      people who have detectable methane on their breath i.e. methane producers, as methane
      production is generally associated with constipation-inducing bacteria.
      Packaging
  5            The invention provides compositions, including preparations, formulations and/or
     kits, comprising combinations of ingredients, as described herein, for example, a frozen
     or freeze-dried liquid preparation or formulation of the invention and additional
     ingredients; or, a frozen or freeze-dried liquid preparation or formulation of the invention
     and a purified or substantially complete representation of a human microbiota. In
 10 alternative embodiments, these combinations can be mixed and administered together, or
     alternatively, they can be an individual member of a packaged combination of
     ingredients, e.g., as manufactured in a separate package, kit or container; or, where all or
     a subset of the combinations of ingredients are manufactured in a separate package or
     container. In alternative aspects, the package, kit or container comprises a blister
 15 package, a clamshell, a tray, a shrink wrap and the like.
              In one aspect, the package, kit or container comprises a "blister package'' (also
    called a blister pack, or bubble pack). In one aspect, the blister package is made up of
    two separate elements: a transparent plastic cavity shaped to the product and its blister
    board backing. These two elements are then joined together with a heat sealing process
20 which allows the product to be hung or displayed. Exemplary types of "blister packages"
    include: Face seal blister packages, gang run blister packages, mock blister packages,
    interactive blister packages, slide blister packages.
              Blister packs, clamshells or trays are forms of packaging used for goods; thus, the
    invention provides for blister packs, clamshells or trays comprising a composition (e.g., a
25 (the multi-ingredient combination of drugs of the invention) combination of active
    ingredients) of the invention. Blister packs, clamshells or trays can be designed to be
    non-reclosable, so consumers can tell if a package has already opened. They are used to
    package for sale goods where product tampering is a consideration, such as the
    pharmaceuticals of the invention. In one aspect, a blister pack of the invention comprises
30 a moulded PVC base, with raised areas (the "blisters") to contain the tablets, pills, etc.
    comprising the combinations of the invention, covered by a foil laminate. Tablets, pills,
    etc. are removed from the pack either by peeling the foil back or by pushing the blister to
                                                    34

       force the tablet to break the foil. In one aspect, a specialized form of a blister pack is a
       strip pack. In one aspect, in the United Kingdom, blister packs adhere to British Standard
       8404.
                In one embodiment, the invention also provides a method of packaging where the
   5 compositions comprising combinations of ingredients of the invention are contained in
       between a card and a clear PVC. The PVC can be transparent so the item (pill, tablet,
       geltab, etc.) can be seen and examined easily; and in one aspect, can be vacuum-formed
      around a mould so it can contain the item snugly and have room to be opened upon
      purchase. In one aspect, the card is brightly colored and designed depending on the item,
 10 (pill, tablet, geltab, etc.) inside, and the PVC is affixed to the card using pre-formed tabs
      where the adhesive is placed. The adhesive can be strong enough so that the pack may
      hang on a peg, but weak enough so that this way one can tear open the join and access the
      item. Sometimes with large items or multiple enclosed pills, tablets, geltabs, etc., the card
      has a perforated window for access. In one aspect, more secure blister packs, e.g., for
 15 items such as pills, tablets, geltabs, etc. of the invention are used, and they can comprise
     of two vacuum-formed PVC sheets meshed together at the edges, with the informative
     card inside. These can be hard to open by hand, so a pair of scissors or a sharp knife may
     be required to open.
               In one aspect, blister packaging comprises at least two or three or more
20 components (e.g., is a multi-ingredient combination of the invention): a thermoformed
     ''blister" which houses multi-ingredient combination of the invention, and then a "blister
     card" that is a printed card with an adhesive coating on the front surface. During the
     assembly process, the blister component, which is most commonly made out of PVC, is
     attached to the blister card using a blister machine. This machine introduces heat to the
25 flange area of the blister which activates the glue on the card in that specific area and
     ultimately secures the PVG blister to the printed blister card. The thermoformed PVG
     blister and the printed blister card can be as small or as large as you would like, but there
     are limitations and cost considerations in going to an oversized blister card. Conventional
     blister packs can also be sealed (e.g., using an AERGO 8 DUOTM, SCA Consumer
30 Packaging, Inc., DeKalb IL) using regular heat seal tooling. This alternative aspect, using
     heat seal tooling, can seal common types of thermoformed packaging.
           Blister packaging
                                                    35

                In alternative embodiments, combinations of ingredients of compositions of the
       invention, or combinations of ingredients for practicing methods of the invention, can be
      packaged alone or in combinations, e.g., as "blister packages" or as a plurality of
      packettes, including as lidded blister packages, lidded blister or blister card or packets or
   5 packettes, or a shrink wrap.
               In alternative embodiments, laminated aluminium foil blister packs are used, e.g.,
      for the preparation of drugs designed to dissolve immediately in the mouth of a patient.
      This exemplary process comprises having the drug combinations of the invention
      prepared as an aqueous solution(s) which are dispensed (e.g., by measured dose) into an
 10 aluminium (e.g., alufoil) laminated tray portion of a blister pack. This tray is then freeze
      dried to form tablets which take the shape of the blister pockets. The alufoil laminate of
      both the tray and lid fully protects any highly hygroscopic and/or sensitive individual
      doses. In one aspect, the pack incorporates a child-proof peel open security laminate. In
      one aspect, the system give tablets an identification mark by embossing a design into the
 15 alufoil pocket that is taken up by the tablets when they change from aqueous to solid
     state. In one aspect, individual 'push-through' blister packs/ packettes are used, e.g., using
     hard temper aluminium (e.g., alufoil) lidding material. In one aspect, hermetically-sealed
     high barrier aluminium (e.g., alufoil) laminates are used. In one aspect, any of the
     invention's products of manufacture, including kits or blister packs, use foil laminations
20 and strip packs, stick packs, sachets and pouches, peelable and non-peelable laminations
     combining foil, paper, and film for high barrier packaging.
              In alternative embodiments, any of the invention's multi-ingredient combinations
     or products of manufacture, including kits or blister packs, include memory aids to help
     remind patients when and how to take the drug. This safeguards the drug's efficacy by
25 protecting each tablet, geltab or pill until it's taken; gives the product or kit portability,
    makes it easy to take a dose anytime or anywhere.
             The invention will be further described with reference to the following examples;
    however, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to such examples.

                                                   36

                In one embodiment, an exemplary composition of the invention is largely (e.g.,
      substantially) whole donor fecal material (e.g., stool) homogenized with saline as an
      extract of a human faeces. The biological material, e.g., donor fecal material (e.g., stool),
      is taken, dissolved and homogenised and passed through a sieve starting with a hole size
   5 of 2.0 mm, and then progressively passed through: 1.0 mm, 0.5 mm and finally down to
      0.1 mm sieve holes. By stopping at to 0.1 mm sieve holes, this exemplary embodiment is
      in contrast to e.g., Sadowsky, et al., WO 2012/122478 Al, who prepared FMT material
      by filtering continued through ever smaller sieve holes until the stool was passed through
      a sieve down to 0.020 mm; this resulted in a very highly purified. microbiota mass with
 10 well over 95% of bacterialcells alone, while the surrounding liquid material was
      discarded (the aim in bacterialcells alone formulations was to have essentially a bacteria
     only composition, as it was recognised that CDI was largely cured by supplying
     Bacteroidetesand Firmicutes,and was not dependent in supplying any liquid components
     such as BAM's, see e.g., Khoruts A et al., J Clin Gastroenterol44(5): 354-360 (2010).
 15 This produces a flora which is, at least for some applications, not optimal or defective
     because it is not physiological (i.e., lacks the native "liquid component"). This exemplary
     embodiment comprises use of a "rough filtered" composition to maintain a physiological
     status, and also, significantly, keeps the liquid components and small fibre molecules to
     supply nutrients to the flora of the microbiota. In contrast to e.g., Sadowsky, et al., WO
20 2012/122478 Al (using only the bacterial cells for carrying out such transplantation), in
     this exemplary embodiment the donor flora is left "incompletely" filtered (e.g.,finally
     down to about 0.1 mm sieve holes) to allow for some physiological "food" to remain for
     the bacteria and to retain the liquid components with their anti-inflammatory products.
              In alternative embodiments, this "incomplete filtering", or "rough filtered"
25 process and resultant product thereof also makes an FMT product of this invention much
     cheaper and/or easier, e.g., such that a patient can do this in their own home for self
    administration.
              In alternative embodiments, one or more cryoprotectants are added to this
    exemplary formulation of the invention, so that e.g., the extract can be frozen, and/or to
30 produce a cheap format for home infusions by patients, e.g. with UC. Alternative
    exemplary features include preparation under cover of inert gases, and/or use of various
    "add in" or additions, as described above, including e.g., additions of prebiotics,
    probiotics and pre-treatment methods with antibiotics and biofilm-dissolving agents.
                                                    37

       EXAMPLE 2: Exemplary "high level filtration" compositions of the invention
                In one embodiment, an exemplary composition of the invention comprises starting
       material from a donor from a defined donor pool (see below), where this donor
   5 contributes a stool that is centrifuges, then filtered with very high-level filtration using
      e.g., either metal sieving or Millipore filters, or equivalent, to ultimately permit only cells
      of bacterial origin to remain, e.g., often less than about 5 micrometres diameter. After the
      initial centrifugation, the solid material is separated from the liquid, and the solid is then
      filtered in progressively reducing size filters and tangential filters, e.g., using a Millipore
 10   filtration, and optionally, also comprising use of nano-membrane filtering. The filtering
      can also be done by sieves as described in WO 2012 122478, but in contrast using sieves
      that are smaller than .0 120 mm, down to about .0110 mm, which ultimately result in
      having only bacterial cells present.
                The supernatant separated during centrifugation is now taken and filtered
 15   progressively in a filtering, e.g., a Millipore filtering or equivalent systems, to end up
      with liquid which is finely filtered through an about 0.22 micron filter. This removes all
     particulate matter including all living matter, including bacteria and viruses. The product
     then is sterile, but the aim is to remove the bacteria but to keep their secretions, especially
     antimicrobial bacteriocins, bacteria-derived cytokine-like products and all accompanying
20   Biologically Active Molecules (BAMs), including: thuricin (which is secreted by bacilli
     in donor stools), bacteriocins (including colicin, troudulixine or putaindicine, or microcin
     or subtilosin A), lanbiotics (including nisin, subtilin, epidermin, mutacin, mersacidin,
     actagardine, cinnamycin), lacticins and other antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory
     compounds.
25             In alternative embodiments, agents such as thuricin (which is secreted by bacilli in
     donor stools), nisin, lacticin and other BAMs (discussed above) are therefore extracted
     from the liquid portion of the donor stool and are preserved for 'adding back' to the
     cellular component. In alternative embodiments, synthetic or altered versions of these
     compositions are "added back".
30    -        In alternative embodiments, the supernatant extract "added back" also contains
     various peptides, micronutrients, protein, some fats, small carbohydrates, trace elements,
     mineral salts, ash, mucous, amino acids and other active agents, nutrients, vitamins or
     minerals, which can be added back to truly reconstitute a "wild type" healthy flora.
                                                     38

                In alternative embodiments, this "supernatant extract" component, or synthetic
      equivalent thereof, is stored and/or pooled and used alone (without the bacterial cells),
      e.g., as a therapeutic, e.g., as an anti-inflammatory and/or anti-microbial agent.
               In alternative embodiments, the invention recognizes the advantage and utility for
   5 using (as the "supernatant extract" component, or synthetic equivalent thereof) the
      various active molecules that the bacterial cells in stool produce which are able to not
      only kill Clostridiaand other pathogens and their spores, but also heal UC and have other
      positive effects on conditions treated with this exemplary composition.
               In alternative embodiments, a composition of the invention comprises extracted
 10 cells combined with their purified products, and/or a "supernatant extract" component, or
      synthetic equivalent thereof, which is then reconstituted for either freezing or freeze
     drying into a powder, or equivalent, before delivery to the patient.
              In alternative embodiments, to achieve or preserve viability, these various added
     components are required or benefit from including a cryoprotectant, a lyoprotectant, or a
 15 preservative, e.g., as described in Example 3, below.
              In alternative embodiments, at times this FMT product may also require topping
     up with components that may be required for a particular condition, disease or infection,
     e.g. adding more Firmicutes,Bacteroidetes and/orBacillus (e.g., Bacillus thurigiensis) or
     others. The bacterial species can be isolated or separated by celltrifugation or
20 plasmapharesis. In alternative embodiments, an exemplary composition of extracted
     complete (or substantially complete) human flora (a microbiota) is freeze-dried; and can
     also be formulated into a powder with various downstream applications.
              In alternative embodiments, compositions of the invention are sieved or extracted
     total flora without the "crud" or non-functioning components, but for the first time also
25 combining the active ingredients that have previously been removed by filtering, sieving
     and discarding. In alternative embodiments, compositions of the invention comprise the
     anti-bacterial agents and/or biologically active molecules produced by the microbiota
     organisms or found in the microbiota extract, e.g., which can act e.g., as interleukins,
     cytokines and the like, which are required or helpful in treatment of inflammation,
30 especially ulcerative colitis.
     EXAMPLE 3: Exemplary "cultured or incubated" compositions of the invention
                                                     39

              In one embodiment, an exemplary composition of the invention comprises
     cultured or incubated flora with the starting composition described in Examples 1 or 2. In
     one embodiment, a whole flora representative extract as in 1 or 2 (e.g., a substantially
     complete representation of a human microbiota) is prepared, e.g., as described herein,
  5 e.g., in Example 1 or Example 2, but then to incubate the FMT product for a variable
     time, e.g., about 2 to about 72 hours (hrs), or about 1 hour to 24 hours, or about 30
     minutes to 12 hours, to increase the numbers of the bacteria and their products without
     needing to use larger numbers of donors. In alternative embodiments, the flora extract is
     incubated in a liquid enrichment culture medium in anaerobic conditions using
 10 appropriate nutrient broths of standard composition. These can then be aliquotted and
    frozen or freeze-dried (or lyophilized or cryodesiccated), thus increasing manufacturing
    volume of the FMT product rather than having to increase the volume of stool to be
    filtered from increasing number of donors. This would allow to produce a higher volume
    of very useful transplantation product.
