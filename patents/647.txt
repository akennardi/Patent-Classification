   BACKGROUND
20
   The prime neuropathological event distinguishing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is deposition
   of the 40-42 residue amyloid p-peptide (AP) in brain parenchyma and cerebral vessels. A
   large body of genetic, biochemical and in vivo data support a pivotal role for AP in the
   pathological cascade that eventually leads to AD. Patients usually present early symptoms
25 (commonly memory loss) in their sixth or seventh decades of life. The disease progresses
   with increasing dementia and elevated deposition of Ap. In parallel, a hyperphosphorylated
   form of the microtubule-associated protein tau accumulates within neurons, leading to a
   plethora of deleterious effects on neuronal function. The prevailing working hypothesis
   regarding the temporal relationship between Af3 and tau pathologies states that AP
30 deposition precedes tau aggregation in humans and animal models of the disease. Within
   this context, it is worth noting that the exact molecular nature of AP, mediating this

  pathological function is presently an issue under intense study. Most likely, there is a
  continuum of toxic species ranging from lower order As oligomers to supramolecular
  assemblies such as AP fibrils.
5 The AP peptide is an integral fragment of the Type I protein APP (AP amyloid precursor
  protein), a protein ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Since soluble AP can be found
  in

        WO 2012/087237                                                          PCT/SE2011/051555
                                                   2
    both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and in the medium from cultured cells, APP has to
    undergo proteolysis. There are three main cleavages of APP that are relevant to the pathobiology
    of AD, the so-called a-, P-, and y-cleavages. The a-cleavage, which occurs roughly in the middle
    of the A domain in APP is executed by the metalloproteases ADAMIO or ADAM17 (the latter
  5 also known as TACE). The j-cleavage, occurring at the N terminus of A, is generated by the
    transmembrane aspartyl protease Beta site APP Cleaving Enzymel (BACE1). The y-cleavage,
    generating the A C termini and subsequent release of the peptide, is effected by a multi-subunit
    aspartyl protease named y-secretase. ADAM10/17 cleavage followed by y-secretase cleavage
    results in the release of the soluble p3 peptide, an N-terminally truncated AD fragment that fails
 [0 to form amyloid deposits in humans. This proteolytic route is commonly referred to as the non
    amyloidogenic pathway. Consecutive cleavages by BACE1 and y-secretase generates the intact
    A peptide, hence this processing scheme has been termed the amyloidogenic pathway. With this
    knowledge at hand, it is possible to envision two possible avenues of lowering A production:
    stimulating non-amyloidogenic processing, or inhibit or modulate amyloidogenic processing.
 [5 This application focuses on the latter strategy, inhibition or modulation of amyloidogenic
    processing.
    Amyloidogenic plaques and vascular amyloid angiopathy also characterize the brains of patients
    with Trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome), Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis of the
 Zo Dutch-type (HCHWA-D), and other neurodegenerative disorders. Neurofibrillary tangles also
    occur in other neurodegenerative disorders including dementia-inducing disorders (Varghese, J.,
    et al, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2003, 46, 4625-4630). R-amyloid deposits are
    predominately an aggregate of AB peptide, which in turn is a product of the proteolysis of
    amyloid precursor protein (APP). More specifically, AB peptide results from the cleavage of
25  APP at the C-terminus by one or more y-secretases, and at the N-terminus by -secretase enzyme
    (BACE), also known as aspartyl protease or Asp2 or Beta site APP Cleaving Enzyme (BACE),
    as part of the -amyloidogenic pathway.
    BACE activity is correlated directly to the generation of AB peptide from APP (Sinha, et al,
30  Nature, 1999, 402, 537-540), and studies increasingly indicate that the inhibition of BACE
    inhibits the production of AR peptide (Roberds, S. L., et al, Human Molecular Genetics, 2001,
    10, 1317-1324). BACE is a membrane bound type 1 protein that is synthesized as a partially
    active proenzyme, and is abundantly expressed in brain tissue. It is thought to represent the

       WO 2012/087237                                                           PCT/SE2011/051555
                                                 3
   major P-secretase activity, and is considered to be the rate-limiting step in the production of
   amyloid--peptide (AP).
   Drugs that reduce or block BACE activity should therefore reduce AP levels and levels of
 5 fragments of AP in the brain, or elsewhere where AP or fragments thereof deposit, and thus slow
   the formation of amyloid plaques and the progression of AD or other maladies involving
   deposition of AP or fragments thereof BACE is therefore an important candidate for the
   development of drugs as a treatment and/or prophylaxis of Aj-related pathologies such as
   Down's syndrome, j-amyloid angiopathy such as but not limited to cerebral amyloid angiopathy
[0 or hereditary cerebral hemorrhage, disorders associated with cognitive impairment such as but
   not limited to MCI ("mild cognitive impairment"), Alzheimer's Disease, memory loss, attention
   deficit symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease, neurodegeneration associated with
   diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or dementia including dementia of mixed vascular and
   degenerative origin, pre-senile dementia, senile dementia and dementia associated with
[5 Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy or cortical basal degeneration.
   It would therefore be useful to inhibit the deposition of AP and portions thereof by inhibiting
   BACE through inhibitors such as the compounds provided herein.
   The therapeutic potential of inhibiting the deposition of AP has motivated many groups to isolate
!o and characterize secretase enzymes and to identify their potential inhibitors.

  5 The present invention relates to the use of compounds of formula (I) as hereinbefore defined as
    well as to the salts thereof Salts for use in pharmaceutical compositions will be pharmaceutically
    acceptable salts, but other salts may be useful in the production of the compounds of formula (I).
    The compounds of the formula (I) may be administered in the form of a prodrug which is broken
 [0 down in the human or animal body to give a compound of the formula (I). Examples of prodrugs
    include in vivo hydrolysable esters of a compound of the formula (I). An in vivo hydrolysable (or
    cleavable) ester of a compound of the formula (I) that contains a carboxy or a hydroxy group is,
    for example, a pharmaceutically acceptable ester which is hydrolysed in the human or animal
    body to produce the parent acid or alcohol. Various forms of prodrugs are known in the art.
 [5
    The definitions set forth in this application are intended to clarify terms used throughout this
    application. The term "herein" means the entire application.
    A variety of compounds in the present invention may exist in particular geometric or
 !o stereoisomeric forms. The present invention takes into account all such compounds, including
    tautomers, cis- and trans isomers, R- and S- enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)
    isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, as being covered within the
    scope of this invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in a substituent
    such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included
25  in this invention. The compounds herein described may have asymmetric centers. Compounds of
    the present invention containing an asymmetrically substituted atom may be isolated in optically
    active or racemic forms. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as
    by resolution of racemic forms, by synthesis from optically active starting materials, or synthesis
    using optically active reagents. When required, separation of the racemic material can be
30  achieved by methods known in the art. Many geometric isomers of olefins, C=N double bonds,
    and the like can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers
    are contemplated in the present invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of
    the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated

        WO 2012/087237                                                            PCT/SE2011/051555
                                                   19
    isomeric forms. All chiral, diastereomeric, racemic forms and all geometric isomeric forms of a
    structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically
    indicated.
  5 When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such
    substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without
    indicating the atom via which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given
    formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. Combinations of
    substituents, positions of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations
 [0 result in stable compounds.
    As used in this application, the term "optionally substituted" means that substitution is optional
    and therefore it is possible for the designated atom or moiety to be unsubstituted.
 [5 As used herein, "alkyl", used alone or as a suffix or prefix, is intended to include both branched
    and straight chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms or if
    a specified number of carbon atoms is provided then that specific number would be intended. For
    example "Co-6 alkyl" denotes alkyl having 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl
    include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, sec-butyl, t
 Zo butyl, pentyl, and hexyl. In the case where a subscript is the integer 0 (zero) the group to which
    the subscript refers to indicates that the group may be absent, i.e. there is a direct bond between
    the groups.
    As used herein, "alkenyl" used alone or as a suffix or prefix is intended to include both branched
25  and straight-chain alkene or olefin containing aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having from 2 to 12
    carbon atoms or if a specified number of carbon atoms is provided then that specific number
    would be intended. For example "C2-6 alkenyl" denotes alkenyl having 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon
    atoms. Examples of alkenyl include, but are not limited to, vinyl, allyl, 1-propenyl, 1-butenyl, 2
    butenyl, 3-butenyl, 2-methylbut-2-enyl, 3-methylbut-1-enyl, 1-pentenyl, 3-pentenyl and 4
30  hexenyl.

                                                  20
    having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms or if a specified number of carbon atoms is provided then that
    specific number would be intended. For example ethynyl, propynyl (e.g. 1-propynyl, 2-propynyl),
    3-butynyl, pentynyl, hexynyl and 1-methylpent-2-ynyl.
  5 As used herein, "aromatic" refers to hydrocarbonyl groups having one or more unsaturated
    carbon ring(s) having aromatic characters, (e.g. 4n + 2 delocalized electrons) and comprising up
    to 14 carbon atoms. In addition "heteroaromatic" refers to groups having one or more
    unsaturated rings containing carbon and one or more heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen or
    sulphur having aromatic character (e.g. 4n + 2 delocalized electrons).
 [0
    As used herein, the term "aryl" refers to an aromatic ring structure made up of from 5 to 14
    carbon atoms. Ring structures containing 5, 6, 7 and 8 carbon atoms would be single-ring
    aromatic groups, for example, phenyl. Ring structures containing 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14
    would be polycyclic, for example naphthyl. The aromatic ring can be substituted at one or more
 [5 ring positions with such substituents as described above. The term "aryl" also includes polycyclic
    ring systems having two or more cyclic rings in which two or more carbons are common to two
    adjoining rings (the rings are "fused rings") wherein at least one of the rings is aromatic, for
    example, the other cyclic rings can be cycloalkyls, cycloalkenyls, cycloalkynyls, aryls and/or
    heterocyclyls. Examples of polycyclic rings include, but are not limited to, 2,3-dihydro-1,4
 !0 benzodioxine and 2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran.
    As used herein, the terms "cycloalkyl" or "carbocyclyl" are intended to include saturated ring
    groups, having the specified number of carbon atoms. These may include fused or bridged
    polycyclic systems. Cycloalkyls have from 3 to 14 carbon atoms in their ring structure. In one
25  embodiment, cycloalkyls have 3, 4, 5, or 6 carbons in the ring structure. For example,
    "C3 .6 cycloalkyl" denotes such groups as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, or cyclohexyl.
    As used herein, the term "cycloalkenyl" is intended to include unsaturated ring groups, having
    the specified number of carbon atoms. These may include fused or bridged polycyclic systems.
30  Cycloalkenyls may have from 3 to 10 carbon atoms in their ring structure. In one embodiment,
    cycloalkenyls have 3, 4, 5, or 6 carbons in the ring structure. For example, "C3 .6 cycloalkenyl"
    denotes such groups as cyclopropenyl, cyclobutenyl, cyclopentenyl, or cyclohexenyl.

    unsaturated or partially saturated, monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic ring (unless otherwise stated)
    containing 3 to 20 atoms of which 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 ring atoms are chosen from nitrogen, sulphur or
 [0 oxygen, which may, unless otherwise specified, be carbon or nitrogen linked, wherein a -CH2
    group is optionally be replaced by a -C(O)-; and where unless stated to the contrary a ring
    nitrogen or sulphur atom is optionally oxidised to form the N-oxide or S-oxide(s) or a ring
    nitrogen is optionally quarternized; wherein a ring -NH is optionally substituted with acetyl,
    formyl, methyl or mesyl; and a ring is optionally substituted with one or more halo. It is
 [5 understood that when the total number of S and 0 atoms in the heterocyclyl exceeds 1, then
    these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. If the said heterocyclyl group is bi- or tricyclic
    then at least one of the rings may optionally be a heteroaromatic or aromatic ring provided that at
    least one of the rings is non-heteroaromatic. If the said heterocyclyl group is monocyclic then it
    must not be aromatic. Examples of heterocyclyls include, but are not limited to, piperidinyl, N
 !o acetylpiperidinyl, N-methylpiperidinyl, N-formylpiperazinyl, N-mesylpiperazinyl,

    the like. In some embodiments, the heteroaryl group has from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and in
    further embodiments from 3 to 20 carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the heteroaryl group
     contains 3 to 14, 4 to 14, 3 to 7, or 5 to 6 ring-forming atoms. In some embodiments, the
    heteroaryl group has 1 to 4, 1 to 3, or 1 to 2 heteroatoms. In some embodiments, the heteroaryl
  5 group has 1 heteroatom.
    As used herein, "haloalkyl", used alone or as a suffix or prefix, is intended to include both
    branched and straight chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups, having at least one halogen
     substituent and having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms or if a specified number of carbon atoms is
 [0 provided then that specific number would be intended. For example "Co-6 haloalkyl" denotes
     alkyl having 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon atoms. Examples of haloalkyl include, but are not limited
    to, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, chlorofluoromethyl, 1-fluoroethyl, 3
    fluoropropyl, 2-chloropropyl, 3,4-difluorobutyl.
 [5 As used herein, the phrase "protecting group" means temporary substituents which protect a
    potentially reactive functional group from undesired chemical transformations. Examples of such
    protecting groups include esters of carboxylic acids, silyl ethers of alcohols, and acetals and
    ketals of aldehydes and ketones respectively. The field of protecting group chemistry has been
    reviewed (Greene, T.W.; Wuts, P.G.M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3 rd ed.; Wiley:
 !o New York, 1999).
    As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those compounds,
    materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical
    judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without
25   excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate
    with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
    As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refer to derivatives of the disclosed
     compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof.
30  Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic
     acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as
     carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the non-toxic salts
     or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic

        WO 2012/087237                                                               PCT/SE2011/051555

    inorganic or organic acids. For example, such non-toxic salts include those derived from
    inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid.
    The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the
  5 parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods.
    Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds
    with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or
    in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol,
    isopropanol, or acetonitrile are used.

    As used herein, "tautomer" means other structural isomers that exist in equilibrium resulting
    from the migration of a hydrogen atom. For example, keto-enol tautomerism where the resulting
    compound has the properties of both a ketone and an unsaturated alcohol. Other examples of
 [5 tautomerism include 2H-imidazole-4-amine and its tautomer
    1,2-dihydroimidazol-5-imine, and 2H-imidazol-4-thiol and its tautomer 1,2-dihydroimidazol-5
    thione. It is understood that in compound representations throughout this description, only one of
    the possible tautomers of the compound is drawn or named.
 !0 As used herein "stable compound" and "stable structure" are meant to indicate a compound that
    is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and
    formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.
    Compounds of the invention further include hydrates and solvates.
25
    The present invention further includes isotopically-labelled compounds of the invention. An
    "isotopically" or "radio-labelled" compound is a compound of the invention where one or more
    atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different
    from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring).
30  Suitable isotopes that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include but are
    not limited to  2H (also written as D for deuterium),    3H  (also written as T for tritium), "1C,  13

    PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS
    The compounds of the present invention can be prepared as a free base or a pharmaceutically
  5 acceptable salt thereof by the processes described below. Throughout the following description
    of such processes it is understood that, where appropriate, suitable protecting groups will be
    added to, and subsequently removed from the various reactants and intermediates in a manner
    that will be readily understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Conventional
    procedures for using such protecting groups as well as examples of suitable protecting groups are
 [0 for example described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by T.W. Greene, P.G.M Wutz,
    3rd Edition, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1999. It is understood that microwaves (MW) can
    alternatively be used for the heating of reaction mixtures. Another aspect of the present invention
    provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable
    salt thereof, wherein, unless specified otherwise, R 1 -R9 , n and A are defined as for formula (I)
 [5 above, or are groups that can be converted into R 1 -R9 , or A in subsequent transformations. A
    compound of formula (XI) may be equivalent to a compound of formula (I). LG represents a
    leaving group such as halogen (such as chlorine, bromine or iodine) or an alkyl-, aryl- or
    haloalkyl-sulfonate (such as triflate) and PG represents a protecting group. Said process
    comprises of:

    The cDNA for the soluble part of the human -Secretase (AA 1 - AA 460) was cloned using the
    ASP2-Fc1O-1-IRES-GFP-neoK mammalian expression vector. The gene was fused to the Fc

    placed in the robotic system. Enzyme (9 [d) was added to the plate then 1 1dof compound in
    dimethylsulphoxide was added, mixed and pre-incubated for 10 minutes. Substrate (10 [d) was
    then added, mixed and the reaction proceeded for 15 minutes at r.t. The reaction was stopped

    measured on a Victor II plate reader with an excitation wavelength of 340nm and an emission
    wavelength of 615nm. The assay was performed in a Costar 384 well round bottom, low volume,
    non-binding surface plate (Corning #3676). The final concentration of the enzyme was 2.7
    pag/ml; the final concentration of substrate was 100 nM (Km of ~250 nM). The
 t0 dimethylsulphoxide control, instead of test compound, defined the 100% activity level and 0%
    activity was defined by wells lacking enzyme (replaced with reaction buffer). A control inhibitor
    was also used in dose response assays and had an IC50 of -150 nM.

   240). The initial models were further refined by alternative cycles of model rebuilding in Coot
   (Emsley, P., Cowtan, K. Acta Crystallogr., Sect. D 2004, 60, 2126) and refinement in Refmac5
   and AutoBuster (Bricogne, G., Blanc, E., Brandl, M., Flensburg, C., Keller, P., Paciorek, W.,

   UK 2010). Strong 5-15 sigma Fo-Fc density in the vicinity of the BACE active site indicated the
   location of the bound compound. Restraints for the isomers of Example 48 were generated by
   Writedict (Wlodek S., Skillman A.G., Nicholls A., Acta Crystallogr., Sect. D 2006, 62, 741-749)
   and used by Flynn (Wlodek S., Skillman A.G., Nicholls A., Acta Crystallogr., Sect. D 2006, 62,
[0 741-749) to determine the absolute configuration of the compound of interest based on the
   refined omit maps. Final refinement of the BACE-inhibitor complexes was performed in
   Refmac5 and AutoBuster. Resulting 2Fo-Fc maps of Example 20d Isomer 1, Example 48 Isomer
   1, Example 48 Isomer 7 and Example 48 Isomer 8 can be seen in Figures 1-4. Full data
