                                 RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] This patent application is related to Patent Cooperation Treaty Application No.
PCT/US2012/052514 filed 26 August 2012, entitled "Cordless Retractable Roller Shade for
Window Coverings," the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its

                                        BACKGROUND
Field
[0002] The present disclosure relates generally to retractable shades for architectural
openings and more particularly to locks for positioning retractable shades at desired
orientations and heights.
Related Art
[0003] Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
[0004] Retractable shades have been popular for many years and generally extend across or
are retracted from covering architectural openings such as windows, doorways, archways,
and the like. Such retractable coverings may include a roller rotatably supported with a shade
material suspended therefrom. The shade material can either be wrapped about the roller
when retracting the shade or unwrapped from the roller when extending the shade.
                                                1

[0005] Many retractable coverings are operated with flexible operating cords which may
extend, for example, downwardly through or adjacent to the shade material to the bottom rail
of the covering from the head rail and be operated from free ends of the cords. The free ends
of the cords may be exposed adjacent to one end of a head rail for manipulation of an
operator.
[0006] Operating and pull cords can be an issue with retractable coverings, as in some
instances the cords may become tangled and difficult to use, fray or break, damage the
covering from repeated wear, and may sometimes form loops that may present a risk to users.
                                         SUMMARY
[0007] A covering for architectural openings including a roller, a shade wrapped around the
roller, the shade extendable from the roller when the roller rotates in a first direction, and
retractable onto the roller when the roller rotates in a second direction. The covering also
includes a retraction mechanism operably associated with the roller for biasing the roller in a
direction to retract the shade and a positioning device operably engaging the roller for
selectively holding the shade at a selected extension location and selectively releasing the
shade for additional extension or retraction. The positioning device is actuated to hold the
shade at the selected extension position by movement of the shade in either the extension or
retraction direction.
[0008] The positioning device of the covering may also include a spool having a length
operably connected to the roller and selectively rotatably therewith, a shuttle at least partially
received around the spool. In operation, as the roller rotates the shuttle translates along the
length of the spool and when the shuttle is in a first position on the shuttle, the roller can
                                                 2

rotate; and when the shuttle is in a second position on the shuttle the roller is prevented from
rotating.
[0009] In some embodiments, of the positioning device, an outer surface of the spool defines
a pin engagement surface defining a plurality of channels and the shuttle comprises at least
one pin, wherein the at least one pin is configured to travel within the plurality of channels.
The location of the at least one pin on the pin engagement surface determines whether the
shuttle can rotate or whether the shuttle is prevented from rotating.
[0010] Additionally, the positioning device may further include an engagement disk operably
connected to the roller and the spool and operably connecting the spool to the roller; a clutch
operably connected to the engagement disk and the spool. During operation, when the shuttle
is in the second position the clutch prevents the engagement disk from rotating, preventing
the roller from rotating.
[0011] The positioning device may further include a retainer received around the spool and
the shuttle. In these embodiments, the shuttle may include a plurality of translation features
defined on an outer surface, the retainer may include a plurality of guide grooves defined an
interior surface thereof The translation features of the shuttle are received into the guide
grooves of the retainer, and when the translation features are received into the guide grooves
the shuttle translates along the length of the spool as the spool rotates.
[0012] In some embodiments, the positioning device may further include at least one locking
pin and a spool having an outer surface defining a first pin seat and a second pin seat. When
the locking pin is in the first pin seat, the positioning device locks the roller to hold the shade
at the selected extension location and when the locking pin is in the second pin seat, the
                                                   3

positioning device unlocks the roller. In these embodiments, the locking pin is defined on a
shuttle, wherein the shuttle is received around the spool.
[0013] The positioning device may further include an engagement disk operably connecting
the spool and the roller, wherein the engagement disk is rotatably connected to the roller.
Additionally, the positioning device may further include a clutch spring having a spool tang
and a disk tang, wherein the spool tang is operably connected to the spool and the disk tang is
operably connected to the engagement disk, wherein the clutch spring selectively prevents the
spool from rotating relative to the engagement disk.
[0014] A method for operating a covering for an architectural opening including moving a
shade in a first direction to a first position and moving the shade in a second direction from
the first position the hold the shade at the selected position. In the method for operating the
covering, the first direction and the second direction are opposite one another.
[0015] In the method for operating the covering, the first direction can either wrap or unwrap
the shade of the roller.
[0016] In the method for operating the covering, the first direction and the second direction
may be opposite from one another. Additionally, the first direction may unwrap the shade
from a roller or may wrap the shade from the roller.
[0017] A shade including a head railhead rail, a roller at least partially received within the
head railhead rail and operably connected thereto, and at least one sheet operably connected
to the roller. The shade also includes a retraction motor operably connected to the roller and a
locking assembly operably connected to the head rail and the roller. The retraction motor
exerts a biasing force to bias the roller in a first direction and the locking assembly selectively
overcomes the biasing force of the retraction motor.
                                                   4

[0018] In some embodiments, the shade may further include a support rod operably
connected to the head rail and the locking assembly. Additionally, the assembly may further
include a spool rotatably associated with the roller; a shuttle received around a portion of the
spool and traversable along a length of the spool; a retainer received around the spool and the
shuttle and operably connected to the roller. During operation, the retainer prevents the
shuttle from rotating with the spool.
[0019] In some embodiments of the shade, the spool defines a pin engagement surface
defining a first engagement feature and the shuttle includes at least one pin, the at least one
pin engages the pin engagement surface. The at least one pin engages the first engagement
feature, the at least one pin substantially prevents the spool from rotating.
[0020] The locking assembly of the shade may also include a clutch spring operably
connected between the spool and the roller, and when the pin engages the first engagement
feature, the clutch is biased to a closed position.
[0021] One embodiment provides a covering for architectural openings, the covering
comprising:
         a roller;
         a shade wrapped around the roller, the shade configured to extend from or retract onto

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0070] The present disclosure relates to a braking and/or positioning device for retractable
coverings. The positioning device allows a retractable covering, such as a Silhouette by
Hunter Douglas style shade, or the like, to be stopped at a number of different locations as
selected by a user, along a drop length of the shade. For example, when the retractable
covering is positioned within an architectural opening, such as a window, the positioning
device may allow a user to select a vertical position for the retractable shade along a height of
                                                  11

the architectural opening, and the positioning device may hold the retractable shade in the
selected position (e.g., at a height desired by the user), whether the shade is being retracted is
extended. The positioning device may be used in conjunction with a motor or manually
powered system that may eliminate the need for operating cords. In one embodiment, the
positioning device may be used with a retraction motor that may retract the shade (once
released from the locked position) and/or may assist a user in retracting the shade. In these
embodiments, the positioning device and the retraction motor may, in conjunction with a user
applied force, may form an operating mechanism for the covering.
[0071] The positioning device or locking assembly may be configured to selectively prevent
the retraction motor from retracting the shade. In some embodiments, the user may exert a
force to extend the shade and when he or she reaches a desired position may remove the
downward force. The positioning device may then lock the shade into the select position,
preventing the retraction motor from retracting the shade. This may allow the shade to be
locked a position substantially anywhere along the vertical drop length. When the user wishes
to reposition the shade, e.g., further extend or retract the shade, the user may exert a
downward force to disengage the positioning device. Once disengaged, the retraction motor
may retract the shade or the user may further extend the shade by exerting a manual extension
force (e.g., pulling down on an end rail of the shade).
[0072] The positioning device may include an engagement disk, a spring clutch, a spool, a
shuttle, and a retainer. The spring clutch and the spool may be operably connected to the
engagement disk. The shuttle may be received around the spool and the retainer may be
received around the shuttle and a substantial portion of the spool.
[0073] The engagement disk and the spool are connected to the roller in order to rotate along
with the roller, such that as the roller rotates, such as due to a user force pulling down on the
                                                   12

shade, a force exerted by the retraction motor, or the like, the engagement disk and spool
rotate correspondingly. Generally as the spool rotates, the shuttle translates laterally across
the spool.
[0074] The shuttle may include one or more pins or traveling engagement members that
travel along a surface of the spool in predefined pathways. The pathways may follow one or
more channels engraved or recessed into the outer surface of the spool. For example, the
channel walls may be contoured to selectively direct the pins into a particular pathway. The
channel walls may also form one or more seats or parking locations for the pins, which may
selectively retain the pins.
[0075] Depending on the rotation direction of the engagement disk, as well as the location of
the shuttle relative to the spool, the spring clutch and pin may substantially prevent rotation
of the engagement disk in a select direction. Since the engagement disk is keyed to the roller,
the engagement disk may substantially prevent the roller from rotating in the selected
direction. Thus, in the locked position, the spring clutch may prevent the retraction motor
from retracting the shade.
[0076] Turning now to the figures, an illustrative covering incorporating the positioning
device will be discussed in more detail. FIG. 1 is a front isometric view of a covering for
architectural openings in the fully extended position. FIG. 2 is a front isometric view of the
covering of FIG. 1 partially extended. With reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, the covering 100 may
include a shade 102 supported at its top end by a head rail 104. The head rail 104 may
support the shade 102 over an architectural opening, such as a window, doorway, or the like.
End caps 108a, 108b may be operably connected to opposing ends of the head rail 104. An
end rail 106 may be operably connected to a bottom end of the shade 102. The end rail 106
                                                  13

may include a hand 118, which provides a gripping surface for a user so that a user may more
easily the end rail 106.
[0077] The shade 102 may include a rear sheet 110 and a front sheet 112. The two sheets
110, 112 may be formed of substantially any material, such as, but not limited to, wovens,
non-wovens, knits, and so on. Moreover, although the rear sheet 110 and front sheet 112 are
illustrated as substantially continuous sheets, the sheets 110, 112 may be formed of multiple
strips or pieces of material sewed, glued, or otherwise operably connected together. Although
the shade 102 is discussed as having two sheets, in some examples, the sheet may include
only a single sheet or more than two sheets.
[0078] It should be noted that although the shade 102 has been illustrated and discussed as
having operable vanes, many other types of coverings are envisioned to be used with the
locking system discussed in more detail below. For example, FIG. 4C illustrates a cellular
shade, such as a Roman shade. The orientation of the positioning lock, as well as the shade as
it attaches to the roller may be varied based on the type of shade and unwinding direction. In
particular, in FIGS. 4A and 4B, the shade may unwind from a rear side of the roller, whereas
in FIG. 4C the shade may unwind from a front side of the roller. Substantially any type of
roller support retractable covering may incorporate the locking system and other features of
the present disclosure. For example, a covering including only a single sheet or multiple
sheets may be used. Accordingly, the discussion of any particular embodiment is meant to be
illustrative only.
[0079] The rear sheet 110 may have a top end 122 and be a backing or support sheet for the
front sheet 112. The front sheet 112 may have a top end 124 and include one or more vanes
116 that may be operably connected to the rear sheet 110 at discrete locations. For example,
as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the vanes 116 may be operably connected to the rear sheet 110.
                                                 14

The vanes 116 may span between the first sheet and the second sheet and may be opened (as
shown in FIG. 1) or closed (as shown in FIG. 2).
[0080] The vanes 116 may be attached to the front sheet 112 and the rear sheet 110 through a
variety of fastening mechanisms, such as, but not limited to, adhesive, stitching, hook and
loop, connectors, or the like.
[0081] The operating mechanism and positioning device for the covering 100 will now be
discussed in more detail. FIG. 3 is an exploded view of the covering 100. FIG. 4A is a cross
section view of the covering 100 taken along line 4A-4A in FIG. 1. FIG. 4B is a cross-section
view of the covering 100 taken along line 4B-4B in FIG. 1. The covering 100 may include an
operating mechanism 126 including one or more retraction motors 142a, 142b and a
positioning device 144. Additionally, a support assembly may include a roller 138, one or
more end cap connectors 134a, 134b, one or more hubs 132a, 132b, fasteners 136a, 136b, a
limit stop assembly 140, and a support rod 130. The head rail 104 may also include one or
more concealing rails that may be operably connected to the backside of the head rail 104 to
conceal the internal components as well as provide an aesthetically pleasing component for
the covering 100 by concealing the internal components from view.
[0082] The roller 138 may be an elongated cylinder or tube and may extend through a length
of the head rail 104 and may define a roller cavity 150 along an entire length of the roller
138. With reference to FIGS. 3 and 4A, the roller 138 may include a retaining pocket 148 that
may from a groove that extends longitudinally along a length of the roller 138. An entrance to
the retaining pocket 148 may be bounded on either side by a pair of pocket lips 152a, 152b
that reduce the diameter of the entrance to the retaining pocket 148.
                                               15

[0083] The support rod 130 may be operably connected to the end caps 108a, 108b through
the end cap connectors 134a, 134b. The support rod 130 may be a generally elongated rod
and may include one or more keying features 146 that may be used to securely connect one or
more components of the motors 142a, 142b and/or the positioning device 144 thereto. With
reference to FIG. 4A, one keying feature 146 may be a triangularly shaped groove that
extends longitudinally along a length or a portion of the length of the support rod 130 and a
second keying feature may be a planar side formed along one side of the generally
cylindrically support rod 130.
[0084] The two hubs 132a, 132b may be cylindrically shaped components having one or
more roller ridges 154. The roller ridges 154 may extend from an outer surface of the hubs
132a, 132b and may be configured to engage with the roller 138. Each of the hubs 132a, 132b
may also include a connector recess 156 defined therethrough that may receive a portion of
the end cap connector 134a, 134b and/or support rod 130.
[0085] The limit stop assembly 140 assembly may include a threaded coupling and a disk.
These components may be used as stop limits for top and bottom of the shade. These
components are described in related Patent Cooperation Treaty Application No.
PCT/US2013/032224 (Attorney Docket No. P237992.WO.01 entitled "Covering for an
Architectural Opening," and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
Retraction Motors
[0086] The retraction motors 142a, 142b will now be discussed in more detail. FIG. 5 is an
exploded view of one of the retraction motors 142a, 142. The two retraction motors 142a,
142b may be substantially identical to each other; accordingly the discussion with respect to
the first retraction motor 142a may be applied to the second retraction motor 142b. However,
                                               16

it should be noted that in other embodiments, the retraction motors might be configured
differently from each other. Additionally, although two retraction motors 142a, 142b are
illustrated in FIG. 4, in some implementations, the covering 100 may include a single
retraction motor 142a, 142b or more than two retraction motors 142a, 142b. The number
and/or size of the retraction motors 142a, 142b may be based, at least in part, on the length
and width of the shade 102 or the weight of the shade 102. The retraction motors 142a, 142b
may also include other mechanisms for retracting a shade, such as other types of springs, an
electric motor, or the like.
[0087] The retraction motors 142a, 142b may include an outer housing or shell 156 having a
generally cylindrical body having an open first end and a closed second end. The shell 156
defines a spring cavity 162 that receives the spring 158 and a portion of the arbor 160. The
second end of the shell 156 may include an aperture (not shown) for receiving a terminal end
of the arbor 160. The shell 156 may also include a tab crevice 164 defined between a sidewall
166 of the spring cavity 162 and an outer wall 168 of the shell 156. An end of the sidewall
166 is sharply "V" or triangular shaped. Pockets 170, 172 may be defined in the outer wall
168 of the shell 156. The pockets 170, 172 are circumferentially spaced from one another,
and may be used to operably connect a different example of the spring 158 or may be used to
reduce the weight of the shell 156.
[0088] A roller-engagement groove 174 may be defined in the outer surface of the shell 156.
The roller-engagement groove 174 may be a recessed portion of the shell 156 that may be
bordered by two sidewalls 176a, 176b on opposite sides. The roller-engagement groove 174
extends axially along the length of the shell 156 and may have a width that in general
corresponds with a width of a bottom surface of the retaining pocket 148 on the roller 138.
Other portions of the shell 156 may intentionally or incidentally engage interior surface of
                                                17

roller 138, or the shell 156 may be positioned in a spacer or adapter to allow it to fit inside a
roller having a larger diameter.
[0089] The retraction motors 142a, 142b may also include the flat spring 158. The flat spring
158 for use in this example of the retraction motors 142a, 142b is a flat strip of material,
typically metal, that is wound around itself in a coil, such as a clock spring. The spring 158
stores mechanical energy when wound more tightly in the direction of the coil, and exerts a
force or torque in a direction opposite to a direction of the winding. The exerted force may
generally be proportional to the amount of winding. The spring 158 may include a core of
windings 178 having an inner tab 180 and an outer tab 182. In at least one example, the outer
tab 182 is the actuable end (in combination with the shell 156), and the inner tab 180 is the
fixed or anchored tab (in combination with the arbor 160 as described below). The actuable
tab 182 is operably associated with and rotates together with the roller 138 during use, which
winds or unwinds the spring 158. The anchor or fixed tab 180 is operably associated with and
is fixed in position to not move with the roller. The relative motion between the two ends
during the extension of the shade creates a spring force used to counterbalance the weight of
the shade and bias the shade in the retracting direction.
[0090] Between the two tabs 180, 182, the spring 158 may have a plurality of coiled
windings 178. The number of windings 178 may be varied, as well as the diameter of each of
the windings 178. For example, as the outer tab 182 is moved (and the inner tab is held in a
fixed position) in the direction to create more coils that are tighter and more tightly spaced,
the biasing force of the spring increases. Where the outer tab 182 is moved in a direction to
create fewer, less tightly spaced coils, the biasing force of the spring decreases.
[0091] The spring 158 is wrapped around the arbor 160 and together they are positioned
inside the shell 156. The arbor 160 may include an arbor end plate 184 extending from a first
                                                 18

end of an elongated arbor body 350. The arbor body 350 is received and positioned in the
spring cavity 162 and extends through an exit aperture (not shown) defined in the shell 156.
The arbor end plate 184 may serve as an end cap for the spring cavity 162 to prevent the
spring 158 from leaving the cavity 162.
[0092] The arbor 160 may be a generally cylindrical body with a rod cavity defined there
through. A locking protrusion 186 may be defined on an internal wall surrounding the rod
cavity 188. The locking protrusion 186 may be a triangular protrusion. A spring recess 346
may be defined on an outer surface of the arbor 160 and may be used to operably connect the
spring 158 to the arbor 160. In some embodiments, the spring recess 190 may have a length
generally corresponding to a width of the spring 158, and thus may be varied based on the
width of the spring. However, in some embodiments it may be desirable for the spring recess
190 to have a longer length than a width of the spring 158. In these embodiments, the spring
158 may slide along the length of the spring recess 190, which may provide additional
flexibility for torsion forces, and may cushion torsion forces that could otherwise disengage
the spring 158 with the arbor 160. For example, in instances where the spring is back-wound
while in an un-tensioned configuration, the diameter of the windings may increase, but due to
the sliding and releasable engagement of the spring with the spring recess, the tab received
into the recess may release, preventing the spring from bending backwards and deforming. If
the bent inner end of the spring deforms, it may not re-engage with the spring recess 190 and
the spring would need be removed from the housing to repair the inner end of the spring.
[0093] With reference to FIGS. 4 A and 5, the arbor 160 and the spring 158 may be operably
connected together and then positioned within the spring cavity 162 and operably connected
to the shell 156. The inner tab 180 of the spring 158 may be received into the spring groove
190 defined in the arbor 160. The elongated portion of the arbor 160 may then be received
                                                19

within a center of the core 178 of the spring 158 and extend there through. The spring 158
and arbor 160 may then be received into the spring cavity 162. The outer tab 182 of the
spring 158 may be positioned within the tab pocket 164 defined between the outer wall 168
of the shell 156 and the cavity sidewall 166. Thus, the spring 158 may be operably connected
to both the arbor 160 and the shell 156. The end of the arbor 160 may then be received
through an exit aperture (not shown) defined on an end wall of the shell 156.
[0094] Once assembled, the retraction motors 142a, 142b may be operably connected to the
support rod 130 and the roller 138. With reference to FIGS. 3-5, the support rod 130 may be
received through the rod cavity 188 defined in the arbor 166 and the locking protrusion 186 is
received within the recessed keying feature 146 of the support rod 13, the planar keying
feature of the support rod may engage with a flattened sidewall of the rod cavity 188. The
keyed connection between the arbor 160 and the support rod 130 may prevent the arbor 160
from rotating relative to the support rod 130.
[0095] The retraction motor 142a, 142b may then be received into the roller cavity 150 of the
roller 138. The roller engagement feature 174 may receive the ridge 154 with the shell
sidewalls 176a, 176b interfacing with the outer sidewalls of roller engagement feature 174.
The engagement between the roller engagement feature 174 and the roller ridge 154 may
rotatably connect the retraction motors 142b to the roller 138, such that the retraction motors
142a, 142b may rotate as the roller 138 rotates.
Positioning Device
[0096] The positioning device 144 or locking assembly will now be discussed in more detail.
Initially, it should be noted that the orientation of the positioning device 144 in the shade and
with respect to the support rod and roller may be varied based on the desired direction of
                                                  20

rotation for winding and unwinding the shade. For example, FIG. 4B illustrates the
positioning device being used with a shade that unwinds from a rear side of the roller with the
positioning device 144 having a first orientation and FIG. 4C illustrates the positioning
device 144 being used with a shade that unwinds from a front side of the roller with the
positioning lock having a second orientation that is reversed from the example shown in FIG.
4B. Generally, the orientation of the positioning device 144 may be varied based on the
desired rotation direction to retract and extend the shade. Accordingly, the discussion of any
particular implementation is meant as exemplary only.
[0097] FIG. 6A is a front perspective view of the positioning device 144. FIG. 6B is a rear
perspective view of the positioning device 144. FIG. 7 is an exploded view of the positioning
device 144. The positioning device 144 may include a retainer housing 200, a shuttle 202, a
spool 204, an engagement disk 206, and a clutch spring 208, each of which will be discussed
in turn.
[0098] The retainer housing 200 may enclose shuttle 202 and spool 204. FIGS. 8A and 8B
illustrate various perspective views of the retainer housing 200. The retainer housing 200 may
be a generally cylindrical body defining a retainer cavity 230. The retainer cavity 230 may
include a keyed surface that may include guide ridges 216 and guide grooves 214 defined on
an interior surface of the retainer housing 200. The guide grooves 214 and guide ridge 216
may each extend longitudinally along a length of the retainer housing 200. The guide ridges
216 may be spaced apart from each other to define the guide grooves 214 and guide edges
218 or sidewalls. The guide edges 218 are positioned at the interface of the guide grooves
214 and the guide ridges 216. In some examples, the guide edges 218 may be angled such
that the guide ridges 216 may have a generally trapezoidal shape in cross-section.
                                                21

[0099] Continuing with FIGS. 8A and 8B, a retainer axle 212 may extend from distal end
228 of the retainer housing 200. The retainer axle 212 may extend from distal end 228 past an
outer edge 234 of the retainer housing 200. Accordingly, a proximal end 220 may be defined
outside of the retainer housing 200 and a length of the retainer housing 200 may be defined
from the proximal end 220 of the retainer 212 to the distal end 228 of the retainer housing
200.
[0100] A rod cavity 232 may be defined through a center of the retainer axle 212. The
retainer axle 212 may have a generally cylindrical shape. In some examples, a lip 226 may be
defined on an outer surface of the retainer axle 212 before the retainer axle exits the retainer
housing 200.
[0101] The interior surfaces defining the rod cavity 232 may be keyed or otherwise
configured to engage with the support rod 130. For example, a protrusion 224 and a planar
engagement surface 222 may extend along a length of the rod cavity 232. The protrusion 224
may be triangular shaped and may be positioned on an opposite side of the rod cavity 232
from the engagement surface 222. The protrusion 224 and the planar engagement surface 222
fittingly engage with the corresponding features of the support rod 130 as described below.
[0102] The shuttle 202 may be received in the retainer cavity 230. FIG. 9A is a perspective
view of the shuttle 202. FIG. 9B is a front elevation view of the shuttle 202. The shuttle 202
may include a shuttle body 236 which may be a hollow cylinder member. A plurality of
translation features 238 may be defined an outer surface of the shuttle body 236 with a
plurality of receiving grooves 240 defined there between. Translation features 240 and the
receiving grooves 240 may extend longitudinally along a length of the shuttle 202. The
translation features 238 and receiving grooves 240 may correspond to the guide ridges 216
and guide grooves 214 defined on the interior of the retainer housing 200. Translation walls
                                               22

242 may define the interface between each receiving groove 240 and each translation feature
238. The translation walls 242 may extend at an angle from the outer surface of the shuttle
body 236 to define a trapezoidal shape for the translation feature 238.
[0103] The shuttle body 236 defines a spool aperture 248. The spool aperture 248 may have a
diameter sized such that the walls of the shuttle body 236 may be relatively thin. Two or
more pins 244, 246 may be defined on an interior of the shuttle body 236 and may extend
radially into the spool aperture 248. Each of the pins 244, 246 may have a rounded end that
may engage with the spool 204 and travel along an outer surface thereof. The pins 244, 246
may be in diametrically opposed positions within the spool aperture 248, which as described
below, may allow each pin 244, 246 to interact with an opposite side of the spool 204 and
facilitate smooth operation of the positioning device.
[0104] Referring to FIGS. 10A and 1OB, the engagement disk 206 may be operably
connected to the retainer housing 200 and the spool 204. The engagement disk 206 may form
one end of the positioning device 144. The engagement disk 206 may include a rim 250 that
axially extends circumferentially around a disk body 264. The rim 250 forms an annular
space around the disk body 264, such that the disk body 264 may be recessed from the outer
edges of the rim 250.
[0105] A key 260 may be defied on the outer surface of the rim 250, the roller recess 269
may define a trapezoidal groove which receives a corresponding feature on the roller to key
the disk and the roller to rotate as one. Engagement walls 262 may abut either side of the
roller recess 269 and may define the trapezoidal shape of the recess 269. Additionally, in
some examples, the engagement walls 262 may extend past a bottom surface of the rim 250
towards a center of the engagement disk 206. In these examples, the disk body 264 may be
generally circularly shaped but have a trapezoidal recess that receives the engagement walls
                                                23

262. The key 260 may also extend past the bottom surface 268 of the rim 250 towards the
center of the engagement disk 206. The key shape allows the disk to slide along the roller
axially while maintaining a rotation key.
[0106] The disk body 264 may include a web 252 defining a central aperture 258 through a
center thereof A boss 256 may extend outwards from a second side 254 of the engagement
disk 206. The boss 256 may be a tube or hollow cylinder and may extend past the outer edge
266 of the rim 250. In some instances, the boss 256 may define a step 270 towards a distal
end thereof The step 270 may transition to a boss extension 272 that extends from the step
270. The boss extension 272 may have a smaller outer diameter than the boss 256 and the
step 270. The retainer aperture 258 may be defined through the boss 256, the boss extension
272, as well as the disk body 264.
[0107] The spool 204 will now be discussed in more detail. FIG. 11 A is a front perspective
view of the spool 204. FIG. 11 B is a rear perspective view of the spool 204. FIG. 12A is a top
elevation view of the spool. FIG. 12B is a side elevation view of the spool. With reference to
FIGS. 11A-12B, the spool 204 may be a generally cylindrical shaped member having a pin
engagement surface 274 defined on an outer surface thereof and an axle aperture 278 may be
defined therethrough. The axle aperture 278 may extend through a length of the spool 204,
such that the spool 204 may be received on the retainer axle 212.
[0108] A spool collar 276 may be defined on a first end 284 of the spool 204 and may extend
radially outwardly from the pin engagement surface 274. The spool collar 276 may include a
spring slot 282 defined through a portion thereof In some examples, the spring slot 282 may
be a horizontal slit defined through the spool collar 276, the spring slot 282 may be in
communication with the axle aperture 278. The spool collar 276 may include a pair of collar
clamp walls 280 that abut either side of the spring slot 282. The collar clamp walls 280 may
                                               24

be elevated from the outer surface of the spool collar 276. As described in more detail below,
the collar clamp walls 280 help to retain a tab of the spring there between.
[0109] A spring seat 294 may be recessed from the first outer end 284 of the spool 204 and
be positioned within the axle aperture 278. The spring seat 294 may define a shelf within the
axle aperture 278. The axle aperture 278 may extend through the spring seat 294, but may
reduce in diameter as it extends through the spring seat 294.
[0110] The pin engagement surface 274 defines a plurality of channels 284 having contoured
channel walls 286 that define a plurality of pathways 290. The contoured channel walls 286
may also form one or more engagement features on the pin engagement surface. The channel
walls 286 and engagement features interact with pins on the spool. Additionally, because the
pins on the spool are diametrically opposed, the pathways 290 may be symmetrically around
the spool.
[0111] The pin engagement surface 274 may also include one or more directing islands 288
or engagement features, which similarly help to define channels 284. The directing island 288
may be spaced apart from the outer channel walls and may be positioned within one or more
pathways 290. In some examples, the island 288 may be positioned in a center of each side of
the spool 204. The directing island 288 may be shaped as an acute triangle having rounded
edges and a recess defined on a bottom edge. With reference to FIG. 12A, the directing island
may a peak that is angled towards the spool collar 276 that defines a locking diversion tip
320. A contoured sidewall 324 extends from a left side of the locking diversion tip and is
angled towards the entry channel 300, the contoured sidewall 324 may terminate at a seat
diversion tip 326. From the seat diversion tip 326, the directing island 288 transitions
upwards towards the locking diversion tip 320 to define the curved recess forming the upper
seat 296. From the upper seat 296, the directing island 288 may curve back down towards the
                                                25

release diversion tip 310 with the third corner defining a main pathway tip 328. The different
pathways will be discussed in more detail below.
 [0112] A main pathway 316 may be defined between the release diversion tip 310 and a
vertical wall extending from a bottom edge 330 of a first side of the pin engagement surface
toward a top edge 332. The main pathway 316 may extend upwards towards the top edge 332
and may extend around the locking diversion tip 320. Thus, the main pathway 316 may curve
outward towards the spool collar 276 as it approaches and extends around the directing island
288. The top and bottom ends of the main pathway 316 are in communication with the
bottom and top ends, respectively, of the main pathway defined on the opposite side of the
spool 204. An extension pathway 322 may extend from the top of the main pathway 316 and
follow the contoured sidewall 324 of the directing island 288 towards the entry pathway 300.
The extension pathway 322 may generally curve downward from the top edge 332 and may
generally be convexly curved towards the second end 286 of the spool 204.
 [0113] With reference to FIGS. 11 B and 12A, the pin engagement surface 274 may define a
plurality of seats or parking positions. An upper seat 296 may be defined on a bottom wall of
the directing island 288 and a lower seat 298 may be defined on a channel wall 286 adjacent
to but spaced apart from the directing island 288. The two seats 296, 298 may define curved
pockets, which as discussed in more detail below, will engage with the pins on the shuttle to
retain the pins within the pockets.
 [0114] With reference to FIGS. 12A and 1 IB, an entry channel 300 may be defined on a
second end 286 of the spool 204. The entry channel 300 may be a recessed groove that
extends to the second end 286 of the spool 204, and as will be discussed in more detail below,
allows the shuttle 202 to be threaded onto the spool 204. The entry channel 300 extends to
join with the other channels 284 defined on the pin engagement surface 274. The entry
                                               26

channel 300 may be substantially straight and may generally run longitudinally along a
portion of the length of the spool 204. The entry channel 300 terminates as it approaches the
operational pathways defined on the pin engagement surface 274. In some instances, the
entry channel 300 may have a length that is generally about one fourth of the total length of
the spool 204. However, depending on the size of the pins 244, 246, the length of the spool
204, and the dimensions of the pin engagement surface, this may be varied as desired.
[0115] It should be noted that the series of channels 284 and pathways 290 the spool 204 may
be repeated on opposing sides. That is, a first side of the spool may have substantially the
same pattern of channels and pathways as defined on a second side of the spool. In these
examples, as the spool 204 rotates (discussed below), the pins 244, 246 may move relative to
the spool and travel around the outer surface of the spool through the pathways defined in the
pin engagement surface. example, with reference to FIG. 12B, the main pathway 316 may
exit the first side of spool 204 and connect with the main pathway on the second side of the
spool (as it extends over the sides of the spool). The two matching patterns may engage each
of the pins 244, 246 of the spool 204. However, in other embodiments, the pin engagement
surface 274 may have other patterns extending across the entire outer surface of the spool 204
to operate with a single pin (or may have one or more that may or may not match each other).
[0116] With reference to FIG. 7, the clutch spring 208 may be a wrap spring having two
tangs, a spool tang 302 and a disk tang 304. The clutch spring 208 may include a plurality of
windings between each of the tangs 302, 304. In these embodiments, the spool tang 302 and
the disk tang 304 may each form one end of the clutch spring 208. The spool tang 302 may be
biased or actuable by the spool.
[0117] With reference to FIGS. 6A-7, the positioning device 144 may be operably connected
together by inserting the clutch spring 208 onto the boss 256 of the engagement disk 206. The
                                                27

disk tang 304 end of the clutch 208 may be inserted first onto the boss 256 such that the disk
tang 304 may abut the second side 254 of the disk body 264. The clutch spring 208 may have
a length at least somewhat shorter than a length of the boss 256 and in some examples may
terminate prior to the step 270 defined on the boss 256. The spool tang 302 may extend
outward substantially perpendicular to the boss 256.
[0118] Once the spring clutch 208 is received around the boss 256 of the engagement disk
206, the spool 204 may be partially received around the boss 256. The spool collar 276 may
be received over the boss 256 and the spool tang 302 of the spring clutch 208 is positioned
within the spring slot 282 and secured therein by the collar clamp walls 280. The spool collar
276 may be received over the spring clutch 208 and the boss 256, the spool collar 276 may
have generally the same length as the boss 256 and may transition to the pin engagement
surface at the step 270 and boss extension 272.
[0119] When the clutch spring 208 is held in the spring slot 282, the spool 302 may be
substantially anchored by the spool 204. As discussed below, the spool 204 may be operably
connected to the support rod 130, which may substantially prevent the spool 204 from
rotating, and as the spool tang 302 of the clutch spring is received into the spring slot 282, the
spool tang 302 may be held in position.
[0120] With reference to FIGS. 6A-7, 9B, and 11 B the shuttle 202 may be threaded onto the
spool 2004. The shuttle 202 may be oriented such that the first pin 244 and the second pin
246 each align with one of the entry channels 300 defined by the pin engagement surface
274. When aligned, the shuttle 202 may be slid onto the spool 204 with the pins 244, 246
sliding through the entry channel 300.
                                                28

[0121] With the shuttle 202 positioned over the spool 204, the retainer housing 200 may be
received over the shuttle 202 and the spool 204. With reference to FIGS. 6A, 6B, 8B, and 9B,
the guide grooves 214 of the retainer housing 200 may be aligned with the translation feature
238 of the shuttle 200 and the guide ridges 216 may be aligned with the receiving grooves
240 of the shuttle 202. Once the corresponding keying features are aligned, the retainer
housing 200 may be slid onto the shuttle 202 and the spool 202. It should be noted that the
retainer housing 200 may have a longer length than the shuttle 202 and so the retainer
housing 200 may substantially enclose the shuttle 202.
[0122] The retainer axle 212 is received through the axle passage 306 defined through a body
of the spool 204. The retainer axle 202 may extend through the length of the spool 204 and
into the central aperture 258 of the engagement disk 206. With reference to FIG. 6A, in some
examples, the retainer axle 212 may extend through the central aperture 258 to exit the
engagement disk 206. In these examples, a securing nut 308 may be positioned around the
retainer axle 212 to secure it against the engagement disk 206. The distal end 228 of the
retainer housing 200 may thus enclose one end of the positioning device 144 and the other
end may be enclosed by the disk body 264 of the engagement disk 206. With continued
reference to FIG. 6A the retainer 200 housing may terminate as the spool transitions to form
the spool collar 276. In this manner, the spool collar 276 and the spool tang 302 of the clutch
spring 208 may not be enclosed by the retainer housing 200.
[0123] With reference to FIGS. 3, 4B, 6A, and 6B, the operating and locking system within
the roller 138 will now be discussed in more detail. Once the device 144 is assembled, the
support rod 130 may be threaded through the rod 232 defined in the retainer housing 200.
The support rod 130 may be aligned with rod cavity 232 such that the keying feature 146 of
the support rod 130 may be with the protrusion 224 and the flat keying feature may be
                                                29

aligned with the surface 222 of the retainer housing 200. Once aligned, the support rod 130
may be threaded through the retainer axle 212. As described above, the retraction motors
142a, 142b may be received onto the support rod 130 in a similar manner. The limit stop
assembly 140 may also be received on the support rod 130 as well.
[0124] As shown in FIG. 4B, the positioning device 144 may be oriented so as to face the
second end cap 108b, i.e., the engagement disk 206 may be closest to the second end cap
108b. In this orientation, the positioning device 144 may be used in instances where a shade
may unwind off of a backside of the roller. However, with reference to FIG. 4C in other
implementations, the shade may be configured to unwind off a front-side of the roller. For
example, some Roman shades may be configured to unwrap on a front side of the roller. In
these implementations the positioning device 144 orientation may be reversed and may be
oriented such that the engagement disk is closest to the first end cap 108a. In other words, the
direction of the positioning device of the support rod may be varied based on the respective
rotation directions of the roller to extend and retract the shade.
[0125] The roller 138 may then be received around the support rod 130, including the
retraction motors 142a, 142b (as discussed above with respect to FIG. 4), the positioning
device 144, and the limit stop assembly 140. The key 260 defined on the engagement disk
206 of the positioning device 144 is aligned with and receives the roller ridge 154 with the
engagement walls 262 extending around the sidewalls of the roller ridge 154. This allows the
engagement disk 206 to be keyed to the roller 138, such that as the roller 138 rotates, the
engagement disk 206 may rotate correspondingly.
[0126] With the roller 138 received around the support rod 130, the support 130 may then be
received through apertures defined in both hubs 132a, 132b and a corresponding cavity
defined on the end cap connectors 134a, 134b. The hubs 132a, 132b may be received into the
                                                 30

roller 138 and may be rotatably connected therewith. The end cap connectors 134a, 134b may
be operably connected to either the end caps 108a, 108b through the fasteners 136a, 136b. In
this manner, the support rod 130 may be secured to the end caps 108a, 108b and may be
prevented from rotating. In some examples, the end cap connectors 134a, 134b may be
connected to the end caps 108a, 108b using other types of fastening such as, but not limited
to, adhesive, heat staking, or the like. In these examples, the plugs or fasteners 134a, 134b
may be omitted.
[0127] The shade 102 may be operably connected to the roller 138, as the top ends 122, 124
of the rear and front sheets, respectively, may be operably connected into the retaining pocket
148 defined by in the roller 138 (the outer recession forming the interior roller ridge 154). For
example, the top ends 122, 124 may be glued, anchored by an anchoring member (such as a
rod positioned within the retaining pocket 148), or otherwise connected to the roller 138. The
head rail 104 and concealing rail 128 (which may be the rail nearest the wall or other
structure containing the architectural opening) may then be connected around the assembly.
[0128] In some examples, such as when the shade is long or made of a heavy material, one or
more components may slide within the roller, along the support rod, or within the head rail.
Accordingly, additional fastening devices, such as push nuts or the like, may be inserted onto
the support rod 130 to maintain the spatial separation between the components of the
positioning device 144 relative to each other (e.g., the engagement disk and the retainer) or
between the positioning device and other components of the shade. Other fasteners may also
be used as desired or required.
Operation of the Covering
                                                 31

[0129] In discussing the operation of covering 100, it should be noted that the retainer
housing 200 is keyed to the support rod 130 and is stationary, even as the roller rotates. The
engagement disk 206 is keyed to the roller 138 and rotates with roller 138, except when the
positioning device is in a locked position and the engagement disk 206 prevents rotation of
the roller. The shuttle 202 does not rotate but travels laterally along the spool 204, which
rotates due to its connection to the engagement disk 206 (via the clutch 208). The shuttle 202
engages the spool 204 through the pins 244 and due to the longitudinal grooves in the retainer
housing 200, traces along the surface of the spool 204. In other words, the pathways on the
spool 204, as well as grooves and ridges on the retainer housing 200 and the shuttle 202,
direct the motion of the shuttle 202 to translate laterally across the surface of the 204, as the
spool 204 rotates beneath. Thus, the shuttle 202 does not move rotationally, but the spool
moves underneath the shuttle 202 and the shuttle 202 translates across a length of the spool.
Additionally, the pins 244, 246 on the shuttle are diametrically opposed and so the discussion
of the movement of one of the pins equally applicable to the other pin. Therefore, the below
discussion is made with respect to the first pin but is mean to encompass movement of the
second pin.
[0130] Extension of the shade is described with respect to FIGS. 13A-13D. FIG. 13A is a
front perspective view of the shade 102 being extended. FIG. 13B is a side elevation view of
the shuttle positioned on the spool for axial motion relative thereto when the shade is
extending corresponding to FIG. 13A. FIG. 13C illustrates the same view as FIG. 13B but
with the shuttle shown in phantom to illustrate the position of the pins 244, 246. FIG. 13D is
a simplified schematic view of the one half of the pin engagement surface illustrating the
position of the shuttle pin when the shade is extending. With reference to FIGS. 13A-13D, a
force F may be applied to the end rail 106 (such as a user pulling down on the grip 118),
                                                32

which causes the roller 138 to rotate in a first direction RI. In other words, the force F may
pull the shade 102, rotating the roller to cause the shade 102 to unwind off the back of the
roller 138. The clutch spring 208 may be disengaged and not completely inhibiting relative
motion (e.g. "open") while the extension force F is applied, which allows the spool 204 to
rotate, but provides some frictional force against the rotation. Further, as the pin 244 of the
shuttle 204 interacts with the outer surface of the spool 204, the user experiences some
frictional force as the shade is extended.
[0131] As shown in FIGS. 13A-13D, in some instances, the roller 138 may rotate backwards
towards the concealing rail 128 as the shade 102 is extended. As the roller 138 rotates, the
shade 102 unwinds of the back of the roller 138 and lowers. In some examples, such as the
covering 100 illustrated in FIGS. 13A-13D, the shade 102 will unwind such that it may
extend or drop off of a backside of the roller 138 (e.g. the side of the roller closer to the
architectural opening). Additionally, in embodiments where the shade 102 includes the vanes
116, as the shade 102 rolls off of the roller 138, the elements 120 of the vanes 116 may cause
the vanes 116 to extend into their open configuration (e.g., the configuration illustrated in
FIG. 1A). Because the engagement disk is keyed to the roller, when the clutch is open such as
shown in FIGS. 13A-13D, the engagement disk rotates in the first rotation direction RI.
[0132] With brief reference to FIG. 4, the retraction motors 142a, 142b, and specifically, the
shells 156 of each of the retraction motors 142a, 142b, are coupled to the roller 138 through
the roller engagement groove 174. Thus, as the roller 138 rotates in the first rotation direction
RI (illustrated in FIG. 13A as rotating into the shells 156 rotate in the same direction. As the
shells 156 rotate in the first direction RI, the outer tab 182 of the flat spring 158 is rotated as
well. Because the inner tab 180 of the flat spring 158 is anchored on the arbor 160, which is
keyed to support rod 130, the inner tab 180 does not rotate. Thus, the outer tab 182 may be
                                                 33

wound around the core 178 to tighten the spring. This causes the retraction motors 142a,
142b to increase the biasing force that can be exerted by the spring correspondingly with the
extension of the shade 102. In this manner, the retraction motor may increase its potential
retraction force to counteract the increasing weight of the shade (due to gravity) as the shade
is unrolled from the roller 138. It should be noted that although the retraction motors may
vary the biasing force as the shade is extended, in other embodiments, the retraction motors
may a have set biasing force that does not vary with the length of the shade. In these
instances the biasing force of the flat spring may be configured to exert a maximum biasing
force regardless of the position of the shade.
[0133] With reference again to FIGS. 13A-13D and 4B, as roller 138 rotates in the first
rotation direction RI, engagement disk 206 of positioning device 144 rotates
correspondingly. This may be because engagement disk 206 is keyed to the roller ridge 154
through the key 260 (see FIG. 4B). The engagement disk 206 may rotate around the retainer
axle 212 of the retainer housing 200 (which is stationary). In other words, as briefly
explained above, the engagement disk 206 is rotatably connected to the roller, but other
components of the positioning device may be non-rotatably connected to the roller, such as
the retainer housing 200, which is stationary.
[0134] As the engagement disk 206 rotates, the clutch spring 208 is biased open as the spool
tab 302, which is received into the spring slot 282 of the spool collar 276, is biased in a
direction opposite of the windings. That is, the spool tab 302 is biased in a direction which
would unwind the clutch spring 208. Although the clutch spring 208 is open, the extending
force F, which is typically applied by a user, is greater than a bias of the clutch spring 208.
The biasing force thus provides a tactile feeling of retraction to a user as the user pulls the
end rail 106 of the shade 102 downwards. In other words, the biasing force of the clutch
                                                34

spring 208, even with the clutch in the open position, provides some resistance as the user
extends the shade 102, which may provide a pleasing feel to a user. Additionally, the pins
244 of the shuttle 202 engage the outer surface of the spool as the spool rotates, also
providing a tactile feel to the user.
[0135] With continued reference to FIGS. 13A-13D, as the extension force F is being applied
to the end rail 106 the shuttle 202 translates laterally (and in this case axially) along the spool
204 and the pin 244 is encouraged by the contoured track shape to move into the lower seat
298. The lower seat 298 provides a parking area for the pins 244, 246 on the pin engagement
surface 274. When the pin 244 is cradled within the lower seat 298, the spool 204 may not
rotate even as engagement disk 206 continues rotating. However, because the clutch spring
208 is biased open by its connection spool 204, the engagement disk 206 can rotate with the
roller.
[0136] As the shade 102 is being extended, the user may wish to stop the shade 102 at a
particular position. FIG. 14A is a front perspective view of the shade 102 stopped in a desired
position. FIG. 14B is a side elevation view of the shuttle position on the spool when the shade
is locked in a desired position. FIG. 14C illustrates the same view as FIG. 14B but with the
shuttle shown in phantom to illustrate the position of the pin 244. FIG. 14D is a simplified
schematic view of the one half of the pin engagement surface illustrating the position of the
shuttle pin when the shade is locked in position. As the shade 102 is extended the retraction
motors 142a, 142b, and specifically the flat springs 158, are wound tighter as the outer tab
182 is wrapped around the core 178 by the rotation of the shell 156. Once the force rotating
the roller in the first rotation direction RI is removed, the flat spring 158 of the retraction
motors 142a, 142b exerts a clock spring force CF in a second rotation direction R2. In some
                                                   35

embodiments, such as the covering 100 illustrated in FIG. 14, the second rotation direction
R2 may be forward or away from the concealing rail 128.
[0137] As the roller 138 is rotated by the retraction motors 142a, 142b forward in the second
rotation direction R2 (illustrated in FIG. 14A as coming out of the page), the spool 204,
which is connected to the roller 138 via the boss 256 on the engagement disk 206, rotates in
the second rotation direction R2. That is, the spring force CF rotates the roller 138 in the
second rotation direction R2, which causes the engagement disk 206 and the spool 204 to also
rotate in the second rotation direction R2. The spool 204 rotates underneath the pin 244 and
the grooves/pathways guide the pin 244, and thus the shuttle 202, along the spool 204
surface.
[0138] As the spool 204 rotates forwardly, the position of the pin 244 relative the spool
changes based on the channel pathway 312. In this case, the pin are guided by the contours
292 along the channel walls 282) are guided generally radially relative to the spool by the
sidewall 311 of tip 310 along path 312. As rotation continues, the pin 244 crosses path 312
and contacts sidewall 327, which is angled to deflect and guide the pin 244 into the upper seat
296. As the pin 244 is directed by the release diversion tip 310 and contacts the sidewall
surface 327, and pin 244 moves accordingly, the shuttle 202 is moved and travels laterally
along a length of the spool and the retainer housing 200.
[0139] As the spool 204 moves, the pin 244 engage the sidewall 327 of the tip 326 closest to
the upper seat 296, and the sidewall 327 pushes the pin 244 towards the upper seat 296. FIG.
14E is an enlarged view of the seat diversion tip 326 as it engages the pin. With reference to
FIGS. 14C-14E, as the seat diversion tip 326 engages the pin 244, the pin 244 (and thus the
shuttle) is guided laterally at an angle towards the upper seat 296.
                                                36

[0140] When the pin 244 is moved into the upper seat 296 defined on a bottom surface of the
diverting island 288, the positioning device 144 enters the locked position. In the locked
position, the clutch spring 208 is in fixed compression as the spool tab 302 is biased in the
clamping direction. The bias of the clutch spring 208 along with the position of the pin 244 in
the upper seat 296, the spool and the engagement disk 206 are prevented from rotating further
in the second rotation direction R2. Additionally, the main pathway tip 328 acts to hold the
pin 244 within the upper seat 296. It should be noted that the seat diversion tip 326, the main
pathway tip 328, and other tips formed on the spool 204 may be sized and angled to direct the
pin 244 as desired.
[0141] The spool tang 302 of the clutch spring 208 is biased in the closed position due to the
locked position of the pin 244 and the force exerted by the engagement disk. The clutch
spring 208 therefore clamps, preventing rotation of the engagement disk in the second
rotation direction R2. The clutch spring 208, as well the engagement of the pin 244 in the
upper seat 296 counter the clock spring force and prevent the shade 102 from being further
retracted. Additionally, without a downward force F on the end rail 106, the shade 102 is held
in the position selected the user. In other words, the positioning device 144 counteracts the
retraction force the retraction motors 142a, 142b because the pin is seated in the upper seat
and prevents the spool and thus the engagement disk from rotating in the second rotation
direction R2. Absent any downward force F by a user to disengage the clutch 208 by
unseating the pin from seat 296, the shade 102 may generally remain in the position where
the downward force F was first removed (it may rotate slightly upwards due to the initial
clock spring force CF, but that height difference may be minor, e.g., due to partial rotation of
the roller 138).
                                                37

[0142] The positioning device 144 may be activated to lock the shade 102 in substantially
any position along a drop length of the shade 102. This is possible because once the
downward force F (which is typically applied by a user) is removed, the retraction motors
142a, 142b move the roller 138 and the positioning device 144 into the locked position. The
locked position does not require that the shade 102 be in a particular location, but only that
the downward force F is removed. Thus, the positioning device 144 allows the shade 102 to
be operated without operating cords and be stopped and held in position at substantially any
location along its drop length.
[0143] Once locked, the shade 102 can be moved to another position. For example, the shade
102 may be extended further, retracted completely, or retracted partially to another position.
FIG. 15A is a front perspective view of the shade 102 as it is moved from a locked position.
FIG. 15B is a side elevation view of the shuttle position on the spool as the shade transitions
between a locked position and being extended or retracted. FIG. 15C illustrates the same
view as FIG. 15B but with the shuttle shown in phantom to illustrate the position of the pin
244. FIG. 15D is a simplified schematic view of the one half of the pin engagement surface
illustrating the position of the shuttle pin as the shade transitions between a locked position
and being extended or retracted. Once the shade 102 is locked in a select position, to extend
or retract the shade 102 the user applies a downward disengaging force FD. The downward
disengaging force FD may be similar to the extension force F, but in instances where the user
may wish to retract the shade, may be a lower magnitude than the extension force F.
[0144] As the disengaging force F is applied to the end rail 106, the clutch opens and the
engagement disk 206 rotates, rotating the spool 204, to disengage the pin 244 from its parked
location in the upper seat 296. The pins 244, 246 engage the main pathway tip 328 which
pushes the pins 244, 246 towards the release diversion 310. Then, as the pins 244, 246
                                                  38

disengage from the upper seat 296, the pins 244, interact with the contoured peak of the
release diversion tip 310 and along the angled sidewall 318 of the tip which causes the shuttle
202 to move laterally towards the collar 276. The release diversion tip 310, as well as the
angled sidewall 318, is contoured to direct the pin 244 into the movement pathway 316.
Additionally, the pathway tip 328 may be slight curved away from the main pathway 316, to
avoid engaging the pin 244 as they transition from the release diversion tip to the main
pathway 316. Once the pin 244 has become disengaged from the upper seat 296 entered the
movement pathway 316, the shade 102 is unlocked and can be either retracted or extended.
[0145] Once unlocked if a user does not apply the extension force F to counteract the force of
the retraction motors 142a, 142b, the shade may be retracted. FIG. 16A is a front perspective
view of the shade 102 retracted. FIG. 16B is a side elevation view of the shuttle position on
the spool as the shade is retracted. FIG. 16C illustrates the same view as FIG. 16B but with
the shuttle shown in phantom to illustrate the position of the pin 244. FIG. 16D is a simplified
schematic view of the one half of the pin engagement surface illustrating the position of the
shuttle pin when the shade is retracting. As the pin 244 is disengaged from the upper seat 296
and encounters the sidewall 318 of the release diversion tip 310, the contoured wall of the
sidewall 318 directs the pin 244 into the main pathway 316. Once in the main pathway 316,
and with no user extension force F applied to counteract them, the retraction motors 142a,
142b may exert a forward rotation or clock spring force CF on the roller 138, causing the
roller 138 to rotate forwardly and retract the shade 102.
[0146] As the roller 138 rotates, the shuttle 202 remains orientated above the main pathway
316, with the pin 244 traveling along the length of the main pathway 316. The main pathway
316 may be a relatively continuous pathway and may not include a diverting tip or island.
Thus, when the pin 244 is in the pathway, is may be rotated around the spool 204, without
                                                39

being substantially directed or blocked. For example, the main pathway 316 extends
circumferentially around the outer surface of the spool, such that the pin may travel along the
entire circumference of the spool. Because the pin 244 is allowed to travel within the main
pathway 316 and the spool 204 is free to rotate, the clutch spring 208 may be disengaged as
both the spool tang 302 and the disk tang 304 may be rotating together. Thus, the clutch
spring 208 allows the retraction motors 142a, 142b to use the stored bias energy to retract the
shade 102. That is, the clutch spring is open to allow the engagement disk to rotate. It should
be noted that without an intervening user force to counteract the retraction motors, the motors
may continue to wind the shade (with the pin freely traveling in the main pathway), until the
shade is completely wrapped around the roller.
[0147] During retraction of the shade, if a user wishes to stop the shade 102 at a particular
location (or after the shade was locked the user wishes to further extend the shade 102), the
pin may be directed to the extending pathway. FIG. 17A a front perspective view of the shade
102 transitioning between the locked position being extended. FIG. 17B is a side elevation
view of the shuttle position on the spool when the shade is being extended from a locked
position. FIG. 17C illustrates the same view as FIG. 17B but with the shuttle shown in
phantom to illustrate the position of the pin 244. FIG. 17D is a simplified schematic view of
the one half of the pin engagement surface illustrating the position of the shuttle pin when the
shade is extended from the locked position.
[0148] Once the shade 102 has been unlocked as illustrated in FIGS. 16A-16D and the pin
244 is in the main pathway 316, the user may apply the downward extension force F to the
end rail 106. As the user applies the extension force F on the end rail 106, the roller 138 will
begin to rotate in the first rotation direction RI or backwards. The rotation of the roller 138
causes the spool 204 (keyed with the engagement disk 206) to rotate in the first rotation
                                                 40

direction D1. The first rotation direction D1 is the opposite of the retraction or second
rotation direction D2. The reverse rotation direction causes the pin 244 of the shuttle 202 to
encounter the angled wall of the locking diversion tip 320 formed on the directing island 288.
The locking diversion tip 320 directs the pin 244 to enter the extension pathway 322 as the
pin 244 is guided by the contoured sidewall 324 of the directing island 288. At the end of the
contoured sidewall 324, the pin 244 interacts with the seat diversion tip 326 and its angled
sidewall, the seat diversion tip then directs the pin 244 into the lower seat 298. Once in the
lower seat 298, the user may continue to extend the shade 102 as described above with
respect to FIGS. 13A-13D. In some embodiments, the clutch spring 208 may be engaged
until the pins 244, 246 enter the lower seat 298.
[0149] A method further detailing the operation of the covering 100 and specifically the
locking and unlocking of the positioning device 144 will now be discussed in further detail.
FIGS. 18A and 18B illustrate a method 500 for operating the covering 100. With reference to
FIG. 18A, the method 500 may begin with operation 502 and a force may be applied to
extend the shade 102. As discussed above with respect to FIGS. 13A-13D, the extension
force F may be applied by a user pushing down on the end rail 106 (such as by grasping the
finger grip 118 and pulling downward). As the force is being applied to the end rail 106, the
method 500 may proceed to operation 504 and the clutch spring 208 may be biased open,
with the continued extension force F and the clutch spring 208 biased open, the method 500
may proceed to operation 506. In operation 506 the pin 244 of the shuttle 202 may be seated
within the lower seat 298.
[0150] While the pin 244 is in the lower seat 298, the method 500 may proceed to operation
508. In operation 508 the positioning device 144 may determine the extension force F has
been removed. If the extension force F has not yet been removed, the method 500 may return
                                                 41

to operation 506 and the pin 244 may remain in the lower seat 298. In this position, as
described above, the user may continue to extend the shade and the clutch spring 208 may be
open allowing the roller 138 to rotate in the first rotation direction RI as the user extends the
shade 102.
[0151] However, if in operation 508 the extension force F is removed, the method 500 may
proceed to operation 510. In operation 510, the retraction motors 142a, 142b exert a clock
spring force CF in the second rotation direction R2 to rotate the roller 138. The rotation of the
roller 138 may be limited to a partial rotation, because as the roller 138 rotates, the pin 244
may move from the lower seat 298 to the upper seat 296. Once the pin 244 is locked in
position, the method 500 may proceed to operation 512. In operation 512, the retraction
motors 142a, 142b may be prevented from rotating the roller 138 as the pin 244 may lock the
spool 204 and prevent the spool 204 (which is operably connected to the roller 138) from
rotating. Accordingly, at operation 512, the shade 102 may be substantially held in the
position where the user released the extension force F.
[0152] Once the shade 102 is held in a select position, the method 500 may proceed to
operation 514 and the shade may be moved, either to be extended or retracted. If in operation
514 a user does not want to move the shade, the method 500 may proceed again to operation
512 and the shade 102 may be held in position. However, if in operation 514 a user wishes to
move the shade 102, the method may proceed to operation 516. In operation 516 a downward
force, such as the extension force F, may be applied to the end rail 106.
[0153] As the downward force F is applied, the method 500 may proceed to operation 518
(shown in FIG. 18B). With reference to FIG. 18B, as the downward force F is applied, the
method 500 may proceed to operation 518 and the spool 204 may be rotated to move the pins
244, 246 so that they each engage with the release diversion tip 310. Once the pin 244
                                                42

interacts with the release diversion tip 310, the method 500 may proceed to operation 520. In
operation 520, as discussed above with respect to FIGS. 15A-15D, the pin 244 is directed by
the contoured sidewall 318 into the main pathway 316.
[0154] Once the pin 244 is positioned in the main pathway 316, the shade may be further
extended or retracted. Accordingly, after operation 520, the method 500 may proceed to
operation 522. In operation 522 the user may determine to retract the shade 102. If the shade
102 is to be retracted, the method 500 to operation 524 and the end rail 106 no longer
experiences the downward force F. That is, the user removes the downward force F. Once the
downward force F has been removed, the method 500 proceeds to operation 526 and the
rotation motors 142a, 142b, and specifically, the springs 158 rotate the roller 138. As
described with respect to FIGS. 16A-16D, the biasing force exerted by the springs 158 rotates
roller 138 in the second rotation direction R2. As the roller 138 rotates in the second rotation
direction R2, the method 500 may proceed to operation 528 and the shade 102 winds around
the roller 138 and retracts. It should be noted that the user may cause the retraction at
substantially any time to position the shade as desired by applying downward extension force
on the end rail 106.
[0155] In operation 522, a user chooses to extend the shade 102 further, rather than retract
the shade 102, the method 500 may proceed to operation 530. In operation 530, a downward
force F may be applied to the end rail 106 and the pin 244 may engage the locking diversion
tip 320. As the pin 244 interacts with the locking diversion tip 320 it is guided by the sidewall
324 of the diverting island 288. As the pin 244 is guided by the sidewall 324, the method 500
may proceed to operation 532 and the pin 244 may enter the lower seat 298.
[0156] Once the pin 244 is in the lower seat 298, the method 500 may proceed to operation
534 and the clutch spring 208 may be biased open. The clutch spring 208 may thus allow a
                                                43

user to extend the shade 102 by allowing the engagement disk 206 to rotate with the roller
138. After operation 534, the method 500 may proceed to operation 536 and the user may
remove the downward force F. If in operation 536 the user does not remove the downward
force F, the method 500 may return to operation 534 and the clutch spring 208 may remain
open, allowing a user to continue to extend the shade 102. However, if in operation 536, the
downward force F is removed, the method 500 may proceed to operation 538 and the
retraction motors 142a, 142b may rotate the roller 138 a partial rotation. In other words, once
the downward force F is removed, the retraction motors 142a, 142b may exert a biasing force
on the roller 138 to rotate it in the second rotation direction R2.
[0157] As the retraction motors 142a, 142b rotate the roller 138, the pin 244 may be moved
into the upper seat 296. Once the pin 244 is engaged in the upper 296, the roller 138 may be
prevented from rotating the second rotation direction R2 and thus the biasing force exerted by
the retraction motors 142a, 142b may Without an additional downward force by the user, the
method 500 may proceed to operation 542 and the shade 102 may be locked at substantially
the location where downward force F was removed. Thus, the user may position the shade
102 substantially anywhere along its vertical drop length. Once the shade 102 is locked, the
method may return to operation 514 illustrated in FIG. 18A.
