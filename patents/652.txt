ABSTRACT
          A femoral prosthesis system is provided which includes femoral prosthesis and an
instrument for inserting/extracting the femoral prosthesis. The femoral prosthesis includes
a stem and a neck portion. The stem includes a proximal end portion which defines a
proximal stem axis. The neck portion is located proximally of the proximal end portion.
The neck portion includes a proximal surface and an insertion/extraction cavity which
extends distally from the proximal surface. The insertion/extraction cavity is configured to
couple with the insertion/extraction instrument. The insertion/extraction cavity defines an
insertion/extraction cavity axis which, when projected onto a coronal plane including the
proximal stem axis, is not parallel with the proximal stem axis. The insertion/extraction
instrument includes a distal end portion configured to couple with the insertion/extraction
cavity.

FEMORAL PROSTHESIS WITH INSERTION/EXTRACTION FEATURE
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 [0001]         This disclosure relates generally to femoral prostheses and, more
specifically, to features facilitating insertion and extraction of femoral prostheses.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 [0002]         Hip arthroplasty can be used to restore function to an injured or diseased hip
joint. When performing surgical procedures such as hip arthroplasty, physicians generally
attempt to damage as little tissue as possible to minimize trauma to the patient, reducing
the time and effort required for the patient's recovery. To facilitate this goal, advances in
medical technology have enabled minimally invasive surgical procedures, wherein a
minimally necessary number of incisions are made and the incisions are as small as
functionally possible. Accordingly, in minimally invasive procedures, the openings
through which physicians perform procedures are relatively small, resulting in a limited
range of motion and maneuverability for procedural tools and equipment. Thus, minimally
invasive procedures provide benefits, such as minimizing trauma to the patient and
reducing the patient's recovery, as well as challenges, such as reducing the workspace and
range of motion for physicians and their tools during procedures.
 [0003]         For the purposes of surgical procedures, such as hip arthroplasty, positions
and directions relative to the hip joint may be described using anatomical directions.
Accordingly, as used herein, proximal refers to the direction toward to the hip joint, distal
refers to the direction away from the hip joint, anterior refers to the direction toward to the
front of the body, posterior refers to the direction toward to the back of the body, medial
refers to the direction toward to the centerline of the body and lateral refers to the direction
away from the centerline of the body. Additionally, aspects of the hip joint can be
described relative to the anatomical planes: the transverse plane, which divides the body
into a superior portion (nearer to the head) and an inferior portion (nearer to the feet); the
sagittal plane, which divides the body into a left portion and a right portion; and the
coronal plane, which divides the body into the anterior portion and the posterior portion.

                                                  2
[0004]          In a total hip arthroplasty, both the "ball" and the "socket" of the hip joint
are replaced with prosthetic device implants to form a new joint. The ball of the hip joint
is often replaced by removing the femoral head from the proximal end of the femur,
inserting a femoral prosthesis partially into the intramedullary canal of the femur, and
coupling a ball to the proximal end of the femoral prosthesis. The socket of the hip joint is
often replaced by removing bone from the acetabulum to create a cup-shaped opening and
inserting an acetabular cup prosthesis into the cup-shaped opening. In a partial hip
arthroplasty, either the ball or the socket of the hip joint may be replaced with a prosthetic
device. If, after a total or partial hip arthroplasty, a subsequent medical event arises
involving one of the hip implant prostheses, a procedure may be required to extract or
remove the implanted prosthetic device to enable replacement with another prosthesis.
[0005]          Inserting and extracting a femoral prosthetic device from a patient's femur
generally require specific tools which engage with the femoral prosthetic device and enable
a physician to apply sufficient force to the femoral prosthetic device. Because a tight fit
between the femoral prosthetic device and existing femoral bone is desired, both insertion
and extraction of a femoral prosthetic device generally requires application of a significant
impact force to the femoral prosthetic device. Such an impact force is usually applied to
an impact surface on the tool. The impact force is transferred through the tool to the
femoral prosthetic device.
[0006]          Due to the anatomy of the hip joint and the reduced range of
maneuverability in minimally invasive hip arthroplasties, the tools for insertion and
extraction are generally curved, like that in FIG. 1, to accommodate available access angles
and to avoid unwanted contact with and impingement of bones and tissues during the
procedures. The curved shapes of the tools, while providing some benefits, in turn present
additional challenges and difficulties during insertion and removal of femoral prosthetic
devices.
[0007]          As shown in FIG. 1, for example, because the tool 10 is curved, the impact
force F1 applied to the impact surface 12 by the physician is offset from the transfer
location 14 where the force is applied to the femoral prosthetic device through the tool 10.
One problem that arises as a result of this offset 16 is the generation of a moment M about

                                                3
the transfer location 14. In other words, application of the impact force F1 at the impact
surface 12 generates a tendency for the tool 10 to rotate about the transfer location 14.
Accordingly, to prevent the tool 10 from rotating about the transfer location 14 and
maintain stability of the tool 10 during the procedure, the physician must apply a manual
force Fm to the tool 10 to oppose the moment M generated by the impact force F1 .
[0008]          By way of example, if the offset 16 between the axis of the impact force F1
and the transfer location 14 is 50mm and the physician grips the tool 10 at a gripping offset
22 that is 230.7mm from the transfer location 14, the moment M generated at the transfer
location 14 has a magnitude that is approximately 1/5 the magnitude of the impact force F1 .
Accordingly, to oppose the moment M, the physician must apply a manual force Fm that is
approximately 1/5 the magnitude of the impact force F1. If the impact force F, is, for
example, 5001bf, a physician has to apply a manual force Fm that is approximately 1001bf
while also maintaining proper positioning of the instruments.
[0009]          Another problem that arises due to the generated moment M is that the tip
18 of the tool 10 which engages the femoral prosthetic device at the transfer location 14
can be sheared off, becoming lodged in the femoral prosthetic device. As noted above, to
counteract the moment M generated by the impact force F1 applied to the tool 10,
physicians must apply a sufficient opposing manual force Fm. Instead of applying the
manual force Fm to oppose the moment M, however, some physicians have intuitively
attempted to eliminate the moment M by hitting the edge of the impact surface 12, thereby
applying the impact force F1 at an angle 20 relative to the impact surface 12. By applying
the impact force F1 to the tool 10 at an angle 20, however, the physician generates a
significant shear stress Fs on the tip 18 of the tool 10 which engages the femoral prosthetic
device. The shear stress Fs has resulted in shearing off the tip 18 of the tool 10, requiring
additional corrective measures to be undertaken during the procedure.
[0010]          Given the above discussion, it would be advantageous to provide an
improved femoral prosthesis including features enabling insertion/extraction with greater
efficiency and less risk for error. It would also be advantageous to provide an improved
insertion/extraction tool including features enabling insertion/extraction with greater
efficiency and less risk for error. It would also be advantageous to provide an improved

                                               4
method for inserting/extracting femoral prosthetic devices with greater efficiency and less
risk for error.

[0011]          In accordance with one embodiment of the disclosure, there is provided a
femoral prosthesis including a stem and a neck portion. The stem includes a proximal end
portion which defines a proximal stem axis. The neck portion is located proximally of the
proximal end portion. The neck portion includes a proximal surface and an
insertion/extraction cavity extends distally from the proximal surface. The
insertion/extraction cavity is configured to couple with an insertion/extraction instrument.
The insertion/extraction cavity defines an insertion/extraction instrument coupling axis
which, when projected onto a coronal plane including the proximal stem axis, is not
parallel with the proximal stem axis.
[0012]          In accordance with another embodiment of the disclosure, there is provided
a femoral prosthesis system including a femoral prosthesis and an insertion/extraction
instrument. The femoral prosthesis includes a femoral stem and a neck portion. The
femoral stem has a proximal end portion which defines a proximal stem axis. The neck
portion is located proximally of the proximal end portion. The neck portion includes a
proximal surface and an insertion/extraction cavity extends distally from a proximal
surface. The insertion/extraction cavity defines an insertion/extraction instrument coupling
axis which, when projected onto a coronal plane including the proximal stem axis, is not
parallel with   the proximal stem axis. The insertion/extraction instrument includes a distal
end portion configured to couple with the insertion/extraction cavity.
[0013]          In accordance with yet another embodiment of the disclosure, there is
provided a method of inserting a femoral prosthesis including coupling an
insertion/extraction instrument to the femoral prosthesis, inserting a distal end portion of
the femoral prosthesis into a femur, and impacting a proximal end portion of the
insertion/extraction instrument. The instrument includes a body defining a longitudinal
axis and the femoral prosthesis includes a proximal portion and a stem portion defining a
longitudinal axis. Coupling the insertion/extraction instrument to the femoral prosthesis

                                                5
includes coupling the instrument with the proximal portion of the femoral prosthesis such
that the longitudinal axis of the body of the instrument is not parallel with the longitudinal
axis of the stem portion of the femoral prosthesis.
[0014]          The above described features and advantages, as well as others, will become
more readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reference to the following
detailed description and accompanying drawings. While it would be desirable to provide a
femoral prosthesis and femoral prosthesis system that provides one or more of these or
other advantageous features, the teachings disclosed herein extend to those embodiments
which fall within the scope of the appended claims, regardless of whether they accomplish
one or more of the above-mentioned advantages.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0022]          As shown in FIG. 2, the femoral prosthesis 100 includes a stem 104, a neck
portion 108, and a femoral head fitting 112. The neck portion 108 extends proximally
from the stem 104 and the femoral head fitting 112 extends proximally from the neck
portion 108. The stem 104, neck portion 108, and femoral head fitting 112, in one
embodiment, are formed from one piece of material and, in another embodiment, are
formed from individual pieces of material that are subsequently coupled together.
[0023]          The stem 104 includes a stem proximal end portion 116, a stem distal end
portion 120 and a stem body portion 124. The stem 104 is constructed out of a metal or
alloy, such as for example, a titanium alloy, or another material known in the art to have
similar properties desirable for long term implantation into the femur. The stem 104 is
substantially straight along the stem body portion 124 from the stem proximal end portion
116 to the stem body portion 124. The stem proximal end portion 116 defines a
longitudinal axis, referred to herein as a proximal stem axis 128, extending axially through
the approximate center of the stem proximal end portion 116. When the stem proximal end
portion 116 is projected onto a transverse plane, the proximal stem axis 128 extends in a
direction substantially perpendicular to the transverse plane.
[0024]          The stem body portion 124 extends between the stem proximal end portion
116 and the stem distal end portion 120 and has a generally elongated shape. The stem
body portion 124 in one embodiment includes a taper such that the stem body portion 124
is smaller nearer to the stem distal end portion 120 and larger nearer to the stem proximal
end portion 116. The taper is sized and configured to facilitate insertion of the femoral
prosthesis 100 into an intermedullary canal of a femur.

                                                7
[0025]          The neck portion 108 extends proximally from the stem proximal end
portion 116 and includes a neck proximal end portion 152, a neck distal end portion 156, a
neck medial portion 160 and a neck lateral portion 164. The neck medial portion 160 and
the neck lateral portion 164 extend between the neck proximal end portion 152 and the
neck distal end portion 156 and are arranged opposite one another along the neck portion
108. The neck lateral portion 164 includes a shoulder 176. In particular, the neck portion
108 is shaped such that the neck lateral portion 164 is more medial at the neck proximal
end portion 152 than at the neck distal end portion 156 forming the shoulder 176.
[0026]          The neck distal end portion 156 is located adjacent to the stem proximal end
portion 116 and the neck proximal end portion 152 extends proximally from the neck distal
end portion 156. The neck proximal end portion 152 includes a proximal surface 180
extending along at least a portion of the neck proximal end portion 152 and the neck lateral
portion 164. The proximal surface 180 is oriented such that it substantially faces
proximally away from the stem 104 and the neck portion 108. Additionally, when the neck
proximal end portion 152 is viewed in a transverse plane, the proximal surface 180 is
substantially parallel to the transverse plane.
[0027]          The neck proximal end portion 152 also includes an insertion/extraction
cavity 184 extending distally into the proximal surface 180 as shown in FIG. 3. The
insertion/extraction cavity 184 includes an insertion/extraction cavity axis 200. The
insertion/extraction cavity 184 extends distally into the proximal surface 180 at an angle A
that is not orthogonal to the proximal surface 180. In particular, as described in more
detail below, as the insertion/extraction cavity 184 extends distally, it also extends
laterally.
[0028]          With reference to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the neck proximal end portion 152 and
the insertion/extraction cavity 184 are described in more detail. As shown, the
insertion/extraction cavity 184 includes an instrument receiving portion 188, a prosthesis
keyed portion 192, and a prosthesis threaded portion 196. The instrument receiving
portion 188 is located directly distally to the proximal surface 180 and is open to the
proximal surface 180. The instrument receiving portion 188 has an instrument receiving
portion depth 204 (shown in FIG. 3) defined relative to the proximal surface 180. The

                                                 8
instrument receiving portion 188, in this embodiment, is also in open communication with
both the prosthesis keyed portion 192 and the prosthesis threaded portion 196. In some
embodiments, however, the instrument receiving portion 188 is not in open communication
with the prosthesis keyed portion 192.
[0029]          The prosthesis keyed portion 192 is also located directly distally to the
proximal surface 180 and is open to the proximal surface 180. The prosthesis keyed
portion 192 has a prosthesis keyed portion depth 208 (shown in FIG. 3) defined relative to
the proximal surface 180, and the prosthesis keyed portion depth 208 is shallower than the
instrument receiving portion depth 204. The prosthesis keyed portion 192 is offset
laterally from the instrument receiving portion 188.
[0030]          The prosthesis threaded portion 196 extends distally from the instrument
receiving portion 188. The prosthesis threaded portion 196 (shown in FIG. 3) is defined by
a wall 216. The prosthesis threaded portion 196 includes threads (not shown) extending
into the wall 216.
[0031]          The insertion/extraction cavity axis 200 extends axially through the center
of the instrument receiving portion 188 and the prosthesis threaded portion 196 (shown in
FIG. 3) of the insertion/extraction cavity 184. In other embodiments, however, the
insertion/extraction cavity axis 200 need not extend through the center of the instrument
receiving portion 188. When the insertion/extraction cavity axis 200 and the proximal
stem axis 128 are projected onto a coronal plane, the insertion/extraction cavity axis 200 is
not oriented in a direction that is substantially parallel to the proximal stem axis 128 but
instead extends at the angle A relative to the proximal stem axis 128. In particular, the
insertion/extraction cavity axis 200 extends at the angle A proximally and medially to the
proximal stem axis 128. In at least one embodiment, the angle A is in the range of
approximately one through approximately forty-five degrees. The angle A in one
embodiment is twelve degrees relative to the proximal stem axis 128.
[0032]          In one embodiment, the insertion/extraction cavity 184 is oriented in a
direction that is approximately parallel to the shoulder 176. As noted above, the shoulder
176 is formed due to the neck lateral portion 164 extending more medially at the neck

                                                9
proximal end portion 152 than at the neck distal end portion 156 (shown in FIG. 2). In
other words, the shoulder 176 extends laterally as it extends distally relative to the
proximal surface 180. Accordingly, when the stem 104 and the neck portion 108 (shown
in FIG. 2) are viewed in the coronal plane, the shoulder 176 is not oriented in a direction
that is substantially parallel to the proximal stem axis 128 but instead extends at an angle A
relative to the proximal stem axis 128.
[0033]          In one embodiment, there is provided a kit including a plurality of femoral
prostheses of different sizes and shapes allowing the physician to select the best fitting
prosthesis from the kit to insert into a particular patient's femur. The best fitting prosthesis
is determined by, among other considerations, the morphology and topography of the
patient's femur. Accordingly, to provide a useful range of fits, each femoral prosthesis in
the kit has a shoulder 176 oriented at an angle A relative to the proximal stem axis 128 that
is different than the angle of each of the other femoral prostheses in the kit. In this
embodiment, the angle of the insertion/extraction cavity 184 relative to the proximal stem
axis 128 of each of the femoral prostheses in the kit is approximately equal to the angle of
the shoulder 176 relative to the proximal stem axis 128 of the smallest femoral prosthesis
in the kit. In this embodiment, the angle of the shoulder 176 relative to the proximal stem
axis 128 of the smallest femoral prosthesis in the kit is approximately twelve degrees. An
advantage of this embodiment is that the physician has the same feel, and exerts the same
forces in the same directions, while inserting any of the femoral prostheses into the
patient's femur (as described below), because the insertion/extraction cavity 184 is
oriented at the same angle regardless of the size or shape of the particular prosthesis. In
another embodiment, the angle of the insertion/extraction cavity 184 relative to the
proximal stem axis 128 of each of the femoral prostheses in the kit is approximately equal
to the angle of the shoulder 176 of that femoral prosthesis relative to the proximal stem
axis 128.
[0034]          Returning to FIG. 2, the femoral head fitting 112 extends proximally from
the neck proximal end portion 152 and includes a coupling surface 228 extending around
the femoral head fitting 112 and tapering inwardly such that the femoral head fitting 112 is
configured to mate for a friction fit with a complementary taper of a ball portion (not
shown). Taken together, the femoral prosthesis 100 and the ball portion complete a

                                              10
femoral implant that is used to replace the femoral head of a patient during hip
arthroplasty.
[0035]         Turning now to FIG. 5, an instrument 300 is provided that is configured to
enable insertion of the femoral prosthesis 100, described above and shown in FIG. 2, into
and removal of the femoral prosthesis 100 from a patient's femur during hip arthroplasty.
The instrument 300 includes an instrument body or housing 312 and a shaft 316. The
housing 312 defines a housing axis 320 and includes a housing impact end portion 324, a
housing engagement end portion 328, a longitudinal opening 332, and an instrument keyed
portion 336. The housing axis 320 extends axially through the center of the housing 312
through the housing impact end portion 324 and the housing engagement end portion 328
and, in this embodiment, is coincident with an impact axis 308. The impact axis 308 is the
axis along which force is transferred to a femoral prosthesis such as the femoral prosthesis
100. In another embodiment, however, the housing axis 320 need not be coincident with
the impact axis 308.
[0036]         The housing impact end portion 324 is arranged opposite the housing
engagement end portion 328. The longitudinal opening 332 extends through the housing
312 along the housing axis 320 from the housing impact end portion 324 to the housing
engagement end portion 328. The instrument keyed portion 336 is located at the distal end
of the housing engagement end portion 328.
[0037]         The shaft 316 defines a shaft axis 340 and includes a shaft impact end
portion 344, and a shaft engagement end portion 348, which includes an instrument
threaded portion 352. The shaft axis 340 extends axially through the center of the shaft
316 through the shaft impact end portion 344 and the shaft engagement end portion 348.
The shaft 316 is sized and configured to be rotatably received and retained within the
longitudinal opening 332 of the housing 312 such that the shaft axis 340 is coincident with
the housing axis 320. In this embodiment, the shaft axis 340 is, consequently, also
coincident with the impact axis 308. In another embodiment, however, the shaft axis 340
need not be coincident with the impact axis 308. When the shaft 316 is received within the
housing 312, the shaft impact end portion 344 is adjacent the housing impact end portion

                                                11
324, the shaft engagement end portion 348 is adjacent the housing engagement end portion
328, and the shaft 316 is rotatable relative to the housing 312.
[0038]          The shaft impact end portion 344 includes a knob 354 having an impact
surface 356. The knob 354 of the shaft impact end portion 344 extends outwardly of
housing impact end portion 324 such that the knob 354 protrudes beyond the housing
impact end portion 324. The knob 354 is operably connected to the shaft impact end
portion 344 and is configured to be gripped. The shaft 316 can be rotated relative to the
housing 312 by rotating the knob 354 where it protrudes beyond the housing impact end
portion 324. The impact surface 356 is arranged proximally on the knob 354 such that it
aligns with and is substantially orthogonal to the shaft axis 340. Accordingly, an impact
applied to the impact surface 356 is transferred through the shaft 316 along the shaft axis
340.
[0039]          The instrument threaded portion 352 protrudes from the housing
engagement end portion 328 such that the threads 360 of the instrument threaded portion
352 are exposed. The instrument threaded portion 352 is substantially aligned with the
shaft axis 340. As mentioned above, the shaft 316 is configured such that, when the knob
354 on the shaft impact end portion 344 is rotated, the shaft engagement end portion 348 is
also rotated, thereby rotating the instrument threaded portion 352 relative to the housing
engagement end portion 328.
[0040]          As shown in FIG. 6, the instrument 300 is arranged and configured such that
the housing engagement end portion 328 and the shaft engagement end portion 348 engage
the insertion/extraction cavity 184 of the femoral prosthesis 100 to facilitate insertion of
the femoral prosthesis 100 into a patient's femur and removal of the femoral prosthesis 100
from a patient's femur during hip arthroplasty. In particular, the prosthesis keyed portion
192 is configured to couple with the instrument keyed portion 336, and the prosthesis
threaded portion 196 is configured to couple with the instrument threaded portion 352.
[0041]          In operation, to use the instrument 300 to facilitate insertion of the femoral
prosthesis into a patient's femur, the instrument threaded portion 352 is first inserted into
the instrument receiving portion 188 to generally align the instrument 300 with the

                                                12
insertion/extraction cavity 184. Once the threaded portion has been received within the
instrument receiving portion 188, the instrument keyed portion 336 is inserted into the
prosthesis keyed portion 192 to maintain the alignment of the instrument 300 with the
femoral prosthesis 100.
[0042]          Next, the instrument threaded portion 352 is rotated relative to the housing
312 by rotating the knob 354 on the shaft impact end portion 344 (shown in FIG. 5).
Because the instrument keyed portion 336 is mated with the prosthesis keyed portion 192,
the housing 312 is prevented from rotating relative to the femoral prosthesis 100.
Accordingly, when the instrument threaded portion 352 is rotated relative to the housing
312, the instrument threaded portion 352 is also rotated relative to the femoral prosthesis
100. Thus, the instrument threaded portion 352 extends into and threadably engages the
prosthesis threaded portion 196 in the insertion/extraction cavity 184. In this embodiment,
engagement of the instrument threaded portion 352 with the prosthesis threaded portion
196 couples the instrument 300 with the femoral prosthesis 100 such that the instrument
300 is restricted in movement away from the femoral prosthesis 100. In another
embodiment, threaded portions need not be used to couple the instrument 300 with the
femoral prosthesis 100, but the instrument 300 is coupled to the femoral prosthesis 100 in
another way which restricts movement of the instrument 300 away from the femoral
prosthesis 100. For example, either a collet or a bayonet clasp is used to couple the
instrument 300 with the femoral prosthesis 100 in such a way as to restrict movement of
the instrument 300 away from the femoral prosthesis 100.
[0043]          Once the instrument threaded portion 352 has fully engaged the prosthesis
threaded portion 196, the impact axis 308 is substantially coincident with the
insertion/extraction cavity axis 200. Accordingly, because the insertion/extraction cavity
axis 200 is not oriented in a direction that is substantially parallel to the proximal stem axis
128 but instead extends at an angle A relative to the proximal stem axis 128, the impact
axis 308 also is not parallel with the proximal stem axis 128. An advantage of orienting
the impact axis 308 at an angle A relative to the proximal stem axis 128 is that the
physician can avoid unnecessary interference with the patient's musculoskeletal system in
the hip joint. Because the impact axis 308 is oriented at an angle A, the physician need not
have an orthogonal line of access relative to the femoral prosthesis 100 to insert or remove

                                                13
the femoral prosthesis. The most effective combination of leverage and access is achieved
by orienting the impact axis 308 at an angle A that is in a range of approximately one
degree through approximately forty-five degrees relative to the proximal stem axis 128.
[0044]          An impact is then applied to the instrument 300 and transferred through the
instrument 300 to the attached femoral prosthesis 100. More specifically, when an impact
force is applied to the impact surface 356 (shown in FIG. 5), the impact force is transferred
through the impact surface 356, the knob 354, the shaft 316, and the threaded portion 352,
successively, to the femoral prosthesis 100, thereby facilitating insertion of the femoral
prosthesis 100 into the patient's femur. Because the impact axis 308 is coincident with the
insertion/extraction cavity axis 200, the impact force is transferred fully and directly into
the femoral prosthesis 100 without generating a moment around the instrument threaded
portion 352 or applying shear stress to the instrument threaded portion 352. Accordingly,
using the instrument 300 in combination with the femoral prosthesis 100 during hip
arthroplasty facilitates the insertion of the femoral prosthesis 100 into the patient's femur
with more efficiency and less risk for error.
[0045]          In one embodiment, the housing 312 includes internal threads (not shown)
such that when the instrument threaded portion 352 is rotated relative to the housing 312,
the shaft 316 travels axially within the housing 312. Accordingly, increasing engagement
of the instrument threaded portion 352 with the prosthesis threaded portion 196 causes the
shaft 316 to travel distally within the housing 312. Distal movement of the shaft 316
within the housing 312 is limited by contact of the knob 354 on the shaft impact end
portion 344 (shown in FIG. 5) with a housing proximal surface 364 on the housing impact
end portion 324. In this embodiment, an impact force applied to the impact surface 356 is
transferred to the femoral prosthesis 100 through the housing 312 in addition to the shaft
316.
[0046]          Additionally, in this embodiment, to facilitate the transfer of the impact
force to the femoral prosthesis 100 through the housing 312, the instrument keyed portion
336 is configured to contact the prosthesis keyed portion 192. Specifically, an instrument
keyed portion surface 338 is configured to contact and rest flatly on a prosthesis keyed
portion surface 194. The prosthesis keyed portion surface 194 is arranged substantially

                                               14
orthogonally relative to the insertion/extraction cavity axis 200. When an impact force is
applied to the impact surface 356 (shown in FIG. 5), the impact force is transferred through
the impact surface 356, the knob 354, the housing proximal surface 364, the instrument
keyed portion 336, and, ultimately, the instrument keyed portion surface 338, successively.
The arrangement of the prosthesis keyed portion surface 194 relative to the
insertion/extraction cavity axis 200 (and thus relative to the impact axis 308) causes the
impact force to be transmitted through the instrument keyed portion 336 to the femoral
prosthesis 100 in a direction along the instrument keyed portion 336 such that neither the
instrument threaded portion 352 nor the instrument keyed portion 336 experiences any
shear stress. The transfer of the impact force to the femoral prosthesis 100, thereby further
facilitates insertion of the femoral prosthesis 100 into the patient's femur with greater
efficiency and less risk for error.
[0047]           In embodiments wherein the instrument 300 is used only for insertion,
through the processes described above, the threaded portions 196 and 352 may be omitted.
In an embodiment wherein the instrument 300 does not include threaded portions 196 and
352, the shaft engagement end portion 348 is used solely for alignment and the only area of
contact between the instrument 300 and the femoral prosthesis 100 is where the instrument
keyed portion surface 338 contacts the prosthesis keyed portion surface 194. Put another
way, the impact is transferred to the femoral prosthesis 100 only through the housing 312
of the instrument 300.
[0048]           In embodiments wherein the threaded portions 196 and 352 are included,
however, the instrument 300 may be used for extracting, in addition to inserting, the
femoral prosthesis 100. Specifically, the threaded portions 196 and 352 of the prosthesis
and the instrument, respectively, enable use of the prosthesis 100 and the instrument 300
for extraction from the femur in addition to insertion into the femur. The process by which
the instrument 300 is used for insertion of the prosthesis 100 is described above. The
process by which the instrument 300 is used for extraction of the prosthesis 100 differs
from the insertion process in that the threaded portions 196 and 352 engage with one
another, such that applying force to the instrument 300 in a direction away from the
prosthesis 100 will pull the prosthesis 100 away from the femur, thereby extracting the
prosthesis 100 from the intermedullary canal.

                                                15
[0049]           By way of example, the instrument 300, in some embodiments, includes
features that enable the impact force to be applied in the opposite direction relative to the
insertion impact. In particular, the instrument 300 is configured such that the knob 354
aligns with and is substantially orthogonal to the shaft axis 340 such that an impact applied
to the underside of the knob 354 is transferred through the shaft 316 along the shaft axis
340. Alternatively, the housing 312 includes a flange (not shown) which extends
outwardly from the housing axis 320 at the shaft impact end portion 344 and is configured
to receive an impact applied in a direction away from the shaft engagement end portion
348. In this way, the instrument 300 is still used with the femoral prosthesis 100 but,
because the impact is applied in the opposite direction, the instrument 300 facilitates
extraction of, rather than insertion of, the femoral prosthesis 100. Accordingly, using the
instrument 300 in combination with the femoral prosthesis 100 during hip arthroplasty
facilitates the extraction of the femoral prosthesis 100 from the patient's femur with more
efficiency and less risk for error.
[0050]           Consequently, while the instrument 300 in FIG. 5 is configured to both
insert and extract a femoral prosthesis 100, in some embodiments, a separate instrument is
used to insert a femoral prosthesis 100 than to extract a femoral prosthesis 100.
