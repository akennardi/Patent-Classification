[001]    This application is a continuation-in-part and claims the benefit of priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §
 120 to U.S. Patent Application 14/037,481, filed on September 26, 2013, a U.S. Non-Provisional patent
application that claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. Provisional application 61/705,790,
filed on September 26, 2012 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61/ 871,662, filed on August 29, 2013,
and also claims the benefit of priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. Patent Application 61/990,800,
filed on May 9, 2014, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[002]    Androgen is a generic term for any natural or synthetic compound (often a steroid hormone).
Androgens stimulate or control the development and maintenance of male characteristics in vertebrates by
binding to androgen receptors.        This includes the activity of the accessory male sex organs and
development of male secondary sex characteristics. Androgens are also the original anabolic steroids and
the precursor of estrogens, the female sex hormones.            The androgens include dihydrotestosterone
testosterone, androstenedione, androstenediol, and dehydroepiandrosterone.
[003]    Certain disorders or disease conditions are exacerbated by the presence of androgens. One such
example is a hormone-sensitive or hormone-dependent cancer.               A hormone-sensitive or hormone
dependent cancer is one where the proliferation of tumor cells depends on the presence of a hormone or
its activity.   Non-limiting examples of hormone-dependent cancers include cancers of the breast,
endometrium, prostate, ovary, testis, thyroid and bone.         Other examples of a hormone-sensitive or
hormone-dependent disorder include, without limitation, a non-cancerous cell proliferation disorder like a
uterine fibroid, a fibrocystic breast disease, an ovarian cyst, and prostate enlargement; abnormal uterine
bleeding, amenorrhoea, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), endometriosis, adenomyosis, and alopecia.
[004]    Hormone depletion therapy is the current treatment option available to people diagnosed with
certain hormone-sensitive or hormone-dependent disorders, such as, e.g. a hormone-dependent cancer.
The basic of this therapy is that growth of a cancer can be reduced or halted by starving tumor cells of a
hormone inducing cell proliferation. Typically, this is achieved by reducing the overall systemic levels of a
hormone, by preventing the endogenous hormone from interacting with its cognate receptor, or both.
Although effective at first, most hormone dependent cancers become refractory after one to three years
and resume growth despite continued hormone depletion therapy. Once a hormone-sensitive or hormone
dependent disorder becomes hormone refractory, the treatment options available to a patient are limited.

                                                 SUMMARY
[006]    Aspects of the present specification disclose compositions comprising a therapeutic compound
capable of modulating androgen production.          Therapeutic compounds include, without limitation, a
benzo(iso)oxazolepiperidine, a fatty acid, a 5a reductase inhibitor, a chemotherapeutic agent, an anti
proliferative agent, or any combination thereof. The composition disclosed herein may reduce an unwanted
side and/or reduce a symptom of a disorder associated with androgen production.
[007]    Aspects of the present specification also disclose methods of treating an individual with a disorder
associated with androgen production. The disclosed methods comprising the step of administering to an
individual in need thereof a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein, wherein administration reduces
a symptom of a disorder associated with androgen production.           A disorder associated with androgen
production may be a disorder associated with steroid hydroxy-dehydrogenase activity, a disorder
associated with HSD17B activity, a disorder associated with HSD17B10 activity, or any combination
thereof. A disorder associated with androgen production may be a hormone-dependent disorder like a
hormone-dependent proliferative disorder or a hormone-dependent non-proliferative disorder. A disorder
associated with androgen production may be a cancer, a hormone-refractory cancer, benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH), polycystic ovary syndrome, acne vulgaris, seborrhea, female hirsutism, or androgenic
alopecia. Administration of a pharmaceutical composition may reduce the frequency of a symptom, the
number of symptoms, the severity of a symptom, or any combination thereof.               Administration of a
pharmaceutical composition may also reduce an unwanted side in the individual.

                                           DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[013]     Many patients treated with a hormone depletion therapy become resistant to this therapy. The
present specification discloses that one possible mechanism for why certain hormone-sensitive or
hormone-dependent disorders become refractory is the presence of a secondary pathway that produces
the hormone or hormonal activity targeted for depletion.       For example, prostate cancer is a hormone
dependent cancer and patients diagnosed with this cancer are typically treated using an androgen depletion
therapy. However, many such patients become refractory to this treatment after one to three years. One
possible explanation for this treatment resistance is the presence of an additional pathway that becomes
responsible for generating testosterone (or dihydrotestosterone) in a manner useful to support proliferation
of prostate tumor cells.
[014]     The present specification discloses compounds and pharmaceutical compositions comprising
compounds that produce therapeutic effects in reducing a symptom of a disorder associated with androgen
production. In aspects of this embodiment, the therapeutic effect is achieved by reducing or inhibiting the
activity facilitated by an alternative or secondary pathway responsible for androgen production. In aspects
of this embodiment, the therapeutic effect is achieved by reducing or inhibiting the activity facilitated by the
primary pathway responsible for androgen production in addition to reducing or inhibiting the activity
facilitated by an alternative or secondary pathway responsible for androgen production.

[028]    A therapeutic compound disclosed herein may be capable of modulating 17p-Hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase (HSD17B) activity. As used herein, the term "capable of modulating HSD17B activity"
refers to the ability of the therapeutic compound disclosed herein to directly or indirectly alter the oxidative
activity of a HSD17B, directly or indirectly alter the reductive activity of a HSD17B, directly or indirectly
decrease the level of a progesterone in an individual, directly or indirectly decrease the level of an androgen
in an individual, directly or indirectly decrease the level of an estrogen in an individual, or any combination
thereof. Steroid hydroxy-dehydrogenases are a class of enzyme involved in androgen production. 17p
hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17P HSDs or HSD17Bs) are responsible for oxidation and reduction of
androgens via this bio-synthetic pathway. Most of these enzymes are capable of working in both redox
directions, but predominantly carry out one reaction in vivo. HSD17p1O (HSD17B1O or HSD10) is known
to be up-regulated in certain cancers as well as cancer that have become hormone refractory.

[047]     Unless otherwise indicated, when a compound or chemical structural feature disclosed herein is
referred to as being "optionally substituted," it includes a feature that has no substituents (i.e. unsubstituted),
or a feature that is "substituted," meaning that the feature has one or more substituents.              The term
"substituent" has the broadest meaning known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and includes a moiety that
replaces one or more hydrogen atoms attached to a parent compound or structural feature. In some
embodiments, a substituent may be an ordinary organic moiety known in the art, which may have a
molecular weight (e.g. the sum of the atomic masses of the atoms of the substituent) of 15 g/mol to 50
g/mol, 15 g/mol to 100 g/mol, 15 g/mol to 150 g/mol,15 g/mol to 200 g/mol, 15 g/mol to 300 g/mol, or 15
g/mol to 500 g/mol. In some embodiments, a substituent comprises, or consists of: 0-30, 0-20, 0-10, or 0
5 carbon atoms; and 0-30, 0-20, 0-10, or 0-5 heteroatoms, wherein each heteroatom may independently
be: N, 0, S, Si, F, Cl, Br, or I; provided that the substituent includes one C, N, 0, S, Si, F, CI, Br, or I atom.

[048]     For convenience, the term "molecular weight" is used with respect to a moiety or part of a molecule
to indicate the sum of the atomic masses of the atoms in the moiety or part of a molecule, even though it
may not be a complete molecule.
[049]     As used herein, the term "alkyl" has the broadest meaning generally understood in the art, and may
include a moiety composed of carbon and hydrogen containing no double or triple bonds. Alkyl may be
linear alkyl, branched alkyl, cycloalkyl, or a combination thereof, and in some embodiments, may contain
from one to thirty-five carbon atoms. In some embodiments, alkyl may include C1.1o linear alkyl, such as
methyl (-CH3), ethyl (-CH2CH3), n-propyl (-CH 2CH2CH3), n-butyl (-CH 2CH 2CH2CH3), n-pentyl (
CH 2 CH2CH2CH2CH3), n-hexyl (-CH 2CH 2CH2CH2CH2CH3), etc.; C3-10 branched alkyl, such as C3H7 (e.g. iso
propyl), C4H (e.g. branched butyl isomers), C5H11 (e.g. branched pentyl isomers), C6H13 (e.g. branched
 hexyl isomers), C7H15 (e.g. heptyl isomers), etc.; C3-10 cycloalkyl, such as C3H5 (e.g. cyclopropyl), C4Hz
 (e.g. cyclobutyl isomers such as cyclobutyl, methylcyclopropyl, etc.), C5 H9 (e.g. cyclopentyl isomers such
as cyclopentyl, methylcyclobutyl, dimethylcyclopropyl, etc.) C6Hii (e.g. cyclohexyl isomers), C7H13 (e.g.
 cycloheptyl isomers), etc.; and the like.
 [050]    In an embodiment, a therapeutic compound disclosed herein is a pharmaceutically-acceptable fatty
 acid. A fatty acid comprises a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched hydrocarbon chain which may be
 either saturated or unsaturated. This arrangement confers a fatty acid with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a
 nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water.         Most naturally occurring fatty acids have a
 hydrocarbon chain of an even number of carbon atoms, typically between 4 and 24 carbons, and may be
 attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. Synthetic or non-natural
 fatty acids may have a hydrocarbon chain of any number of carbon atoms from between 3 and 40 carbons.
 Where a double bond exists, there is the possibility of either a cis or a trans geometric isomerism, which
 significantly affects the molecule's molecular configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to
 bend, an effect that is more pronounced the more double bonds there are in a chain. Most naturally
 occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and
 partially hydrogenated fats and oils. Examples of fatty acids include, without limitation, Capryllic acid,
 pelargonic acid, Capric acid, Undecylic acid, Lauric acid, Tridecylic acid, Myristic acid, Myristoleic acid,

(DHT) by reducing the A4,5 double-bond. In benign prostatic hyperplasia, dihydrotestosterone acts as a
potent cellular androgen and promotes prostate growth; therefore, inhibiting the enzyme reduces the
excessive prostate growth. In alopecia, male-pattern baldness is one of the effects of androgenic receptor
activation. Thus, reducing the levels of dihydrotestosterone reduces alopecia. These inhibitors decrease
the levels of available 5a-reductase prior to testosterone's binding with the enzyme, thus reducing levels of
dihydrotestosterone that derives from such a bond. A 5a reductase inhibitor include, without limitation,

[069]     A pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein may optionally include a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier that facilitates processing of an active ingredient into pharmaceutically-acceptable
compositions.      As used herein, the term "pharmacologically-acceptable carrier" is synonymous with
"pharmacological carrier" and means any carrier that has substantially no long term or permanent
detrimental effect when administered and encompasses terms such as "pharmacologically acceptable
vehicle, stabilizer, diluent, additive, auxiliary or excipient." Such a carrier generally is mixed with an active
compound or permitted to dilute or enclose the active compound and can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid
agent. It is understood that the active ingredients can be soluble or can be delivered as a suspension in
the desired carrier or diluent. Any of a variety of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be used
including, without limitation, aqueous media such as, e.g., water, saline, glycine, hyaluronic acid and the
like; solid carriers such as, e.g., mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum,
cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like; solvents; dispersion media; coatings;
antibacterial and antifungal agents; isotonic and absorption delaying agents; or any other inactive
ingredient. Selection of a pharmacologically acceptable carrier can depend on the mode of administration.
Except insofar as any pharmacologically acceptable carrier is incompatible with the active ingredient, its
use in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is contemplated. Non-limiting examples of specific uses
of such pharmaceutical carriers can be found in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems
(Howard C. Ansel et al., eds., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers, 7th ed. 1999); REMINGTON: THE
SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 20th

[0100] A composition or compound is administered to an individual. An individual is typically a human
being. Typically, any individual who is a candidate for a conventional treatment is a candidate for a disorder
associated with androgen production treatment disclosed herein.              Pre-operative evaluation typically
includes routine history and physical examination in addition to thorough informed consent disclosing all
relevant risks and benefits of the procedure.
[0101] A pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein may comprise a therapeutic compound in a
therapeutically effective amount.      As used herein, the term "effective amount" is synonymous with
"therapeutically effective amount", "effective dose", or "therapeutically effective dose" and when used in
reference to treating a disorder associated with androgen production refers to the minimum dose of a
therapeutic compound disclosed herein necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and includes a
dose sufficient to reduce a symptom associated with a disorder associated with androgen production. The
effectiveness of a therapeutic compound disclosed herein in treating a disorder associated with androgen
production can be determined by observing an improvement in an individual based upon one or more

clinical symptoms, and/or physiological indicators associated with the disorder associated with androgen
production. An improvement in a disorder associated with androgen production also can be indicated by a
reduced need for a concurrent therapy.
[0102] The appropriate effective amount of a therapeutic compound disclosed herein to be administered
to an individual for a particular disorder associated with androgen production can be determined by a person
of ordinary skill in the art by taking into account factors, including, without limitation, the type of the disorder
associated with androgen production, the location of the disorder associated with androgen production, the
cause of the disorder associated with androgen production, the severity of the disorder associated with
androgen production, the degree of relief desired, the duration of relief desired, the particular therapeutic
compound used, the rate of excretion of the therapeutic compound used, the pharmacodynamics of the
therapeutic compound used, the nature of the other compounds to be included in the composition, the
particular formulation desired, the particular route of administration, the particular characteristics, history
and risk factors of the patient, such as, e.g., age, weight, general health and the like, or any combination
thereof. Additionally, where repeated administration of a therapeutic compound is used, an effective
amount of a therapeutic compound will further depend upon factors, including, without limitation, the
frequency of administration, the half-life of the therapeutic compound, or any combination thereof. In is
known by a person of ordinary skill in the art that an effective amount of a therapeutic compound disclosed
herein can be extrapolated from in vitro assays and in vivo administration studies using animal models prior
to administration to humans.
[0103] Wide variations in the necessary effective amount are to be expected in view of the differing
efficiencies of the various routes of administration.        For instance, oral administration of a therapeutic
compound disclosed herein generally would be expected to require higher dosage levels than
administration by inhalation. Similarly, systemic administration of a therapeutic compound disclosed herein
would be expected to require higher dosage levels than a local administration. Variations in these dosage
levels can be adjusted using standard empirical routines of optimization, which are well-known to a person
of ordinary skill in the art. The precise therapeutically effective dosage levels and patterns are preferably
determined by the attending physician in consideration of the above-identified factors. One skilled in the
art will recognize that the condition of the individual can be monitored throughout the course of therapy and
that the effective amount of a therapeutic compound disclosed herein that is administered can be adjusted
accordingly.

[0123] The following non-limiting examples are provided for illustrative purposes only in order to facilitate
a more complete understanding of representative embodiments now contemplated. These examples
should not be construed to limit any of the embodiments described in the present specification, including
those pertaining to the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, or methods or uses of treating a disorder
disclosed herein.
                                                 Example 1
                                      HSD10 Enzyme Inhibition Assay
[0124] An HSD10 inhibition assay was performed to determine the effect of several anti-psychotics on
enzyme activity.
[0125] PC3 cells are from a cell line derived from a hormone refractory prostate cancer and are known to
overexpress HSD10. PC3 cells were seeded at a density of 4,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate, and
incubated at 37 0C, 5% CO2 for 48 hours in standard growth media (F12K nutrient media, 7% Fetal Calf
Serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 45 mg/L ascorbic acid). The media was then removed by pipette and replaced
with the appropriate drug treatment as follows: 50 pM Chlorpromazine (a typical anti-psychotic) in PC3
treatment media (F12K nutrient media, 125 pM fatty acid free BSA, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 45 mg/L ascorbic
acid); 50 pM Clozapine (an atypical anti-psychotic) in PC3 treatment media; 50 pM Clomipramine (a tricyclic
anti-depressant) in PC3 treatment media; 50 pM Risperidone (an atypical anti-psychotic) in PC3 treatment
media; 50 pM Diphenhydramine (a sedative) in PC3 treatment media. Cells line tests were carried out in
presence and absence of testosterone for comparison. After incubation in the drug treatment for 96 hours
at 370C, 5% C02, the supernatant was removed from all wells of cells, and cells washed with 200 pL PBS.
[0126] After removal of the PBS, cell number was determined using a lysed cell LDH assay (CytoTox 96
Non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (LDH Assay); Promega, Co., Madison WI). Cells were lysed with 0.9%
Triton-X in PBS for 2 hours at 370C, 5% C02 and 50 pL of this cell lysate was transferred to a fresh 96 well

     WO 2015/169971                                                                  PCT/EP2015/060388
                                                     54
plate. About 50 pL of CytoTox 96 assay reagent was added to the transferred cell lysate and this mixture
was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20 minutes. After the addition of 50 pL stop reagent,
the optical absorbance was determined for each incubated mixture at 492 nm. The percentage cell number
was calculated by normalizing the experimental counts, where 100% is set to cells receiving no drug
treatment, and 0% is set to readings from wells containing no cells. The mean and standard error was
calculated from at least 3 wells.
[0127] As seen in Table 1, Risperidone showed an inhibitory effect on both oxidative (88% inhibition) and
reductive (63% inhibition) performance of HSD10.        No other drug tested appeared to have effectively
inhibited both oxidative and reductive performance of HSD10.

[0128] A cell metabolism inhibition assay was performed to determine the effect of different fatty acids on
cellular metabolic rate. The fatty acids tested were a-Linolenic acid, omega 3 fatty acid (ALA), Arachidonic
acid, omega 6 fatty acid (AA), 9Z, 11E conjugated Linoleic acid, omega 7 fatty acid (CLA),
Docosahexaenoic acid, omega 3 fatty acid (DHA), Eicosapentaenoic acid, omega 3 fatty acid (EPA), Oleic
acid, omega 9 fatty acid (OA), Ricinoleic acid, omega 9 hydroxylated fatty acid (RA).
[0129] PC3 cells are from a cell line derived from a hormone refractory prostate cancer and are known to
overexpress HSD10. PC3 cells were seeded at a density of 4,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate, and
incubated at 370C, 5% C02 for 48 hours in standard growth media (F12K nutrient media, 7% Fetal Calf
Serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 45 mg/L ascorbic acid). The media was then removed by pipette and replaced
with the appropriate drug treatment as follows: 20 pM, or 40 pM, or 60 pM, or 80 pM, or 100 pM ALA in
 PC3 treatment media (F12K nutrient media, 125 uM fatty acid free BSA, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 45 mg/L
ascorbic acid); 20 pM, or 40 pM, or 60 pM, or 80 pM, or 100 pM AA in PC3 treatment media; 20 pM, or 40
 pM, or 60 pM, or 80 pM, or 100 pM CLA in PC3 treatment media; 20 pM, or 40 pM, or 60 pM, or 80 pM, or

or 40 pM, or 60 pM, or 80 pM, or 100 pM RA in PC3 treatment media. After incubation in the drug treatment
for 72 hours at 370C, 5% C02, 50 pL Cell titre Blue Assay Reagent was added to each well and the plate

return to incubation at 37oC, 5% C02, for a further 24 hours, at which time the absorbance at 620 nm was
recorded. The reduction of absorbance at 620 nm represents a higher metabolic rate, and the data below
has been normalized such that 100% represents cells that have been grown in the presence of undrugged
media, and 0% represents wells containing no cells.
[0130] As seen in Table 2, AA, CLA, DHA, and EPA showed a significant inhibitory effect on cellular
metabolic activity. AA showed about 35-40% metabolic inhibition in the 80-100 pM range. CLA showed at
least about 35-40% metabolic inhibition in the 60-100 pM range. DHA showed about 40-65% metabolic
inhibition in the 60-100 pM range. EPA showed about 50-65% metabolic inhibition in the 80-100 pM range.

                                      Cell Growth Inhibition Assay
[0131] To determine whether Risperidone could be effective in inhibiting growth of cancer cells
overexpressing HSD10, a lysed cell LDH assay was conducted using cells from a PC3 cell line.
[0132] PC3 cells are from a cell line derived from a hormone refractory prostate cancer and are known to
overexpress HSD10. PC3 cells were seeded at a density of 4,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate, and
incubated at 370C, 5% C02 for 48 hours in standard growth media (F12K nutrient media, 7% Fetal Calf
Serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 45 mg/L ascorbic acid). The media was then removed by pipette and replaced
with the appropriate drug treatment as follows: 12.5 pM, 25 pM, or 50 pM Risperidone in PC3 treatment
 media (F12K nutrient media, 125 uM fatty acid free BSA, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 45 mg/L ascorbic acid); 12.5
 pM, 25 pM, or 50 pM CLA in PC3 treatment media; 12.5 pM, 25 pM, or 50 pM DHA in PC3 treatment media;
 12.5 pM Risperidone and 12.5 pM CLA, DHA, or both CLA and DHA in PC3 treatment media; 25 pM
 Risperidone and 25 pM CLA, DHA, or both CLA and DHA in PC3 treatment media; and 50 pM Risperidone
and 50 pM CLA, DHA, or both CLA and DHA in PC3 treatment media. Cells line tests were carried out in
 presence and absence of testosterone for comparison. After incubation in the drug treatment for 96 hours
at 370C, 5% C02, the supernatant was removed from all wells of cells, and cells washed with 200 pL PBS.

     WO 2015/169971                                                                  PCT/EP2015/060388

[0133] After removal of the PBS, cell number was determined using a lysed cell LDH assay (CytoTox 96
Non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (LDH Assay); Promega, Co., Madison WI). Cells were lysed with 0.9%
Triton-X in PBS for 2 hours at 37*C, 5% CO2 and 50 pL of this cell lysate was transferred to a fresh 96 well
plate. About 50 pL of CytoTox 96 assay reagent was added to the transferred cell lysate and this mixture
was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20 minutes. After the addition of 50 pL stop reagent,
the optical absorbance was determined for each incubated mixture at 492 nm. The percentage cell number
was calculated by normalizing the experimental counts, where 100% is set to cells receiving no drug
treatment, and 0% is set to readings from wells containing no cells. The mean and standard error was
calculated from at least 3 wells.
[0134] The results show that 50 pM Risperidone exhibited about 50% growth inhibition of PC3 cells (Table
3). In addition, although having no effect alone, CLA in combination Risperidone had a synergistic effect,
inhibiting PC3 cell growth by over 60%.

[0135] To determine the optimal concentration of Risperidone and CLA necessary to inhibit cell growth, a
lysed cell LDH assay was conducted using various concentration of Risperidone and CLA. PC3 cells were
cultured and a lysed cell LDH assay was conducted as described above, except that the various drug
treatments evaluated contained either 0 pM, 12.5 pM, 25 pM, or 50 pM Risperidone in combination with 0
pM, 6.25 pM, 12.5 pM, 25 pM, 50 pM, or 100 pM CLA (see Table 3).
[0136] The data demonstrated that combination treatments comprising 50 pM Risperidone and either 50
or 100 pM CLA exhibited about 65% growth inhibition of PC3 cells (Table 4). In addition, 50 pM Risperidone
and 25 pM CLA or 25 pM Risperidone and 50 pM CLA both exhibited about 50% growth inhibition of PC3
cells (Table 4). These inhibitory effects were all synergistic in nature since treatment containing either 25
pM or 50 pM Risperidone alone only inhibited cell growth by about 20-30%.

[0137] To determine whether Risperidone could be effective in inhibiting growth of cancer cells
overexpressing HSD10, a lysed cell LDH assay was conducted using cells taken from a prostate cancer
cell line, a lung cancer cell line, a breast cancer cell line, an ovarian cancer cell line, each of which was
known to overexpress HSD10, and a non-cancerous cell line.
[0138] To determine whether Risperidone alone, or in combination with CLA could inhibit cell growth of
cells taken from a prostate cancer cell line overexpressing HSD10, a lysed cell LDH assay was conducted
on PC3 cells as described in Example 2, except that the various drug treatments evaluated contained: 50
pM Risperidone in PC3 treatment media; 50 pM CLA in PC3 treatment media; 50 pM Risperidone and 50
pM CLA in PC3 treatment media; 50 pM Risperidone and 1 pM Testosterone (T) in PC3 treatment media;
50 pM Risperidone, 50 pM CLA, and 1 pM Testosterone in PC3 treatment media.
[0139] To determine whether Risperidone alone, or in combination with CLA could inhibit cell growth of
cells taken from a lung cancer cell line overexpressing HSD10, A549 cells were seeded at a density of
2,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate, and incubated at 370C, 5% C02 for 48 hours in standard growth
media (DMEM nutrient media, 10% Fetal Calf Serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine). The media was then removed
by pipette and replaced with the appropriate drug treatment as follows: 50 pM Risperidone in A459
treatment media (DMEM nutrient media, 125 uM fatty acid free BSA, 2 mM L-Glutamine); 50 pM CLA in
A459 treatment media; 50 pM Risperidone and 50 pM CLA in A459 treatment media; 50 pM Risperidone
and 1 pM Testosterone in A459 treatment media; 50 pM Risperidone, 50 pM CLA, and 1 pM Testosterone

supernatant was removed from all wells of cells, and cells washed with 200 pL PBS.
[0140] To determine whether Risperidone alone, or in combination with CLA could inhibit cell growth of
cells taken from a breast cancer cell line overexpressing HSD10, MCF7 cells were seeded at a density of

incubation in the drug treatment for 96 hours at 370C, 5% C02, the supernatant was removed from all wells
of cells, and cells washed with 200 pL PBS.
[0141] To determine whether Risperidone alone, or in combination with CLA could inhibit cell growth of
cells taken from an ovarian cancer cell line overexpressing HSD10, OVCAR-3 cells were seeded at a
density of 8,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate, and incubated at 370C, 5% C02 for 48 hours in standard
growth media (RPMI-1640 nutrient media, 20% Fetal Calf Serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 0.01 mg/mL insulin,
4.5 g/L glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate). The media was then removed by pipette and
replaced with the appropriate drug treatment as follows: 50 pM Risperidone in OVCAR-3 treatment media
(RPMI-1640 nutrient media, 0.5% Fetal Calf Serum, 125 uM fatty acid free BSA, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 0.01

Testosterone in OVCAR-3 treatment media; 50 pM Risperidone, 50 pM CLA, and 1 pM Testosterone in
OVCAR-3 treatment media. After incubation in the drug treatment for 96 hours at 370C, 5% C02, the
supernatant was removed from all wells of cells, and cells washed with 200 pL PBS.
[0142] To determine whether Risperidone alone, or in combination with CLA could inhibit cell growth of
cells taken from a non-cancerous cell line, VERO cells, derived from kidney cells) were seeded at a density
of 2,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate, and incubated at 371C, 5% C02 for 48 hours in standard growth
media (EMEM nutrient media, 10% Fetal Calf Serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate). The
media was then removed by pipette and replaced with the appropriate drug treatment as follows: 50 pM
Risperidone in VERO treatment media (EMEM nutrient media, 125 uM fatty acid free BSA, 2 mM L
Glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate); 50 pM CLA in VERO treatment media; 50 pM Risperidone and 50 pM

drug treatment for 96 hours at 370C, 5% C02, the supernatant was removed from all wells of cells, and cells
washed with 200 pL PBS.
[0143] After removal of the PBS from the cell cultures described above, cell number was determined using
a lysed cell LDH assay. Cells were lysed with 0.9% Triton-X in PBS for 2 hours at 370C, 5% C02 and 50
pL of this cell lysate was transferred to a fresh 96 well plate. About 50 pL of CytoTox 96 assay reagent
was added to the transferred cell lysate and this mixture was incubated at room temperature in the dark for
20 minutes. After the addition of 50 pL stop reagent, the optical absorbance was determined for each
incubated mixture at 492 nm. The percentage cell number was calculated by normalizing the experimental

[0144] The results show that 50 pM Risperidone exhibited about 50% growth inhibition of PC3 cells, over
60% growth inhibition of A549 cells, about 65% growth inhibition of MCF7 cells, and about 35% growth
inhibition of OVCAR-3 cells (Table 3).       In addition, CLA in combination Risperidone demonstrated a
synergistic growth inhibition effect on most cancer cell lines tested.      Thus, 50 pM Risperidone in
combination with CLA exhibited over 60% growth inhibition of PC3 cells, almost 100% growth inhibition of
A549 cells, and over 70% growth inhibition of MCF7 cells (Table 3). Importantly, neither Risperidone nor
CLA had any measurable effect on growth on cell from the non-cancerous cell line VERO.
[0145] The results also show that the mechanism of action of Resperidone is related to Testosterone in
that adding an external source of Testosterone to Risperidone-treated cells partially negated the effect of
the Risperidone alone. However, in the presence of CLA, Testosterone failed to negate the effect of the
Risperidone. This suggests the CLA is acting on one Testosterone pathway and Risperidone on another
Testosterone pathway. None of the cells from the cell lines tested responded to a 1 pM Testosterone
treatment without drug present.

                                      Cell Growth Inhibition Assay
[0146] To determine whether Risperidone alone, or in combination with CLA could inhibit cell growth of
cells taken from a pancreatic cancer cell line overexpressing HSD1 0, a resazurin-based cell viability assay
was conducted on Bx-PC3 cells.
[0147] BxPC-3 cells are from a cell line derived from a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma and are known
to overexpress HSD10. BxPC-3 cells were seeded at a density of 4,000 cells per well in a 384 well plate,
and incubated at 370C, 5% C02 for 24 hours in standard growth media (RPMI nutrient media, 5% heat
inactivated Fetal Calf Serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine). The media was then removed by pipette and replaced
with 50 pL BxPC-3 treatment media comprising 125 pM fatty acid-free BSA, 2 mM L-Glutamine and one of
the following drug treatments: 0.1 pM, 2 pM, or 50 pM Risperidone; 0.1 pM, 2 pM, or 50 pM CLA; or 0.1

pM, 2 pM, or 50 pM of Risperidone and CLA (in equimolar amounts). After incubation in the drug treatment
for 72 hours at 37 0 C, 5% CO2, viable cell number was determined using a resazurin-based cell viability
assay (PRESTOBLUE*; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To each well, 7 pL of PRESTOBLUE* reagent was
added and the plates incubated for 60 minutes at 37 0C, 5% CO2. After incubation, the fluorescence intensity
of each well was determined using a microplate reader by excitation and 570 nm and recording emission
at 600 nm.       The percentage of viable cell number was calculated by normalizing the experimental
fluorescence intensity, where 100% is set to cells receiving no drug treatment (cells metabolizing at optimal
rate), and 0% is set to readings from cells treated with Paclitaxel (cells not metabolizing at all due to their
destruction by anti-cancer drug). A value under 50% could be considered a useful indication of potential
efficacy.

 [0148] The results show that Risperidone alone inhibited cancer cell growth, exhibited about 60% growth
 inhibition of Bx-PC3 cells at 50 pM (Table 6). Surprisingly, although having no effect cytostatic or cytotoxic
alone, CLA, in combination Risperidone, had a synergistic effect, with equimolar combinations inhibiting
 Bx-PC3 cell growth by about 50% at 2 uM and about 84% at 50 uM.

                              In vivo animal model studies on prostate cancer
 [0149] In vivo studies were performed to determine the effect of Risperidone in combination with Rumenic
 acid on orthotopic prostate tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model utilizing novel luciferase labelled
 BxPC-3 cells. Immunodeficeint male mice (athymic nude mice) were acclimated to the laboratory for at
 least one week prior to implantation of tumor. PC-3M-luc cells obtained directly from in vitro culture were
 then injected into the prostate on Day 0. Animals were divided into six groups of 12 mice each. Primary
 tumor size and metastases were assessed by bioluminescence measurements on day 6, 13, 20, 27, 34,
 and 40. On day 7 a five week treatment regime was initiated. Both individual drug and high and low dose
 combination were examined by administering the drugs twice daily on an individual body weight basis using
 a dose escalation protocol (Table 7). If tumors grew above a pre-determined level, or mice lost more than
 10% of bodyweight, they were culled. The primary tumor was excised, weighed and measured. Individual
 organs were imaged to assess metastatic burden.

 * combination doses were calculated according to the dosage of Risperidone; rumenic acid was added to
   an equimolar level.
[0150] One parameter of increased efficacy measured was animal survival in each group, both in terms of
overall survival at the end of the study as well as survival rate. Group 1 animals were dosed on a vehicle
and served as the negative control and exhibited an overall survivorship of 45% (Table 8). Group 6 animals
were dosed on Docetaxel and served as the positive control; this group showed 100% survival at day 40
(Table 8). Looking at the groups where only a single drug was administered, Group 2 (Risperidone) showed
an overall survivorship of 33% while Group 3 (Rumenic Acid) showed an overall survivorship of 45% (Table
8). These results indicate that administration of a single drug alone was ineffective in treating prostate
cancer. On the other hand, groups where a drug combination was administered revealed increased overall
survivorship of animals. Animals from Group 4 and 5 were dosed low and high Risperidone and Rumenic
Acid combinations. Group 4 animals showed an overall survivorship of 70% while Group 5 animals showed
an overall survivorship of 64% (Table 8). These results demonstrate a synergistic interaction between
Risperidone and Rumenic Acid as neither drug alone was effective, yet in combination these drugs
increased overall survival by at least 1.4-fold and as much as 2.1-fold. Thus, both the low and high dose
drug combinations exhibited increase efficacy by improving overall survivorship in the treated animals.

 * Tumor growth inhibition data is as calculated on Day 34, except for
   Group 5 which had sufficient mice alive to calculate on Day 40.
[0151] With regards to survival rate, a decline in the survival of Group 1 (Vehicle) animals was observed
by day 27 with an almost 20% animal loss and continued to drop steadily throughout the course of the study
(FIG. 2). Group 6 (Docetaxel) animals showed 100% survival throughout the course of the study (FIG. 2).
Similar to overall survivorship, animals belonging to the groups where only a single drug was administered
showed no real differences when compared to Group 1 animals (negative control).       For example, animals
from Group 2 (Risperidone) showed an onset delay of tumor lethality as a decrease in survivorship rate
was pushed back to day 34 with only about 10% animal loss. However, a rapid decrease of survive rate
was then observed resulting in only 33% animal survivorship by day 40 (FIG. 2). Similarly, animals from
Group 3 (Rumenic Acid) showed a decline in the survival rate by day 27. Although survival remained high
with only about 10% animal loss by day 34, there was a sharp decline in survival rates until only 45% of the
mice were alive by day 40 (FIG. 2). In contrast, both the onset of tumor lethality and the survival rate
improved in animals treated with the combination therapy. For example, a decline in survival rate was not
observed until day 34 with about 10% (Group 5) or 34% (Group 4) loss of animals (FIG. 2). By day 40,
70% of the animals in Group 4 were alive whereas 64% of the animals in Group 5 were also alive (FIG. 2).
These results demonstrate that both the low and high dose drug combinations showed increase efficacy by
increasing survival rates both in terms of delaying the onset of tumor lethality and well as improving the
survival rate in the treated animals.
[0152] Another parameter of increased efficacy measured was growth inhibition of the prostate tumor.
Group 1 (Vehicle) animals severing as the negative control showed no inhibition of tumor growth, whereas
Group 6 (Docetaxel) animals severing as the positive control showed a 94% inhibition of tumor growth
(Table 8). Animal groups treated with a single drug regime showed little effect on tumor growth inhibition.
Animals from Group 2 (Risperidone) showed only a 16% inhibition of tumor growth (Table 8). Similarly,
Group 3 (Rumenic Acid) animals showed only a 21% inhibition of tumor growth (Table 8). In contrast,
animal groups treated with both low and high dose drug combinations exhibited significant tumor growth
inhibition. For example, animals from Group 4 (Low Dose) showed 70% inhibition of tumor growth whereas
animals from Group 5 (High Dose) showed 65% inhibition of tumor growth (Table 8). Analysis of tumor
growth inhibition throughout the course of the study indicated that the rate of tumor growth inhibition was
consistent (FIG. 3). These results demonstrate that both the low and high dose drug combinations showed
increase efficacy by dramatically inhibiting tumor growth.
[0153] Lastly, the general health and overall condition of the animals in each group was assessed by
monitoring body weight throughout the study. Groups 1 (Vehicle) and Group 6 (Docetaxel) animals were

on a trend of losing weight by Day 40, whereas Group 4 animals gained weight and Groups 2, 3, 5 animals
maintained a constant weight. These results showed that both the low and high dose drug combinations
did not adversely affect the general health and overall condition of the animals.      In contrast, although
demonstrating efficacy, Docetaxel administration had adverse consequences on the general health and
overall condition of the animals.

                           In vivo animal model studies on pancreatic cancer
[0154] In vivo studies were performed to determine the effect of Risperidone in combination with Rumenic
acid on orthotopic pancreatic tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model utilizing novel luciferase labelled
BxPC-3 cells. Immunodeficeint male mice (athymic nude mice) were acclimated to the laboratory for at
least one week prior to implantation of tumor. BxPC-3 cells obtained directly from in vitro culture were then
injected into the pancreas on Day 0.      Animals were divided into four groups of 10 mice each which
underwent the following treatment regime: Group 1, daily oral administration of vehicle comprising 1% (v/v)
ethanol, 20% (v/v) PEG 400, 79% (v/v) acid solution and 0.4% (w/v) TWEEN'" 80 at a final pH of 3.1-3.3
(Control); Group 2, intraperitoneal administration of 60 mg/kg of Reference Compound gemcitabine every
third day for four rounds followed by one week rest before repeating the dosing; Group 3, daily oral
administration of 1 mg/kg of Test Compound VAL401; and Group 4, daily administration of 2 mg/kg Test
Compound VAL401. Administration of Test and Reference Compounds began on Day 1 and continued
until Day 33. Body weights of the animals were measured two times a week throughout the in-life phase
and blood samples for PK analyses were collected from saphenous vein from all animals 2 hours after
compound administration at study Day 24.          Primary tumor size and metastases were assessed by
bioluminescence measurements on Day 6, 13, 20, 27, and 34 using fluorescent imaging system.               The
animals were sacrificed at Day 34. At the termination, brain tissues were collected and frozen. Tumors were
weighed, measured in three dimensions followed by fixation and embedding in paraffin for possible
histopathological assessment. Also spleen, liver and lungs were collected for possible analysis.
[0155] Statistical analysis was performed with statistical software R (version 3.1.2). The parameters with
multiple measurements in different time points per animal were analyzed using mixed-effects models and
model contrasts. The models had fixed effects for treatment, time point, and their interaction. The obtained
p-values values were adjusted for multiple comparisons if necessary. The continuous valued end-point
parameters were analyzed using parametric or non-parametric test. If the groups were normally distributed
with equal variance, parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD post hoc test was used. If the
assumptions were not fulfilled as such or after data transform (e.g. logarithmic), nonparametric Kruskal
Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney U test was used.

[0156] The summary of the results obtained are provided in Table 9. With respect to Group 2, treatment
with gemcitabine did not have any effect on animal body weight gain compared to vehicle treatment (Table
9). Animals treated with Gemcitabine did exhibit a statistically significantly decreased pancreatic tumor
volume when compared to vehicle group (Table 9). Although not statistically different when compared to
vehicle group, Gemcitabine-treated animals also showed a trend in decreased pancreatic tumor weight as
well as in the bioluminescence imaging parameters (area, average radiation and total flux) on Day 34 (Table
9).
[0157] With respect to Group 3 and 4, treatment VAL401 at either dose did not have any effect on animal
body weight gain compared to vehicle treatment (Table 9). Animals treated with VAL401 did exhibited a
statistically significant decrease in pancreatic tumor volume in both studied doses and the same trend was
seen in pancreatic tumor weight when compared to vehicle group (Table 9). In addition, VAL401-treated
animals showed a statistically significant decrease in bioluminescence imaging parameter evaluating area
compared to vehicle group on Day 34 and the same trend was seen in in other bioluminescence imaging
parameters (average radiation and total flux) (Table 9).

                      In vivo animal model studies on non-small cell lung cancer
[0158] In vivo studies were performed to determine the effect of Risperidone in combination with Rumenic
acid on a subcutaneous non-small cell lung cancer tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. MF1 female
mice were acclimated to the laboratory for at least one week prior to implantation of tumor. H2228 cells
obtained directly from in vitro culture were then injected subcutaneously on Day 0. Animals were divided
into five groups of 15 mice each which underwent the following treatment regime: Group 1, daily oral
administration of vehicle; Group 2, daily oral administration of 50 mg/kg of Reference Compound Crizotinib;
Group 3, daily oral administration of 0.1 mg/kg of Test Compound VAL401; and Group 4, daily
administration of 0.5 mg/kg Test Compound VAL401; Group 5, daily oral administration of 2 mg/kg of Test
Compound VAL401. Administration of Test and Reference Compounds began on Day 22 and continued
until Day 64. Body weights of the animals were measured daily throughout the in-life phase and primary
tumor size measured with calipers in two dimensions three times a week with volumes calculated using the
formula 0.5(L x W x W). The animals were sacrificed at Day 65. At the termination, tumors were weighed,
measured in three dimensions.
[0159] No significant differences were observed in bodyweight during the experiment. No adverse events
were recorded, and no mice were terminated early. Data was assessed such that the treatment groups
were pooled and treated mice were observed to be split into 'responder' and 'non-responder' categories.
40% of treated mice responded, and the tumour growth for the groups is seen below in Table 10. The
tumour growth of the treatment non-responders is seen to be comparable to the untreated animals,
validating the 'non-response' criteria (Table 10). Responders are seen to have significantly lower tumour
growth than untreated animals (Table 10).

[0167] In closing, it is to be understood that although aspects of the present specification are highlighted
by referring to specific embodiments, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that these disclosed
embodiments are only illustrative of the principles of the subject matter disclosed herein. Therefore, it
should be understood that the disclosed subject matter is in no way limited to a particular methodology,
 protocol, and/or reagent, etc., described herein. As such, various modifications or changes to or alternative
configurations of the disclosed subject matter can be made in accordance with the teachings herein without
departing from the spirit of the present specification. Lastly, the terminology used herein is for the purpose

       WO 2015/169971                                                                 PCT/EP2015/060388

of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention,
which is defined solely by the claims. Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to that precisely as
shown and described.
[0168] Certain embodiments of the present invention are described herein, including the best mode known
to the inventors for carrying out the invention. Of course, variations on these described embodiments will
become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the foregoing description. The inventor
expects skilled artisans to employ such variations as appropriate, and the inventors intend for the present
invention to be practiced otherwise than specifically described herein. Accordingly, this invention includes
all modifications and equivalents of the subject matter recited in the claims appended hereto as permitted
by applicable law.       Moreover, any combination of the above-described embodiments in all possible
variations thereof is encompassed by the invention unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly
contradicted by context.
[0169] Groupings of alternative embodiments, elements, or steps of the present invention are not to be
construed as limitations.      Each group member may be referred to and claimed individually or in any
combination with other group members disclosed herein. It is anticipated that one or more members of a
group may be included in, or deleted from, a group for reasons of convenience and/or patentability. When
any such inclusion or deletion occurs, the specification is deemed to contain the group as modified thus
fulfilling the written description of all Markush groups used in the appended claims.
[0170] Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing a characteristic, item, quantity, parameter,
property, term, and so forth used in the present specification and claims are to be understood as being
modified in all instances by the term "about." As used herein, the term "about" means that the characteristic,
item, quantity, parameter, property, or term so qualified encompasses a range of plus or minus ten percent
above and below the value of the stated characteristic, item, quantity, parameter, property, or term.
Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the specification and
attached claims are approximations that may vary. For instance, as mass spectrometry instruments can
vary slightly in determining the mass of a given analyte, the term "about" in the context of the mass of an
ion or the mass/charge ratio of an ion refers to +/-0.50 atomic mass unit.
[0171] At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the
scope of the claims, each numerical indication should at least be construed in light of the number of reported
significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.
[0172] Use of the terms "may" or "can" in reference to an embodiment or aspect of an embodiment also
carries with it the alternative meaning of "may not" or "cannot." As such, if the present specification
discloses that an embodiment or an aspect of an embodiment may be or can be included as part of the
inventive subject matter, then the negative limitation or exclusionary proviso is also explicitly meant,

     WO 2015/169971                                                                     PCT/EP2015/060388
                                                         70
meaning that an embodiment or an aspect of an embodiment may not be or cannot be included as part of
the inventive subject matter. In a similar manner, use of the term "optionally" in reference to an embodiment
or aspect of an embodiment means that such embodiment or aspect of the embodiment may be included
as part of the inventive subject matter or may not be included as part of the inventive subject matter.
Whether such a negative limitation or exclusionary proviso applies will be based on whether the negative
limitation or exclusionary proviso is recited in the claimed subject matter.
[0173] Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and values setting forth the broad scope of the invention
are approximations, the numerical ranges and values set forth in the specific examples are reported as
precisely as possible. Any numerical range or value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily
resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. Recitation of
numerical ranges of values herein is merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring
individually to each separate numerical value falling within the range. Unless otherwise indicated herein,
each individual value of a numerical range is incorporated into the present specification as if it were
individually recited herein.
[0174] The terms "a," "an," "the" and similar referents used in the context of describing the present
invention (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular
and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context. All methods described
herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly
contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (e.g., "such as") provided
herein is intended merely to better illuminate the present invention and does not pose a limitation on the
scope of the invention otherwise claimed. No language in the present specification should be construed as
indicating any non-claimed element essential to the practice of the invention.
[0175] Specific embodiments disclosed herein may be further limited in the claims using consisting of or
consisting essentially of language. When used in the claims, whether as filed or added per amendment,
the transition term "consisting of" excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified in the claims. The
transition term "consisting essentially of" limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or steps and
those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s). Embodiments of the present
invention so claimed are inherently or expressly described and enabled herein.
[0176] All patents, patent publications, and other publications referenced and identified in the present
specification are individually and expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for the purpose
of describing and disclosing, for example, the compositions and methodologies described in such
publications that might be used in connection with the present invention. These publications are provided
solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing in this regard should be
construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior
 invention or for any other reason. All statements as to the date or representation as to the contents of these
