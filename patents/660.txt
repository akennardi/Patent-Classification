                                   Field of the Invention
             [0002]     The invention generally relates to wrapping loads with
packaging material through relative rotation of loads and a packaging material
dispenser, and in particular, to the control of the rate in which packaging material is
dispensed during wrapping.
                               Background of the Invention
             [0003]     Various packaging techniques have been used to build a load of
unit products and subsequently wrap them for transportation, storage, containment
and stabilization, protection and waterproofing. One system uses wrapping machines
to stretch, dispense, and wrap packaging material around a load. The packaging
material may be pre-stretched before it is applied to the load. Wrapping can be
performed as an inline, automated packaging technique that dispenses and wraps
packaging material in a stretch condition around a load on a pallet to cover and
contain the load. Stretch wrapping, whether accomplished by a turntable, rotating
arm, vertical rotating ring, or horizontal rotating ring, typically covers the four vertical
sides of the load with a stretchable packaging material such as polyethylene
packaging material. In each of these arrangements, relative rotation is provided
between the load and the packaging material dispenser to wrap packaging material
about the sides of the load.
                                              1

            [0004]    A primary metric used in the shipping industry for gauging
overall wrapping effectiveness is containment force, which is generally the
cumulative force exerted on the load by the packaging material wrapped around the
load. Containment force depends on a number of factors, including the number of
layers of packaging material, the thickness, strength and other properties of the
packaging material, the amount of pre-stretch applied to the packaging material, and
the wrap force applied to the load while wrapping the load. The wrap force,
however, is a force that fluctuates as packaging material is dispensed to the load
due primarily to the irregular geometry of the load.
            [0005]    In particular, wrappers have historically suffered from packaging
material breaks and limitations on the amount of wrap force applied to the load (as
determined in part by the amount of pre-stretch used) due to erratic speed changes
required to wrap loads. Were all loads perfectly cylindrical in shape and centered
precisely at the center of rotation for the relative rotation, the rate at which packaging
material would need to be dispensed would be constant throughout the rotation.
Typical loads, however, are generally box-shaped, and have a square or rectangular
cross-section in the plane of rotation, such that even in the case of square loads, the
rate at which packaging material is dispensed varies throughout the rotation. In
some instances, loosely wrapped loads result due to the supply of excess packaging
material during portions of the wrapping cycle where the demand rate for packaging
material by the load is exceeded by the rate at which the packaging material is
supplied by the packaging material dispenser. In other instances, when the demand
rate for packaging material by the load is greater than the supply rate of the
packaging material by the packaging material dispenser, breakage of the packaging
material may occur.
            [0006]    When wrapping a typical rectangular load, the demand for
packaging material typically decreases as the packaging material approaches
contact with a corner of the load and increases after contact with the corner of the
load. When wrapping a tall, narrow load or a short load, the variation in the demand
rate is typically even greater than in a typical rectangular load. In vertical rotating
rings, high speed rotating arms, and turntable apparatuses, the variation is caused
by a difference between the length and the width of the load, while in a horizontal
                                              2

rotating ring apparatus, the variation is caused by a difference between the height of
the load (distance above the conveyor) and the width of the load. Variations in
demand may make it difficult to properly wrap the load, and the problem with
variations may be exacerbated when wrapping a load having one or more
dimensions that may differ from one or more corresponding dimensions of a
preceding load. The problem may also be exacerbated when wrapping a load having
one or more dimensions that vary at one or more locations of the load itself.
Furthermore, whenever a load is not centered precisely at the center of rotation of
the relative rotation, the variation in the demand rate is also typically greater, as the
corners and sides of even a perfectly symmetric load will be different distances away
from the packaging material dispenser as they rotate past the dispenser.
            [0007]     The amount of force, or pull, that the packaging material exhibits
on the load determines in part how tightly and securely the load is wrapped.
Conventionally, this wrap force is controlled by controlling the feed or supply rate of
the packaging material dispensed by the packaging material dispenser. For example,
the wrap force of many conventional stretch wrapping machines is controlled by
attempting to alter the supply of packaging material such that a relatively constant
packaging material wrap force is maintained. With powered pre-stretching devices,
changes in the force or tension of the dispensed packaging material are monitored,
e.g., by using feedback mechanisms typically linked to spring loaded dancer bars,
electronic load cells, or torque control devices. The changing force or tension of the
packaging material caused by rotating a rectangular shaped load is transmitted back
through the packaging material to some type of sensing device, which attempts to
vary the speed of the motor driven dispenser to minimize the change. The passage
of the corner causes the force or tension of the packaging material to increase, and
the increase is typically transmitted back to an electronic load cell, spring-loaded
dancer interconnected with a sensor, or to a torque control device. As the corner
approaches, the force or tension of the packaging material decreases, and the
reduction is transmitted back to some device that in turn reduces the packaging
material supply to attempt to maintain a relatively constant wrap force or tension.
            [0008]     With the ever faster wrapping rates demanded by the industry,
however, rotation speeds have increased significantly to a point where the concept
                                              3

of sensing changes in force and altering supply speed in response often loses
effectiveness. The delay of response has been observed to begin to move out of
phase with rotation at approximately 20 RPM. Given that a packaging dispenser is
required to shift between accelerating and decelerating eight times per revolution in
order to accommodate the four corners of the load, at 20 RPM the shift between
acceleration and deceleration occurs at a rate of more than every once every half of
a second. Given also that the rotating mass of a packaging material roll and rollers
in a packaging material dispenser may be 100 pounds or more, maintaining an ideal
dispense rate throughout the relative rotation can be a challenge.
            [0009]    Also significant is the need in many applications to minimize
acceleration and deceleration times for faster cycles. Initial acceleration must pull
against clamped packaging material, which typically cannot stand a high force,and
especially the high force of rapid acceleration, which typically cannot be maintained
by the feedback mechanisms described above. As a result of these challenges, the
use of high speed wrapping has often been limited to relatively lower wrap forces
and pre-stretch levels where the loss of control at high speeds does not produce
undesirable packaging material breaks.
            [0010]     In addition, due to environmental, cost and weight concerns, an
ongoing desire exists to reduce the amount of packaging material used to wrap
loads, typically through the use of thinner, and thus relatively weaker packaging
materials and/or through the application of fewer layers of packaging material. As
such, maintaining adequate containment forces in the presence of such concerns,
particularly in high speed applications, can be a challenge.
            [0011]    Therefore, a significant need continues to exist in the art for an
improved manner of controlling the rate at which packaging material is dispensed
during wrapping of a load, particularly to provide greater wrap force, and ultimately
greater containment force to the load.
                                Summary of the Invention
            [0012]    The invention addresses these and other problems associated
with the prior art by providing in one aspect a corner geometry-based wrap control
that controls the rate at which packaging material is dispensed at least in part based
                                              4

on the geometrical relationship between one or more corners of the load and a
packaging material dispenser. In some embodiments of the invention, for example,
the spatial locations of one or more corners on a loadmay be determined from the
dimensions of the load (e.g., the length and width) as well as any offset of the load
from a center of rotation, and when combined with a sensed or calculated rotational
position of the load relative to a packaging material dispenser, may be utilized to
control the dispense rate of the packaging material dispenser.
            [0013]    In some embodiments, the determined locations of one or more
corners may be used to determine when the packaging material has contacted a
corner of the load during relative rotation. During relative rotation, a web of
packaging material will typically extend along a line defined from an exit point of the
packaging material dispenser to a point of engagement with the load, which is
typically at or proximate to a corner of the load. Further rotation of the load results in
a next corner eventually intersecting this line and engaging with the packaging
material dispenser, at which point the next corner becomes the new point of
engagement for the packaging material. In such embodiments, a wrap speed model
may be used to control the dispense rate of the packaging material dispenser based
upon what corner is currently acting as the point of engagement with the packaging
material, and a corner rotation angle may be used to control the wrap speed model
to determine when a next corner should begin to effectively drive the wrap speed
model.
            [0014]    Therefore, consistent with one aspect of the invention, an
apparatus for wrapping a load with packaging material may include a packaging
material dispenser for dispensing packaging material to the load, a load support for
supporting the load during wrapping, where the packaging material dispenser and
the load support are adapted for rotation relative to one other about a center of
rotation, and a controller configured to control a dispense rate of the packaging
material dispenser during the relative rotation based at least in part on a geometric
relationship between the packaging material dispenser and at least one corner of the
load during the relative rotation.
            [0015]    Consistent with another aspect of the invention, a load may be
wrapped with packaging material by providing relative rotation between a load
                                             5

support and a packaging material dispenser about a center of rotation to dispense
packaging material to the load, controlling a dispense rate of the packaging material
dispenser based at least in part on a geometric relationship between the packaging
material dispenser and a current corner of the load to which the packaging material
is currently engaging during the relative rotation, determining when the packaging
material will engage a next corner of the load, andcontrolling the dispense rate
based at least in part on a geometric relationship between the packaging material
dispenser and the next corner of the load after the packaging material engages the
next corner of the load.

the invention, are set forth in the claims annexed hereto and forming a further part
hereof. However, for a better understanding of the invention, and of the advantages
and objectives attained through its use, reference should be made to the Drawings,

                           WrappingApparatus Configurations
            [0042]    Fig. 1, for example, illustrates arotating arm-type wrapping
apparatus 100, which includes a roll carriage 102 mounted on a rotating arm 104.
Roll carriage 102 may include a packaging material dispenser 106. Packaging
material dispenser 106 may be configured to dispense packaging material 108 as
rotating arm 104 rotates relative to a load 110 to be wrapped. In an exemplary
embodiment, packaging material dispenser 106 may be configured to dispense
stretch wrap packaging material. As used herein, stretch wrap packaging material is
defined as material having a high yield coefficient to allow the material a large
amount of stretch during wrapping. However, it is possible that the apparatuses and
methods disclosed herein may be practiced with packaging material that will not be
pre-stretched prior to application to the load. Examples of such packaging material
include netting, strapping, banding, tape, etc. The invention is therefore not limited
to use with stretch wrap packaging material.
                                              9

            [0043]     Packaging material dispenser 106 may include a pre-stretch
assembly 112 configured to pre-stretch packaging material before it is applied to
load 110 if pre-stretching is desired, or to dispense packaging material to load 110
without pre-stretching. Pre-stretch assembly 112 may include at least one packaging
material dispensing roller, including, for example, an upstream dispensing roller 114
and a downstream dispensing roller 116. It is contemplated that pre-stretch
assembly 112 may include various configurations and numbers of pre-stretch rollers,
drive or driven roller and idle rollers without departing from the spirit and scope of the
invention.
            [0044]     The terms "upstream" and "downstream," as used in this
application, are intended to define positions and movement relative to the direction of
flow of packaging material 108 as it moves from packaging material dispenser 106 to
load 110. Movement of an object toward packaging material dispenser 106, away
from load 110, and thus, against the direction of flow of packaging material 108, may
be defined as "upstream." Similarly, movement of an object away from packaging
material dispenser 106, toward load 110, and thus, with the flow of packaging
material 108, may be defined as "downstream." Also, positions relative to load 110
(or a load support surface 118) and packaging material dispenser 106 may be
described relative to the direction of packaging material flow. For example, when two
pre-stretch rollers are present, the pre-stretch roller closer to packaging material
dispenser 106 may be characterized as the "upstream" roller and the pre-stretch
roller closer to load 110 (or load support 118) and further from packaging material
dispenser 106 may be characterized as the "downstream" roller.
            [0045]     A packaging material drive system 120, including, for example,
an electric motor 122, may be used to drive dispensing rollers 114 and 116. For
example, electric motor 122 may rotate downstream dispensing roller 116.
Downstream dispensing roller 116 may be operatively coupled to upstream
dispensing roller 114 by a chain and sprocket assembly, such that upstream
dispensing roller 114 may be driven in rotation by downstream dispensing roller 116.
Other connections may be used to drive upstream roller 114 or, alternatively, a
separate drive (not shown) may be provided to drive upstream roller 114.
                                             10

            [0046]     Downstream of downstream dispensing roller 116 may be
provided one or more idle rollers 124, 126that redirect the web of packaging
material, with the most downstream idle roller 126 effectively providing an exit point
128 from packaging material dispenser 102, such that a portion 130 of packaging
material 108 extends between exit point 128 and a contact point 132 where the
packaging material engages load 110 (or alternatively contact point 132' if load 110
is rotated in a counter-clockwise direction).
            [0047]    Wrapping apparatus 100 also includes a relative rotation
assembly 134 configured to rotate rotating arm 104, and thus, packaging material
dispenser 106 mounted thereon, relative to load 110 as load 110 is supported on
load support surface 118. Relative rotation assembly 134 may include a rotational
drive system 136, including, for example, an electric motor 138. It is contemplated
that rotational drive system 136 and packaging material drive system 120 may run
independently of one another. Thus, rotation of dispensing rollers 114 and 116 may
be independent of the relative rotation of packaging material dispenser 106 relative
to load 110. This independence allows a length of packaging material 108 to be
dispensed per a portion of relative revolution that is neither predetermined or
constant. Rather, the length may be adjusted periodically or continuously based on
changing conditions.
            [0048]    Wrapping apparatus 100 may further include a lift assembly 140.
Lift assembly 140 may be powered by a lift drive system 142, including, for example,
an electric motor 144, that may be configured to move roll carriage 102 vertically
relative to load 110. Lift drive system 142 may drive roll carriage 102, and thus
packaging material dispenser 106, upwards and downwards vertically on rotating
arm 104 while roll carriage 102 and packaging material dispenser 106 are rotated
about load 110 by rotational drive system 136, to wrap packaging material spirally
about load 110.
            [0049]    One or more of downstream dispensing roller 116, idle roller 124
and idle roller 126 may include a corresponding sensor 146, 148, 150 to monitor
rotation of the respective roller. In particular, rollers 116, 124 and/or 126, and/or
packaging material 108 dispensed thereby, may be used to monitor a dispense rate
of packaging material dispenser 106, e.g., by monitoring the rotational speed of
                                             11

rollers 116, 124 and/or 126, the number of rotations undergone by such rollers, the
amount and/or speed of packaging material dispensed by such rollers, and/or one or
more performance parameters indicative of the operating state of packaging material
drive system 120, including, for example, a speed of packaging material drive
system 120. The monitored characteristics may also provide an indication of the
amount of packaging material 108 being dispensed and wrapped onto load 110. In
addition, in some embodiments a sensor, e.g., sensor 148 or 150, may be used to
detect a break in the packaging material.
            [0050]     Wrapping apparatus also includes an angle sensor 152 for
determining an angular relationship between load 110 and packaging material
dispenser 106 about a center of rotation 154. Angle sensor 152 may be
implemented, for example, as a rotary encoder, or alternatively, using any number of
alternate sensors or sensor arrays capable of providing an indication of the angular
relationship and distinguishing from among multiple angles throughout the relative
rotation, e.g., an array of proximity switches, optical encoders, magnetic encoders,
electrical sensors, mechanical sensors, photodetectors, motion sensors, etc. The
angular relationship may be represented in some embodiments in terms of degrees
or fractions of degrees, while in other embodiments a lower resolution may be
adequate. It will also be appreciated that an angle sensor consistent with the
invention may also be disposed in other locations on wrapping apparatus 100, e.g.,
about the periphery or mounted on arm 104 or roll carriage 102. In addition, in some
embodiments angular relationship may be represented and/or measured in units of
time, based upon a known rotational speed of the load relative to the packaging
material dispenser, from which a time to complete a full revolution may be derived
such that segments of the revolution time would correspond to particular angular
relationships.
            [0051]     Additional sensors, such as a load distance sensor 156 and/or a
film angle sensor 158, may also be provided on wrapping apparatus 100. Load
distance sensor 156 may be used to measure a distance from a reference point to a
surface of load 110 as the load rotates relative to packaging material dispenser 106
and thereby determine a cross-sectional dimension of the load at a predetermined
angular position relative to the packaging material dispenser. In one embodiment,
                                            12

load distance sensor 156 measures distance along a radial from center of rotation
154, and based on the known, fixed distance between the sensor and the center of
rotation, the dimension of the load may be determined by subtracting the sensed
distance from this fixed distance. Sensor 156 may be implemented using various
types of distance sensors, e.g., a photoeye, proximity detector, laser distance
measurer, ultrasonic distance measurer, electronic rangefinder, and/or any other
suitable distance measuring device. Exemplary distance measuring devices may
include, for example, an IFM Effector 01D100 and a Sick UM30-213118 (6036923).
            [0052]    Film angle sensor 158 may be used to determine a film angle for
portion 130 of packaging material 108, which may be relative, for example, to a
radial (not shown in Fig. 1) extending from center of rotation154 to exit point 128
(although other reference lines may be used in the alternative).
            [0053]    In one embodiment, film angle sensor 158 may be implemented
using a distance sensor, e.g., a photoeye, proximity detector, laser distance
measurer, ultrasonic distance measurer, electronic rangefinder, and/or any other
suitable distance measuring device. In one embodiment, an IFM Effector 01D100
and a Sick UM30-213118 (6036923) may be used for film angle sensor 158.          In
other embodiments, film angle sensor 158 may be implemented mechanically, e.g.,
using a cantilevered or rockered follower arm having a free end that rides along the
surface of portion 130 of packaging material 108 such that movement of the follower
arm tracks movement of the packaging material. In still other embodiments, a film
angle sensor may be implemented by a force sensor that senses force changes
resulting from movement of portion 130 through a range of film angles, or a sensor
array (e.g., an image sensor) that is positioned above or below the plane of portion
130 to sense an edge of the packaging material. Additional details regarding these
alternate film angle sensor implementations are discussed in greater detail below in
connection with Figs. 7, 8 and 9A-9B.
            [0054]    Wrapping apparatus 100 may also include additional
components used in connection with other aspects of a wrapping operation. For
example, a clamping device 159 may be used to grip the leading end of packaging
material 108 between cycles. In addition, a conveyor (not shown) may be used to
convey loads to and from wrapping apparatus 100. Other components commonly
                                            13

used on a wrapping apparatus will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art
having the benefit of the instant disclosure.
             [0055]   An exemplary schematic of a control system 160 for wrapping
apparatus 100 is shown in Fig. 2. Motor 122 of packaging material drive system
120, motor 138 of rotational drive system 136, and motor 144 of lift drive system 142
may communicate through one or more data links 162 with a rotational drive variable
frequency drive ("VFD") 164, a packaging material drive VFD 166, and a lift drive
VFD 168, respectively. Rotational drive VFD 164, packaging material drive VFD 166,
and lift drive VFD 168 may communicate with controller 170 through a data link 172.
It should be understood that rotational drive VFD 164, packaging material drive VFD
166, and lift drive VFD 168 may produce outputs to controller 170 that controller 170
may use as indicators of rotational movement. For example, packaging material
drive VFD 166 may provide controller 170 with signals similar to signals provided by
sensor 146, and thus, sensor 146 may be omitted to cut down on manufacturing
costs.
             [0056]   Controller 170 may include hardware components and/or
software program code that allow it to receive, process, and transmit data. It is
contemplated that controller 170 may be implemented as a programmable logic
controller (PLC), or may otherwise operate similar to a processor in a computer
system. Controller 170 may communicate with an operator interface 174 via a data
link 176. Operator interface 174 may include a screen and controls that provide an
operator with a way to monitor, program, and operate wrapping apparatus 100. For
example, an operator may use operator interface 174 to enter or change
predetermined and/or desired settings and values, or to start, stop, or pause the
wrapping cycle. Controller 170 may also communicate with one or more sensors,
e.g., sensors 146, 148, 150, 152, 154 and 156, as well as others not illustrated in
Fig.2, through a data link 178, thus allowing controller 170 to receive performance
related data during wrapping. It is contemplated that data links 162, 172, 176, and
178 may include any suitable wired and/or wireless communications media known in
the art.
             [0057]   As noted above, sensors 146, 148, 150, 152 may be configured
in a number of manners consistent with the invention. In one embodiment, for
                                            14

example, sensor 146 may be configured to sense rotation of downstream dispensing
roller 116, and may include one or more magnetic transducers 180 mounted on
downstream dispensing roller 116, and a sensing device 182 configured to generate
a pulse when the one or more magnetic transducers 180 are brought into proximity
of sensing device 182. Alternatively, sensor assembly 146 may include an encoder
configured to monitor rotational movement, and capable of producing, for example,
360 or 720 signals per revolution of downstream dispensing roller 116 to provide an
indication of the speed or other characteristic of rotation of downstream dispensing
roller 116. The encoder may be mounted on a shaft of downstream dispensing roller
116, on electric motor 122, and/or any other suitable area. One example of a sensor
assembly that may be used is anEncoder Products Company model 15H optical
encoder. Other suitable sensors and/or encoders may be used for monitoring, such
as, for example, optical encoders, magnetic encoders, electrical sensors, mechanical
sensors, photodetectors, and/or motion sensors.
            [0058]    Likewise, for sensors 148 and 150, magnetic transducers 184,
186 and sensing devices 188, 190 may be used to monitor rotational movement,
while for sensor 152, a rotary encoder may be used to determine the angular
relationship between the load and packaging material dispenser. Any of the
aforementioned alternative sensor configurations may be used for any of sensors
146, 148, 150, 152, 154 and 156 in other embodiments, and as noted above, one or
more of such sensors may be omitted in some embodiments. Additional sensors
capable of monitoring other aspects of the wrapping operation may also be coupled
to controller 170 in other embodiments.
            [0059]    For the purposes of the invention, controller 170 may represent
practically any type of computer, computer system, controller, logic controller, or
other programmable electronic device, and may in some embodiments be
implemented using one or more networked computers or other electronic devices,
whether located locally or remotely with respect to wrapping apparatus 100.
Controller 170 typically includes a central processing unit including at least one
microprocessor coupled to a memory, which may represent the random access
memory (RAM) devices comprising the main storage of controller 170, as well as any
supplemental levels of memory, e.g., cache memories, non-volatile or backup
                                           15

memories (e.g., programmable or flash memories), read-only memories, etc. In
addition, the memory may be considered to include memory storage physically
located elsewhere in controller 170, e.g., any cache memory in a processor in CPU
52, as well as any storage capacity used as a virtual memory, e.g., as stored on a
mass storage device or on another computer or electronic device coupled to
controller 170. Controller 170 may also include one or more mass storage devices,
e.g., a floppy or other removable disk drive, a hard disk drive, a direct access
storage device (DASD), an optical drive (e.g., a CD drive, a DVD drive, etc.), and/or
a tape drive, among others. Furthermore, controller 170 may include an interface
with one or more networks (e.g., a LAN, a WAN, a wireless network, and/or the
Internet, among others) to permit the communication of information to the
components in wrapping apparatus 100 as well as with other computers and
electronic devices. Controller 170 operates under the control of an operating
system, kernel and/or firmware and executes or otherwise relies upon various
computer software applications, components, programs, objects, modules, data
structures, etc. Moreover, various applications, components, programs, objects,
modules, etc. may also execute on one or more processors in another computer
coupled to controller 170, e.g., in a distributed or client-server computing
environment, whereby the processing required to implement the functions of a
computer program may be allocated to multiple computers over a network.
            [0060]    In general, the routines executed to implement the embodiments
of the invention, whether implemented as part of an operating system or a specific
application, component, program, object, module or sequence of instructions, or
even a subset thereof, will be referred to herein as "computer program code," or
simply "program code." Program code typically comprises one or more instructions
that are resident at various times in various memory and storage devices in a
computer, and that, when read and executed by one or more processors in a
computer, cause that computer to perform the steps necessary to execute steps or
elements embodying the various aspects of the invention. Moreover, while the
invention has and hereinafter will be described in the context of fully functioning
controllers, computers and computer systems, those skilled in the art will appreciate
that the various embodiments of the invention are capable of being distributed as a
program product in a variety of forms, and that the invention applies equally
                                             16

regardless of the particular type of computer readable media used to actually carry
out the distribution.
            [0061]    Such computer readable media may include computer readable
storage media and communication media. Computer readable storage media is non
transitory in nature, and may include volatile and non-volatile, and removable and
non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of
information, such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program
modules or other data. Computer readable storage media may further include RAM,
ROM, erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable
programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), flash memory or other solid state
memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD), or other optical storage,
magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage
devices, or any other medium that can be used to store the desired information and
which can be accessed by controller 170. Communication media may embody
computer readable instructions, data structures or other program modules. By way
of example, and not limitation, communication media may include wired media such
as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic,
RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above may also
be included within the scope of computer readable media.
            [0062]    Various program code described hereinafter may be identified
based upon the application within which it is implemented in a specific embodiment
of the invention. However, it should be appreciated that any particular program
nomenclature that follows is used merely for convenience, and thus the invention
should not be limited to use solely in any specific application identified and/or implied
by such nomenclature. Furthermore, given the typically endless number of manners
in which computer programs may be organized into routines, procedures, methods,
modules, objects, and the like, as well as the various manners in which program
functionality may be allocated among various software layers that are resident within
a typical computer (e.g., operating systems, libraries, API's, applications, applets,
etc.), it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the specific
organization and allocation of program functionality described herein.

            [0063]    Now turning to Fig. 3, a rotating ring-type wrapping apparatus
200 is illustrated. Wrapping apparatus 200 may include elements similar to those
shown in relation to wrapping apparatus 100 of Fig. 1, including, for example, a roll
carriage 202 including a packaging material dispenser 206 configured to dispense
packaging material 208 during relative rotation between roll carriage 202 and a load
210 disposed on a load support 218. However, a rotating ring 204 is used in
wrapping apparatus 200 in place of rotating arm 104 of wrapping apparatus 100. In
many other respects, however, wrapping apparatus 200 may operate in a manner
similar to that described above with respect to wrapping apparatus 100.
            [0064]    Packaging material dispenser 206 may include a pre-stretch
assembly 212 including an upstream dispensing roller 214 and a downstream
dispensing roller 216, and a packaging material drive system 220, including, for
example, an electric motor 222, may be used to drive dispensing rollers 214 and
216.Downstream of downstream dispensing roller 216 may be provided one or more
idle rollers 224, 226, with the most downstream idle roller 226 effectively providing
an exit point 228 from packaging material dispenser 206, such that a portion 230 of
packaging material 208 extends between exit point 228 and a contact point 232
where the packaging material engages load 210.
            [0065]    Wrapping apparatus 200 also includes a relative rotation
assembly 234 configured to rotate rotating ring 204, and thus, packaging material
dispenser 206 mounted thereon, relative to load 210 as load 210 is supported on
load support surface 218. Relative rotation assembly 234 may include a rotational
drive system 236, including, for example, an electric motor 238. Wrapping apparatus
200 may further include a lift assembly 240, which may be powered by a lift drive
system 242, including, for example, an electric motor 244, that may be configured to
move rotating ring 204 and roll carriage 202 vertically relative to load 210.
            [0066]    In addition, similar to wrapping apparatus 100, wrapping
apparatus 200 may include sensors 246, 248, 250 on one or more of downstream
dispensing roller 216, idle roller 224 and idle roller 226. Furthermore, an angle
sensor 252 may be provided for determining an angular relationship between load
210 and packaging material dispenser 206 about a center of rotation 254, and in
some embodiments, one or both of a load distance sensor 256 and a film angle
                                              18

sensor 258 may also be provided. Sensor 252 may be positioned proximate center
of rotation 254, or alternatively, may be positioned at other locations, such as
proximate rotating ring 204. Wrapping apparatus 200 may also include additional
components used in connection with other aspects of a wrapping operation, e.g., a
clamping device 259 may be used to grip the leading end of packaging material 208
between cycles.
            [0067]     Fig. 4 likewise shows a turntable-type wrapping apparatus 300,
which may also include elements similar to those shown in relation to wrapping
apparatus 100 of Fig. 1. However, instead of a roll carriage 102 that rotates around
a fixed load 110 using a rotating arm 104, as in Fig. 1, wrapping apparatus 300
includes a rotating turntable 304 functioning as a load support 318 and configured to
rotate load 310 about a center of rotation 354 while a packaging material dispenser
306 disposed on a dispenser support 302 remains in a fixed location about center of
rotation 354 while dispensing packaging material 308. In many other respects,
however, wrapping apparatus 300 may operate in a manner similar to that described
above with respect to wrapping apparatus 100.
            [0068]     Packaging material dispenser 306 may include a pre-stretch
assembly 312 including an upstream dispensing roller 314 and a downstream
dispensing roller 316, and a packaging material drive system 320, including, for
example, an electric motor 322, may be used to drive dispensing rollers 314 and
316, and downstream of downstream dispensing roller 316 may be provided one or
more idle rollers 324, 326, with the most downstream idle roller 326 effectively
providing an exit point 328 from packaging material dispenser 306, such that a
portion 330 of packaging material 308 extends between exit point 328 and a contact
point 332 (or alternatively contact point 332' if load 310 is rotated in a counter
clockwise direction) where the packaging material engages load 310.
            [0069]    Wrapping apparatus 300 also includes a relative rotation
assembly 334 configured to rotate turntable 304, and thus, load 310 supported
thereon, relative to packaging material dispenser 306. Relative rotation assembly
334 may include a rotational drive system 336, including, for example, an electric
motor 338. Wrapping apparatus 300 may further include a lift assembly 340, which
may be powered by a lift drive system 342, including, for example, an electric motor
                                            19

344, that may be configured to move dispenser support 302 and packaging material
dispenser 306 vertically relative to load 310.
            [0070]     In addition, similar to wrapping apparatus 100, wrapping
apparatus 300 may include sensors 346, 348, 350 on one or more of downstream
dispensing roller 316, idle roller 324 and idle roller 326. Furthermore, an angle
sensor 352 may be provided for determining an angular relationship between load
310 and packaging material dispenser 306 about a center of rotation 354, and in
some embodiments, one or both of a load distance sensor 356 and a film angle
sensor 358 may also be provided. Sensor 352 may be positioned proximate center
of rotation 354, or alternatively, may be positioned at other locations, such as
proximate the edge of turntable 304. Wrapping apparatus 300 may also include
additional components used in connection with other aspects of a wrapping
operation, e.g., a clamping device 359 may be used to grip the leading end of
packaging material 308 between cycles.
            [0071]     Each of wrapping apparatus 200 of Fig. 3 and wrapping
apparatus 300 of Fig. 4 may also include a controller (not shown) similar to controller
170 of Fig. 2, and receive signals from one or more of the aforementioned sensors
and control packaging material drive system 220, 320 during relative rotation
between load 210, 310 and packaging material dispenser 206, 306.
            [0072]    Those skilled in the art will recognize that the exemplary
environments illustrated in Figs. 1-4 are not intended to limit the present invention.
Indeed, those skilled in the art will recognize that other alternative environments may
be used without departing from the scope of the invention.
                         Effective Circumference-Based Wrapping
            [0073]    As noted above, embodiments consistent with the invention
utilize in one aspect the effective circumference of a load to dynamically control the
rate at which packaging material is dispensed to a load when wrapping the load with
packaging material during relative rotation established between the load and a
packaging material dispenser.
            [0074]     It will be appreciated that in many wrapping applications, the
rate at which packaging material is dispensed is also controlled based on a desired
                                              20

payout percentage, which in general relates to the amount of wrap force applied to
the load by the packaging material during wrapping. Further details regarding the
concept of payout percentage may be found, for example, in the aforementioned
U.S. Pat. No. 7,707,801, which has been incorporated by reference.
             [0075]      In many embodiments, for example, a payout percentage may
have a range of about 80% to about 120% Decreasing the payout percentage slows
the rate at which packaging material exits the packaging material dispenser
compared to the relative rotation of the load such that the packaging material is
pulled tighter around the load, thereby increasing containment force. In contrast,
increasing the payout percentage decreases the wrap force. For the purposes of
simplifying the discussion hereinafter, however, a payout percentage of 100% is
initially assumed. It will be appreciated also that other metrics may be used as an
alternative to payout percentage to reflect the relative amount of wrap force to be
applied during wrapping, so the invention is not so limited.
             [0076]      Fig. 5, for example, functionally illustrates a wrapping apparatus
400 in which a load support 402 and packaging material dispenser 404 are adapted
for relative rotation with one another to rotate a load 406 about a center of rotation
408 and thereby dispense a packaging material 410 for wrapping around the load.
In this illustration, the relative rotation is in a clockwise direction relative to the load
(i.e., the load rotates clockwise relative to the packaging material dispenser, while
the packaging material dispenser may be considered to rotate in a counter-clockwise
direction around the load).
             [0077]      In embodiments consistent with the invention, the effective
circumference of a load throughout relative rotation is indicative of an effective
consumption rate of the load, which is in turn indicative of the amount of packaging
material being "consumed" by the load as the load rotates relative to the packaging
dispenser. In particular, effective consumption rate, as used herein, generally refers
to a rate at which packaging material would need to be dispensed by the packaging
material dispenser in order to substantially match the tangential velocity of a tangent
circle that is substantially centered at the center of rotation of the load and
substantially tangent to a line substantially extending between a first point proximate
to where the packaging material exits the dispenser and a second point proximate to
                                                 21

where the packaging material engages the load. This line is generally coincident
with the web of packaging material between where the packaging material exits the
dispenser and where the packaging material engages the load.
             [0078]     As shown in Fig. 5, for example, an idle roller 412 defines an
exit point 414 for packaging material dispenser 404, such that a portion of web 416
of packaging material 410 extends between this exit point 414 and an engagement
point 418 at which the packaging material 410 engages load 406. In this
arrangement, a tangent circle 420 is tangent to portion 416 and is centered at center
of rotation 408.
             [0079]     The tangent circle has a circumference CTC, which for the
purposes of this invention, is referred to as the "effective circumference" of the load.
Likewise, other dimensions of the tangent circle, e.g., the radius RTC and diameter
DTC,  may be respectively referred to as the "effective radius" and "effective diameter"
of the load.
             [0080]     It has been found that for a load having a non-circular cross
section, as the load rotates relative to the dispenser about center of rotation 408, the
size (i.e., the circumference, radius and diameter) of tangent circle 420 dynamically
varies, and that the size of tangent circle 420 throughout the rotation effectively
models, at any given angular position of the load relative to the dispenser, a rate at
which packaging material should be dispensed in order to match the consumption
rate of the load, i.e., where the dispense rate in terms of linear velocity (represented
by arrow Vo) is substantially equal to the tangential velocity of the tangent circle
(represented by arrow VC). Thus, in situations where a payout percentage of 100%
is desired, the desired dispense rate of the packaging material may be set to
substantially track the dynamically changing tangential velocity of the tangent circle.
             [0081]     Of note, the tangent circle is dependent not only on the
dimensions of the load (i.e., the length L and width W), but also the offset of the
geometric center 422 of the load from the center of rotation 408, illustrated in Fig. 5
as OL and Ow. Given that in many applications, a load will not be perfectly centered
when it is placed or conveyed onto the load support, the dimensions of the load, by
themselves, typically do not present a complete picture of the effective consumption
                                             22

rate of the load. Nonetheless, as will become more apparent below, the calculation
of the dimensions of the tangent circle, and thus the effective consumption rate, may
be determined without determining the actual dimensions and/or offset of the load in
many embodiments.
            [0082]      It has been found that this tangent circle, when coupled with the
web of packaging material and the drive roller (e.g., drive roller 424), functions in
much the same manner as a belt drive system, with tangent circle 420 functioning as
the driver pulley, dispenser drive roller 424functioning as the follower pulley, and
web 416 of packaging material functioning as the belt. For example, let        Nd be the
rotational velocity of a driver pulley in RPM, Nf be the rotational velocity of a follower
pulley in RPM,    Rd be the radius of the driver pulley and Rf be the radius of the
follower pulley. Consider the length of belt that passes over each of the driver pulley
and the follower pulley in one minute, which is equal to the circumference of the
respective pulley (diameter * Tr, or radius * 2rr) multiplied by the rotational velocity:
                        Ld = 2TT*Rd * Nd                                                 (1)
                        L= 2TT*Rf * Nr                                                   (2)
where   Ld is the length of belt that passes over the driver pulley in one minute, and Lf
is the length of belt that passes over the follower pulley in one minute.
            [0083]      In this theoretical system, the point at which neither pulley
applied a tensile or compressive force to the belt (which generally corresponds to a
payout percentage of 100%) would beachieved when the tangential velocities, i.e.,
the linear velocities at the surfaces or rims of the pulleys, were equal. Put another
way, when the length of belt that passes over each pulley over the same time period
is equal, i.e., Ld = Lf. Therefore:
                        2Tr*Rd * Nd =  2Tr*Rr* Nr                                        (3)

            [0084]    Consequently, the velocity ratio VR of the rotational velocities of
the driver and follower pulleys is:
                      VR =    N_      Rf
                              Nf      Rd
            [0085]    Alternatively, the velocity ratio may be expressed in terms of the
ratio of diameters or of circumferences:
                      VR=     N       Df
                                       -(5)
                                       VR            -          --
                              Nf      Dd
                      VR=             C-                                               (6)
                              Nf      Cd
where Df, Dd are the respective diameters of the follower and driver pulleys, and Cf,
Cd  are the respective circumferences of the follower and driver pulleys.
            [0086]    Returning to equations (1) and (2) above, the values Ld and Lf
represent the length of belt that passes the driver and follower pulleys in one minute.
Thus, when the tangent circle for the load is considered a driver pulley, the effective
consumption rate (ECR) may be considered to be equal to the length of packaging
material that passes the tangent circle in a fixed amount of time, e.g., per minute:
                      ECR = CTC * NTC = 2rr*RTc * NTC                            (7)
where CTC is the circumference of the tangent circle, NTC is the rotational velocity of
the tangent circle (e.g., in revolutions per minute (RPM)), and RTC is the radius of the
tangent circle.
            [0087]    Therefore, given a known rotational velocity for the load, a
known circumference of the tangent circle at a given instant and a known
circumference for the drive roller, the rotational velocity of the drive roller necessary
                                             24

to provide a dispense rate that substantially matches the effective consumption rate
is:
                        NDR  = -'   *  N,                                         (8)
                               CDR
where   NOR  is the rotational rate of the drive roller, CTC is the circumference of the
tangent circle and the effective circumference of the load, CDR is the circumference
of the drive roller and NL is the rotational rate of the load relative to the dispenser.
            [0088]      In addition, should it be desirable to scale the rotational rate of
the drive roller to provide a controlled payout percentage (PP), and thereby provide a
desired containment force and/or a desired packaging material use efficiency,
equation (8) may be modified as follows:
                        NDR  =       * NL * PP                                    (9)

            [0089]     The manner in which the dimensions (i.e., circumference,
diameter and/or radius) of the tangent circle may be calculated or otherwise
determined may vary in different embodiments. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 6,
a wrap speed model 500, representing the control algorithm by which to drive a
packaging material dispenser to dispense packaging material at a desired dispense
rate during relative rotation with a load, may be responsive to a number of different
control inputs.
            [0090]      In some embodiments, for example, a sensed film angle (block
502) may be used to determine various dimensions of a tangent circle, e.g., effective
radius (block 504) and/or effective circumference (block 506). As shown in Fig. 5, for
example, a film angle FA may be defined as the angle at exit point 414 between
portion 416 of packaging material 410 (to which tangent circle 420 is tangent) and a
radial or radius 426 extending from center of rotation 408 to exit point 414.
                                               25

           [0091]     Returning to Fig. 6, the film angle sensed in block 502, e.g.,
using an encoder and follower arm or other electronic sensor, is used to determine
one or more dimensions of the tangent circle (e.g., effective radius, effective
circumference and/or effective diameter), and from these determined dimensions, a
wrap speed control algorithm 508 determines a dispense rate. In many
embodiments, wrap speed control algorithm 508 also utilizes the angular relationship
between the load and the packaging material dispenser, i.e., the sensed rotational
position of the load, as an input such that, for any given rotational position or angle of
the load (e.g., at any of a plurality of angles defined in a full revolution), a desired
dispense rate for the determined tangent circle may be determined.
           [0092]     Alternatively or in addition to the use of sensed film angle,
various additional inputs may be used to determine dimensions of a tangent circle.
As shown in block 512, for example, a film speed sensor, such as an optical or
magnetic encoder on an idle roller, may be used to determine the speed of the
packaging material as the packaging material exits the packaging material
dispenser. In addition, as shown in block 514, a laser or other distance sensor may
be used to determine a load distance (i.e., the distance between the surface of the
load at a particular rotational position and a reference point about the periphery of
the load). Furthermore, as shown in block 516, the dimensions of the load, e.g.,
length, width and/or offset, may either be input manually by a user, may be received
from a database or other electronic data source, or may be sensed or measured.
           [0093]     From any or all of these inputs, one or more dimensions of the
load, such as corner contact angles (block 518), corner contact radials (block 520),
and/or corner radials (block 522) may be used to determine a calculated film angle,
such that this calculated film angle may be used in lieu of or in addition to any
sensed film angle to determine one or more dimensions of the tangent circle. Thus,
the calculated film angle may be used by the wrap speed control algorithm in a
similar manner to the sensed film angle described above.
           [0094]     Moreover, as will be discussed in greater detail below, in some
embodiments additional modifications may be applied to wrap speed control
algorithm 508 to provide more accurate control over the dispense rate. As shown in
block 526, for example, a compensation may be performed to address system lag.
                                             26

In some embodiments, for example, a controlled intervention may be performed to
effectively anticipate contact of a corner of the load with the packaging material. In
addition, in some embodiments, a rotational shift may be performed to better align
collected data with the control algorithm and thereby account for various lags in the
system.
Effective Circumference Based on Sensed Film Angle
            [0095]    Returning to Fig. 5, when sensed film angle is used in a wrap
speed model consistent with the invention, the effective circumference may be
determined based upon the right triangle 428 defined by center of rotation 408, exit
point 414, and a tangent point 430 where web 416 of packaging material 410
intersects with tangent circle 420. Given that an effective radius RTC extending
between center of rotation 408 and point 430 forms a right angle with web 416, and
further given that the length of the rotation radial (RR), i.e., the radius 426 from
center of rotation 408 to exit point 414, is known, the effective radius   RTC may be
calculated using the film angle (FA) and length RR as follows:
                 RTC = RR *sin(FA)                                        (10)
            [0096]    Furthermore, the effective circumference CTC may be calculated
from the effective radius as follows:
                 CTC= 21T*  RTC   = 2rr* RR *sin(FA)                             (11)
            [0097]    Thereafter, equation (9) may be used to control the dispense
rate in the manner disclosed above.
            [0098]    In some embodiments, exit point 414 is defined at a fixed point
proximate idle roller 412, e.g., proximate a tangent point at which web 416
disengages from idle roller 412 when web 416 is about half-way between the
maximum and minimum film angles through which the web passes for a particular
load, or alternatively, for all expected loads that may be wrapped by wrapping
apparatus 400. Alternatively, exit point 414 may be defined at practically any other
point along the surface of idle roller 412, or even at the center of rotation thereof. In
other embodiments, however, it may be desirable to dynamically determine the exit
                                              27

point based on the angle at which web 416 exits the dispenser. Other dynamically or
statically-defined exit points proximate the packaging material dispenser may be
used in other embodiments consistent with the invention.
            [0099]    As previously noted, film angle may be sensed in a number of
manners consistent with the invention. For example, as illustrated in Figs. 1-3, a film
angle sensor 158, 258, 358 may be implemented using a distance sensor that
measures distance between the plane of the web of packaging material and the fixed
location of the sensor.
            [00100]    Alternatively, as illustrated in Fig. 7, a film angle sensor 550
may be mechanical in nature, and utilize a cantilevered or rockered follower arm 552
that rotates about an axis 554 and includes a foot 556 that rides along the surface of
a web 558 of packaging material extending between an exit roller 560 on the
packaging material dispenser and the point of engagement with a load 562. Thus,
for example, as the web deflects to a position 558' as a result of rotation of load 562,
arm 552 rotates to a position 552'. Sensor 550 may include, for example, a rotary
encoder or other angle sensor to determine the angle of arm 552, and thus, the
corresponding film angle. It will be appreciated that arm 552 may be spring loaded
or otherwise tensioned against web 558 such that foot 556 rides along the web
throughout the rotation of the load. Furthermore, foot 556 may include rollers or a
low friction surface to minimize drag on the web of packaging material.In addition,
other manners of detecting the relative position of arm 552 and/or foot 556, e.g., a
distance sensor directed at the arm, foot or other portion of the assembly, may also
be used.
            [00101]   As another alternative, as illustrated in Fig. 8, a film angle
sensor 570 may be implemented as a force sensor that senses force changes
resulting from movement of the web through a range of film angles. In particular, a
pair of roller 572, 574 may be provided as an exit point for a packaging material
dispenser, such that a web 576 projects through the rollers 572, 574 and engages a
load 578. Each roller 572, 574 may be coupled to a force sensor that measures the
force applied perpendicular to the rotational axis of each roller by web 576.
Furthermore, in some embodiments, the axle of each roller 572, 574 may be
configured to move perpendicular relative to the axis of rotation. Thus, for example,
                                              28

as web 576 deflects to a position 576' as a result of rotation of load 578, a force is
applied to roller 572, displacing the roller to the position shown at 572'. It will be
appreciated that the amount of force applied is proportional to the film angle, and
thus the film angle may be derived from the force measurement.
            [00102]   In some embodiments, rollers 572, 574 may be mounted for
linear displacement or displacement along an arc. In other embodiments, rollers
572, 574 may not be displaced through the application of force. In still other
embodiments, only one roller may be used, while in other embodiments, rollers 572,
574 may be replaced with low friction surfaces over which the web passes during
wrapping.
            [00103]   As another alternative, as illustrated in Figs. 9A-9B, an array of
sensors, e.g., in the form of a light curtain 580, may be positioned above and/or
below a web 582 of packaging material between an exit roller 584 of a packaging
material dispenser and a point of engagement with a load 586 to effective sense the
position of an edge of the packaging material. As shown in Fig. 9B, light curtain 580
may include an array of transmitters 588 opposing an array of receivers 590, with
each transmitter 588 emitting a beam such as an infrared light beam or a laser beam
that is sensed by a corresponding receiver 590. Whenever web 582 passes
between a corresponding pair of transmitter 588 and receiver 590, the beam is
interrupted and thus the position of the web may be determined. Thus, for example,
when the web is positioned as shown at 582, a receiver 590a does not detect a
beam, while when the web is positioned as shown at 582', a receiver 590b does not
detect a beam.
            [00104]   It will be appreciated that the positions of transmitters 588 and
receivers 590 may be swapped relative to one another, and that in some
embodiments, a reflective surface may be used along one edge of the web such that
the transmitters and receivers may both be positioned along the same edge of the
web. In other embodiments, a sensor array may be implemented using an image
sensor, such as in a digital camera, with image processing techniques used to detect
the position of the web in a digital image. In still other embodiments, a laser or
infrared scanner, e.g., as used in bar code readers, may be used.
                                             29

            [00105]    It will also be appreciated that in any of the aforementioned film
angle sensor implementations, various lighting or illumination techniques may be
used to improve sensing of the packaging material, and in some embodiments, the
packaging material may be tinted or colored to improve recognition. Other
modifications will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of
the instant disclosure.
Effective Circumference Determined Based on Calculated Film Angle
            [00106]   As noted above, in other embodiments of the invention, the film
angle, and thus the effective radius and effective circumference used in a wrap
speed model consistent with the invention, may be calculated or derived from other
measurements and/or input data.
            [00107]    Fig. 10, for example, illustrates a representative plot of the
length of a web of packaging material from an exit point of a packaging material
dispenser to a point of engagement with an example load throughout a full relative
rotation between the packaging material dispenser and the load. Put another way,
consider a fixed load 600 and a packaging material dispenser that rotates about load
600 with an exit point that traverses a circular path 602 having a center of rotation
604. Each line represents the length of the web of packaging material at a particular
angular relationship between the packaging material dispenser and the load, and for
the purposes of this example, the load is assumed to be 40 x 40 inches and offset
from the center of rotation.
            [00108]    Fig. 11, in turn, illustrates a graph of the distances of the lines at
a plurality of angles in a full relative rotation of 360 degrees, and it has been found
that the graph accurately depicts the effective consumption rate of the load
throughout the relative rotation. Moreover, as has been discussed above in
connection with equations (1)-(11), the dimensions of the tangent circle (e.g., the
effective circumference and the effective radius), the film angle and the film speed
are all geometrically related to this effective consumption speed.
            [00109]   As shown in Figs. 12A-12C, for example, effective
circumference, film angle, and idle roller speed (which is proportional to film speed)
are respectively graphed over a plurality of angles for an example load with a 48 inch
                                                30

length, a 40 inch width, and an offset of 4 inches in length and 0 inches in width. It
can be seen that all three parameters follow the same general profile (though film
speed is both dampened and delayed), and thus, each may be used to control
dispense rate to match an effective consumption rate of the load.
            [00110]   In some embodiments, the effective consumption rate may be
determined in part based on the dimensions and offset of the load, which may be
determined using the locations of the corners of the load. For example, as shown in
Fig. 13, an example load 610 of length L and width W, and having four corners
denoted C1, C2, C3 and C4, may be considered to have four corner radials Rc1,
Rc2, Rc3 and Rc4 extending from a center of rotation 612 to each respective corner.
The load has a geometric center 614 that is offset along the length and width as
represented by Lo and Wo.
            [00111]   The location of each corner may be defined, for example, using
polar coordinates for each of the corner radials, defining both a length (RcX, where X
= 1, 2, 3, or 4) and an angle (referred to as a corner location angle, LAcX) relative to
a base angular position, such as defined at 616. Alternatively, Cartesian coordinates
may be used.
            [00112]   The length and the width of the load may be determined using
the corner radial locations, for example, by applying the law of cosines to the
triangles formed by the corner radials and the outer dimensions of the load. For
example, with the corner radials for corners 1 and 4 known, the length may be
determined as follows:
                 L =Rc42 + Rc1 2 - 2 * Rc4 * Rcl * cos(Ac4cl)          (12)
where Ac4cl = 360 - LAc4 + LAc1.
            [00113]   Alternatively, the length may be determined using the corner
radials for corners 2 and 3, as follows:
                 L =jRc22 + Rc3 2 - 2 * Rc2 * Rc3 * cos(Ac2c3)         (13)
                                            31

where Ac2c3 = LAc3 - LAc2.
            [00114]  Similarly, the width of the load may be determined using either
the corner radials for corners 3 and 4, or the corner radials for corners 1 and 2:
                 W =Rc32 + Rc4 2 - 2 * Rc3 * Rc4 * cos(Ac3c4)          (14)
                 L =jRc12 + Rc2 2 - 2 * Rc      *   Rc2 * cos(Aclc2)   (15)
where Ac3c4 = LAc4 - LAc3 and Ac c2 = LAc2 - LAc1.
            [00115]  Conversely, using Pythagorean's theorem the lengths of the
corner radials may be determined from the length L, width W and offset Lo, Wo as
follows:
                 Rc1 =      - WO      +    - Lo                        (16)
                              (2                  2
                 Rc2 =   (     Wo     + (-   Lo                        (17)
                 Rc3 =     W+ Wo      + Q+ Lo) 2                       (18)
                 Rc1 =         WO          + Lo                        (19)
            [00116]   Furthermore, to determine the corner location angle for the
corner radials, the orthogonal distances from the center of rotation to the sides of the
rectangle may be used to define a right triangle with the corner radial as the
hypotenuse. As shown in Fig. 13, for example, for corner radial Rc1, a right triangle
is defined between the corner radial and line segments 618, 620. Taking the arcsine
of the ratio of segment 620 and the corner radial Rc gives the corner location angle
LAc1:
                                 (-Lo)
                 LAc1 = sin-'     Rc1                                  (20)
                                            32

           [00117]  To determine the corner location angle LAc2 for corner radial
Rc2, this angle may be considered to include LAc1 summed with the angle defined
between corner radials Rc and Rc2, which in turn may be considered to be defined
by two sub-angles LAc2a and LAc2b, as shown in Fig. 14, or:
                LAc2 = LAc + LAc2a + LAc2b                          (21)
           [00118]  LAc2a may be determined using a right triangle defined by
corner radial Rc and line segments 622 and 624, e.g., by taking the arcsine of the
ratio of segment 622 and corner radial Rc1:
                LAc2a = sin-' (   R 1)                              (22)
           [00119]  LAc2b may be determined using a right triangle defined by
corner radial Rc2 and line segments 624 and 626, e.g., by taking the arcsine of the
ratio of segment 626 and corner radial Rc2:

           [00120]  For corner location angles LAc3 and LAc4, a similar summation
of angles may be performed. Thus, LAc3 = LAc2 + LAc3a + LAc3b, where:
                LAc3a = sin- (R     2)                              (24)

           [00121]  In addition, LAc4 = LAc3 + LAc4a + LAc4b, where:
                LAc4a = sin-      Rc3                               (26)

           [00122]     It should be noted that instead of arcsines, arccosines may be
used to determine the corner location angles. Alternatively, the corner location
angles may be determined without having to first calculate the lengths of the corner
radials and/or without having to sum together the angles from preceding corners. As
shown in Fig. 13, for example, for corner radial Rc1, a right triangle is defined
between the corner radial and line segments 618, 620, which respectively have
lengths of W/2-Wo and L/2-Lo. Taking the arctangent of the ratio of these two
distances gives the corner location angle LAc1:
                                    E-Lo
                 LAc1 = tan-' (-Wo                                        (28)
           [00123]     Likewise, for corner radials Rc2, Rc3 and Rc4, the corner
location angles may be calculated as follows (since for corner radials Rc2, Rc3 and
Rc4, the right triangles analogous to that used to calculate the corner location angle
for the corner radial Rc are respectively 90, 180 and 270 degrees from base
angular position 616):

           [00124]     Based on the locations of the corner radials, the film angle at
any rotational position of the load may be determined. For example, In one
embodiment, the film angle FA may be determined by first determining the length of
a web of packaging material, e.g., web 630 of Fig. 15, which extends between an
exit point 632 of a packaging material dispenser and corner c1 of a load 634. Of
note, in Fig. 15, the load rotates counterclockwise relative to the dispenser.
           [00125]     For the first corner c1, for example, the corner film length FLc1
may be determined using the law of cosines based upon the known rotation angle
                                              34

RA of the load, the corner location angle LAc1 of corner ci, and the lengths Rr and
Rc of the rotation radial and the corner radial for corner ci, as follows:
                FLc1 = VRc12 + Rr     2  - 2 * Rcl * Rr * cos(Acl) (32)
where Ac1 = RA - LAc1.
           [00126]   Likewise, for corners c2, c3 and c4, the respective corner film
lengths FLc2, FLc3 and FLc4 may be calculated as follows:
                FLc2 = VRc2 2 + Rr    2
                                         - 2 * Rc2 * Rr * cos(Ac2) (33)
                FLc3 = VRc32 + Rr     2  - 2 * Rc3 * Rr * cos(Ac3) (34)
                FLc4 = VRc42 + Rr     2  - 2 * Rc4 * Rr * cos(Ac4) (35)
where Ac2 = RA - LAc2, Ac3 = RA - LAc4, and Ac4 = RA - LAc4.
           [00127]   Upon calculation of the corner film length, the law of cosines
may then be used to determine the film angle as follows:
                FA    = Cos-1 (FLc1       2 +Rr 2 -Rc1 2               (36)

           [00128]   For corners c2, c3 and c4, the film angle is likewise calculated
as follows:
                FAc2  = Cos -1 (FLc2 2 +Rr 2 -Rc2       2
                                                          )

            [00129]     Once the film angle is known for a given corner, the dimensions
of the tangent circle, and thus the effective consumption rate, may be determined,
and equation (9) as discussed above may be used to control the dispense rate.
            [00130]     It will be appreciated that in some embodiments of the invention,
the dimensions of the tangent circle may be determined without one or more of the
intermediate calculations discussed above. For example, in some embodiments, film
angle does not need to be separately calculated. As shown in Fig. 16, for example,
for a given corner, a triangle 636 is defined by the rotation radial, web 630 and the
corner radial, each respectively having a length Rr, FLc1 and Rc1. The altitude of
this triangle is the effective radius of tangent circle 638. This altitude may be
calculated by applying Heron's formula to obtain the area of the triangle, and then
deriving the altitude from the area formula for a triangle (area=1/2*base*altitude),
where the base in the area formula corresponds to the film length FLc1:
                          2*Vs(s-FLc1)(s-Rr)(s-Rc1)
                  R-rc =                                                   (40)
                                         FLc1
where s, the semiperimeter, is one half the sum of the sides, or (FLc1 +Rr+Rcl)/2.
            [00131]     It will be appreciated that other trigonometric formulas and rules
may be utilized to derive various dimensions and angles utilized herein to determine
effective consumption rate without departing from the spirit and scope of the
invention.
Load Distance
            [00132]     As noted above, a load distance sensor may be used to
determine film angle, and thus, effective circumference and/or effective consumption
rate. In one embodiment, for example, a load distance sensor 432, as illustrated in
Fig. 5, may be oriented along a radius from the center of rotation 408 and at a known
and fixed distance from and angular position about the center of rotation. By
orienting this sensor such that a corner passes the sensor prior to engaging the
packaging material, both the length and the contact angle of the corner radial may be
determined prior to contact with the packaging material, and used to control
dispense rate through the phase of the rotation in which the web of packaging
                                               36

material extends between the corner and the exit point of the dispenser. For
example, a corner typically may be identified at a local minimum in the output of load
distance sensor 432, which occurs when the corner passes the sensor.
           [00133]     Alternatively, the load distance sensor may be used to
determine the complete geometric profile of the load, e.g., through an initial full
revolution in which the distance to the surface of the load is stored and used to
derive the length, width and offset of the load and/or the locations of each of the
corners. In addition, given that some loads may have varying dimensions from top to
bottom, it may be desirable in some embodiments to record the output of the load
distance sensor during each revolution for use in determining the dimensions of the
load to be used for the subsequent revolution (or for multiple subsequent
revolutions).
           [00134]     Derivation of the corner locations (e.g., corner radials and corner
location angles) from the determined dimensions and offset of the load may then be
performed in the manner discussed above, such that an effective consumption rate
and/or effective circumference/radius-based wrap speed model may be employed to
control the dispense rate during a wrapping operation.
Film Speed
           [00135]     Another input that may be used to determine film angle, and
thus, effective circumference and/or effective consumption rate, is film speed, e.g.,
the speed of idle roller 126 as sensed by sensor 150 of Fig. 1 and converted from
rotational velocity to linear velocity based on the known radius of the idle roller.
           [00136]     To correlate the film speed to the dimensions of the load, the
amplitudes of the local minimums and maximums of the film speed, or alternatively,
the local minimums and maximums of the rotational velocity of the idle roller, may be
used. In general, the amplitude of the peak, or maximum, speed after a corner
passes approximates the length of its corner radial, while the amplitude of the
minimum speed where a corner passes approximates the length of its contact radial,
which is typically the effective radius of the load at corner contact. The angle where
the peak or maximum speed occurs after a corner passes approximates the corner
location angle where the length of the corner radial and the effective radius are
                                              37

approximately equal, and the angle where the minimum speed occurs after a corner
passes approximates the contact angle for that corner. Fig. 12C, for example,
illustrates the points matching the approximate amplitudes and angles corresponding
to the corner radials Rc1, Rc2, Rc3 and Rc4 for corners c1, c2, c3 and c4, and to the
contact radials CRc1, CRc2, CRc3 and CRc4.
            [00137]    With reference to Fig. 17, for example, the corner radial length
(Rc1) and the contact radial length (CRc1) for corner c1 for may be determined as
follows:
                 Rc = (FSmax*K                                    (41)
                 CRc1   =  (FS    *K                              (42)
where FSmax is the local maximum film speed after a corner passes, FSmin is the local
minimum film speed after the corner passes, and K is a constant used to convert film
speed units into length/revolution (e.g., if film speed units are in inches/sec, K may
be rotation speed in second/revolution).. It will be appreciated that K may be
determined empirically or may be calculated based upon the dimensions and
configuration of the wrapping apparatus and the sensor used to determine the film
speed.
            [00138]    In addition, again with reference to Fig. 17, the location of the
corner relative to the rotation radial may be determined, for example, as follows:
                 Ac1L = sin          -R-                          (43)
                                    Rcl)
                 Ac1CL = 180 - Ac1L                               (44)
                 CLc1 = Rc1 * cos(Ac1CL) + VRr2 - Rc1 2 * sin 2 (Ac1CL)          (45)
                                         Cc*in(ACL
                 LAc1Rr =Sin-L            *s Rc       )           (46)
where Lac Rr is the difference between the corner location and corner contact
angles for the corner.
                                             38

            [00139]   Calculation of the corresponding values for corners c2, c3 and
c4 are performed in a similar manner. Derivation of the dimensions and offset of the
load from these values may be performed in the manner discussed above, and an
effective consumption rate and/or effective circumference/radius-based wrap speed
model may be employed to control the dispense rate during a wrapping operation
based upon these values.
Load Dimensions
            [00140]   Yet another input that may be used to determine film angle, and
thus, effective circumference and/or effective consumption rate, is the measured or
input dimensions of the load. In some embodiments, for example, the dimensions
and/or offset may be manually input by an operator through a user interface with a
wrapping apparatus. In an alternate embodiment, the dimensions and/or offset may
be stored in a database and retrieved by the controller of the wrapping apparatus. In
some embodiments, for example, where a conveyor is used to convey loads to and
from the wrapping apparatus, upstream machinery may provide dimensions of the
load to the wrapping apparatus prior to arrival, or a bar code or other identification
may be provided on the load to be read by the wrapping apparatus and thereby
enable retrieval of the dimensions based on the identification.
            [00141]   In still other embodiments, a light curtain or other dimensional
sensor or sensor array may be used to visually determine the dimensions and/or
offset of the load. The dimensions and offset may be determined, for example,
before the load is conveyed to the wrapping apparatus, or alternatively, after the load
has been conveyed to the wrapping apparatus, and prior to or during initiation of a
wrapping operation for the load.
            [00142]   Derivation of the corner locations (e.g., corner radials and corner
location angles) from the determined dimensions and offset of the load may then be
performed in the manner discussed above, such that an effective consumption rate
and/or effective circumference/radius-based wrap speed model may be employed to
control the dispense rate during a wrapping operation.
                                            39

                         Corner Rotation Angle-Based Wrapping
            [00143]    In some embodiments of the invention, a wrap speed model and
wrap speed control utilizing such a wrap speed model may be based at least in part
on rotation angles associated with one or more corners of a load. In this regard, a
corner rotation angle may be considered to include an angle or rotational position
about a center of rotation that is relative to or otherwise associated with a particular
corner of a load. In some embodiments, for example, a corner rotation angle may be
based on a corner location angle for a corner, and represent the angular position of a
corner radial relative to a particular base or home position. Alternatively, a corner
rotation angle may be based on a corner contact angle for an angle, representing an
angle at which packaging material first comes into contact with a corner during
relative rotation between the load and a packaging material dispenser. Given that
these and other angles are geometrically related to one another based on the
geometry of the load, it will be appreciated that a corner rotation angle consistent
with the invention is not limited to only a corner location angle or a corner contact
angle, and that other angles relative to or otherwise associated with a corner may be
used in the alternative.
            [00144]   As will become more apparent below, corner rotation angles
may be used in connection with wrap speed control in a number of manners
consistent with the invention. For example, in some embodiments corner rotation
angles may be used to determine to what corner the packaging material is currently
engaging, and thus, what corner is driving the effective consumption rate of the load.
In this regard, in some embodiments, multiple corners may be tracked to enable a
determination to be made as to when to switch from a current corner to a next corner
when controlling dispense rate. In other embodiments, corner rotation angles may
be used to anticipate corner contacts and perform controlled interventions, and in still
other embodiments, corner rotation angles may be used in the performance of
rotational data shifts.
            [00145]    In some embodiments of the invention, for example, it may be
desirable to determine and/or predict or anticipate a rotation angle such as a contact
angle of each corner of a load during the relative rotation. In some embodiments, a
                                             40

contact angle, representing the rotational position of the load when the packaging
material first contacts a particular corner, may be determined for each corner.
            [00146]   The contact angles may be sensed using various sensors
discussed above, or determined via calculation based on the dimensions/offset of
the load and/or corner locations. In addition, the contact angles may be used to
effectively determine what corner is driving the wrap speed model, and thus, what
corner profile should be used to control dispense rate.
            [00147]    Fig. 18, for example, illustrates a graph of the ideal dispense
rates for corner profiles 650a, 650b, 650c and 650d for the four corners of the same
load depicted in Figs. 12A-12C. It should be noted that the intersections of these
profiles, at 652a, 652b and 652c, represent the contact angles when the packaging
material, which is being driven by one corner, contacts the next corner such that the
next corner begins to drive the desired dispense rate of the packaging material.
Comparing Fig. 18 to Figs. 12A-12B it may be seen that the effective circumference
and film angle track these profiles and contact angles, and as such, in some
embodiments, the contact angles may be sensed using a number of the
aforementioned sensors.
            [00148]    For example, each of a film angle sensor and a load distance
sensor will reach a local minimum proximate each contact angle. Thus, a wrap
speed control may be configured to switch from one corner to a next corner based
on the anticipated rotational position of each corner as sensed in either of these
manners. As another example, an effective radius or effective circumference may be
calculated based upon a current corner and a next corner, such that the contact
angle is determined at the angle where the effective radius/effective circumference of
the next corner becomes larger than that of the current corner.
            [00149]   Alternatively, the contact angles may be calculated based on the
dimensions of the load. As shown in Fig. 19A, for example, the contact angle (CAc1)
for corner c1 represents the angle where corner c1 intersects the plane between the
previous corner c4 and exit point 632. The contact angle may be calculated, for
example, using the length and location angles of the corner radials for the corner at
                                             41

issue and the immediately preceding corner in the rotation (here, Rc1, Rc4, LAc1
and LAc4) and the length of the rotation radial (Rr), which are illustrated in Fig. 19B.
           [00150]    Fig. 19C illustrates two values, Ac4cl and Lc4cl, that may be
calculated from the aforementioned values. Ac4cl is the angle between the corner
location angles for corners c1 and c4:
                Ac4cl = 360 - LAc4 + LAc1                                      (41)
           [00151]    Lc4cl is the distance between the corners, which in this
instance is equal to the length of the load:
                Lc4cl = Rc42 + Rc12 - 2 * Rc4 * Rcl * cos(Ac4cl)               (42)
           [00152]    Next, as shown in Fig. 19D, three additional values, illustrated at
Ac L, Ac CL and CLc1, may be calculated as follows:
                AcL    =  COS-1 (Rc1 2 +Lc4c       2 -Rc4 2 )
                                         2*Rc1*Lc4c1
                Ac1CL = 180 - Ac1L                                             (44)
                CLc1 = Rc *cos(Acl CL) + VRr 2 - Rc1 2       * sin 2 (Ac1CL)   (45)
           [00153]    Next, as shown in Fig. 19E, the contact angle CAc1 for corner
c1 may be isolated from the known and calculated angles:
                                          2     2 - (CLc1+Lc4c1) 2
                Ac4Rr    =  COS 11CRc4 +Rr *c*r)(46)
                                                2*Rc4*Rr
                CAc    =   LAc4 + Ac4Rr - 360                                  (47)
           [00154]    For corners c2, c3 and c4, a similar analysis may be performed,
except that since the location angle preceding corner will be smaller than the current
corner (unlike the case with corner ci, where corner c4 has a larger location angle),
the determination of the angle between the current and preceding corners in
                                             42

equation (41), and the determination of the contact angle in equation (47), do not
need to take into account negative angles. Thus, for example, for corner c2:
                Ac1c2 = LAc2-LAc1                                             (48)
                CAc2 = LAc + Ac Rr                                            (49)
           [00155]   The other calculations discussed above for equations (42)-(46),
however, are essentially the same.
           [00156]   The contact angle of each corner may therefore be determined
and used to select which corner is currently "driving" the dispensing process, based
upon the known angular relationship of the load to the packaging material dispenser
at any given time. In addition, the contact angle may be used to anticipate a contact
of the packaging material with a corner so that, for example, a controlled intervention
may be performed.
                                  Wrapping Operation
           [00157]   Returning briefly to Fig. 6, implementation of a wrap speed
model 500 using any of the aforementioned techniques may be used to wrap
packaging material around a load during relative rotation between the load and a
packaging material dispenser. During a typical wrapping operation, a clamping
device, e.g., as known in the art, is used to position a leading edge of the packaging
material on the load such that when relative rotation between the load and the
packaging material dispenser is initiated, the packaging material will be dispensed
from the packaging material dispenser and wrapped around the load. In addition,
where prestretching is used, the packaging material is stretched prior to being
conveyed to the load. Thereafter, wrapping continues while a lift assembly controls
the height of the packaging material so that the packaging material is wrapped in a
spiral manner around the load from the base of the load to the top. Multiple layers of
packaging material may be wrapped around the load over multiple passes to
increase containment force, and once the desired amount of packaging material is
dispensed, the packaging material is severed to complete the wrap.
                                            43

            [00158]    Based upon the various techniques discussed above, the
manner in which the dispense rate is controlled during this operation may vary in
different embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, an initial revolution
may be performed to determine the dimensions of the load, such that corner
locations may be determined prior to wrapping and then wrapping may commence
using these predetermine corner locations to drive the dispenser rate based on a
calculated effective consumption rate. In other embodiments, no initial revolution
may be performed, and either dimensions of the load as input or retrieved from a
database may be used to drive the dispenser rate based on the effective
consumption rate. In still other embodiments, sensed film angle, sensed film speed,
sensed load distance, etc. may be used to calculate effective consumption rate as
soon as wrapping is commenced.
            [00159]    Furthermore, as noted above, some loads may not have a
consistent length and width from top to bottom. Loads may include different layers of
objects or containers having different lengths and/or widths, and some layers may be
offset relative to other layers. As such, it may be desirable in some embodiments to
recalculate load dimensions and/or corner locations for different elevations on a load.
For example, in some embodiments, as each corner approaches and/or passes the
packaging material dispenser, the location of the corner may be recalculated and
used for the next pass of the same corner. In some embodiments, load dimensions
calculated during one full revolution may be used for the next full revolution, such
that as the lift assembly changes the elevation of the packaging material dispenser,
the load dimensions are dynamically updated based on the dimensions sensed at a
particular elevation of the packaging material dispenser.
            [00160]    One example wrap speed control process 660, which is based
on concurrent tracking of multiple corner locations, is shown in Fig. 20. In this
process, two corners are effectively tracked at all times. The first is referred to
herein as the "current corner," which is the corner that is currently driving the
dispensing process, in terms of being the corner at which the packaging material is
engaging the load. The second is referred to herein as the "next corner," which is
the immediately subsequent corner that will engage the load after further revolution
of the load relative to the packaging material dispenser. These corners are
                                             44

concurrently tracked such that each contact between the packaging material and a
new corner can be anticipated or detected, thereby allowing the dispense rate to be
controlled appropriately based upon the location of the new corner.
           [00161]   One manner of anticipating or detecting a corner contact is
based on applying a wrap speed model based on the locations of two corners, and
comparing the results. Thus, in blocks 662 and 664, the effective consumption rate
is determined based on the location of the current corner and based on the location
of the next corner. A corner contact occurs when the effective consumption rate
based on the next corner exceeds that of the current corner, as discussed above in
connection with Fig. 18, and as such, block 666 compares these two effective
consumption rates. So long as the corner contact has not yet occurred, and the
effective consumption rate of the current corner is used to control the dispense rate,
block 666 passes control to block 668 to control the dispense rate based on the
effective consumption rate for the current corner. Control then returns to block 662
to continue tracking the current and next corners.
           [00162]    If, however, the effective consumption rate based on the next
corner exceeds that of the current corner, a corner contact has occurred, and block
666 passes control to block 670 to update the current corner to what was previously
the next corner. Thus, for example, if the current corner is corner c1 and the next
corner is c2, and the effective consumption rate based on corner c2 exceeds that
calculated based on corner c1, c2 becomes the new current corner, and
consequently, corner c3 becomes the new next corner. Control then passes to block
668 to control the dispense rate based on the new current corner.
           [00163]   As noted above in connection with Fig. 18, the effective
circumference, effective radius, film angle, and film speed all track the effective
consumption rate. As such, blocks 662, 664 and 666 may alternatively track the
corners based on calculating any of these values and compare the results to
determine a corner contact.
           [00164]   Alternatively, as illustrated by process680 of Fig. 21, a wrap
speed control process may be performed by tracking the corner contact angle for a
next corner in block 682, determining the current rotational position of the load in
                                             45

block 684 (e.g., using an angle sensor such as angle sensor 152 of Fig. 1), and then
determining in block 686 whether the corner contact angle for the next corner has
been reached (i.e., where the rotational position of the load matches the corner
contact angle). So long as the corner contact has not yet occurred, block 686
passes control to block 688 to control the dispense rate based on the effective
consumption rate calculated from the location of the current corner, and control
returns to block 682. Otherwise, if contact has occurred, block 686 passes control to
block 690 to set the current corner to the next corner, such that when control is
passed to block 688, the next corner, now the new current corner, is used to
determine the dispense rate.
                                   Controlled Interventions
            [00165]    It will be appreciated that, even when a desired wrap speed
model may be determined for a load, various system lags typically exist in any
wrapping apparatus that can make it difficult to match the desired wrap speed. From
an electronic standpoint, delays due to the response times of sensors and drive
motors, communication delays, and computational delays in a controller will
necessarily introduce some amount of lag. Moreover, from a physical or mechanical
standpoint, sensors may have delays in determining a sensed value and drive
motors, such as the motor(s) used to drive a packaging dispenser, as well as the
other rotating components in the packaging material, typically have rotational inertia
to overcome whenever the dispense rate is changed. Furthermore, packaging
material typically has some degree of elasticity even after prestretching, so some lag
will exist before changes in dispense rate propagate through the web of packaging
material. In addition, mechanical sources of fluctuation, such as film slippage on idle
rollers, out of round rollers and bearings, imperfect mechanical linkages, flywheel
effects of downstream non-driven rollers, also exist.
            [00166]   As a result of many of these issues, it may be desirable to
implement controlled interventions in some embodiments. Within the context of the
invention, an intervention is an operation that controls the dispense rate in a
predetermined manner based on a predetermined intervention criteria. In some
embodiments, an intervention is an operation that modifies the dispense rate relative
to a predicted demand or a dispense rate that has been calculated by a particular
                                              46

wrap model, e.g., a wrap speed model based on effective circumference or effective
consumption rate. An intervention may also be an operation that modifies the
dispense rate relative to another type of wrap model and/or a wrap model based on
another type of control input, e.g., a wrap force model based on wrap force or
packaging material tension as monitored by a load cell.
             [00167]  For example, Fig. 22 illustrates an example process 700 that
selectively applies one or more controlled interventions at predetermined times or
rotational positions relative to a corner contact. In this process, a corner contact
angle for a next corner is determined, e.g., predicted or anticipated (block 702) and
one or more intervention criteria are determined (block 704). An intervention criteria
may include, for example, an absolute rotational position (e.g., at 75 degrees) or a
relative rotational position (e.g., 10 degrees before or after corner contact), and may
be relative to a corner contact angle, a corner location angle, or another calculated
angle. Alternatively, an intervention criteria may be based on absolute or relative
times or distances (e.g., 100 ms before or after corner contact). In some
embodiments, separate start and end criteria may be specified (e.g., start 10
degrees before corner contact and stop at contact), while in other embodiments, a
start criteria may be coupled with a duration such that an intervention is applied for a
fixed duration of angles, times or distances after being initiated.
             [00168]  Next, in block 706, the rotational position of the load is
determined, e.g., in terms of an angle, a time or distance within a revolution of the
load relative to the packaging material dispenser. Block 708 then determines
whether an intervention criteria has been met. If not, block 708 passes control to
block 710 to control the dispense rate without the use of an intervention, e.g., in any
of the manners discussed above based on effective circumference or effective
consumption rate.If the criteria for an intervention is met, however, block 708 passes
control to block 712 to instead control dispense rate based on the intervention.
             [00169]  It will be appreciated that in different embodiments, a number of
interventions may be performed. For example, it may be desirable to reduce the
dispense rate below a predicted demand as calculated by a wrap speed model a few
degrees prior to a corner contact to build wrap force as the corner approaches, e.g.,
as shown in Fig. 23A. In some embodiments, for example, the dispense rate may be
                                             47

advanced a few degrees so that the wrap speed model is time shifted to decrease
the dispense rate sooner than would otherwise be performed. In other
embodiments, the dispense rate may be set to the dispense rate to be used at the
corner contact, only a few degrees early. In still other embodiments, the wrap speed
model may be scaled such that the dispense rate is decreased by a certain
percentage from that of the wrap speed model as the corner approaches, e.g., as
shown in Fig. 23B.
            [00170]   Likewise, it may also be desirable to increase the dispense rate
above a predicted demand as calculated by a wrap speed model a few degrees after
a corner contact to allow the peak force after the corner to be reduced. Similar to
prior to the corner contact, the wrap speed model may be delayed a few degrees or
scaled to otherwise increase the dispense rate above that calculated from the wrap
speed model. In other embodiments, the dispense rate may be set to hold the
dispense rate used at the corner contact for a few extra degrees. It may also be
desirable in some embodiments to contact a corner at dispense rate that is a factor
less than the dispense rate calculated from the wrap speed model to create a force
spike at the corner contact.
            [00171]   As another alternative, as shown in Fig. 23C, it may be desirable
to step between minimum and maximum dispense rates calculated based on a wrap
speed model at predetermined times relative to the corners. The dispense rate
calculated from an example wrap speed model is illustrated at 720, and as shown at
722, interventions may be applied to essentially switch between the maximum
calculated dispense rate for a corner at or a few degrees after the contact with that
corner, and then switch to the minimum calculated dispense rate for that corner a
few degrees after the peak has passed.
            [00172]   In general an intervention may be used to effectively modify a
wrap speed model to improve performance, e.g., by improving containment force
and/or reducing the risk of breakage. In many instances, some interventions may be
selected to increase force immediately prior to a corner and increase containment
force, while other interventions may be selected to relieve force immediately after a
corner contact to reduce breakage risk and otherwise ensure that wrap forces built
up in the corner are not wasted after the corner contact has occurred. It will be
                                           48

appreciated that multiple interventions may be applied or combined, and that
different interventions may be applied to different corners or at different times in the
wrapping operation, and that interventions may be tailored for particular corners
based on the dimensions of the load. In addition, it will be appreciated that
interventions may be applied to wrap models other than effective circumference
based wrap speed models, e.g., wrap force models.
                                    Rotational Data Shift
             [00173]   In addition to or in lieu of a controlled intervention, it may also be
desired to account for system lags through the use of a rotational shift of the data
utilized by a wrap speed model. As discussed above, electrical and physical delays
in sensors, drive motors, control circuitry and even the packaging material
necessarily introduce a system lag, such that a desired dispense rate at a particular
rotational position of the load, as calculated by a wrap speed model, will not occur at
the load until after some duration of time or further angular rotation.
             [00174]   To address this issue, a rotational shift typically may be applied
to the sensed data used by the wrap speed model or to the calculated dimensions or
position of the load, which in either case has the net effect of advancing the wrap
speed model to an earlier point in time or rotational position such that the actual
dispense rate at the load will more closely line up with that calculated by the wrap
speed model, thereby aligning the phase of the profile of the actual dispense rate
with that of the desired dispense rate calculated by the wrap speed model.
             [00175]   In some embodiments, the system lag from which the rotational
shift may be calculated may be a fixed value determined empirically for a particular
wrapping apparatus. In other embodiments, the system lag may have both fixed and
variable components, and as such, may be derived based upon one or more
operating conditions of the wrapping apparatus. For example, a controller will
typically have a fairly repeatable electronic delay associated with computational and
communication costs, which may be assumed in many instances to be a fixed delay.
In contrast, the rotational inertia of packaging material dispenser components,
different packaging material thicknesses and compositions, and the wrapping speed
(e.g., in terms of revolutions per minute of the load) may contribute variable delays
                                               49

depending upon the current operating condition of a wrapping apparatus. As such,
in some embodiments, the system lag may be empirically determined or may be
calculated as a function of one or more operating characteristics.
             [00176]     As shown in Fig. 24A, for example, a calculated wrap speed
model may calculate a desired dispense rate having a profile 714, yet due to system
lag, if that profile is applied to control the dispense rate of a packaging material
dispenser, the actual profile 716a may be delayed relative to the desired profile 714.
By accounting for system lag and providing a rotational shift such that the dispense
rate is applied based on a dispense rate control signal having a rotationally shifted
profile 718 as shown in Fig. 24B, the resulting actual profile 716b more closely
approximates the desired profile 714.
             [00177]     A rotational shift may be performed, for example, in the manner
illustrated by process 720 of Fig. 25, which is similar to process 680 of Fig. 21.
Process 720 may begin in block 722 by determining the geometry of the load, e.g.,
the dimensions, offset and/or corner locations. In one embodiment, for example, an
initial revolution of the load may be performed, while in another embodiment, the
dimensions of the load may be input or retrieved from a database. Alternatively, the
geometry may be determined during wrapping via any of the sensed inputs
discussed above.
             [00178]     Next, in block 724, the system lag is determined. In some
embodiments, the system lag may be a fixed value, and in other embodiments, the
system lag may be a variable value that may be calculated, for example, based on
wrapping speed. In still other embodiments, system lag may be determined
dynamically during wrapping, e.g., so that a system lag determined during one
revolution is used to perform a rotational shift in one or more subsequent revolutions.
             [00179]     Next, process 720 proceeds by tracking the corner contact angle
for a next corner in block 726, determining the current rotational position of the load
in block 728 (e.g., using an angle sensor such as angle sensor 152 of Fig. 1), and
then performing a rotational shift of either the corner contact angle (by subtracting
from the calculated corner contact angle) or the current rotational position of the load
(by adding to the sensed rotational position) to offset the system lag in block 730.
                                               50

Thereafter, block 732 determines whether the corner contact angle for the next
corner has been reached, but in this case, the comparison incorporates the rotational
shift such that the corner contact is detected earlier than would otherwise occur
based on the wrap speed model.
            [00180]   So long as the corner contact has not yet been detected, block
732 passes control to block 734 to control the dispense rate based on the effective
consumption rate calculated from the location of the current corner, and control
returns to block 726. In addition, based upon the rotational shift applied in block 730,
the wrap speed model is effectively advanced to offset the system lag.
            [00181]   Returning to block 732, if corner contact has been detected,
control is passed to block 736 to set the current corner to the next corner, such that
when control is passed to block 734, the next corner, now the new current corner, is
used to determine the dispense rate, again with the rotational shift accounted for in
the wrap speed model.
            [00182]   Rotational shifts may also be applied in other manners
consistent with the invention. For example, through positioning of a sensorsuch as a
load distance sensor at an earlier rotational position, e.g., shifted a few degrees in
advance of a base or home position, the sensor data may be treated as if it were
collected at the base or home position to apply a rotational shift to the model.
                                        Conclusion
            [00183]   Embodiments of the invention may be used, for example, to
increase containment force applied to a load by packaging material, and moreover,
reduce fluctuations in wrap force that may occur during a wrapping operation,
particularly at higher wrapping speeds. By reducing force fluctuations, the difference
between the maximum applied wrap forces, which might otherwise cause packaging
material breakages, and the minimum applied wrap forces, which affect the overall
containment force that may be achieved, may be reduced, enabling improved
containment forces to be achieved with reduced risk of breakages. In many
instances, reducing the force fluctuations will permit higher containment forces to be
obtained with thinner packaging material, with increased prestretch and/or with less
                                            51

packaging material (e.g., through the use of fewer layers). In many instances,
containment forces are more consistent across all corners and sides of the load .
           [00184]    It is also contemplated that any sequence or combination of the
above-described methods may be performed during the wrapping of one or more
loads. For example, while wrapping a load, one method may be performed, whereas
while wrapping another load, another method may be performed. Additionally or
alternatively, while wrapping a single load, two or more of the three methods may be
performed. One method may be performed during one portion of the wrapping cycle,
and another method may be performed during another portion of the wrapping cycle.
Additionally or alternatively, one load may be wrapped using a first combination of
methods, while another load may be wrapped using a second combination of
methods (e.g., a different combination of methods, and/or a different sequence of
methods).

         the load and the packaging material dispenser about the center of rotation;
         and
                 a controller coupled to the angle sensor and configured to control a
         dispense rate of the packaging material dispenser based at least in part on a
         geometric relationship between the packaging material dispenser and a
         current corner of the load to which the packaging material is currently
         engaging during the relative rotation and determined using the sensed
         angular relationship, determine when the packaging material will engage a
         next corner of the load using the sensed angular relationship, and control the
         dispense rate based at least in part on a geometric relationship between the
         packaging material dispenser and the next corner of the load after the
         packaging material engages the next corner of the load and determined using
         the sensed angular relationship.
         11.     The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the controller is further configured
to initiate a controlled intervention in response to determining when the packaging
material will engage a next corner of the load.
         12.     The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the controlled intervention
decreases the dispensing rate below a predicted demand immediately in advance of
contact between the packaging material and the corner during the relative rotation to
increase a wrap force captured by the corner.
         13.     The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the controlled intervention
increases the dispensing rate above a predicted demand immediately subsequent to
                                              55

contact between the packaging material and the corner during the relative rotation to
reduce a wrap force incurred by the corner.
       14.    The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the controlled intervention
decreases the dispensing rate below a predicted demand proximate contact between
the packaging material and the corner during the relative rotation to produce a force
spike in the packaging material proximate the contact.
       15.    The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the controller is further configured
to compensate for system lag by rotationally shifting collected in response to
determining when the packaging material will engage a next corner of the load.
       16.    An apparatus configured to perform the method of any of claims 1 to 9.
       17.    A method of wrapping a load with packaging material using the
apparatus of any of claims 10 to 15.
