                                      Technical Field
         The invention relates to the field of therapeutic agent delivery using lipid
particles. In particular, the invention provides cationic lipids and lipid particles
comprising these lipids, which are advantageous for the in vivo delivery of nucleic
acids, as well as nucleic acid-lipid particle compositions suitable for in vivo
therapeutic use. Additionally, the invention provides methods of preparing these
compositions, as well as methods of introducing nucleic acids into cells using these
compositions, e.g., for the treatment of various disease conditions.
                             Description of the Related Art
         Therapeutic nucleic acids include, e.g., small interfering RNA (siRNA), micro
RNA (miRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, plasmids, and immune
stimulating nucleic acids. These nucleic acids act via a variety of mechanisms. In the
case of siRNA or miRNA, these nucleic acids can down-regulate intracellular levels
of specific proteins through a process termed RNA interference (RNAi). Following
introduction of siRNA or miRNA into the cell cytoplasm, these double-stranded RNA
constructs can bind to a protein termed RISC. The sense strand of the siRNA or
miRNA is displaced from the RISC complex providing a template within RISC that
can recognize and bind mRNA with a complementary sequence to that of the bound
siRNA or miRNA. Having bound the complementary mRNA the RISC complex
cleaves the mRNA and releases the cleaved strands. RNAi can provide down
regulation of specific proteins by targeting specific destruction of the corresponding
mRNA that encodes for protein synthesis.
                                                 - 1-

  WO 2010/088537                                                           PCT/US2010/022614
          The therapeutic applications of RNAi are extremely broad, since siRNA and
miRNA constructs can be synthesized with any nucleotide sequence directed against a
target protein. To date, siRNA constructs have shown the ability to specifically
down-regulate target proteins in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, siRNA
constructs are currently being evaluated in clinical studies.
          However, two problems currently faced by siRNA or miRNA constructs are,
first, their susceptibility to nuclease digestion in plasma and, second, their limited
ability to gain access to the intracellular compartment where they can bind RISC
when administered systemically as the free siRNA or miRNA. These double-stranded
constructs can be stabilized by incorporation of chemically modified nucleotide
linkers within the molecule, for example, phosphothioate groups. However, these
chemical modifications provide only limited protection from nuclease digestion and
may decrease the activity of the construct. Intracellular delivery of siRNA or miRNA
can be facilitated by use of carrier systems such as polymers, cationic liposomes or by
chemical modification of the construct, for example by the covalent attachment of
cholesterol molecules. However, improved delivery systems are required to increase
the potency of siRNA and miRNA molecules and reduce or eliminate the requirement
for chemical modification.
          Antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes can also inhibit mRNA translation
into protein. In the case of antisense constructs, these single stranded deoxynucleic
acids have a complementary sequence to that of the target protein mRNA and can
bind to the mRNA by Watson-Crick base pairing. This binding either prevents
translation of the target mRNA and/or triggers RNase H degradation of the mRNA
transcripts. Consequently, antisense oligonucleotides have tremendous potential for
specificity of action (i.e., down-regulation of a specific disease-related protein). To
date, these compounds have shown promise in several in vitro and in vivo models,
including models of inflammatory disease, cancer, and HIV (reviewed in Agrawal,
Trends in Biotech. 14:376-387 (1996)). Antisense can also affect cellular activity by
hybridizing specifically with chromosomal DNA. Advanced human clinical
assessments of several antisense drugs are currently underway. Targets for these
drugs include the bcl2 and apolipoprotein B genes and mRNA products.

        One well known problem with the use of therapeutic nucleic acids relates to
the stability of the phosphodiester internucleotide linkage and the susceptibility of this
linker to nucleases. The presence of exonucleases and endonucleases in serum results
in the rapid digestion of nucleic acids possessing phosphodiester linkers and, hence,
therapeutic nucleic acids can have very short half-lives in the presence of serum or
within cells. (Zelphati, 0., et al., Antisense. Res. Dev. 3:323-338 (1993); and Thierry,
A.R., et al., ppl47-161 in Gene Regulation: Biology of Antisense RNA and DNA
(Eds. Erickson, RP and Izant, JG; Raven Press, NY (1992)). Therapeutic nucleic acid
being currently being developed do not employ the basic phosphodiester chemistry
found in natural nucleic acids, because of these and other known problems.
        This problem has been partially overcome by chemical modifications that
reduce serum or intracellular degradation. Modifications have been tested at the
internucleotide phosphodiester bridge (e.g., using phosphorothioate,
methylphosphonate or phosphoramidate linkages), at the nucleotide base (e.g., 5
propynyl-pyrimidines), or at the sugar (e.g., 2'-modified sugars) (Uhlmann E., et al.
Antisense: Chemical Modifications. Encyclopedia of Cancer, Vol. X., pp 64-81
Academic Press Inc. (1997)). Others have attempted to improve stability using 2'-5'
sugar linkages (see, e.g., US Pat. No. 5,532,130). Other changes have been
attempted. However, none of these solutions have proven entirely satisfactory, and in
vivo free therapeutic nucleic acids still have only limited efficacy.
        In addition, as noted above relating to siRNA and miRNA, problems remain
with the limited ability of therapeutic nucleic acids to cross cellular membranes (see,
Vlassov, et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1197:95-1082 (1994)) and in the problems
associated with systemic toxicity, such as complement-mediated anaphylaxis, altered
coagulatory properties, and cytopenia (Galbraith, et al., Antisense Nucl. Acid Drug
Des. 4:201-206 (1994)).
        In spite of recent progress, there remains a need in the art for improved lipid
therapeutic nucleic acid compositions that are suitable for general therapeutic use.
Preferably, these compositions would encapsulate nucleic acids with high-efficiency,
have high drug:lipid ratios, protect the encapsulated nucleic acid from degradation
and clearance in serum, be suitable for systemic delivery, and provide intracellular
                                                 -3-

delivery of the encapsulated nucleic acid. In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid
particles should be well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that
patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with
significant toxicity and/or risk to the patient. The invention provides such
compositions, methods of making the compositions, and methods of using the
compositions to introduce nucleic acids into cells, including for the treatment of
diseases.

         In some embodiments, the targeting lipid is present in the formulation in an
amount of from about 0.001% to about 5% (e.g., about 0.005%, 0.15%, 0.3%, 0.5%,
1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 4%, or 5%) on a molar basis. In some embodiments, the
targeting lipid is included in a formulation described herein such as LNP05 or LNP08.
         In some embodiments, the lipid formulation also included an antioxidant (e.g.,
a radical scavenger). The antioxidant can be present in the formulation, for example,
at an amound from about 0.01% to about 5%. The antioxidant can be hydrophobic or
hydrophilic (e.g., soluble in lipids or soluble in water). In some embodiments, the
antioxidant is a phenolic compound, for example, butylhydroxytoluene, resveratrol,
coenzyme Q1O, or other flavinoids, or a vitamin, for example, vitamin E or vitamin C.
Other exemplary antioxidants include lipoic acid, uric acid, a carotene such as beta
carotene or retinol (vitamin A), glutathione, melatonin, selenium, and ubiquinol.
         In some embodiments, the receptor for the targeting lipid (e.g., a GalNAc
containing lipid) is the asialoglycoprotein receptor (i.e., ASGPR).

        In one embodiment, the formulations of the invention are produced via an
extrusion method or an in-line mixing method.
        The extrusion method (also refer to as preformed method or batch process) is a
method where the empty liposomes (i.e. no nucleic acid) are prepared first, followed
by the the addition of nucleic acid to the empty liposome. Extrusion of liposome
compositions through a small-pore polycarbonate membrane or an asymmetric
ceramic membrane results in a relatively well-defined size distribution. Typically, the
suspension is cycled through the membrane one or more times until the desired
liposome complex size distribution is achieved. The liposomes may be extruded
through successively smaller-pore membranes, to achieve a gradual reduction in
liposome size. In some instances, the lipid-nucleic acid compositions which are
formed can be used without any sizing. These methods are disclosed in the US
5,008,050; US 4,927,637; US 4,737,323; Biochim Biophys Acta. 1979 Oct
19;557(1):9-23; Biochim Biophys Acta. 1980 Oct 2;601(3):559-7; Biochim Biophys
Acta. 1986 Jun 13;858(1):161-8; and Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1985 812, 55-65, which
are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
        The in-line mixing method is a method wherein both the lipids and the nucleic
acid are added in parallel into a mixing chamber. The mixing chamber can be a
simple T-connector or any other mixing chamber that is known to one skill in the art.
These methods are disclosed in US patent nos. 6,534,018 and US 6,855,277; US
publication 2007/0042031 and PharmaceuticalsResearch, Vol. 22, No. 3, Mar. 2005,
p. 362-372, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
        It is further understood that the formulations of the invention can be prepared
by any methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.
        In a further embodiment, representative formulations prepared via the
extrusion method are delineated in Table 1, wherein Lipid A is a compound of
formula A, where R 1 and R 2 are linoleyl and R 3 and R4 are methyl, i.e., 2,2
Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminoethyl-[1,3]-dioxolane.      References to "Lipid A"
throughout the application, for example, in other tables and in the Examples, refer to
this same lipid of formula A, where R 1 and R 2 are linoleyl and R 3 and R 4 are methyl,
unless explicitly otherwise defined.

the scope of the invention.
        In certain embodiments, the apolipoprotein can be a fragment, variant or
isoform of the apolipoprotein. The term "fragment" refers to any apolipoprotein
having an amino acid sequence shorter than that of a native apolipoprotein and which
fragment retains the activity of native apolipoprotein, including lipid binding
properties. By "variant" is meant substitutions or alterations in the amino acid
sequences of the apolipoprotein, which substitutions or alterations, e.g., additions and
deletions of amino acid residues, do not abolish the activity of native apolipoprotein,
including lipid binding properties. Thus, a variant can comprise a protein or peptide
having a substantially identical amino acid sequence to a native apolipoprotein
provided herein in which one or more amino acid residues have been conservatively
substituted with chemically similar amino acids. Examples of conservative
substitutions include the substitution of at least one hydrophobic residue such as
isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another. Likewise, the present invention
contemplates, for example, the substitution of at least one hydrophilic residue such as,
for example, between arginine and lysine, between glutamine and asparagine, and
between glycine and serine (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,925, 6,037,323 and 6,046,166).
The term "isoform" refers to a protein having the same, greater or partial function and
similar, identical or partial sequence, and may or may not be the product of the same
gene and usually tissue specific (see Weisgraber 1990, J. Lipid Res. 31(8):1503-11;

         In certain embodiments, the methods and compositions of the present
invention include the use of a chimeric construction of an apolipoprotein. For
example, a chimeric construction of an apolipoprotein can be comprised of an
apolipoprotein domain with high lipid binding capacity associated with an
apolipoprotein domain containing ischemia reperfusion protective properties. A
chimeric construction of an apolipoprotein can be a construction that includes separate
regions within an apolipoprotein (i.e., homologous construction) or a chimeric
construction can be a construction that includes separate regions between different
apolipoproteins (i.e., heterologous constructions). Compositions comprising a
chimeric construction can also include segments that are apolipoprotein variants or
segments designed to have a specific character (e.g., lipid binding, receptor binding,
enzymatic, enzyme activating, antioxidant or reduction-oxidation property) (see

described in The Proteins, Vol. II, 3d Ed., Neurath et. al., Eds., p. 105-237, Academic
Press, New York, N.Y. (1976). Appropriate protective groups for use in different
peptide syntheses are described in the above-mentioned texts as well as in McOmie,
Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press, New York, N.Y. (1973). The
peptides of the present invention might also be prepared by chemical or enzymatic
cleavage from larger portions of, for example, apolipoprotein A-I.
         In certain embodiments, the apolipoprotein can be a mixture of
apolipoproteins. In one embodiment, the apolipoprotein can be a homogeneous
mixture, that is, a single type of apolipoprotein. In another embodiment, the
apolipoprotein can be a heterogeneous mixture of apolipoproteins, that is, a mixture of
two or more different apolipoproteins. Embodiments of heterogenous mixtures of

apolipoproteins can comprise, for example, a mixture of an apolipoprotein from an
animal source and an apolipoprotein from a semi-synthetic source. In certain
embodiments, a heterogenous mixture can comprise, for example, a mixture of ApoA
I and ApoA-I Milano. In certain embodiments, a heterogeneous mixture can comprise,
for example, a mixture of ApoA-I Milano and ApoA-I Paris. Suitable mixtures for use
in the methods and compositions of the invention will be apparent to one of skill in
the art.
         If the apolipoprotein is obtained from natural sources, it can be obtained from
a plant or animal source. If the apolipoprotein is obtained from an animal source, the
apolipoprotein can be from any species. In certain embodiments, the apolipoprotien
can be obtained from an animal source. In certain embodiments, the apolipoprotein
can be obtained from a human source. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the
apolipoprotein is derived from the same species as the individual to which the
apolipoprotein is administered.

MIB I gene, MTAI gene, M68 gene, mutations in tumor suppressor genes, p53
tumor suppressor gene, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment the target gene
is a gene expressed in the liver, e.g., the Factor VII (FVII) gene. The effect of the
expression of the target gene, e.g., FVII, is evaluated by measuring FVII levels in a
biological sample, such as a serum or tissue sample. For example, the level of FVII,
e.g., as measured by assay of FVII activity, in blood can be determined.           In one
embodiment, the level of mRNA in the liver can be evaluated. In another preferred
embodiment, at least two types of evaluation are made, e.g., an evaluation of protein
level (e.g., in blood), and a measure of mRNA level (e.g., in the liver) are both made.

RNA (dsRNA).
         In another embodiment, the nucleic acid agent is a single-stranded DNA or
RNA, or double-stranded DNA or RNA, or DNA-RNA hybrid. For example, a
double-stranded DNA can be a structural gene, a gene including control and
termination regions, or a self-replicating system such as a viral or plasmid DNA. A
double-stranded RNA can be, e.g., a dsRNA or another RNA interference reagent. A
single-stranded nucleic acid can be, e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide, ribozyme,
microRNA, or triplex-forming oligonucleotide.
         In yet another embodiment, at various time points after administration of a
candidate agent, a biological sample, such as a fluid sample, e.g., blood, plasma, or
serum, or a tissue sample, such as a liver sample, is taken from the test subject and
tested for an effect of the agent on target protein or mRNA expression levels. In one
particularly preferred embodiment, the candidate agent is a dsRNA that targets FVII,
and the biological sample is tested for an effect on Factor VII protein or mRNA
levels. In one embodiment, plasma levels of FVII protein are assayed, such as by
using an immunohistochemistry assay or a chromogenic assay. In another
embodiment, levels of FVII mRNA in the liver are tested by an assay, such as a
branched DNA assay, or a Northern blot or RT-PCR assay.
         In one embodiment, the agent, e.g., a composition including the improved
lipid formulation, is evaluated for toxicity. In yet another embodiment, the model
subject can be monitored for physical effects, such as by a change in weight or
cageside behavior.
         In one embodiment, the method further includes subjecting the agent, e.g., a
composition comprising the improved lipid formulation, to a further evaluation. The
further evaluation can include, for example, (i) a repetition of the evaluation described
above, (ii) a repetition of the evaluation described above with a different number of
animals or with different doses, or (iii) by a different method, e.g., evaluation in
another animal model, e.g., a non-human primate.
         In another embodiment, a decision is made regarding whether or not to include
the agent and the improved lipid formulation in further studies, such as in a clinical

trial, depending on the observed effect of the candidate agent on liver protein or
mRNA levels. For example, if a candidate dsRNA is observed to decrease protein or
mRNA levels by at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, or more, then the agent can be
considered for a clinical trial.
         In yet another embodiment, a decision is made regarding whether or not to
include the agent and the improved lipid formulation in a pharmaceutical
composition, depending on the observed effect of the candidate agent and amino lipid
on liver protein or mRNA levels. For example, if a candidate dsRNA is observed to
decrease protein or mRNA levels by at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, or more, then the
agent can be considered for a clinical trial.
         In another aspect, the invention features a method of evaluating the improved
lipid formulation for its suitability for delivering an RNA-based construct, e.g., a
dsRNA that targets FVII. The method includes providing a composition that includes
a dsRNA that targets FVII and a candidate amino lipid, administering the composition
to a rodent, e.g., a mouse, evaluating the expression of FVII as a function of at least
one of the level of FVII in the blood or the level of FVII mRNA in the liver, thereby
evaluating the candidate amino lipid.
         Compositions that include lipid containing components, such as a liposome,
and these are described in greater detail below. Exemplary nucleic acid-based agents
include dsRNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, microRNAs,
immunostimulatory oligonucleotides, or triplex-forming oligonucleotides. These
agents are also described in greater detail below.

         In some embodiments, the methods of the invention may require the use of
protecting groups. Protecting group methodology is well known to those skilled in
the art (see, for example, PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS, Green, T.W.
et. al., Wiley-Interscience, New York City, 1999). Briefly, protecting groups within
the context of this invention are any group that reduces or eliminates unwanted
reactivity of a functional group. A protecting group can be added to a functional
group to mask its reactivity during certain reactions and then removed to reveal the
original functional group. In some embodiments an "alcohol protecting group" is
used. An "alcohol protecting group" is any group which decreases or eliminates
unwanted reactivity of an alcohol functional group. Protecting groups can be added
and removed using techniques well known in the art.

         The amino lipids are of the invention are cationic lipids. As used herein, the
term "amino lipid" is meant to include those lipids having one or two fatty acid or
fatty alkyl chains and an amino head group (including an alkylamino or dialkylamino
group) that may be protonated to form a cationic lipid at physiological pH.
         Other amino lipids would include those having alternative fatty acid groups
and other dialkylamino groups, including those in which the alkyl substituents are
different (e.g., N-ethyl-N-methylamino-, N-propyl-N-ethylamino- and the like). For
those embodiments in which R11 and R12 are both long chain alkyl or acyl groups,
they can be the same or different. In general, amino lipids having less saturated acyl
chains are more easily sized, particularly when the complexes must be sized below
about 0.3 microns, for purposes of filter sterilization. Amino lipids containing
unsaturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of C14 to C 22 are
preferred. Other scaffolds can also be used to separate the amino group and the fatty
acid or fatty alkyl portion of the amino lipid. Suitable scaffolds are known to those of
skill in the art.

         In certain embodiments, amino or cationic lipids of the invention have at least
one protonatable or deprotonatable group, such that the lipid is positively charged at a
pH at or below physiological pH (e.g. pH 7.4), and neutral at a second pH, preferably
at or above physiological pH. It will, of course, be understood that the addition or
removal of protons as a function of pH is an equilibrium process, and that the
reference to a charged or a neutral lipid refers to the nature of the predominant species
and does not require that all of the lipid be present in the charged or neutral form.
Lipids that have more than one protonatable or deprotonatable group, or which are
zwiterrionic, are not excluded from use in the invention.
         In certain embodiments, protonatable lipids according to the invention have a
pKa of the protonatable group in the range of about 4 to about 11. Most preferred is
pKa of about 4 to about 7, because these lipids will be cationic at a lower pH
formulation stage, while particles will be largely (though not completely) surface
neutralized at physiological pH around pH 7.4. One of the benefits of this pKa is that
at least some nucleic acid associated with the outside surface of the particle will lose
its electrostatic interaction at physiological pH and be removed by simple dialysis;
thus greatly reducing the particle's susceptibility to clearance.

          Lipid Particles
          The agents and/or amino lipids for testing in the liver screening model
featured herein can be formulated in lipid particles.        Lipid particles include, but are
not limited to, liposomes. As used herein, a liposome is a structure having lipid
containing membranes enclosing an aqueous interior. Liposomes may have one or
more lipid membranes. The invention contemplates both single-layered liposomes,
which are referred to as unilamellar, and multi-layered liposomes, which are referred
to as multilamellar. When complexed with nucleic acids, lipid particles may also be
lipoplexes, which are composed of cationic lipid bilayers sandwiched between DNA
layers, as described, e.g., in Felgner, Scientific American.
          Lipid particles may further include one or more additional lipids and/or other
components such as cholesterol. Other lipids may be included in the liposome
compositions for a variety of purposes, such as to prevent lipid oxidation or to attach
ligands onto the liposome surface. Any of a number of lipids may be present,
including amphipathic, neutral, cationic, and anionic lipids. Such lipids can be used
                                                 - 34 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                             PCT/US2010/022614
alone or in combination. Specific examples of additional lipid components that may
be present are described below.
         Additional components that may be present in a lipid particle include bilayer
stabilizing components such as polyamide oligomers (see, e.g., U.S. Patent
No. 6,320,017), peptides, proteins, detergents, lipid-derivatives, such as PEG coupled
to phosphatidylethanolamine and PEG conjugated to ceramides (see, U.S. Patent
No. 5,885,613).     In some embodiments, the lipid particle includes a targeting agent
such as a targeting lipid described herein.
         A lipid particle can include one or more of a second amino lipid or cationic
lipid, a neutral lipid, a sterol, and a lipid selected to reduce aggregation of lipid
particles during formation, which may result from steric stabilization of particles
which prevents charge-induced aggregation during formation.
         Examples of lipids suitable for conjugation to nucleic acid agents that can be
used in the liver screening model are polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified lipids,
monosialoganglioside Gml, and polyamide oligomers ("PAO") such as (described in
US Pat. No. 6,320,017). Other compounds with uncharged, hydrophilic, steric-barrier
moieties, which prevent aggregation during formulation, like PEG, Gml or ATTA,
can also be coupled to lipids for use as in the methods and compositions of the
invention. ATTA-lipids are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 6,320,017, and PEG
lipid conjugates are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,820,873, 5,534,499 and
5,885,613. Typically, the concentration of the lipid component selected to reduce
aggregation is about 1 to 15% (by mole percent of lipids).
         Specific examples of PEG-modified lipids (or lipid-polyoxyethylene
conjugates) that are useful in the invention can have a variety of "anchoring" lipid
portions to secure the PEG portion to the surface of the lipid vesicle. Examples of
suitable PEG-modified lipids include PEG-modified phosphatidylethanolamine and
phosphatidic acid, PEG-ceramide conjugates (e.g., PEG-CerC14 or PEG-CerC20)
which are described in co-pending USSN 08/486,214, incorporated herein by
reference, PEG-modified dialkylamines and PEG-modified 1,2-diacyloxypropan-3
                                                   - 35 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                           PCT/US2010/022614
amines. Particularly preferred are PEG-modified diacylglycerols and
dialkylglycerols. In some embodiments, the total mol% of PEG lipids within a
particle is about 1.5 mol%. For example, when the particle includes a plurality of
PEG lipids described herein such as a PEG-modified lipid as described above and a
targeting lipid containing a PEG, the total amount of the PEG containing lipids when
taken together is about 1.5 mol%.
         In embodiments where a sterically-large moiety such as PEG or ATTA are
conjugated to a lipid anchor, the selection of the lipid anchor depends on what type of
association the conjugate is to have with the lipid particle. It is well known that
mePEG (mw2000)-diastearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-DSPE) will remain
associated with a liposome until the particle is cleared from the circulation, possibly a
matter of days. Other conjugates, such as PEG-CerC20 have similar staying capacity.
PEG-CerC14, however, rapidly exchanges out of the formulation upon exposure to
serum, with a T 12 less than 60 mins. in some assays. As illustrated in US Pat.
Application SN 08/486,214, at least three characteristics influence the rate of
exchange: length of acyl chain, saturation of acyl chain, and size of the steric-barrier
head group. Compounds having suitable variations of these features may be useful
for the invention. For some therapeutic applications it may be preferable for the PEG
modified lipid to be rapidly lost from the nucleic acid-lipid particle in vivo and hence
the PEG-modified lipid will possess relatively short lipid anchors. In other
therapeutic applications it may be preferable for the nucleic acid-lipid particle to
exhibit a longer plasma circulation lifetime and hence the PEG-modified lipid will
possess relatively longer lipid anchors. Exemplary lipid anchors include those having
lengths of from about C 14 to about C 22, preferably from about C 14 to about C16. In
some embodiments, a PEG moiety, for example an mPEG-NH 2 , has a size of about
 1000, 2000, 5000, 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 daltons.
         It should be noted that aggregation preventing compounds do not necessarily
require lipid conjugation to function properly. Free PEG or free ATTA in solution
                                                - 36-

  WO 2010/088537                                                            PCT/US2010/022614
may be sufficient to prevent aggregation. If the particles are stable after formulation,
the PEG or ATTA can be dialyzed away before administration to a subject.
         Neutral lipids, when present in the lipid particle, can be any of a number of
lipid species which exist either in an uncharged or neutral zwitterionic form at
physiological pH. Such lipids include, for example diacylphosphatidylcholine,
diacylphosphatidylethanolamine, ceramide, sphingomyelin, dihydrosphingomyelin,
cephalin, and cerebrosides. The selection of neutral lipids for use in the particles
described herein is generally guided by consideration of, e.g., liposome size and
stability of the liposomes in the bloodstream. Preferably, the neutral lipid component
is a lipid having two acyl groups, (i.e., diacylphosphatidylcholine and
diacylphosphatidylethanolamine). Lipids having a variety of acyl chain groups of
varying chain length and degree of saturation are available or may be isolated or
synthesized by well-known techniques. In one group of embodiments, lipids
containing saturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of C 14 to C 22
are preferred. In another group of embodiments, lipids with mono or diunsaturated
fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of C 14 to C 22 are used. Additionally,
lipids having mixtures of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid chains can be used.
Preferably, the neutral lipids used in the invention are DOPE, DSPC, DPPC, POPC,
or any related phosphatidylcholine. The neutral lipids useful in the invention may
also be composed of sphingomyelin, dihydrosphingomyeline, or phospholipids with
other head groups, such as serine and inositol.
         The sterol component of the lipid mixture, when present, can be any of those
sterols conventionally used in the field of liposome, lipid vesicle or lipid particle
preparation. A preferred sterol is cholesterol.
         Other cationic lipids, which carry a net positive charge at about physiological
pH, in addition to those specifically described above, may also be included in lipid
particles of the invention. Such cationic lipids include, but are not limited to, N,N
dioleyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride ("DODAC"); N-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl
N,N-N-triethylammonium chloride ("DOTMA"); N,N-distearyl-N,N

dimyristyloxyprop-3-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-N-hydroxyethyl ammonium bromide
("DMRIE"). Additionally, a number of commercial preparations of cationic lipids can
be used, such as, e.g., LIPOFECTIN (including DOTMA and DOPE, available from
GIBCO/BRL), and LIPOFECTAMINE (comprising DOSPA and DOPE, available
from GIBCO/BRL).        In particular embodiments, a cationic lipid is an amino lipid.
        Anionic lipids suitable for use in lipid particles of the invention include, but
are not limited to, phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, diacylphosphatidylserine,
diacylphosphatidic acid, N-dodecanoyl phosphatidylethanoloamine, N-succinyl
phosphatidylethanolamine, N-glutaryl phosphatidylethanolamine,
lysylphosphatidylglycerol, and other anionic modifying groups joined to neutral
lipids.
        In numerous embodiments, amphipathic lipids are included in lipid particles of
the invention. "Amphipathic lipids" refer to any suitable material, wherein the
hydrophobic portion of the lipid material orients into a hydrophobic phase, while the
hydrophilic portion orients toward the aqueous phase. Such compounds include, but
are not limited to, phospholipids, aminolipids, and sphingolipids. Representative
phospholipids include sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine,
phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic
acid, palmitoyloleoyl phosphatdylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine,
lysophosphatidylethanolamine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC),
dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), or
                                                -38-

  WO 2010/088537                                                             PCT/US2010/022614
dilinoleylphosphatidylcholine. Other phosphorus-lacking compounds, such as
sphingolipids, glycosphingolipid families, diacylglycerols, and -acyloxyacids, can
also be used. Additionally, such amphipathic lipids can be readily mixed with other
lipids, such as triglycerides and sterols.
         Also suitable for inclusion in the lipid particles of the invention are
programmable fusion lipids. Such lipid particles have little tendency to fuse with cell
membranes and deliver their payload until a given signal event occurs. This allows
the lipid particle to distribute more evenly after injection into an organism or disease
site before it starts fusing with cells. The signal event can be, for example, a change
in pH, temperature, ionic environment, or time. In the latter case, a fusion delaying or
"cloaking" component, such as an ATTA-lipid conjugate or a PEG-lipid conjugate,
can simply exchange out of the lipid particle membrane over time. Exemplary lipid
anchors include those having lengths of from about C 14 to about C22, preferably from
about C 14 to about C16 . In some embodiments, a PEG moiety, for example an mPEG
NH 2, has a size of about 1000, 2000, 5000, 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 daltons.
         By the time the lipid particle is suitably distributed in the body, it has lost
sufficient cloaking agent so as to be fusogenic. With other signal events, it is
desirable to choose a signal that is associated with the disease site or target cell, such
as increased temperature at a site of inflammation.
         A lipid particle conjugated to a nucleic acid agent can also include a targeting
moiety, e.g., a targeting moiety that is specific to a cell type or tissue. Targeting of
lipid particles using a variety of targeting moieties, such as ligands, cell surface
receptors, glycoproteins, vitamins (e.g., riboflavin) and monoclonal antibodies, has
been previously described (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,957,773 and 4,603,044).
Exexmplary targeting moieties include a targeting lipid such as a targeting lipid
described herein. In some embodiments, the targeting lipid is a GalNAc containing
targeting lipid such as GalNAc3-DSG and GalNAc3-PEG-DSG as described herein.
The targeting moieties can include the entire protein or fragments thereof. Targeting
mechanisms generally require that the targeting agents be positioned on the surface of
                                                 - 39 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                             PCT/US2010/022614
the lipid particle in such a manner that the targeting moiety is available for interaction
with the target, for example, a cell surface receptor. A variety of different targeting
agents and methods are known and available in the art, including those described, e.g.,
in Sapra, P. and Allen, TM, Prog.Lipid Res. 42(5):439-62 (2003); and Abra, RM et
al., J. Liposome Res. 12:1-3, (2002).
         The use of lipid particles, i.e., liposomes, with a surface coating of hydrophilic
polymer chains, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, for targeting has been
proposed (Allen, et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1237: 99-108 (1995); DeFrees,
et al., Journalof the American Chemistry Society 118: 6101-6104 (1996); Blume, et
al., Biochimica et BiophysicaActa 1149: 180-184 (1993); Klibanov, et al., Journalof
Liposome Research 2: 321-334 (1992); U.S. Patent No. 5,013556; Zalipsky,
Bioconjugate Chemistry 4: 296-299 (1993); Zalipsky, FEBS Letters 353: 71-74
(1994); Zalipsky, in Stealth Liposomes Chapter 9 (Lasic and Martin, Eds) CRC Press,
Boca Raton Fl (1995). In one approach, a ligand, such as an antibody, for targeting
the lipid particle is linked to the polar head group of lipids forming the lipid particle.
In another approach, the targeting ligand is attached to the distal ends of the PEG
chains forming the hydrophilic polymer coating (Klibanov, et al., Journalof
Liposome Research 2: 321-334 (1992); Kirpotin et al., FEBS Letters 388: 115-118
(1996)).
         Standard methods for coupling the target agents can be used. For example,
phosphatidylethanolamine, which can be activated for attachment of target agents, or
derivatized lipophilic compounds, such as lipid-derivatized bleomycin, can be used.
Antibody-targeted liposomes can be constructed using, for instance, liposomes that
incorporate protein A (see, Renneisen, et al., J. Bio. Chem., 265:16337-16342 (1990)
and Leonetti, et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 87:2448-2451 (1990). Other
examples of antibody conjugation are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,027,726, the
teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Examples of targeting
moieties can also include other proteins, specific to cellular components, including
antigens associated with neoplasms or tumors. Proteins used as targeting moieties can
                                                  - 40 -

         Therapeutic Agent-Lipid Particle Compositions and Formulations
         The invention includes compositions comprising a lipid particle of the
invention and an active agent, wherein the active agent is associated with the lipid
particle. In particular embodiments, the active agent is a therapeutic agent. In
particular embodiments, the active agent is encapsulated within an aqueous interior of
the lipid particle. In other embodiments, the active agent is present within one or
more lipid layers of the lipid particle. In other embodiments, the active agent is
bound to the exterior or interior lipid surface of a lipid particle.
         "Fully encapsulated" as used herein indicates that the nucleic acid in the
particles is not significantly degraded after exposure to serum or a nuclease assay that
would significantly degrade free DNA. In a fully encapsulated system, preferably less
than 25% of particle nucleic acid is degraded in a treatment that would normally
degrade 100% of free nucleic acid, more preferably less than 10% and most
preferably less than 5% of the particle nucleic acid is degraded. Alternatively, full
encapsulation may be determined by an Oligreen assay. Oligreen* is an ultra
sensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain for quantitating oligonucleotides and single
stranded DNA in solution (available from Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA).
Fully encapsulated also suggests that the particles are serum stable, that is, that they
do not rapidly decompose into their component parts upon in vivo administration.
         Active agents, as used herein, include any molecule or compound capable of
exerting a desired effect on a cell, tissue, organ, or subject. Such effects may be
biological, physiological, or cosmetic, for example. Active agents may be any type of
molecule or compound, including e.g., nucleic acids, peptides and polypeptides,
including, e.g., antibodies, such as, e.g., polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies,
antibody fragments; humanized antibodies, recombinant antibodies, recombinant

human antibodies, and PrimatizedTM antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, apoptotic
factors, differentiation-inducing factors, cell surface receptors and their ligands;
hormones; and small molecules, including small organic molecules or compounds.
         In one embodiment, the active agent is a therapeutic agent, or a salt or
derivative thereof. Therapeutic agent derivatives may be therapeutically active
themselves or they may be prodrugs, which become active upon further modification.
Thus, in one embodiment, a therapeutic agent derivative retains some or all of the
therapeutic activity as compared to the unmodified agent, while in another
embodiment, a therapeutic agent derivative lacks therapeutic activity.
         In various embodiments, therapeutic agents include any therapeutically
effective agent or drug, such as anti-inflammatory compounds, anti-depressants,
stimulants, analgesics, antibiotics, birth control medication, antipyretics, vasodilators,
anti-angiogenics, cytovascular agents, signal transduction inhibitors, cardiovascular
drugs, e.g., anti-arrhythmic agents, vasoconstrictors, hormones, and steroids.
         In certain embodiments, the therapeutic agent is an oncology drug, which may
also be referred to as an anti-tumor drug, an anti-cancer drug, a tumor drug, an
antineoplastic agent, or the like. Examples of oncology drugs that may be used
according to the invention include, but are not limited to, adriamycin, alkeran,

        Nucleic Acid-Lipid Particles
        In certain embodiments, lipid particles of the invention are associated with a
nucleic acid, resulting in a nucleic acid-lipid particle. In particular embodiments, the
nucleic acid is fully encapsulated in the lipid particle. As used herein, the term
"nucleic acid" is meant to include any oligonucleotide or polynucleotide. Fragments
containing up to 50 nucleotides are generally termed oligonucleotides, and longer
fragments are called polynucleotides. In particular embodiments, oligonucletoides of
the invention are 20-50 nucleotides in length.
        In the context of this invention, the terms "polynucleotide" and
"oligonucleotide" refer to a polymer or oligomer of nucleotide or nucleoside
monomers consisting of naturally occurring bases, sugars and intersugar (backbone)
linkages. The terms "polynucleotide" and "oligonucleotide" also includes polymers
or oligomers comprising non-naturally occurring monomers, or portions thereof,
which function similarly. Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often
preferred over native forms because of properties such as, for example, enhanced
cellular uptake and increased stability in the presence of nucleases.
        Oligonucleotides are classified as deoxyribooligonucleotides or
ribooligonucleotides. A deoxyribooligonucleotide consists of a 5-carbon sugar called
deoxyribose joined covalently to phosphate at the 5' and 3' carbons of this sugar to
form an alternating, unbranched polymer. A ribooligonucleotide consists of a similar
repeating structure where the 5-carbon sugar is ribose.

         The nucleic acid that is present in a lipid-nucleic acid particle according to this
invention includes any form of nucleic acid that is known. The nucleic acids used
herein can be single-stranded DNA or RNA, or double-stranded DNA or RNA, or
DNA-RNA hybrids. Examples of double-stranded DNA include structural genes,
genes including control and termination regions, and self-replicating systems such as
viral or plasmid DNA. Examples of double-stranded RNA include siRNA and other
RNA interference reagents. Single-stranded nucleic acids include, e.g., antisense
oligonucleotides, ribozymes, microRNA, and triplex-forming oligonucleotides.
         Nucleic acids of the invention may be of various lengths, generally dependent
upon the particular form of nucleic acid. For example, in particular embodiments,
plasmids or genes may be from about 1,000 to 100,000 nucleotide residues in length.
In particular embodiments, oligonucleotides may range from about 10 to 100
nucleotides in length. In various related embodiments, oligonucleotides, both single
stranded, double-stranded, and triple-stranded, may range in length from about 10 to
about 50 nucleotides, from about 20 o about 50 nucleotides, from about 15 to about
30 nucleotides, from about 20 to about 30 nucleotides in length.
         In particular embodiments, an oligonucleotide (or a strand thereof) of the
invention specifically hybridizes to or is complementary to a target polynucleotide.
"Specifically hybridizable" and "complementary" are terms which are used to indicate
a sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding occurs
between the DNA or RNA target and the oligonucleotide. It is understood that an
oligonucleotide need not be 100% complementary to its target nucleic acid sequence
to be specifically hybridizable. An oligonucleotide is specifically hybridizable when
binding of the oligonucleotide to the target interferes with the normal function of the
target molecule to cause a loss of utility or expression therefrom, and there is a
sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the
oligonucleotide to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is
desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or
therapeutic treatment, or, in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the
                                                 - 44 -

assays are conducted. Thus, in other embodiments, this oligonucleotide includes 1, 2,
or 3 base substitutions as compared to the region of a gene or mRNA sequence that it
is targeting or to which it specifically hybridizes.
         RNA Interference Nucleic Acids
         In particular embodiments, nucleic acid-lipid particles of the invention are
associated with RNA interference (RNAi) molecules. RNA interference methods
using RNAi molecules may be used to disrupt the expression of a gene or
polynucleotide of interest. In the last 5 years small interfering RNA (siRNA) has
essentially replaced antisense ODN and ribozymes as the next generation of targeted
oligonucleotide drugs under development. SiRNAs are RNA duplexes normally 21
30 nucleotides long that can associate with a cytoplasmic multi-protein complex
known as RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC loaded with siRNA
mediates the degradation of homologous mRNA transcripts, therefore siRNA can be
designed to knock down protein expression with high specificity. Unlike other
antisense technologies, siRNA function through a natural mechanism evolved to
control gene expression through non-coding RNA. This is generally considered to be
the reason why their activity is more potent in vitro and in vivo than either antisense
ODN or ribozymes. A variety of RNAi reagents, including siRNAs targeting
clinically relevant targets, are currently under pharmaceutical development, as
described, e.g., in de Fougerolles, A. et al., Nature Reviews 6:443-453 (2007).
        While the first described RNAi molecules were RNA:RNA hybrids
comprising both an RNA sense and an RNA antisense strand, it has now been
demonstrated that DNA sense:RNA antisense hybrids, RNA sense:DNA antisense
hybrids, and DNA:DNA hybrids are capable of mediating RNAi (Lamberton, J.S. and
Christian, A.T., (2003) Molecular Biotechnology 24:111-119). Thus, the invention
includes the use of RNAi molecules comprising any of these different types of
double-stranded molecules. In addition, it is understood that RNAi molecules may be
used and introduced to cells in a variety of forms. Accordingly, as used herein, RNAi

  WO 2010/088537                                                            PCT/US2010/022614
molecules encompasses any and all molecules capable of inducing an RNAi response
in cells, including, but not limited to, double-stranded polynucleotides comprising two
separate strands, i.e. a sense strand and an antisense strand, e.g., small interfering
RNA (siRNA); polynucleotides comprising a hairpin loop of complementary
sequences, which forms a double-stranded region, e.g., shRNAi molecules, and
expression vectors that express one or more polynucleotides capable of forming a
double-stranded polynucleotide alone or in combination with another polynucleotide.
         RNA interference (RNAi) may be used to specifically inhibit expression of
target polynucleotides. Double-stranded RNA-mediated suppression of gene and
nucleic acid expression may be accomplished according to the invention by
introducing dsRNA, siRNA or shRNA into cells or organisms. SiRNA may be
double-stranded RNA, or a hybrid molecule comprising both RNA and DNA, e.g.,
one RNA strand and one DNA strand. It has been demonstrated that the direct
introduction of siRNAs to a cell can trigger RNAi in mammalian cells (Elshabir,
S.M., et al. Nature 411:494-498 (2001)). Furthermore, suppression in mammalian
cells occurred at the RNA level and was specific for the targeted genes, with a strong
correlation between RNA and protein suppression (Caplen, N. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA 98:9746-9747 (2001)). In addition, it was shown that a wide variety of cell
lines, including HeLa S3, COS7, 293, NIH/3T3, A549, HT-29, CHO-KI and MCF-7
cells, are susceptible to some level of siRNA silencing (Brown, D. et al. TechNotes
9(1):1-7, available on the worldwide web at
www.dot.ambion.dot.com/techlib/tn/91/912.html (9/1/02)).
         RNAi molecules targeting specific polynucleotides can be readily prepared
according to procedures known in the art. Structural characteristics of effective
siRNA molecules have been identified. Elshabir, S.M. et al. (2001) Nature 411:494
498 and Elshabir, S.M. et al. (2001), EMBO 20:6877-6888. Accordingly, one of skill
in the art would understand that a wide variety of different siRNA molecules may be
used to target a specific gene or transcript. In certain embodiments, siRNA molecules
according to the invention are double-stranded and 16 - 30 or 18 - 25 nucleotides in
                                                - 46 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                          PCT/US2010/022614
length, including each integer in between. In one embodiment, an siRNA is 21
nucleotides in length. In certain embodiments, siRNAs have 0-7 nucleotide 3'
overhangs or 0-4 nucleotide 5' overhangs. In one embodiment, an siRNA molecule
has a two nucleotide 3' overhang. In one embodiment, an siRNA is 21 nucleotides in
length with two nucleotide 3' overhangs (i.e. they contain a 19 nucleotide
complementary region between the sense and antisense strands). In certain
embodiments, the overhangs are UU or dTdT 3' overhangs.
        Generally, siRNA molecules are completely complementary to one strand of a
target DNA molecule, since even single base pair mismatches have been shown to
reduce silencing. In other embodiments, siRNAs may have a modified backbone
composition, such as, for example, 2'-deoxy- or 2'-O-methyl modifications.
However, in preferred embodiments, the entire strand of the siRNA is not made with
either 2' deoxy or 2'-O-modified bases.
        In another embodiment, the invention provides a cell including a vector for
inhibiting the expression of a gene in a cell. The vector includes a regulatory sequence
operably linked to a nucleotide sequence that encodes at least one strand of one of the
dsRNA of the invention.
        In one embodiment, siRNA target sites are selected by scanning the target
mRNA transcript sequence for the occurrence of AA dinucleotide sequences. Each
AA dinucleotide sequence in combination with the 3' adjacent approximately 19
nucleotides are potential siRNA target sites. In one embodiment, siRNA target sites
are preferentially not located within the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) or
regions near the start codon (within approximately 75 bases), since proteins that bind
regulatory regions may interfere with the binding of the siRNP endonuclease complex
(Elshabir, S. et al. Nature 411:494-498 (2001); Elshabir, S. et al. EMBO J. 20:6877
6888 (2001)). In addition, potential target sites may be compared to an appropriate
genome database, such as BLASTN 2.0.5, available on the NCBI server at
www.ncbi.nlm, and potential target sequences with significant homology to other
coding sequences eliminated.

         In particular embodiments, short hairpin RNAs constitute the nucleic acid
component of nucleic acid-lipid particles of the invention. Short Hairpin RNA
(shRNA) is a form of hairpin RNA capable of sequence-specifically reducing
expression of a target gene. Short hairpin RNAs may offer an advantage over siRNAs
in suppressing gene expression, as they are generally more stable and less susceptible
to degradation in the cellular environment. It has been established that such short
hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing works in a variety of normal and cancer cell
lines, and in mammalian cells, including mouse and human cells. Paddison, P. et al.,
Genes Dev. 16(8):948-58 (2002). Furthermore, transgenic cell lines bearing
chromosomal genes that code for engineered shRNAs have been generated. These
cells are able to constitutively synthesize shRNAs, thereby facilitating long-lasting or
constitutive gene silencing that may be passed on to progeny cells. Paddison, P. et al.,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99(3):1443-1448 (2002).
         ShRNAs contain a stem loop structure. In certain embodiments, they may
contain variable stem lengths, typically from 19 to 29 nucleotides in length, or any
number in between. In certain embodiments, hairpins contain 19 to 21 nucleotide
stems, while in other embodiments, hairpins contain 27 to 29 nucleotide stems. In
certain embodiments, loop size is between 4 to 23 nucleotides in length, although the
loop size may be larger than 23 nucleotides without significantly affecting silencing
activity. ShRNA molecules may contain mismatches, for example G-U mismatches
between the two strands of the shRNA stem without decreasing potency. In fact, in
certain embodiments, shRNAs are designed to include one or several G-U pairings in
the hairpin stem to stabilize hairpins during propagation in bacteria, for example.
However, complementarity between the portion of the stem that binds to the target
mRNA (antisense strand) and the mRNA is typically required, and even a single base
pair mismatch is this region may abolish silencing. 5' and 3' overhangs are not
required, since they do not appear to be critical for shRNA function, although they
may be present (Paddison et al. (2002) Genes & Dev. 16(8):948-58).

         MicroRNAs
         Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are a highly conserved class of small RNA molecules
that are transcribed from DNA in the genomes of plants and animals, but are not
translated into protein. Processed miRNAs are single stranded -17-25 nucleotide (nt)
RNA molecules that become incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex
(RISC) and have been identified as key regulators of development, cell proliferation,
apoptosis and differentiation. They are believed to play a role in regulation of gene
expression by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of specific mRNAs.RISC
mediates down-regulation of gene expression through translational inhibition,
transcript cleavage, or both. RISC is also implicated in transcriptional silencing in the
nucleus of a wide range of eukaryotes.
         The number of miRNA sequences identified to date is large and growing,
illustrative examples of which can be found, for example, in: "miRBase: microRNA
sequences, targets and gene nomenclature" Griffiths-Jones S, Grocock RJ, van

         Antisense Oligonucleotides
         In one embodiment, a nucleic acid is an antisense oligonucleotide directed to a
target polynucleotide. The term "antisense oligonucleotide" or simply "antisense" is
meant to include oligonucleotides that are complementary to a targeted polynucleotide
sequence. Antisense oligonucleotides are single strands of DNA or RNA that are
complementary to a chosen sequence. In the case of antisense RNA, they prevent
translation of complementary RNA strands by binding to it. Antisense DNA can be
used to target a specific, complementary (coding or non-coding) RNA. If binding
takes places this DNA/RNA hybrid can be degraded by the enzyme RNase H. In
particular embodiment, antisense oligonucleotides contain from about 10 to about 50
                                               - 49 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                         PCT/US2010/022614
nucleotides, more preferably about 15 to about 30 nucleotides. The term also
encompasses antisense oligonucleotides that may not be exactly complementary to the
desired target gene. Thus, the invention can be utilized in instances where non-target
specific-activities are found with antisense, or where an antisense sequence containing
one or more mismatches with the target sequence is the most preferred for a particular
use.
        Antisense oligonucleotides have been demonstrated to be effective and
targeted inhibitors of protein synthesis, and, consequently, can be used to specifically
inhibit protein synthesis by a targeted gene. The efficacy of antisense
oligonucleotides for inhibiting protein synthesis is well established. For example, the
synthesis of polygalactauronase and the muscarine type 2 acetylcholine receptor are
inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides directed to their respective mRNA sequences
(U. S. Patent 5,739,119 and U. S. Patent 5,759,829). Further, examples of antisense
inhibition have been demonstrated with the nuclear protein cyclin, the multiple drug
resistance gene (MDG1), ICAM-1, E-selectin, STK-1, striatal GABAA receptor and
human EGF (Jaskulski et al., Science. 1988 Jun 10;240(4858):1544-6;
Vasanthakumar and Ahmed, Cancer Commun. 1989;1(4):225-32; Peris et al., Brain
Res Mol Brain Res. 1998 Jun 15;57(2):310-20; U. S. Patent 5,801,154; U.S. Patent
5,789,573; U. S. Patent 5,718,709 and U.S. Patent 5,610,288). Furthermore, antisense
constructs have also been described that inhibit and can be used to treat a variety of
abnormal cellular proliferations, e.g. cancer (U. S. Patent 5,747,470; U. S. Patent
5,591,317 and U. S. Patent 5,783,683).
        Methods of producing antisense oligonucleotides are known in the art and can
be readily adapted to produce an antisense oligonucleotide that targets any
polynucleotide sequence. Selection of antisense oligonucleotide sequences specific
for a given target sequence is based upon analysis of the chosen target sequence and
determination of secondary structure, Tm, binding energy, and relative stability.
Antisense oligonucleotides may be selected based upon their relative inability to form
dimers, hairpins, or other secondary structures that would reduce or prohibit specific
                                                -50-

  WO 2010/088537                                                          PCT/US2010/022614
binding to the target mRNA in a host cell. Highly preferred target regions of the
mRNA include those regions at or near the AUG translation initiation codon and
those sequences that are substantially complementary to 5' regions of the mRNA.
These secondary structure analyses and target site selection considerations can be
performed, for example, using v.4 of the OLIGO primer analysis software (Molecular
Biology Insights) and/or the BLASTN 2.0.5 algorithm software (Altschul et al.,
Nucleic Acids Res. 1997, 25(17):3389-402).
         Ribozymes
         According to another embodiment of the invention, nucleic acid-lipid particles
are associated with ribozymes. Ribozymes are RNA-protein complexes having
specific catalytic domains that possess endonuclease activity (Kim and Cech, Proc
Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Dec;84(24):8788-92; Forster and Symons, Cell. 1987 Apr
24;49(2):211-20). For example, a large number of ribozymes accelerate phosphoester
transfer reactions with a high degree of specificity, often cleaving only one of several
phosphoesters in an oligonucleotide substrate (Cech et al., Cell. 1981 Dec;27(3 Pt
2):487-96; Michel and Westhof, J Mol Biol. 1990 Dec 5;216(3):585-610; Reinhold
Hurek and Shub, Nature. 1992 May 14;357(6374):173-6). This specificity has been
attributed to the requirement that the substrate bind via specific base-pairing
interactions to the internal guide sequence ("IGS") of the ribozyme prior to chemical
reaction.
         At least six basic varieties of naturally-occurring enzymatic RNAs are known
presently. Each can catalyze the hydrolysis of RNA phosphodiester bonds in trans
(and thus can cleave other RNA molecules) under physiological conditions. In
general, enzymatic nucleic acids act by first binding to a target RNA. Such binding
occurs through the target binding portion of a enzymatic nucleic acid which is held in
close proximity to an enzymatic portion of the molecule that acts to cleave the target
RNA. Thus, the enzymatic nucleic acid first recognizes and then binds a target RNA
through complementary base-pairing, and once bound to the correct site, acts
                                                  -51-

enzymatically to cut the target RNA. Strategic cleavage of such a target RNA will
destroy its ability to direct synthesis of an encoded protein. After an enzymatic
nucleic acid has bound and cleaved its RNA target, it is released from that RNA to
search for another target and can repeatedly bind and cleave new targets.
        The enzymatic nucleic acid molecule may be formed in a hammerhead,
hairpin, a hepatitis 6 virus, group I intron or RNaseP RNA (in association with an
RNA guide sequence) or Neurospora VS RNA motif, for example. Specific examples
of hammerhead motifs are described by Rossi et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992 Sep
11;20(17):4559-65. Examples of hairpin motifs are described by Hampel et al. (Eur.
Pat. Appl. Publ. No. EP 0360257), Hampel and Tritz, Biochemistry 1989 Jun

U. S. Patent 5,631,359. An example of the hepatitis 6 virus motif is described by
Perrotta and Been, Biochemistry. 1992 Dec 1;31(47):11843-52; an example of the
RNaseP motif is described by Guerrier-Takada et al., Cell. 1983 Dec;35(3 Pt 2):849
57; Neurospora VS RNA ribozyme motif is described by Collins (Saville and Collins,
Cell. 1990 May 18;61(4):685-96; Saville and Collins, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.
1991 Oct 1;88(19):8826-30; Collins and Olive, Biochemistry. 1993
Mar 23;32(11):2795-9); and an example of the Group I intron is described in U. S.
Patent 4,987,071. Important characteristics of enzymatic nucleic acid molecules used
according to the invention are that they have a specific substrate binding site which is
complementary to one or more of the target gene DNA or RNA regions, and that they
have nucleotide sequences within or surrounding that substrate binding site which
impart an RNA cleaving activity to the molecule. Thus the ribozyme constructs need
not be limited to specific motifs mentioned herein.
        Methods of producing a ribozyme targeted to any polynucleotide sequence are
known in the art. Ribozymes may be designed as described in Int. Pat. Appl. Publ.
No. WO 93/23569 and Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 94/02595, each specifically
incorporated herein by reference, and synthesized to be tested in vitro and in vivo, as
described therein.

         Nucleic Acid Modifications
         In the 1990's DNA-based antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) and
ribozymes (RNA) represented an exciting new paradigm for drug design and
development, but their application in vivo was prevented by endo- and exo- nuclease
activity as well as a lack of successful intracellular delivery. The degradation issue
was effectively overcome following extensive research into chemical modifications
that prevented the oligonucleotide (oligo) drugs from being recognized by nuclease
enzymes but did not inhibit their mechanism of action. This research was so
successful that antisense ODN drugs in development today remain intact in vivo for
days compared to minutes for unmodified molecules (Kurreck, J. 2003. Antisense
technologies. Improvement through novel chemical modifications. Eur J Biochem
                                                - 53 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                            PCT/US2010/022614
270:1628-44). However, intracellular delivery and mechanism of action issues have
so far limited antisense ODN and ribozymes from becoming clinical products.
         RNA duplexes are inherently more stable to nucleases than single stranded
DNA or RNA, and unlike antisense ODN, unmodified siRNA show good activity
once they access the cytoplasm. Even so, the chemical modifications developed to
stabilize antisense ODN and ribozymes have also been systematically applied to
siRNA to determine how much chemical modification can be tolerated and if
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity can be enhanced. RNA interference
by siRNA duplexes requires an antisense and sense strand, which have different
functions. Both are necessary to enable the siRNA to enter RISC, but once loaded the
two strands separate and the sense strand is degraded whereas the antisense strand
remains to guide RISC to the target mRNA. Entry into RISC is a process that is
structurally less stringent than the recognition and cleavage of the target mRNA.
Consequently, many different chemical modifications of the sense strand are possible,
but only limited changes are tolerated by the antisense strand (Zhang et al., 2006).
         As is known in the art, a nucleoside is a base-sugar combination. Nucleotides
are nucleosides that further include a phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar
portion of the nucleoside. For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar,
the phosphate group can be linked to either the 2', 3' or 5' hydroxyl moiety of the
sugar. In forming oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link adjacent
nucleosides to one another to form a linear polymeric compound. In turn the
respective ends of this linear polymeric structure can be further joined to form a
circular structure. Within the oligonucleotide structure, the phosphate groups are
commonly referred to as forming the internucleoside backbone of the oligonucleotide.
The normal linkage or backbone of RNA and DNA is a 3' to 5' phosphodiester
linkage.
         The nucleic acid that is used in a lipid-nucleic acid particle according to this
invention includes any form of nucleic acid that is known. Thus, the nucleic acid may
be a modified nucleic acid of the type used previously to enhance nuclease resistance

and serum stability. Surprisingly, however, acceptable therapeutic products can also
be prepared using the method of the invention to formulate lipid-nucleic acid particles
from nucleic acids that have no modification to the phosphodiester linkages of natural
nucleic acid polymers, and the use of unmodified phosphodiester nucleic acids (i.e.,
nucleic acids in which all of the linkages are phosphodiester linkages) is a preferred
embodiment of the invention.
         Backbone Modifications
         Antisense, siRNA and other oligonucleotides useful in this invention include,
but are not limited to, oligonucleotides containing modified backbones or non-natural
internucleoside linkages. Oligonucleotides having modified backbones include those
that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a
phosphorus atom in the backbone. Modified oligonucleotides that do not have a
phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to be
oligonucleosides. Modified oligonucleotide backbones include, for example,
phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters,
aminoalkylphosphotri-esters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3'
alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates
including 3'-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates,
thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters,
phosphoroselenate, methylphosphonate, or O-alkyl phosphotriester linkages, and
boranophosphates having normal 3'-5' linkages, 2'-5' linked analogs of these, and
those having inverted polarity wherein the adjacent pairs of nucleoside units are
linked 3'-5' to 5'-3' or 2'-5' to 5'-2'. Particular non-limiting examples of particular
modifications that may be present in a nucleic acid according to the invention are
shown in Table 2.
         Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included.

include a phosphorus atom therein have backbones that are formed by short chain
alkyl or cycloalkyl internucleoside linkages, mixed heteroatom and alkyl or cycloalkyl
internucleoside linkages, or one or more short chain heteroatomic or heterocyclic
internucleoside linkages. These include, e.g., those having morpholino linkages

sulfoxide and sulfone backbones; formacetyl and thioformacetyl backbones;
methylene formacetyl and thioformacetyl backbones; alkene containing backbones;

        The phosphorothioate backbone modification (Table 3, #1), where a non
bridging oxygen in the phosphodiester bond is replaced by sulfur, is one of the earliest
and most common means deployed to stabilize nucleic acid drugs against nuclease
degradation. In general, it appears that PS modifications can be made extensively to
both siRNA strands without much impact on activity (Kurreck, J., Eur.J. Biochem.
270:1628-44, 2003). However, PS oligos are known to avidly associate non
specifically with proteins resulting in toxicity, especially upon i.v. administration.
Therefore, the PS modification is usually restricted to one or two bases at the 3' and
5' ends. The boranophosphate linker (Table 3, #2) is a recent modification that is

         Other useful nucleic acids derivatives include those nucleic acids molecules in
which the bridging oxygen atoms (those forming the phosphoester linkages) have
been replaced with -S-, -NH-, -CH2- and the like. In certain embodiments, the
alterations to the antisense, siRNA, or other nucleic acids used will not completely
affect the negative charges associated with the nucleic acids. Thus, the invention
contemplates the use of antisense, siRNA, and other nucleic acids in which a portion
of the linkages are replaced with, for example, the neutral methyl phosphonate or
phosphoramidate linkages. When neutral linkages are used, in certain embodiments,
less than 80% of the nucleic acid linkages are so substituted, or less than 50% of the
linkages are so substituted.
         Base Modifications
         Base modifications are less common than those to the backbone and sugar.
The modifications shown in 0.3-6 all appear to stabilize siRNA against nucleases and
have little effect on activity ( Zhang, H.Y., Du,   Q., Wahlestedt, C., Liang, Z. 2006.
RNA Interference with chemically modified siRNA. Curr Top Med Chem 6:893-900).
         Accordingly, oligonucleotides may also include nucleobase (often referred to
in the art simply as "base") modifications or substitutions. As used herein,

"unmodified" or "natural" nucleobases include the purine bases adenine (A) and
guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases thymine (T), cytosine (C) and uracil (U).
Modified nucleobases include other synthetic and natural nucleobases such as 5
methylcytosine (5-me-C or m5c), 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine,
2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2

deazaguanine and 7-deazaadenine and 3-deazaguanine and 3-deazaadenine.
         Certain nucleobases are particularly useful for increasing the binding affinity
of the oligomeric compounds of the invention, including 5-substituted pyrimidines, 6
azapyrimidines and N-2, N-6 and 0-6 substituted purines, including 2
aminopropyladenine, 5-propynyluracil and 5 -propynylcytosine. 5 -methylcytosine
substitutions have been shown to increase nucleic acid duplex stability by 0.6-1.2' C.
(Sanghvi, Y. S., Crooke, S. T. and Lebleu, B., eds., Antisense Research and

combined, in particular embodiments, with 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar modifications.

         Sugar Modifications
         Most modifications on the sugar group occur at the 2'-OH of the RNA sugar
ring, which provides a convenient chemically reactive site (Manoharan, M. 2004.
RNA interference and chemically modified small interfering RNAs. Curr Opin Chem
Biol 8:570-9; Zhang, H.Y., Du,     Q., Wahlestedt,    C., Liang, Z. 2006. RNA Interference
with chemically modified siRNA. Curr Top Med Chem 6:893-900). The 2'-F and 2'
OME (0.7 and 8) are common and both increase stability, the 2'-OME modification
does not reduce activity as long as it is restricted to less than 4 nucleotides per strand
(Holen, T., Amarzguioui, M., Babaie, E., Prydz, H. 2003. Similar behaviour of single
strand and double-strand siRNAs suggests they act through a common RNAi
pathway. Nucleic Acids Res 31:2401-7). The 2'-O-MOE (0.9) is most effective in
siRNA when modified bases are restricted to the middle region of the molecule (
Prakash, T.P., Allerson, C.R., Dande, P., Vickers, T.A., Sioufi, N., Jarres, R., Baker,
B.F., Swayze, E.E., Griffey, R.H., Bhat, B. 2005. Positional effect of chemical
modifications on short interference RNA activity in mammalian cells. JMed Chem
48:4247-53). Other modifications found to stabilize siRNA without loss of activity
are shown in 0.10-14.
         Modified oligonucleotides may also contain one or more substituted sugar
moieties. For example, the invention includes oligonucleotides that comprise one of
the following at the 2' position: OH; F; 0-, S-, or N-alkyl, 0-alkyl-O-alkyl, 0-, S-, or
N-alkenyl, or 0-, S- or N-alkynyl, wherein the alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl may be
substituted or unsubstituted C1 to CIO alkyl or C2 to C1O alkenyl and alkynyl.
Particularly preferred are 0[(CH2)nO]mCH 3 , O(CH 2)nOCH 3, O(CH 2 ) 2 0N(CH 3 ) 2 ,
O(CH 2)nNH 2, O(CH 2)nCH 3, O(CH 2)nONH 2, and O(CH 2 )nON[(CH 2 )nCH 3)] 2, where n
and m are from 1 to about 10. Other preferred oligonucleotides comprise one of the

reporter group, an intercalator, a group for improving the pharmacokinetic properties
of an oligonucleotide, or a group for improving the pharmacodynamic properties of an

includes 2'-methoxyethoxy (2'-O--CH 2CH 2OCH3, also known as 2'-0-(2
methoxyethyl) or 2'-MOE) (Martin et al., Helv. Chim. Acta 1995, 78, 486-504), i.e.,
an alkoxyalkoxy group. Other modifications include 2'-dimethylaminooxyethoxy,
i.e., a O(CH 2)20N(CH 3 )2 group, also known as 2'-DMAOE, and 2'
dimethylaminoethoxyethoxy (2'-DMAEOE).
         Additional modifications include 2'-methoxy (2'-O--CH 3), 2'-aminopropoxy
(2'-OCH 2CH2CH 2NH 2) and 2'-fluoro (2'-F). Similar modifications may also be made
at other positions on the oligonucleotide, particularly the 3' position of the sugar on
the 3' terminal nucleotide or in 2'-5' linked oligonucleotides and the 5' position of 5'
terminal nucleotide. Oligonucleotides may also have sugar mimetics such as
cyclobutyl moieties in place of the pentofuranosyl sugar. Representative United

         In other oligonucleotide mimetics, both the sugar and the internucleoside
linkage, i.e., the backbone, of the nucleotide units are replaced with novel groups,
although the base units are maintained for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic
acid target compound. One such oligomeric compound, an oligonucleotide mimetic
that has been shown to have excellent hybridization properties, is referred to as a
peptide nucleic acid (PNA). In PNA compounds, the sugar-backbone of an
oligonucleotide is replaced with an amide containing backbone, in particular an
aminoethylglycine backbone. The nucleobases are retained and are bound directly or
indirectly to aza nitrogen atoms of the amide portion of the backbone. Representative

         Particular embodiments of the invention are oligonucleotides with
phosphorothioate backbones and oligonucleosides with heteroatom backbones, and in
particular --CH 2--NH--O--CH 2-- , -- CH2 --N(CH 3) --O--CH 2- (referred to as a

U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,677, and the amide backbones of the above referenced U.S. Pat.

         Chimeric Oligonucleotides
         It is not necessary for all positions in a given compound to be uniformly
modified, and in fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications may be
incorporated in a single compound or even at a single nucleoside within an
oligonucleotide. Certain preferred oligonucleotides of this invention are chimeric
oligonucleotides. "Chimeric oligonucleotides" or "chimeras," in the context of this
invention, are oligonucleotides that contain two or more chemically distinct regions,
each made up of at least one nucleotide. These oligonucleotides typically contain at
least one region of modified nucleotides that confers one or more beneficial properties
(such as, e,g., increased nuclease resistance, increased uptake into cells, increased
binding affinity for the RNA target) and a region that is a substrate for RNase H
cleavage.
         In one embodiment, a chimeric oligonucleotide comprises at least one region
modified to increase target binding affinity. Affinity of an oligonucleotide for its
target is routinely determined by measuring the Tm of an oligonucleotide/target pair,
which is the temperature at which the oligonucleotide and target dissociate;
dissociation is detected spectrophotometrically. The higher the Tm, the greater the
                                                  - 64 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                               PCT/US2010/022614
affinity of the oligonucleotide for the target. In one embodiment, the region of the
oligonucleotide which is modified to increase target mRNA binding affinity
comprises at least one nucleotide modified at the 2' position of the sugar, most
preferably a 2'-O-alkyl, 2'-O-alkyl-O-alkyl or 2'-fluoro-modified nucleotide. Such
modifications are routinely incorporated into oligonucleotides and these
oligonucleotides have been shown to have a higher Tm (i.e., higher target binding
affinity) than 2'-deoxyoligonucleotides against a given target. The effect of such
increased affinity is to greatly enhance oligonucleotide inhibition of target gene
expression.
         In another embodiment, a chimeric oligonucletoide comprises a region that
acts as a substrate for RNAse H. Of course, it is understood that oligonucleotides
may include any combination of the various modifications described herein
         Another modification of the oligonucleotides of the invention involves
chemically linking to the oligonucleotide one or more moieties or conjugates which
enhance the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the oligonucleotide.
Such conjugates and methods of preparing the same are known in the art.
         Those skilled in the art will realize that for in vivo utility, such as therapeutic
efficacy, a reasonable rule of thumb is that if a thioated version of the sequence works
in the free form, that encapsulated particles of the same sequence, of any chemistry,
will also be efficacious. Encapsulated particles may also have a broader range of in
vivo utilities, showing efficacy in conditions and models not known to be otherwise
responsive to antisense therapy. Those skilled in the art know that applying this
invention they may find old models which now respond to antisense therapy. Further,
they may revisit discarded antisense sequences or chemistries and find efficacy by
employing the invention.
         The oligonucleotides used in accordance with this invention may be
conveniently and routinely made through the well-known technique of solid phase
synthesis. Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors including Applied
Biosystems. Any other means for such synthesis may also be employed; the actual
synthesis of the oligonucleotides is well within the talents of the routineer. It is also
                                                  - 65 -

well known to use similar techniques to prepare other oligonucleotides such as the
phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives.
        Definitions
        For convenience, the meaning of certain terms and phrases used in the
specification, examples, and appended claims, are provided below. If there is an
apparent discrepancy between the usage of a term in other parts of this specification
and its definition provided in this section, the definition in this section shall prevail.
        "G," "C," "A" and "U" each generally stand for a nucleotide that contains
guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil as a base, respectively. However, it will be
understood that the term "ribonucleotide" or "nucleotide" can also refer to a modified
nucleotide, as further detailed below, or a surrogate replacement moiety. The skilled
person is well aware that guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil may be replaced by
other moieties without substantially altering the base pairing properties of an
oligonucleotide including a nucleotide bearing such replacement moiety. For
example, without limitation, a nucleotide including inosine as its base may base pair
with nucleotides containing adenine, cytosine, or uracil. Hence, nucleotides
containing uracil, guanine, or adenine may be replaced in the nucleotide sequences of
the invention by a nucleotide containing, for example, inosine. Sequences including
such replacement moieties are embodiments of the invention.
        By "Factor VII" as used herein is meant a Factor VII mRNA, protein, peptide,
or polypeptide. The term "Factor VII" is also known in the art as AI132620, Cf7,
Coagulation factor VII precursor, coagulation factor VII, FVII, Serum prothrombin
conversion accelerator, FVII coagulation protein, and eptacog alfa.
        As used herein, "target sequence" refers to a contiguous portion of the
nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule formed during the transcription of the
gene, including mRNA that is a product of RNA processing of a primary transcription
product.
                                                - 66 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                            PCT/US2010/022614
         As used herein, the term "strand including a sequence" refers to an
oligonucleotide including a chain of nucleotides that is described by the sequence
referred to using the standard nucleotide nomenclature.
         As used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term "complementary,"
when used in the context of a nucleotide pair, means a classic Watson-Crick pair, i.e.,
GC, AT, or AU. It also extends to classic Watson-Crick pairings where one or both
of the nuclotides has been modified as decribed herein, e.g., by a rbose modification
or a phosphate backpone modification. It can also include pairing with an inosine or
other entity that does not substantially alter the base pairing properties.
         As used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term "complementary,"
when used to describe a first nucleotide sequence in relation to a second nucleotide
sequence, refers to the ability of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide including the
first nucleotide sequence to hybridize and form a duplex structure under certain
conditions with an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide including the second nucleotide
sequence, as will be understood by the skilled person. Complementarity can include,
full complementarity, substantial complementarity, and sufficient complementarity to
allow hybridization under physiological conditions, e.g, under physiologically
relevant conditions as may be encountered inside an organism. Full complementarity
refers to complementarity, as defined above for an individual pair, at all of the pairs of
the first and second sequence. When a sequence is "substantially complementary"
with respect to a second sequence herein, the two sequences can be fully
complementary, or they may form one or more, but generally not more than 4, 3 or 2
mismatched base pairs upon hybridization, while retaining the ability to hybridize
under the conditions most relevant to their ultimate application. Substantial
complementarity can also be defined as hybridization under stringent conditions,
where stringent conditions may include: 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM PIPES pH 6.4, 1 mM
EDTA, 50'C or 70'C for 12-16 hours followed by washing. The skilled person will
be able to determine the set of conditions most appropriate for a test of
complementarity of two sequences in accordance with the ultimate application of the
hybridized nucleotides.

  WO 2010/088537                                                        PCT/US2010/022614
         However, where two oligonucleotides are designed to form, upon
hybridization, one or more single stranded overhangs, such overhangs shall not be
regarded as mismatches with regard to the determination of complementarity. For
example, a dsRNA including one oligonucleotide 21 nucleotides in length and another
oligonucleotide 23 nucleotides in length, wherein the longer oligonucleotide includes
a sequence of 21 nucleotides that is fully complementary to the shorter
oligonucleotide, may yet be referred to as "fully complementary" for the purposes of
the invention.
         "Complementary" sequences, as used herein, may also include, or be formed
entirely from, non-Watson-Crick base pairs and/or base pairs formed from non-natural
and modified nucleotides, in as far as the above requirements with respect to their
ability to hybridize are fulfilled.
         The terms "complementary", "fully complementary", "substantially
complementary" and sufficient complementarity to allow hybridization under
physiological conditions, e.g, under physiologically relevant conditions as may be
encountered inside an organism, may be used hereinwith respect to the base matching
between the sense strand and the antisense strand of a dsRNA, or between the
antisense strand of a dsRNA and a target sequence, as will be understood from the
context of their use.
         As used herein, a polynucleotide which is "complementary, e.g., substantially
complementary to at least part of' a messenger RNA (mRNA) refers to a
polynucleotide which is complementary, e.g., substantially complementary, to a
contiguous portion of the mRNA of interest (e.g., encoding Factor VII). For example,
a polynucleotide is complementary to at least a part of a Factor VII mRNA if the
sequence is substantially complementary to a non-interrupted portion of an mRNA
encoding Factor VII.
         The term "double-stranded RNA" or "dsRNA", as used herein, refers to a
ribonucleic acid molecule, or complex of ribonucleic acid molecules, having a duplex
structure including two anti-parallel and substantially complementary, as defined
above, nucleic acid strands. The two strands forming the duplex structure may be
                                              -68 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                             PCT/US2010/022614
different portions of one larger RNA molecule, or they may be separate RNA
molecules. Where the two strands are part of one larger molecule, and therefore are
connected by an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3'-end of one strand
and the 5'end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the
connecting RNA chain is referred to as a "hairpin loop". Where the two strands are
connected covalently by means other than an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides
between the 3'-end of one strand and the 5'end of the respective other strand forming
the duplex structure, the connecting structure is referred to as a "linker." The RNA
strands may have the same or a different number of nucleotides. The maximum
number of base pairs is the number of nucleotides in the shortest strand of the dsRNA.
In addition to the duplex structure, a dsRNA may comprise one or more nucleotide
overhangs. A dsRNA as used herein is also refered to as a "small inhibitory RNA,"
"siRNA," "siRNA agent," "iRNA agent" or "RNAi agent."
        As used herein, a "nucleotide overhang" refers to the unpaired nucleotide or
nucleotides that protrude from the duplex structure of a dsRNA when a 3'-end of one
strand of the dsRNA extends beyond the 5'-end of the other strand, or vice versa.
"Blunt" or "blunt end" means that there are no unpaired nucleotides at that end of the
dsRNA, i.e., no nucleotide overhang. A "blunt ended" dsRNA is a dsRNA that is
double-stranded over its entire length, i.e., no nucleotide overhang at either end of the
molecule.
        The term "antisense strand" refers to the strand of a dsRNA which includes a
region that is substantially complementary to a target sequence. As used herein, the
term "region of complementarity" refers to the region on the antisense strand that is
substantially complementary to a sequence, for example a target sequence, as defined
herein. Where the region of complementarity is not fully complementary to the target
sequence, the mismatches are most tolerated in the terminal regions and, if present,
are generally in a terminal region or regions, e.g., within 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2 nucleotides of
the 5' and/or 3' terminus.

  WO 2010/088537                                                            PCT/US2010/022614
         The term "sense strand," as used herein, refers to the strand of a dsRNA that
includes a region that is substantially complementary to a region of the antisense
strand.
         The term "identity" is the relationship between two or more polynucleotide
sequences, as determined by comparing the sequences. Identity also means the degree
of sequence relatedness between polynucleotide sequences, as determined by the
match between strings of such sequences. While there exist a number of methods to
measure identity between two polynucleotide sequences, the term is well known to
skilled artisans (see, e.g., Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G.,
Academic Press (1987); and Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov., M. and Devereux,
J., eds., M. Stockton Press, New York (1991)). "Substantially identical," as used
herein, means there is a very high degree of homology (preferably 100% sequence
identity) between the sense strand of the dsRNA and the corresponding part of the
target gene. However, dsRNA having greater than 90%, or 95% sequence identity
may be used in the invention, and thus sequence variations that might be expected due
to genetic mutation, strain polymorphism, or evolutionary divergence can be tolerated.
Although 100% identity is preferred, the dsRNA may contain single or multiple base
pair random mismatches between the RNA and the target gene.
         "Introducing into a cell", when referring to a dsRNA, means facilitating
uptake or absorption into the cell, as is understood by those skilled in the art.
Absorption or uptake of dsRNA can occur through unaided diffusive or active cellular
processes, or by auxiliary agents or devices. The meaning of this term is not limited
to cells in vitro; a dsRNA may also be "introduced into a cell," wherein the cell is part
of a living organism. In such instance, introduction into the cell will include the
delivery to the organism. For example, for in vivo delivery, dsRNA can be injected
into a tissue site or administered systemically. In vitro introduction into a cell
includes methods known in the art such as electroporation and lipofection.
         The terms "silence" and "inhibit the expression of," in as far as they refer to
the Factor VII gene, herein refer to the at least partial suppression of the expression of
the Factor VII gene, as manifested by a reduction of the amount of mRNA from the
                                                - 70 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                             PCT/US2010/022614
Factor VII gene which may be isolated from a first cell or group of cells in which the
Factor VII gene is transcribed and which has or have been treated such that the
expression of the Factor VII gene is inhibited, as compared to a second cell or group
of cells substantially identical to the first cell or group of cells but which has or have
not been so treated (control cells). The degree of inhibition is usually expressed in
terms of
 (mRNA in control cells) - (mRNA in treated cells)
                                                         e 100%
               (mRNA in control cells)
         Alternatively, the degree of inhibition may be given in terms of a reduction of
a parameter that is functionally linked to Factor VII gene transcription, e.g. the
amount of protein encoded by the Factor VII gene which is secreted by a cell, or the
number of cells displaying a certain phenotype, e.g apoptosis. In principle, Factor VII
gene silencing may be determined in any cell expressing the target, either
constitutively or by genomic engineering, and by any appropriate assay. However,
when a reference is needed in order to determine whether a given siRNA inhibits the
expression of the Factor VII gene by a certain degree and therefore is encompassed by
the instant invention, the assays provided in the Examples below shall serve as such
reference.
         For example, in certain instances, expression of the Factor VII gene is
suppressed by at least about 20%, 25%, 35%, 40% or 50% by administration of the
double-stranded oligonucleotide of the invention. In one embodiment, the Factor VII
gene is suppressed by at least about 60%, 70%, or 80% by administration of the
double-stranded oligonucleotide of the invention. In a more preferred embodiment,
the Factor VII gene is suppressed by at least about 85%, 90%, or 95% by
administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide of the invention.
         The terms "treat," "treatment," and the like, refer to relief from or alleviation
of a disease or disorder. In the context of the invention insofar as it relates to any of
the other conditions recited herein below (e.g., a Factor VII -mediated condition other
than a thrombotic disorder), the terms "treat," "treatment," and the like mean to
                                                   -71 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                           PCT/US2010/022614
relieve or alleviate at least one symptom associated with such condition, or to slow or
reverse the progression of such condition.
         A "therapeutically relevant" composition can alleviate a disease or disorder, or
a symptom of a disease or disorder when administered at an appropriate dose.
         As used herein, the term "Factor VII -mediated condition or disease" and
related terms and phrases refer to a condition or disorder characterized by
inappropriate, e.g., greater than normal, Factor VII activity. Inappropriate Factor VII
functional activity might arise as the result of Factor VII expression in cells which
normally do not express Factor VII, or increased Factor VII expression (leading to,
e.g., a symptom of a viral hemorrhagic fever, or a thrombus). A Factor VII-mediated
condition or disease may be completely or partially mediated by inappropriate Factor
VII functional activity. However, a Factor VII-mediated condition or disease is one in
which modulation of Factor VII results in some effect on the underlying condition or
disorder (e.g., a Factor VII inhibitor results in some improvement in patient well
being in at least some patients).
         A "hemorrhagic fever" includes a combination of illnesses caused by a viral
infection. Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms are typically followed by capillary
hemorrhaging.
         A "coagulopathy" is any defect in the blood clotting mechanism of a subject.
         As used herein, a "thrombotic disorder" is any disorder, preferably resulting
from unwanted FVII expression, including any disorder characterized by unwanted
blood coagulation.
         As used herein, the phrases "therapeutically effective amount" and
"prophylactically effective amount" refer to an amount that provides a therapeutic
benefit in the treatment, prevention, or management of a viral hemorrhagic fever, or
an overt symptom of such disorder, e.g., hemorraging, fever, weakness, muscle pain,
headache, inflammation, or circulatory shock. The specific amount that is
therapeutically effective can be readily determined by ordinary medical practitioner,
and may vary depending on factors known in the art, such as, e.g. the type of
thrombotic disorder, the patient's history and age, the stage of the disease, and the
administration of other agents.

         As used herein, a "pharmaceutical composition" includes a pharmacologically
effective amount of a dsRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used
herein, "pharmacologically effective amount," "therapeutically effective amount" or
simply "effective amount" refers to that amount of an RNA effective to produce the
intended pharmacological, therapeutic or preventive result. For example, if a given
clinical treatment is considered effective when there is at least a 25% reduction in a
measurable parameter associated with a disease or disorder, a therapeutically effective
amount of a drug for the treatment of that disease or disorder is the amount necessary
to effect at least a 25% reduction in that parameter.
         The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to a carrier for
administration of a therapeutic agent. Such carriers include, but are not limited to,
saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof.
The term specifically excludes cell culture medium. For drugs administered orally,
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to pharmaceutically
acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents,
lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and
preservatives. Suitable inert diluents include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium
and calcium phosphate, and lactose, while corn starch and alginic acid are suitable
disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin, while the
lubricating agent, if present, will generally be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.
If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or
glyceryl distearate, to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.
         As used herein, a "transformed cell" is a cell into which a vector has been
introduced from which a dsRNA molecule may be expressed.
         Characteristic of Nucleic Acid-Lipid Particles
         In certain embodiments, the invention relates to methods and compositions for
producing lipid-encapsulated nucleic acid particles in which nucleic acids are
encapsulated within a lipid layer. Such nucleic acid-lipid particles, incorporating
siRNA oligonucleotides, are characterized using a variety of biophysical parameters
                                                -73 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                             PCT/US2010/022614
including: (1) drug to lipid ratio; (2) encapsulation efficiency; and (3) particle size.
High drug to lipid rations, high encapsulation efficiency, good nuclease resistance and
serum stability and controllable particle size, generally less than 200 nm in diameter
are desirable. In addition, the nature of the nucleic acid polymer is of significance,
since the modification of nucleic acids in an effort to impart nuclease resistance adds
to the cost of therapeutics while in many cases providing only limited resistance.
Unless stated otherwise, these criteria are calculated in this specification as follows:
         Nucleic acid to lipid ratio is the amount of nucleic acid in a defined volume of
preparation divided by the amount of lipid in the same volume. This may be on a
mole per mole basis or on a weight per weight basis, or on a weight per mole basis.
For final, administration-ready formulations, the nucleic acid:lipid ratio is calculated
after dialysis, chromatography and/or enzyme (e.g., nuclease) digestion has been
employed to remove as much of the external nucleic acid as possible;
         Encapsulation efficiency refers to the drug to lipid ratio of the starting mixture
divided by the drug to lipid ratio of the final, administration competent formulation.
This is a measure of relative efficiency. For a measure of absolute efficiency, the total
amount of nucleic acid added to the starting mixture that ends up in the administration
competent formulation, can also be calculated. The amount of lipid lost during the
formulation process may also be calculated. Efficiency is a measure of the wastage
and expense of the formulation; and
         Size indicates the size (diameter) of the particles formed. Size distribution
may be determined using quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) on a Nicomp Model
370 sub-micron particle sizer. Particles under 200 nm are preferred for distribution to
neo-vascularized (leaky) tissues, such as neoplasms and sites of inflammation.
         Methods of preparing lipid particles
         The methods and compositions of the invention make use of certain cationic
lipids, the synthesis, preparation and characterization of which is described below and
in the accompanying Examples. In addition, the present invention provides methods
of preparing lipid particles, including those associated with a therapeutic agent, e.g., a

nucleic acid. In the methods described herein, a mixture of lipids is combined with a
buffered aqueous solution of nucleic acid to produce an intermediate mixture
containing nucleic acid encapsulated in lipid particles wherein the encapsulated
nucleic acids are present in a nucleic acid/lipid ratio of about 3 wt% to about 25 wt%,
preferably 5 to 15 wt%. The intermediate mixture may optionally be sized to obtain
lipid-encapsulated nucleic acid particles wherein the lipid portions are unilamellar
vesicles, preferably having a diameter of 30 to 150 nm, more preferably about 40 to
90 nm. The pH is then raised to neutralize at least a portion of the surface charges on
the lipid-nucleic acid particles, thus providing an at least partially surface-neutralized
lipid-encapsulated nucleic acid composition.
         As described above, several of these cationic lipids are amino lipids that are
charged at a pH below the pKa of the amino group and substantially neutral at a pH
above the pKa. These cationic lipids are termed titratable cationic lipids and can be
used in the formulations of the invention using a two-step process. First, lipid
vesicles can be formed at the lower pH with titratable cationic lipids and other vesicle
components in the presence of nucleic acids. In this manner, the vesicles will
encapsulate and entrap the nucleic acids. Second, the surface charge of the newly
formed vesicles can be neutralized by increasing the pH of the medium to a level
above the pKa of the titratable cationic lipids present, i.e., to physiological pH or
higher. Particularly advantageous aspects of this process include both the facile
removal of any surface adsorbed nucleic acid and a resultant nucleic acid delivery
vehicle which has a neutral surface. Liposomes or lipid particles having a neutral
surface are expected to avoid rapid clearance from circulation and to avoid certain
toxicities which are associated with cationic liposome preparations. Additional details
concerning these uses of such titratable cationic lipids in the formulation of nucleic
acid-lipid particles are provided in US Patent 6,287,591 and US Patent 6,858,225,
incorporated herein by reference.
         It is further noted that the vesicles formed in this manner provide formulations
of uniform vesicle size with high content of nucleic acids. Additionally, the vesicles
have a size range of from about 30 to about 150 nm, more preferably about 30 to
about 90 nm.

         Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the
very high efficiency of nucleic acid encapsulation is a result of electrostatic
interaction at low pH. At acidic pH (e.g. pH 4.0) the vesicle surface is charged and
binds a portion of the nucleic acids through electrostatic interactions. When the
external acidic buffer is exchanged for a more neutral buffer (e.g.. pH 7.5) the surface
of the lipid particle or liposome is neutralized, allowing any external nucleic acid to
be removed. More detailed information on the formulation process is provided in
various publications (e.g., US Patent 6,287,591 and US Patent 6,858,225).
         In view of the above, the present invention provides methods of preparing
lipid/nucleic acid formulations. In the methods described herein, a mixture of lipids is
combined with a buffered aqueous solution of nucleic acid to produce an intermediate
mixture containing nucleic acid encapsulated in lipid particles, e.g., wherein the
encapsulated nucleic acids are present in a nucleic acid/lipid ratio of about 10 wt% to
about 20 wt%. The intermediate mixture may optionally be sized to obtain lipid
encapsulated nucleic acid particles wherein the lipid portions are unilamellar vesicles,
preferably having a diameter of 30 to 150 nm, more preferably about 40 to 90 nm.
The pH is then raised to neutralize at least a portion of the surface charges on the
lipid-nucleic acid particles, thus providing an at least partially surface-neutralized
lipid-encapsulated nucleic acid composition.
         In certain embodiments, the mixture of lipids includes at least two lipid
components: a first amino lipid component of the present invention that is selected
from among lipids which have a pKa such that the lipid is cationic at pH below the
pKa and neutral at pH above the pKa, and a second lipid component that is selected
from among lipids that prevent particle aggregation during lipid-nucleic acid particle
formation. In particular embodiments, the amino lipid is a novel cationic lipid of the
present invention.
         In preparing the nucleic acid-lipid particles of the invention, the mixture of
lipids is typically a solution of lipids in an organic solvent. This mixture of lipids can
then be dried to form a thin film or lyophilized to form a powder before being
hydrated with an aqueous buffer to form liposomes. Alternatively, in a preferred
method, the lipid mixture can be solubilized in a water miscible alcohol, such as
                                                  - 76 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                            PCT/US2010/022614
ethanol, and this ethanolic solution added to an aqueous buffer resulting in
spontaneous liposome formation. In most embodiments, the alcohol is used in the
form in which it is commercially available. For example, ethanol can be used as
absolute ethanol (100%), or as 95% ethanol, the remainder being water. This method
is described in more detail in US Patent 5,976,567).
         In accordance with the invention, the lipid mixture is combined with a
buffered aqueous solution that may contain the nucleic acids. The buffered aqueous
solution of is typically a solution in which the buffer has a pH of less than the pKa of
the protonatable lipid in the lipid mixture. Examples of suitable buffers include
citrate, phosphate, acetate, and MES. A particularly preferred buffer is citrate buffer.
Preferred buffers will be in the range of 1-1000 mM of the anion, depending on the
chemistry of the nucleic acid being encapsulated, and optimization of buffer
concentration may be significant to achieving high loading levels (see, e.g., US Patent
6,287,591 and US Patent 6,858,225).       Alternatively, pure water acidified to pH 5-6
with chloride, sulfate or the like may be useful. In this case, it may be suitable to add
5% glucose, or another non-ionic solute which will balance the osmotic potential
across the particle membrane when the particles are dialyzed to remove ethanol,
increase the pH, or mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as normal
saline. The amount of nucleic acid in buffer can vary, but will typically be from about
0.01 mg/mL to about 200 mg/mL, more preferably from about 0.5 mg/mL to about 50
mg/mL.
         The mixture of lipids and the buffered aqueous solution of therapeutic nucleic
acids is combined to provide an intermediate mixture. The intermediate mixture is
typically a mixture of lipid particles having encapsulated nucleic acids. Additionally,
the intermediate mixture may also contain some portion of nucleic acids which are
attached to the surface of the lipid particles (liposomes or lipid vesicles) due to the
ionic attraction of the negatively-charged nucleic acids and positively-charged lipids
on the lipid particle surface (the amino lipids or other lipid making up the
protonatable first lipid component are positively charged in a buffer having a pH of
less than the pKa of the protonatable group on the lipid). In one group of preferred
embodiments, the mixture of lipids is an alcohol solution of lipids and the volumes of
                                                 - 77 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                           PCT/US2010/022614
each of the solutions is adjusted so that upon combination, the resulting alcohol
content is from about 20% by volume to about 45% by volume. The method of
combining the mixtures can include any of a variety of processes, often depending
upon the scale of formulation produced. For example, when the total volume is about
10-20 mL or less, the solutions can be combined in a test tube and stirred together
using a vortex mixer. Large-scale processes can be carried out in suitable production
scale glassware.
        Optionally, the lipid-encapsulated therapeutic agent (e.g., nucleic acid)
complexes which are produced by combining the lipid mixture and the buffered
aqueous solution of therapeutic agents (nucleic acids) can be sized to achieve a
desired size range and relatively narrow distribution of lipid particle sizes. Preferably,
the compositions provided herein will be sized to a mean diameter of from about 70 to
about 200 nm, more preferably about 90 to about 130 nm. Several techniques are
available for sizing liposomes to a desired size. One sizing method is described in
U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,323, incorporated herein by reference. Sonicating a liposome
suspension either by bath or probe sonication produces a progressive size reduction
down to small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) less than about 0.05 microns in size.
Homogenization is another method which relies on shearing energy to fragment large
liposomes into smaller ones. In a typical homogenization procedure, multilamellar
vesicles are recirculated through a standard emulsion homogenizer until selected
liposome sizes, typically between about 0.1 and 0.5 microns, are observed. In both
methods, the particle size distribution can be monitored by conventional laser-beam
particle size determination. For certain methods herein, extrusion is used to obtain a
uniform vesicle size.
        Extrusion of liposome compositions through a small-pore polycarbonate
membrane or an asymmetric ceramic membrane results in a relatively well-defined
size distribution. Typically, the suspension is cycled through the membrane one or
more times until the desired liposome complex size distribution is achieved. The
liposomes may be extruded through successively smaller-pore membranes, to achieve
a gradual reduction in liposome size. In some instances, the lipid-nucleic acid
compositions which are formed can be used without any sizing.

         In particular embodiments, methods of the present invention further comprise
a step of neutralizing at least some of the surface charges on the lipid portions of the
lipid-nucleic acid compositions. By at least partially neutralizing the surface charges,
unencapsulated nucleic acid is freed from the lipid particle surface and can be
removed from the composition using conventional techniques. Preferably,
unencapsulated and surface adsorbed nucleic acids are removed from the resulting
compositions through exchange of buffer solutions. For example, replacement of a
citrate buffer (pH about 4.0, used for forming the compositions) with a HEPES
buffered saline (HBS pH about 7.5) solution, results in the neutralization of liposome
surface and nucleic acid release from the surface. The released nucleic acid can then
be removed via chromatography using standard methods, and then switched into a
buffer with a pH above the pKa of the lipid used.
         Optionally the lipid vesicles (i.e., lipid particles) can be formed by hydration
in an aqueous buffer and sized using any of the methods described above prior to
addition of the nucleic acid. As described above, the aqueous buffer should be of a
pH below the pKa of the amino lipid. A solution of the nucleic acids can then be
added to these sized, preformed vesicles. To allow encapsulation of nucleic acids into
such "pre-formed" vesicles the mixture should contain an alcohol, such as ethanol. In
the case of ethanol, it should be present at a concentration of about 20% (w/w) to
about 45% (w/w). In addition, it may be necessary to warm the mixture of pre-formed
vesicles and nucleic acid in the aqueous buffer-ethanol mixture to a temperature of
about 250 C to about 500 C depending on the composition of the lipid vesicles and the
nature of the nucleic acid. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that
optimization of the encapsulation process to achieve a desired level of nucleic acid in
the lipid vesicles will require manipulation of variable such as ethanol concentration
and temperature. Examples of suitable conditions for nucleic acid encapsulation are
provided in the Examples. Once the nucleic acids are encapsulated within the
prefromed vesicles, the external pH can be increased to at least partially neutralize the
surface charge. Unencapsulated and surface adsorbed nucleic acids can then be
removed as described above.

Method of Use
          The lipid particles of the invention may be used to deliver a therapeutic agent
to a cell, in vitro or in vivo. In particular embodiments, the therapeutic agent is a
nucleic acid, which is delivered to a cell using a nucleic acid-lipid particles of the
invention. While the following description o various methodsof using the lipid
particles and related pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are exemplified by
description related to nucleic acid-lipid particles, it is understood that these methods
and compositions may be readily adapted for the delivery of any therapeutic agent for
the treatment of any disease or disorder that would benefit from such treatment.
          In certain embodiments, the invention provides methods for introducing a
nucleic acid into a cell. Preferred nucleic acids for introduction into cells are siRNA,
immune-stimulating oligonucleotides, plasmids, antisense and ribozymes. These
methods may be carried out by contacting the particles or compositions of the
invention with the cells for a period of time sufficient for intracellular delivery to
occur.
          The compositions of the invention can be adsorbed to almost any cell type,
e.g., tumor cell lines, including but not limited to HeLa, HCT1 16, A375, MCF7,
B16F1O, Hep3b, HUH7, HepG2, Skov3, U87, and PC3 cell lines. Once adsorbed, the
nucleic acid-lipid particles can either be endocytosed by a portion of the cells,
exchange lipids with cell membranes, or fuse with the cells. Transfer or incorporation
of the nucleic acid portion of the complex can take place via any one of these
pathways. Without intending to be limited with respect to the scope of the invention,
it is believed that in the case of particles taken up into the cell by endocytosis the
particles then interact with the endosomal membrane, resulting in destabilization of
the endosomal membrane, possibly by the formation of non-bilayer phases, resulting
in introduction of the encapsulated nucleic acid into the cell cytoplasm. Similarly in
the case of direct fusion of the particles with the cell plasma membrane, when fusion
takes place, the liposome membrane is integrated into the cell membrane and the
contents of the liposome combine with the intracellular fluid. Contact between the
cells and the lipid-nucleic acid compositions, when carried out in vitro, will take place
in a biologically compatible medium. The concentration of compositions can vary

widely depending on the particular application, but is generally between about 1 Pmol
and about 10 mmol. In certain embodiments, treatment of the cells with the lipid
nucleic acid compositions will generally be carried out at physiological temperatures
(about 37C) for periods of time from about 1 to 24 hours, preferably from about 2 to
8 hours. For in vitro applications, the delivery of nucleic acids can be to any cell
grown in culture, whether of plant or animal origin, vertebrate or invertebrate, and of
any tissue or type. In preferred embodiments, the cells will be animal cells, more
preferably mammalian cells, and most preferably human cells.
         In one group of embodiments, a lipid-nucleic acid particle suspension is added
to 60-80% confluent plated cells having a cell density of from about 103 to about 10 5
cells/mL, more preferably about 2 x 10 4 cells/mL. The concentration of the
suspension added to the cells is preferably of from about 0.01 to 20 Pg/mL, more
preferably about 1 Vg/mL.
         Typical applications include using well known procedures to provide
intracellular delivery of siRNA to knock down or silence specific cellular targets.
Alternatively applications include delivery of DNA or mRNA sequences that code for
therapeutically useful polypeptides. In this manner, therapy is provided for genetic
diseases by supplying deficient or absent gene products (i.e., for Duchenne's
dystrophy, see Kunkel, et al., Brit. Med. Bull. 45(3):630-643 (1989), and for cystic
fibrosis, see Goodfellow, Nature 341:102-103 (1989)). Other uses for the
compositions of the invention include introduction of antisense oligonucleotides in
cells (see, Bennett, et al., Mol. Pharm. 41:1023-1033 (1992)).
         Alternatively, the compositions of the invention can also be used for deliver of
nucleic acids to cells in vivo, using methods which are known to those of skill in the
art. With respect to application of the invention for delivery of DNA or mRNA
sequences, Zhu, et al., Science 261:209-211 (1993), incorporated herein by reference,

         In other methods, the pharmaceutical preparations may be contacted with the

be made by topical, "open" or "closed" procedures. By "topical," it is meant the direct
application of the pharmaceutical preparation to a tissue exposed to the environment,
such as the skin, oropharynx, external auditory canal, and the like. "Open" procedures
are those procedures which include incising the skin of a patient and directly
visualizing the underlying tissue to which the pharmaceutical preparations are applied.

This is generally accomplished by a surgical procedure, such as a thoracotomy to
access the lungs, abdominal laparotomy to access abdominal viscera, or other direct
surgical approach to the target tissue. "Closed" procedures are invasive procedures in
which the internal target tissues are not directly visualized, but accessed via inserting
instruments through small wounds in the skin. For example, the preparations may be
administered to the peritoneum by needle lavage. Likewise, the pharmaceutical
preparations may be administered to the meninges or spinal cord by infusion during a
lumbar puncture followed by appropriate positioning of the patient as commonly
practiced for spinal anesthesia or metrazamide imaging of the spinal cord.
Alternatively, the preparations may be administered through endoscopic devices.
         The lipid-nucleic acid compositions can also be administered in an aerosol
inhaled into the lungs (see, Brigham, et al., Am. J. Sci. 298(4):278-281 (1989)) or by
direct injection at the site of disease (Culver, Human Gene Therapy, MaryAnn
Liebert, Inc., Publishers, New York. pp. 7 0 -7 1 (1994)).
         The methods of the invention may be practiced in a variety of hosts. Preferred
hosts include mammalian species, such as humans, non-human primates, dogs, cats,
cattle, horses, sheep, and the like.
         Dosages for the lipid-therapeutic agent particles of the invention will depend
on the ratio of therapeutic agent to lipid and the administrating physician's opinion
based on age, weight, and condition of the patient.
         In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of modulating the
expression of a target polynucleotide or polypeptide. These methods generally
comprise contacting a cell with a lipid particle of the invention that is associated with
a nucleic acid capable of modulating the expression of a target polynucleotide or
polypeptide. As used herein, the term "modulating" refers to altering the expression
of a target polynucleotide or polypeptide. In different embodiments, modulating can
mean increasing or enhancing, or it can mean decreasing or reducing. Methods of
measuring the level of expression of a target polynucleotide or polypeptide are known
and available in the arts and include, e.g., methods employing reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical techniques. In
particular embodiments, the level of expression of a target polynucleotide or

polypeptide is increased or reduced by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, or greater
than 50% as compared to an appropriate control value. For example, if increased
expression of a polypeptide desired, the nucleic acid may be an expression vector that
includes a polynucleotide that encodes the desired polypeptide. On the other hand, if
reduced expression of a polynucleotide or polypeptide is desired, then the nucleic acid
may be, e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide, siRNA, or microRNA that comprises a
polynucleotide sequence that specifically hybridizes to a polnucleotide that encodes
the target polypeptide, thereby disrupting expression of the target polynucleotide or
polypeptide. Alternatively, the nucleic acid may be a plasmid that expresses such an
antisense oligonucletoide, siRNA, or microRNA.
         In one particular embodiment, the invention provides a method of modulating
the expression of a polypeptide by a cell, comprising providing to a cell a lipid
particle that consists of or consists essentially of a cationic lipid of formula A, a
neutral lipid, a sterol, a PEG or PEG-modified lipid, e.g., in a molar ratio of about 35
65% of cationic lipid of formula A, 3-12% of the neutral lipid, 15-45% of the sterol,
and 0.5-10% of the PEG or PEG-modified lipid, wherein the lipid particle is
associated with a nucleic acid capable of modulating the expression of the
polypeptide. In particular embodiments, the molar lipid ratio is approximately
60/7.5/31/1.5, 57.5/7.5/31.5/3.5 or 50/10/38.5/1.5 (mol% LIPID A/DSPC/Chol/PEG
DMG) or 57.1/7.1/34.4/1.4 (mol% LIPID A/DPPC/Chol/PEG-cDMA). In some
embodiments, the lipide particle also includes a targeting moiety such as a targeting
lipid described herein (e.g., the lipid particle consists essentially of a cationic lipid of
formula A, a neutral lipid, a sterol, a PEG or PEG-modified lipid and a targeting
moiety). In another group of embodiments, the neutral lipid in these compositions is
replaced with DPPC, POPC, DOPE or SM.
         In particular embodiments, the therapeutic agent is selected from an siRNA, a
microRNA, an antisense oligonucleotide, and a plasmid capable of expressing an
siRNA, a microRNA, or an antisense oligonucleotide, and wherein the siRNA,
microRNA, or antisense RNA comprises a polynucleotide that specifically binds to a
polynucleotide that encodes the polypeptide, or a complement thereof, such that the
expression of the polypeptide is reduced.

         In other embodiments, the nucleic acid is a plasmid that encodes the
polypeptide or a functional variant or fragment thereof, such that expression of the
polypeptide or the functional variant or fragment thereof is increased.
         In related embodiments, the invention provides a method of treating a disease
or disorder characterized by overexpression of a polypeptide in a subject, comprising
providing to the subject a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, wherein the
therapeutic agent is selected from an siRNA, a microRNA, an antisense
oligonucleotide, and a plasmid capable of expressing an siRNA, a microRNA, or an
antisense oligonucleotide, and wherein the siRNA, microRNA, or antisense RNA
comprises a polynucleotide that specifically binds to a polynucleotide that encodes the
polypeptide, or a complement thereof.
         In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a lipid particle
that consists of or consists essentially of a cationic lipid of formula A, DSPC, Chol
and PEG-DMG, PEG-C-DOMG or PEG-cDMA, e.g., in a molar ratio of about 35
65% of cationic lipid of formula A, 3-12% of the neutral lipid, 15-45% of the sterol,
and 0.5-10% of the PEG or PEG-modified lipid PEG-DMG, PEG-C-DOMG or PEG
CDMA, wherein the lipid particle is assocated with the therapeutic nucleic acid. In
particular embodiments, the molar lipid ratio is approximately 60/7.5/31/1.5,
57.5/7.5/31.5/3.5 or 50/10/38.5/1.5 (mol% LIPID A/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG) or
57.1/7.1/34.4/1.4 (mol% LIPID A/DPPC/Chol/PEG-cDMA). In some embodiments,
the lipid particle also includes a targeting lipid described herein (e.g., the lipid particle
consists essentially of a cationic lipid of formula A, a neutral lipid, a sterol, a PEG or
PEG-modified lipid and a targeting moiety). In some embodiments, when the
targeting lipid includes a PEG moiety and is added to an existing liposomal
formulation, the amount of PEG-modified lipid is reduced such that the total amount
of PEG-moidfied lipid (i.e., PEG-modified lipid, for example PEG-DMG, and the
PEG-containing targeting lipid) is kept at a constant mol percentage (e.g., 0.3 mol%,
1.4 mol%, 1.5 mol%, or 3.5 mol%). In another group of embodiments, the neutral
lipid in these compositions is replaced with DPPC, POPC, DOPE or SM.
         In another related embodiment, the invention includes a method of treating a
disease or disorder characterized by underexpression of a polypeptide in a subject,

comprising providing to the subject a pharmaceutical composition of the invention,
wherein the therapeutic agent is a plasmid that encodes the polypeptide or a functional
variant or fragment thereof.
         The invention further provides a method of inducing an immune response in a
subject, comprising providing to the subject the pharmaceutical composition of the
invention, wherein the therapeutic agent is an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide. In
certain embodiments, the immune response is a humoral or mucosal immune response
consists of or consists essentially of a cationic lipid of formula A, DSPC, Chol and
PEG-DMG, PEG-C-DOMG or PEG-cDMA, e.g., in a molar ratio of about 35-65% of
cationic lipid of formula A, 3-12% of the neutral lipid, 15-45% of the sterol, and 0.5
10% of the PEG or PEG-modified lipid PEG-DMG, PEG-C-DOMG or PEG-cDMA,
wherein the lipid particle is assocated with the therapeutic nucleic acid. In particular
embodiments, the molar lipid ratio is approximately 60/7.5/31/1.5, 57.5/7.5/31.5/3.5
or 50/10/38.5/1.5 (mol% LIPID A/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG) or 57.1/7.1/34.4/1.4
(mol% LIPID A/DPPC/Chol/PEG-cDMA). In some embodiments, the lipid particle
also includes a targeting lipid described herein (e.g., the lipid particle consists
essentially of a cationic lipid of formula A, a neutral lipid, a sterol, a PEG or PEG
modified lipid and a targeting moiety). In some embodiments, when the targeting
lipid includes a PEG moiety and is added to an existing liposomal formulation, the
amount of PEG-modified lipid is reduced such that the total amount of PEG-moidfied
lipid (i.e., PEG-modified lipid, for example PEG-DMG, and the PEG-containing
targeting lipid) is kept at a constant mol percentage (e.g., 0.3 mol%, 1.4 mol%, 1.5
mol%, or 3.5 mol%). In another group of embodiments, the neutral lipid in these
compositions is replaced with DPPC, POPC, DOPE or SM.
         In further embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is provided to the
subject in combination with a vaccine or antigen. Thus, the invention itself provides
vaccines comprising a lipid particle of the invention, which comprises an
immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, and is also associated with an antigen to which
an immune response is desired. In particular embodiments, the antigen is a tumor
antigen or is associated with an infective agent, such as, e.g., a virus, bacteria, or
parasiste.

          Pharmaceutical compositions
          In one embodiment, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions
comprising a nucleic acid agent identified by the liver screening model described
                                               -91 -

  WO 2010/088537                                                            PCT/US2010/022614
herein. The composition includes the agent, e.g., a dsRNA, and a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition is useful for treating a disease or
disorder associated with the expression or activity of the gene. Such pharmaceutical
compositions are formulated based on the mode of delivery. One example is
compositions that are formulated for systemic administration via parenteral delivery.
        Pharmaceutical compositions including the identified agent are administered
in dosages sufficient to inhibit expression of the target gene, e.g., the Factor VII gene.
In general, a suitable dose of dsRNA agent will be in the range of 0.01 to
5.0 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, generally in the
range of 1 microgram to 1 mg per kilogram body weight per day. The pharmaceutical
composition may be administered once daily, or the dsRNA may be administered as
two, three, or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day or even
using continuous infusion or delivery through a controlled release formulation. In
that case, the dsRNA contained in each sub-dose must be correspondingly smaller in
order to achieve the total daily dosage. The dosage unit can also be compounded for
delivery over several days, e.g., using a conventional sustained release formulation
which provides sustained release of the dsRNA over a several day period. Sustained
release formulations are well known in the art and are particularly useful for vaginal
delivery of agents, such as could be used with the agents of the invention. In this
embodiment, the dosage unit contains a corresponding multiple of the daily dose.
        The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the
dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to
the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or
age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a
therapeutically effective amount of a composition can include a single treatment or a
series of treatments. Estimates of effective dosages and in vivo half-lives for the
individual dsRNAs encompassed by the invention can be made using conventional
methodologies or on the basis of in vivo testing using an appropriate animal model, as
described elsewhere herein.

         In particular embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the lipid
nucleic acid particles of the invention are prepared according to standard techniques
and further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Generally, normal saline
will be employed as the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other suitable carriers
include, e.g., water, buffered water, 0.9% saline, 0.3% glycine, and the like, including
glycoproteins for enhanced stability, such as albumin, lipoprotein, globulin, etc. In
compositions comprising saline or other salt containing carriers, the carrier is
preferably added following lipid particle formation. Thus, after the lipid-nucleic acid
compositions are formed, the compositions can be diluted into pharmaceutically
acceptable carriers such as normal saline.
         The resulting pharmaceutical preparations may be sterilized by conventional,
well known sterilization techniques. The aqueous solutions can then be packaged for
use or filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation
being combined with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administration. The
compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as
required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering
agents, tonicity adjusting agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sodium
lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, etc. Additionally, the
lipidic suspension may include lipid-protective agents which protect lipids against
free-radical and lipid-peroxidative damages on storage. Lipophilic free-radical
quenchers, such as a-tocopherol and water-soluble iron-specific chelators, such as
ferrioxamine, are suitable.
         The concentration of lipid particle or lipid-nucleic acid particle in the
pharmaceutical formulations can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.0 1%,
usually at or at least about 0.05-5% to as much as 10 to 30% by weight and will be
selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular
mode of administration selected. For example, the concentration may be increased to
lower the fluid load associated with treatment. This may be particularly desirable in
patients having atherosclerosis-associated congestive heart failure or severe
hypertension. Alternatively, complexes composed of irritating lipids may be diluted
                                                - 93 -

to low concentrations to lessen inflammation at the site of administration. In one
group of embodiments, the nucleic acid will have an attached label and will be used
for diagnosis (by indicating the presence of complementary nucleic acid). In this
instance, the amount of complexes administered will depend upon the particular label
used, the disease state being diagnosed and the judgement of the clinician but will
generally be between about 0.01 and about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight (e.g.,
of the nucleic acid agent), preferably between about 0.1 and about 5 mg/kg of body
weight. In some embodiments a complex administered includes from about 0.004 and
about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight of neucleic acid agent (e.g., from about
0.006 mg/kg to about 0.2 mg/kg).
         As noted above, the lipid-therapeutic agent (e.g., nucleic acid) particels of the
invention may include polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified phospholipids, PEG
ceramide, or ganglioside GMl-modified lipids or other lipids effective to prevent or
limit aggregation. Addition of such components does not merely prevent complex
aggregation. Rather, it may also provide a means for increasing circulation lifetime
and increasing the delivery of the lipid-nucleic acid composition to the target tissues.
         The invention also provides lipid-therapeutic agent compositions in kit form.
The kit will typically be comprised of a container that is compartmentalized for
holding the various elements of the kit. The kit will contain the particles or
pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, preferably in dehydrated or
concentrated form, with instructions for their rehydration or dilution and
administration. In certain embodiments, the particles comprise the active agent, while
in other embodiments, they do not.
         The pharmaceutical compositions containing an agent identified by the liver
screening model may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether
local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration
may be topical, pulmonary, e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols,
including by nebulizer; intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal), oral or
parenteral. Admininstration may also be designed to result in preferential localization
to particular tissues through local delivery, e.g. by direct intraarticular injection into
joints, by rectal administration for direct delivery to the gut and intestines, by

or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms,
gloves and the like may also be useful. Preferred topical formulations include those in
which the dsRNAs of the invention are in admixture with a topical delivery

        Compositions and formulations for parenteral, intrathecal or intraventricular
administration may include sterile aqueous solutions which may also contain buffers,
diluents and other suitable additives such as, but not limited to, penetration enhancers,
carrier compounds and other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.
        Pharmaceutical compositions include, but are not limited to, solutions,
emulsions, and liposome-containing formulations. These compositions may be
generated from a variety of components that include, but are not limited to, preformed
liquids, self-emulsifying solids and self-emulsifying semisolids.
        The pharmaceutical formulations, which may conveniently be presented in
unit dosage form, may be prepared according to conventional techniques well known
in the pharmaceutical industry. Such techniques include the step of bringing into
association the active ingredients with the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In
general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into
association the active ingredients with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or
both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.
        The compositions may be formulated into any of many possible dosage forms
such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gel capsules, liquid syrups, soft gels,
suppositories, and enemas. The compositions of the invention may also be formulated
as suspensions in aqueous, non-aqueous or mixed media. Aqueous suspensions may
further contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including,
for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran. The suspension
may also contain stabilizers.
        In one embodiment of the invention the pharmaceutical compositions may be
formulated and used as foams. Pharmaceutical foams include formulations such as,
but not limited to, emulsions, microemulsions, creams, jellies and liposomes. While
basically similar in nature these formulations vary in the components and the
consistency of the final product. The preparation of such compositions and
formulations is generally known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical and

3'-O-N,N'-diisopropyl-2-cyanoethyl-phosphoramidite are purchased from (Promega).
All phosphoramidites are used at a concentration of 0.2M in acetonitrile (CH 3CN)
except for guanosine which is used at 0.2M concentration in 10% THF/ANC (v/v).
Coupling/recycling time of 16 minutes is used. The activator is 5-ethyl thiotetrazole
(0.75M, American International Chemicals); for the PO-oxidation
iodine/water/pyridine is used and for the PS-oxidation PADS (2%) in 2,6
lutidine/ACN (1:1 v/v) is used.
3'-ligand conjugated strands are synthesized using solid support containing the
corresponding ligand. For example, the introduction of cholesterol unit in the
sequence is performed from a hydroxyprolinol-cholesterol phosphoramidite.
Cholesterol is tethered to trans-4-hydroxyprolinol via a 6-aminohexanoate linkage to
obtain a hydroxyprolinol-cholesterol moiety. 5'-end Cy-3 and Cy-5.5 (fluorophore)
labeled siRNAs are synthesized from the corresponding Quasar-570 (Cy-3)
phosphoramidite are purchased from Biosearch Technologies. Conjugation of ligands
to 5'-end and or internal position is achieved by using appropriately protected ligand
phosphoramidite building block. An extended 15 min coupling of 0.1 M solution of
phosphoramidite in anhydrous CH3CN in the presence of 5-(ethylthio)-1H-tetrazole
activator to a solid-support-bound oligonucleotide. Oxidation of the internucleotide
phosphite to the phosphate is carried out using standard iodine-water as reported (1)
or by treatment with tert-butyl hydroperoxide/acetonitrile/water (10: 87: 3) with 10
min oxidation wait time conjugated oligonucleotide. Phosphorothioate is introduced
by the oxidation of phosphite to phosphorothioate by using a sulfur transfer reagent

minutes.
Deprotection I (Nucleobase Deprotection)
After completion of synthesis, the support is transferred to a 100 mL glass bottle
(VWR). The oligonucleotide is cleaved from the support with simultaneous
deprotection of base and phosphate groups with 80 mL of a mixture of ethanolic
ammonia [ammonia: ethanol (3:1)] for 6.5 h at 55'C. The bottle is cooled briefly on
ice and then the ethanolic ammonia mixture is filtered into a new 250-mL bottle. The
CPG is washed with 2 x 40 mL portions of ethanol/water (1:1 v/v). The volume of
the mixture is then reduced to ~ 30 mL by roto-vap. The mixture is then frozen on
dry ice and dried under vacuum on a speed vac.
Deprotection II (Removal of 2'-TBDMS 2roup)
        The dried residue is resuspended in 26 mL of triethylamine, triethylamine
trihydrofluoride (TEA-3HF) or pyridine-HF and DMSO (3:4:6) and heated at 60'C
for 90 minutes to remove the tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) groups at the 2'
position. The reaction is then quenched with 50 mL of 20 mM sodium acetate and the
pH is adjusted to 6.5. Oligonucleotide is stored in a freezer until purification.
Analysis
The oligonucleotides are analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) prior to purification and selection of buffer and column depends on nature of
the sequence and or conjugated ligand.
HPLC Purification
The ligand-conjugated oligonucleotides are purified by reverse-phase preparative
HPLC. The unconjugated oligonucleotides are purified by anion-exchange HPLC on a
TSK gel column packed in house. The buffers are 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.5)

Example 6: In vivo rodent Factor VII silencing experiments.
         C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Labs, MA) and Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles
River Labs, MA) received either saline or formulated siRNA via tail vein injection at
a volume of 0.01 mL/g. At various time points after administration, serum samples
were collected by retroorbital bleed. Serum levels of Factor VII protein were
determined in samples using a chromogenic assay (Biophen FVII, Aniara
Corporation, OH). To determine liver mRNA levels of Factor VII, animals were
sacrificed and livers were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue lysates
were prepared from the frozen tissues and liver mRNA levels of Factor VII were
quantified using a branched DNA assay (QuantiGene Assay, Panomics, CA).
Example 7: Regulation of mammalian gene expression using nucleic acid-lipid
particles.
         Factor VII (FVII), a prominent protein in the coagulation cascade, is
synthesized in the liver (hepatocytes) and secreted into the plasma. FVII levels in
plasma can be determined by a simple, plate-based colorimetric assay. As such, FVII
represents a convenient model for determining sirna-mediated downregulation of
hepatocyte-derived proteins, as well as monitoring plasma concentrations and tissue
distribution of the nucleic acid lipid particles and siRNA.

        Factor VII Knockdown in Mice
        FVII activity was evaluated in FVII siRNA-treated animals at 24 hours after
intravenous (bolus) injection in C57BL/6 mice. FVII was measured using a
commercially available kit for determining protein levels in serum or tissue, following
the manufacturer's instructions at a microplate scale. FVII reduction was determined
against untreated control mice, and the results were expressed as % Residual FVII.
Four dose levels (2, 5, 12.5, 25 mg/kg FVII siRNA) were used in the initial screen of
each novel liposome composition, and this dosing was expanded in subsequent studies
based on the results obtained in the initial screen.
        Determination of Tolerability
        The tolerability of each novel liposomal siRNA formulation was evaluated by
monitoring weight change, cageside observations, clinical chemistry and, in some
instances, hematology. Animal weights were recorded prior to treatment and at 24
hours after treatment. Data was recorded as % Change in Body Weight. In addition
to body weight measurements, a full clinical chemistry panel, including liver function
markers, was obtained at each dose level (2, 5, 12.5 and 25 mg/kg siRNA) at 24 hours
post-injection using an aliquot of the serum collected for FVII analysis. Samples
were sent to the Central Laboratory for Veterinarians (Langley, BC) for analysis. In
some instances, additional mice were included in the treatment group to allow
collection of whole blood for hematology analysis.
        Determination of Therapeutic Index
        Therapeutic index (TI) is an arbitrary parameter generated by comparing
measures of toxicity and activity. For these studies, TI was determined as:
        TI= MTD (maximum tolerated dose) / ED50 (dose for 50% FVII knockdown)
        The MTD for these studies was set as the lowest dose causing >7% decrease in
body weight and a >200-fold increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a clinical

Example 8: General protocol for the extrusion method.
        Lipids (Lipid A, DSPC, cholesterol, DMG-PEG) are solubilized and mixed in
ethanol according to the desired molar ratio. Liposomes are formed by an ethanol
injection method where mixed lipids are added to sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.2.
This results in the spontaneous formation of liposomes in 35 % ethanol. The
liposomes are extruded through a 0.08 [tm polycarbonate membrane at least 2 times.
A stock siRNA solution was prepared in sodium acetate and 35% ethanol and was
added to the liposome to load. The siRNA-liposome solution was incubated at 37'C
for 30 min and, subsequently, diluted. Ethanol was removed and exchanged to PBS
buffer by dialysis or tangential flow filtration. A flow chart of this method is shown
in FIG. 1.
Example 9: General protocol for the in-line mixing method.
        Individual and separate stock solutions are prepared - one containing lipid and
the other siRNA. Lipid stock containing lipid A, DSPC, cholesterol and PEG lipid is
prepared by solubilized in 90% ethanol. The remaining 10% is low pH citrate buffer.
The concentration of the lipid stock is 4 mg/mL. The pH of this citrate buffer can
range between pH 3-5, depending on the type of fusogenic lipid employed. The
siRNA is also solubilized in citrate buffer at a concentration of 4 mg/mL. For small
scale, 5 mL of each stock solution is prepared.
        Stock solutions are completely clear and lipids must be completely solubilized
before combining with siRNA. Therefore stock solutions may be heated to
completely solubilize the lipids. The siRNAs used in the process may be unmodified
oligonucleotides or modified and may be conjugated with lipophilic moieties such as
cholesterol.
        The individual stocks are combined by pumping each solution to a T-junction.
A dual-head Watson-Marlow pump is used to simultaneously control the start and

stop of the two streams. A 1.6 mm polypropylene tubing is further downsized to a 0.8
mm tubing in order to increase the linear flow rate. The polypropylene line (ID = 0.8
mm) are attached to either side of a T-junction. The polypropylene T has a linear
edge of 1.6 mm for a resultant volume of 4.1 mm3 . Each of the large ends (1.6 mm)
of polypropylene line is placed into test tubes containing either solubilized lipid stock
or solubilized siRNA. After the T-junction a single tubing is placed where the
combined stream will emit. The tubing is then extending into a container with 2x
volume of PBS. The PBS is rapidly stirring. The flow rate for the pump is at a
setting of 300 rpm or 110 mL/min. Ethanol is removed and exchanged for PBS by
dialysis. The lipid formulations are then concentrated using centrifugation or
diafiltration to an appropriate working concentration.

Example 19: Role of ApoE in the Cellular Uptake of Liposomes in HeLa Cells.
        This study compared whether pre-complexation with human recombinant
ApoE may increase the uptake of our LNP05 neutral liposome formulation in vitro in
HeLa cells. Furthermore we compared the uptake of LNP05 plus or minus ApoE to
the uptake of two other liposomes LNPO1 (ND98, Cholesterol, and PEG-Ceramide
C16) and SNALP (PEG-cDMA;DLinDMA;DPPC;cholesterol) under the same
conditions.

Experimental protocol:
        HeLa cells were seeded in 96 well plates (Grenier) at 6000 cells per well
overnight. Three different liposome formulations of Alexa-fluor 647 labeled GFP
siRNA: 1) LNP01, 2) SNALP, 3) LNP05 were diluted in one of 3 media conditions to
a 50nM final concentration. Media conditions examined were OptiMem, DMEM with
10% FBS or DMEM with 10% FBS plus lOug/mL of human recombinant ApoE
(Fitzgerald Industries). The indicated liposomes either in media or in media
precomplexed with ApoE for 10 minutes were added to cells for either 4, 6, or 24
hours. Three replicated were performed for each experimental condition. After
addition to HeLa cells in plates for indicated time points cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes then nuclei and cytoplasm stained with DAPI and
Syto dye. Images were acquired using an Opera spinning disc automated confocal
system from Perkin Elmer. Quantitation of Alexa Fluor 647 siRNA uptake was
performed using Acapella software. Four different parameters were quanitifed: 1) Cell
number, 2) the number of siRNA positive spots per field, 3) the number of siRNA
positive spots per cell and 4) the integrated spot signal or the average number of
siRNA spots per cell times the average spot intensity. The average spot signal
therefore is a rough estimate of the total amount of siRNA content per cell.
Quantitation of Alexa-fluor siRNA uptake was performed only for the 6 hour time
point.
        FIG. 16 illustrates the effect of ApoE on various liposome formulations. The
uptake of more neutral charged liposomes SNALP and LNP05 into cells was
enhanced by the pre-complexation with human recombinant ApoE ay 6 hours. The
uptake into HeLa cells of the liposome LNPO1 which carried a positive charge was
unaffected by ApoE presence. The number of spots per field, spots per cell and
integrated spot intensity was enhanced roughly 3 fold for SNALP but dramatically
enhanced for LNP05 as much as 20 fold. Almost no uptake of LNP05 particles in the
absence of ApoE at 6 hours and even at 24 hours. ApoE binding to neutral liposomes
particularly LNP05 can dramatically enhance the cellular uptake of these lipid
nanoparticles.

Example 20: Efficacy of LNP08 liposomes show ApoE dependence of in mice.
         To further examine the role of ApoE in efficacy of various liposome
formulations, wildtype and ApoE knockout mice were administered LNP08 liposomes
containing the AD-1661 siRNA composition, at 0.2, 0.067, and 0.022 mg/kg. Figure
17 shows dose-dependent attenuation of FVII protein levels in wild type but not ApoE
deficient knockout mice when administered with LNP08 liposomes, suggesting a role
of ApoE in cellular uptake and/or delivery to the liver. Administration of LNP08 or
LNP05 liposomes premixed with different ApoE lipoprotein at different
concentrations results in reduction of FVII protein levels in the ApoE knockout mice;
attenuation of FVII protein levels were also observed in wild type mice using some,
but not all, ApoE containing liposomes (data not shown). Further, wildtype and ApoE
knockout mice were administered LNPO9 liposomes (LNPO9 is a lipid A-containing
LNP) containing the AD-1661 siRNA composition at 0.2 mg/kg. As shown in FIG.
18, lipid A activity could be rescued in ApoE knockout mice by premixing LNPO9 (an
lipid A-containing LNP) with ApoE.
Example 21: Incorporation of GalNAc lipids into liposome formulations.
         To explore potential alternate delivery mechanisms, in vivo experiments were
performed using liposome formulations comprising N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc)
conjugated lipids. GalNAc was chosen as a possible targeting ligand as it is known
that the GalNAc receptor is thought to be highly expressed in the liver. A study was
therefore performed using C57BL/6 and ApoE knockout mice essentially as described
in Example 6 to test the efficacy of the LNP08 formulations futher comprising various
concentrations of GalNAc3-DSG and GalNAc3-PEG-DSG lipids. In all experiments,
the total amount of PEG-conjugated lipids was kept constant (e.g., where 0.5% mol of
GalNAc3-PEG is added, the corresponding amount of PEG-DMG was decreased by
0.5 % mol to keep the total PEG-lipid at 1.5% mol). Three animals were used for each
of the nine groups per genotype in the experiment for a total of 54 animals:

           Each animal received 0.2 mg/kg of a saline control (PBS) or an AD-1661
(1661) siRNA composition targeting FVII expression, formulated as described in the
above table, via tail vein injection at a volume of approximately 0.01 mL/g. At
various time points after administration, serum samples were collected by retroorbital
bleed. Serum levels of Factor VII protein were measured as described above.
          The in vivo results of the mouse FVII silencing model with GalNAc lipids
included in LNP08 are provided in FIGs. 19a and FIG. 19b. The total mol% of PEG
lipids (i.e., the amount of GalNAc3 lipid and PEG-lipid) is kept constant at 1.5 mol%
relative to lipids. As shown in FIG. 17, both GalNAc3-DSG and GalNAc3-PEG
DSG showed silencing activity in wild type mice. GalNAc3-PEG-DSG rescued
silencing activity in ApoE KO mice.

        HeLa-GFP or Hep3B-GFP cells were seeded in 96 well plates (Greiner)
overnight at a density ranging from 8000-12,000 cells per well. Primary hepatocytes
were seeded at 20,000 cells per well similarly but on collagen coated plates. The
following morning LNP08 or LNPO1 formulated GFP targeted Alexa-fluor 647
tagged siRNAs were incubated in OptiMem, DMEM or DMEM with 10% FBS media
plus or minus concentrations of ApoE3 (Fitzgerald Research) ranging from 0.01 to
20ug/mL final in solution. Incubations were allowed to proceed for 10-60 minutes in a
37 degree incubator. Media was removed from cells cultured overnight and the
liposome mixtures +/- ApoE, added to cells for the indicated time periods ranging
from 15 minutes up to 6 hours. At that time cells were either fixed for 30 minutes in
4% paraformaldehyde and counterstained with DAPI to visualize nuclei, or incubated
for 30 minutes with 2ug/mL of Hoescht dye also to visualize nuclei and imaged live.
Images were acquired using an Opera spinning disk confocal imaging system (Perkin
Elmer) using a 20X objective. Quantitation of siRNA uptake into cells from the
images was performed using Acapella software (Perkin Elmer).
        As shown in FIG. 22, pre-complexation of lipid A liposomes dramatically
enhanced the uptake of lipid A liposomes into multiple cell types in vitro. Similar
results were obtained when uptake of LNPO1 vs. LNP08 +/- ApoE was examined in
primary hepatocytes.
Example 25: Uptake of BODIPY labeled Liposomes Pre-complexed with ApoE in

        The goal of these experiments was to investigate whether ApoE pre
complexation to liposomes increased the cellular uptake of the entire LNP particle as
compared to just the encapsulated siRNA. To perform these experiments a new
version of the lipid A was synthesized with a fluorescent BODIPY group attached.
This labeled lipid was incorporated at a 10% ratio of the total amount of unlabeled
lipid A in a standard LNP08 formulation.
        The uptake of these lipids was performed similarly to the above experiment
done with all unlabeled lipid A in the formulation. The difference being that following

AF647 (siRNA) and BODIPY (lipid A) channel were acquired. The amount of both
the siRNA and BODIPY labeled lipid in the presence and absence of ApoE after
image acquisition on the Opera system was determined again using Acapella
software.
         As shown in FIG. 23 (data are average of 30 fields, 10 each from 3 replicates
wells), experiments with labeled lipid A revealed that pre-complexation of liposomes
with ApoE enhanced the uptake of the entire lipid A based LNP containing the siRNA
and not just the siRNA itself.
Example 26: Effect of ApoE2, ApoE3, or ApoE4 on mRNA Silencing in HeLa-GFP
Cells.
         The goal of these experiments was to determine if pre-complexation of lipid A
containing liposomes with ApoE enhanced not only the uptake of the liposomes but
also mRNA target silencing.
         HeLa-GFP cells were seeded in 24 well plates overnight at a density of
-50,000 cells per well. The following morning LNP08 formulated GFP targeted
Alexa-fluor 647 tagged siRNAs were incubated in DMEM or DMEM with 10% FBS
media plus or minus concentrations of ApoE3 (Fitzgerald Research) ranging from
0.01 to 20ug/mL. Incubations were allowed to proceed for 10 or 60 minutes in a 37
degree incubator. Media was removed from cells cultured overnight and the liposome
mixtures +/- ApoE3, added to cells. After 24 hours incubation the media was removed
and the cells lysed in Lysis buffer (Epicentre) + Proteinase K (50ug/mL). Lysates
were incubated for 2 hours at 65 degrees with constant shaking. Lysates were
analyzed for GFP mRNA knockdown using the Quantigene branched DNA assay
from Panomics. Probes recognizing target GFP and housekeeping Gapdh were run in
triplicate for each sample. Data were expressed as a percentage of untreated control
GFP/Gapdh mRNA ratios. In some experiments (only when specifically noted)
alternative ApoE isoforms ApoE2 or ApoE4 were used for pre-complexation to
liposomes in place of ApoE3.
         As shown in FIGs. 24 and 25, pre-complexation with ApoE enhanced
silencing with lipid A containing liposomes. FIG. 26 demonstrates that other

isoforms ApoE2 or ApoE4 enhanced LNP08 silencing comparably to ApoE3 in HeLa
cells. These results suggest that ApoE3 as well as other isoforms of ApoE, either
ApoE2 or ApoE4 enhance the mRNA silencing mediated by lipid A containing
liposomes likely by mediating more efficient cellular uptake of the particles.

Example 28: Dose Response for Lipid A Liposome Formulations Containing
GalNAc in ApoE Knockout Mice.
         ApoE knockout mice were administered PBS, Lipid A LNP08 without
GalNAc, or Lipid A liposome LNP08 in which 0.15 mol% or 0.5 mol% of the PEG
DMG was replaced with the same molar % of GalNAc3 lipid of formula 3, at the
following dosages: 0.006 mg/kg, 0.02 mg/kg, 0.06 mg/kg, and 0.2 mg/kg FVII
siRNA. The total mol% of PEG lipids (i.e., the amount of GalNAc3 lipid and PEG
lipid) is kept constant at 1.5 mol% relative to lipids. The experiments were performed
as described in Example 6.
         The in vivo results of the dose response study are provided in FIG. 30. As
shown in FIG. 30, dose dependent reduction of FVII level was observed in ApoE
mice administered Lipid A formulations containing 0.15 mol% or 0.5 mol% the
GalNAc3 lipid of formula 3. There was little or no knockdown of FVII by Lipid A
formulation without the GalNAc3 lipid of formula 3 in ApoE knockout mice.
Example 29: Efficacy of Lipid A Formulations containing GalNAc in ApoE
Wildtype Mice.
         C57BL6 mice were administered PBS, Lipid A formulation with lipids ratio
(in molar %) of 57.5/7.5/30/5 (lipid A/ distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC)
/cholesterol/PEG-distyryl glycerol (PEG-DSG) lipid) without GalNAc3 lipid of
formula 3, or the same formulation containing 0.15 mol%, 0.5 mol%, or 1.0 mol%
GalNAc3 lipid of formula 3. The total mol% of PEG lipids (i.e., the amount of
GalNAc3 lipid and PEG-lipid) is kept constant at 1.5 mol% relative to lipids. Three
dose levels (0.1, 0.3, or 1 mg/kg) of FVII siRNA were tested when mice were
administered the formulation containing 1.0 mol% GlaNAc3 lipid of formula 3, and
                                               - 131 -

all other mice were tested at a dose of 1 mg/kg siRNA. The experiments were
otherwise performed essentially as described in Example 6.
         The in vivo results of this study are provided in FIG. 31. Previously, efficacy
of liposomes containing GalNAc lipids could not easily be shown in ApoE wildtype
mice, presumably due to predominance of the ApoE-dependent mechanism driving
liver uptake. However, by using 5 mol% C18-PEG (PEG-DSG)-containing
formulations, FVII knockdown was observed to be reduced. As shown in FIG. 31, the
liver uptake of siRNA was retarded when longer chain (C18) PEG conjugates were
used at 5 mol% in the formulation. However, replacement of 0.15 mol% to 1 mol%
of the PEG-DSG with the GalNAc3 lipid of formula 3 (also at 0.15 mol% to 1 mol%)
in this formulation restored knockdown of FVII in the ApoE wildtype mice,
indicating the ability of GalNAc conjugated lipid (e.g., GalNAc3-PEG-lipid) to target
the lipid nucleic acid particle to deliver to the liver, further suggesting that other
targeting lipids could be used in liposomes containing PEG-DSG to target to other
tissues.
Example 30: Efficacy of Lipid A Formulations in Various Tumor Cell Lines.
         Cells were seeded in 96 well plates at 15-20x10 3 per well overnight. On the
following day, four different liposome formulations of dsRNAs targeting KSP
(AD6248) and Luc (AD1955) were prepared. The formulations were as follows: 1)
LNP08- containing C14-PEG (PEG-DMG), 2) LNP08- containing C18-PEG (PEG
DSG), 3) LNP09- containing C14-PEG, and 4) LNP09- containing C18-PEG. The
dsRNA-liposome formulations were serially diluted from 500 or 600 nM in serum
containing media with or without 3 ug/ml of ApoE. Liposome formulations of Luc
targeted siRNA were used for normalization. 1 ug/ml ApoE was also tested for half
of the cell lines. Incubations were allowed to proceed for 15 to 25 minutes at 37 'C.
Media were removed from cells and 100 I of the liposome mixtures +/- ApoE were
added to the cells for 24 hour incubation. The next day, 100ul of lysis
mixture/nuclease free H 20 (1:2) and Proteinase K (10ul per ml) were added to the
cells and mixed at 65 'C for about 35 minutes. KSP mRNA levels were determined
by Quantigene 1.0 in comparison to the levels of GAPDH.

Stability assays with Lipid A liposome
        Fresh Lipid A liposome samples with loaded siRNA AD1661 were prepared
as described herein. These Lipid A liposome samples were incubated in 100 mM
NaOAc buffer (pH=5) at 37'C, and were subject to LC-ELSD analysis every other
day. Chromatographs at the indicated time points are shown in FIG. 32. The results
indicate that Lipid A samples are degraded under mild acidic conditions (pH=5).
        In order to examine whether degradation of Lipid A can be prevented by
addition of radical scavengers such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT or
butylhydroxytoluene), Lipid A-containing liposome formulation LNP08 with lipids
molar ratio of 60/7.5/31/1.5 (lipid A/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG-C14 lipid) loaded with
siRNA AD1661 containing BHT was tested in the stability assay as described above.
These samples were subject to LC-ELSD analysis at day 5. Chromatographs
comparing the stability of Lipid A liposome formulations with or without BHT were
shown in FIG. 33. The results indicate that the degradation of Lipid A under mild
acidic condition (pH=5) could be inhibited by BHT.
        In order to examine whether the degradation of Lipid A can be prevented by
antioxidants such as vitamin E, Lipid A-containing liposome formulation LNPO9
loaded with siRNA AD1661 containing various amount of vitamin E were tested in
the stability assay as described above. These samples were subject to LC-ELSD
analysis at day 5. Chromatographs comparing the stability of various Lipid A
liposome formulations with or without vitamin E were shown in FIG. 34. The results
indicate that the degradation of Lipid A under mild acidic condition (pH=5) could be
inhibited by vitamin E. Higher amount of vitamin E caused reverse effect.

         As illustrated in Figure 35, a decrease in efficacy was observed in the LDLR
KO mice when compared to the wildtype mice, consistent with the LDL Receptor
being a significant receptor for ApoE.
         The formulations were further tested wherein 0.5 mol% of the PEG-DMG was
replaced with GALNaC3-PEG-lipid (formula 3). The formulations comprising the
the GalNac3-PEG-lipids were tested mice (9 groups total, as shown in the table
below), and tested for FVII protein level as described above. As shown in Figure 36,
the formulations were no longer LDLR dependent, as shown by the equivalent
potency of the formulation in wildtype and LDLR knockout mice. Thus, the presence
of the targeting lipid such as the GalNAc lipid used here appears to alleviate the LDL
Receptor dependence of particles comprising Lipid A.
