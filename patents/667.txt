                                               ABSTRACT
              Trace amount levels of non-volatile mercury in crude oil are reduced by contacting
      the crude oil with a water stream containing at least a monatomic water-soluble sulfur species
 5    such as sulfides and hydrosulfides. The non-volatile mercury is extracted into the water phase
      forming a mercury rich wastewater, yielding a treated crude oil having at less than 50% of the
      original non-volatile mercury level. The wastewater can disposed or recycled by injection
      into a reservoir. In one embodiment, the water stream consists essentially of produced water.

 0    TECHNICAL FIELD
               [002]  The invention relates generally to a process, method, and system for removing
      mercury from hydrocarbon fluids such as crude oil.
      BACKGROUND
 5             [003]  Mercury can be present in trace amounts in all types of hydrocarbon streams
      such as crude oils. The amount can range from below the analytical detection limit to
      several thousand ppbw (parts per billion by weight) depending on the source.
               [004]  Methods have been disclosed to remove mercury from liquid hydrocarbon
      feed, specifically volatile mercury. It has been reported that mercury in crude is primarily in
 0    the form of volatile species, e.g., 90% Hg 0 and only 100 DMHg.          See Wilhelm et al.

               [005]    US Patent No. 4,915,818 discloses a method of removing mercury from
      liquid hydrocarbons (natural gas condensate) by contact with a dilute aqueous solution of
      alkali metal sulfide salt, for reaction of the sulfur component with the mercury, where the
      mercury sulfur compounds precipitate and settle for subsequent recovery as a solid waste.

      compound where mercury is removed as a solid. US Patent No. 6,350,372 discloses the
      removal of mercury from a hydrocarbon feed upon contact with an oil soluble or oil miscible
      sulfur compound      U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,896 discloses using polysulfide based absorbents to
      remove elemental mercury (Hg0 ) from gaseous and liquid hydrocarbon streams.

             [006] There are also a number of commercially available processes and products for
    the removal of (volatile) elemental mercury Hg0 from hydrocarbon streams including but not
    limited to ICI Synetix' Merespec TM fixed bed absorbents, UOP's HgSIVTM regenerative
    mercury removal adsorbents, and Johnson Matthey's Puraspec TM and PuracareTM granulated
  5 absorbents for the removal of mercury from naphtha and / or gaseous hydrocarbon streams.
    Adsorption technology does not work well for crude oils and condensates with low levels of
    mercury, and with primarily non-volatile mercury.
             [007]  Production of oil and gas is usually accompanied by the production of water.
    This produced water in some cases is reinjected into the subsurface for disposal, to maintain
 [0 pressure in the reservoir, or to achieve other beneficial effects. The produced water may
    consist of formation water (water present naturally in the reservoir), or water previously
    injected into the formation. As exploited reservoirs mature, the quantity of water produced
    increases. Produced water is the largest single fluid stream in exploration and production
    operations.
 [5          [008]  There is a need for methods for the removal of non-volatile mercury from
    liquid hydrocarbon streams, and particularly methods wherein produced water can be used /
    recycled.
    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 !o          [009]  In one aspect, the invention relates to an improved method to treat a crude oil
    to reduce its mercury concentration. The method comprises: extracting crude oil from the
    ground via a well with associated natural gas and produced water; separating dissolved
    natural gas and at least a portion of the produced water from the crude oil; mixing into the
    crude oil at least a portion of the separated produced water and a water-soluble reagent
25  containing a single sulfur atom selected from the group of water-soluble monatomic sulfur
    compound selected from the group of sodium hydrosulfide, potassium hydrosulfide,
    ammonium hydrosulfide, sodium sulfide, potassium sulfide, calcium sulfide, magnesium
    sulfide, and ammonium sulfide and combinations thereof forming a mixture; extracting at
    least a portion of the mercury into the water as a soluble compound forming a mercury rich
30  wastewater, separating the wastewater from the crude oil for a treated crude oil having a
    reduced concentration of mercury, and disposal of the mercury-rich wastewater via
    reinjection to an underground reservoir. In one embodiment, the water stream consists
    essentially of produced water. In another embodiment, the wastewater is injected into a gas
                                                     2

    or oil reservoir. In yet another embodiment, the wastewater is optionally treated before
    injection into a gas or oil reservoir.
             [010] In another embodiment, after separation of the treated crude oil having a
    reduced concentration of mercury from the mercury-rich wastewater, at least a portion of the
  5 mercury-rich wastewater is recycled and combined with the separated produced water and a
    water-soluble reagent to be contacted with the mercury-containing crude oil. In this way, the
    mercury-rich wastewater, which still contains unreacted water-soluble sulfur-containing
    reagent is recycled to reduce the total amount of sulfur-containing reagent required to
    accomplish removal of mercury from the crude oil. At least a portion of the mercury-rich
 [0 wastewater is disposed of via reinjection to an underground reservoir.

25  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
             [015] The following terms will be used throughout the specification and will have
    the following meanings unless otherwise indicated.
             [016] "Hydrocarbons" refers to hydrocarbon streams such as crude oils and / or
    natural gases.
30           [017]   "Produced fluids" refers hydrocarbon gases and / or crude oil. Produced
    fluids may be used interchangeably with hydrocarbons.
             [018] "Crude oil" refers to a hydrocarbon material, including to both crude oil and
    condensate, which is typically in liquid form. Under some formation conditions of
    temperature and/or pressure, the crude may be in a solid phase. Under some conditions, the
                                                    3

    oil may be in a very viscous liquid phase that flows slowly, if at all. Crude, crude oil, crudes
    and crude blends are used interchangeably and each is intended to include both a single crude
    and blends of crudes.
             [019] "Production well" is a well through which produced fluids are carried from an
  5 oil-bearing geological formation to the earth's surface, whether the surface is water or land.
    Surface facilities are provided for handling and processing the crude from the formation as it
    arrives on the surface.
             [020] "Topside production facility" refers to the surface hardware on an offshore oil
    platform or connected group of platforms, such as the oil production plant and the drilling rig.
 [0          [021]   "Injection well" is a well through which at least a treatment agent is passed
    from the surface facilities into the geological formation. In one embodiment, a well is
    alternatively employed in a producing and an injection mode. The well is alternatively
    employed for injecting a material into the formation for some period of time. The process
    conditions within the well are then adjusted to permit crude to flow into the well, from where
 [5 it is withdrawn to surface facilities.
             [022]  "Hydrocarbon material" refers to a pure compound or mixtures of compounds
    containing hydrogen and carbon and optionally sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen, and other elements.
    Examples include crude oils, synthetic crude oils, petroleum products such as gasoline, jet
    fuel, diesel fuel, lubricant base oil, solvents, and alcohols such as methanol and ethanol.
 !0          [023]    "Heavy metals" refers to gold, silver, mercury, osmium, ruthenium, uranium,
    cadmium, tin, lead, and arsenic. In one embodiment, "heavy metals" refers to mercury.
             [024]    "Trace amount" refers to the amount of heavy metals in the crude oil. The
    amount varies depending on the crude oil source and the type of heavy metal, for example,
    ranging from a few ppb to up to 60,000 ppb for mercury and arsenic.
25           [025]  "High mercury crude" refers to a crude with 50 ppbw or more of mercury,
    e.g., 100 ppbw or more of mercury; or 250 ppbw or more of mercury.
             [026]  "Mercury sulfide" may be used interchangeably with HgS, referring to
    mercurous sulfide, mercuric sulfide, or mixtures thereof. Normally, mercury sulfide is
    present as mercuric sulfide with a stoichiometric equivalent of one mole of sulfide ion per
30  mole of mercury ion.
             [027]  "Percent volatile mercury" in one embodiment is measured by stripping 15 ml
    of crude or condensate with 300 ml/min of nitrogen (N 2) for one hour. For samples which are
    fluid at room temperature, the stripping is carried out at room temperature. For samples
    which have a pour point above room temperature, but below 60'C, the stripping is done at
                                                       4

    60'C. For samples which have a pour point above 60'C, the stripping is at 10 C above the
    pour point.
             [028]  "Percent particulate mercury" refers to the portion of mercury that can be
    removed from the crude oil by centrifugation or filtration. After the centrifuging the sample,
  5 the mercury concentration is determined for the middle of the hydrocarbon layer. The sample
    is not taken from sediment, water or rag layers. The sample is not shaken or stirred after
    centrifugation. In one embodiment, percent particulate mercury is measured by filtration
    using a 0.45 micron filter or by using a modified sediment and water (BS&W) technique
    described in ASTM D4007-1 1. The sample is heated in accordance with the procedure. If
 [0 the two methods are in disagreement, the modified basic BS&W test is used. The
    modifications to the BS&W test includes: omission of dilution with toluene; demulsifier is
    not added; and the sample is centrifuged two times with the water and sediments values
    measured after each time. If the amount of sample is small, the ASTM D4007-11 procedure
    can be used with smaller centrifuge tubes, but if there is disagreement, the modified basic
 [5 BS&W test is used with the centrifuge tubes specified in ASTM D4007-1 1.
             [029]  "Hg-particulate crude" refers to a crude that contains 25% or more of its
    mercury content as particulate mercury.
             [030] "Predominantly non-volatile (mercury)" in the context of crudes refers crudes
    for which less than 50% of the mercury can be removed by stripping, e.g., less than 25% of
 !o the mercury can be removed by stripping; or less than 15%.
             [031] "Predominantly Hg-particulate crude" refers to a crude for which 50% or
    more of the mercury is particulate (non-volatile) mercury, e.g., with > 65% or more mercury
    as particulate mercury; with > 75% or more mercury as particulate mercury; or with > 90%
    or more mercury as particulate mercury.
25           [032]  "Halogens" refers to diatomic species from the column of the periodic table
    headed by fluorine, for example F2 , Cl 2 , Br 2 , 12, etc.
             [033] "Halogen oxides" refers to molecules which combine one or more halogen
    atoms and oxygen, for example NaCIO, C0           2 , NaCtO 4 .
             [034] "Flow-back water" refers to water that flows back to the surface after being
30  placed into a subterranean formation as part of an enhanced oil recovery operation, e.g., a
    hydraulic fracturing operation.
             [035]  "Produced water" refers to the water generated in the production of oil and
    gas, including formation water (water present naturally in a reservoir), as well as water
    previously injected into a formation either by matrix or fracture injection, which can be any
                                                          5

    of connate water, aquifer water, seawater, desalinated water, flow-back water, industrial by
    product water, and combinations thereof.
             [036] The invention relates to systems and processes for the removal of mercury
    from a crude oil. The system in one embodiment is located at a production facility, wherein
  5 produced water is used in the mercury removal process prior to transport. The wastewater
    containing mercury after the removal process can be injected into an underground facility,
    e.g., a reservoir.
             [037] Crude Oil Feedstock: Mercury can be present in crude oil feed as elemental
    mercury Hg0 , ionic mercury, inorganic mercury compounds, and / or organic mercury
 [0 compounds. Examples include but are not limited to: mercuric halides (e.g., HgXY, X and
    Y could be halides, oxygen, or halogen-oxides), mercurous halides (e.g., Hg 2 XY, X and Y
    could be halides, oxygen, or halogen-oxides), mercuric oxides (e.g., HgO), mercuric sulfide
    (e.g., HgS, meta-cinnabar and/or cinnabar), mercuric sulfate (HgSO 4), mercurous sulfate
    (Hg 2 SO 4), mercury selenide (e.g., HgSe 2, HgSe8 , HgSe), mercury hydroxides, and organo
 [5 mercury compounds (e.g., alkyl mercury compounds) and mixtures of thereof.
             [038]   Studies have been conducted to measure mercury levels in certain crude oil
    feedstock as well as the percentage of mercury in the feedstock in the forms of particles or
    particulate, which can be removed by filtration or centrifugation. It was shown that in these
    crude oil samples with more than 50 ppbw mercury, the percent mercury in particles which
 !o can be removed by laboratory filtration or centrifugation is over 25% with an average of
    73%. It is believed that the remaining 27% mercury is primarily in the form of fine particles.
    It was also shown that in these samples of crude oils and condensates, the predominant form
    of mercury is non-volatile, and not in the form of volatile elemental mercury Hg0 as indicated
    in the prior art, which can be readily removed from hydrocarbons upon stripping or sparging
25  with a low mercury gas stream.
             [039] The invention relates to the removal of trace mercury in crude oil that contains
    predominantly particulate or non-volatile mercury, referring to crudes containing mercury of
    which less than 50% of the mercury can be removed by stripping (or more than 50% of the
    mercury is particulate) in one embodiment; less than 35% of the mercury in the crude can be
30  removed by stripping in a second embodiment; and less than 25% of the mercury in the crude
    can be removed by stripping in a third embodiment. In the crude, the non-volatile mercury
    can be present in dissolved form, as particles, and / or adsorbed onto particulate surfaces such
    as clay minerals, inorganic mineral scale, sand, and asphaltenes and as suspended mercury
    sulfide.
                                                    6

             [040] The crude oil containing small amounts of heavy metals such as mercury has a
    specific gravity of at least 0.75 at a temperature of 60'F in one embodiment; at least 0.85 in a
    second embodiment; and at least 0.90 in a third embodiment. In one embodiment, the crude
    oil is in the form of a mixture of crude and water produced from a hydrocarbon reservoir, or
  5 from a production well. For some sources, the crude stream to be treated may contain little if
    any produced water. For some other sources, the amount of produced water can be as much
    as 98% of the crude stream to be treated. Crude oil feed to be treated refers to both crude oil
    by itself as well as crude oil-water mixtures.
             [041] Method for Removing Mercury: The non-volatile mercury in the crude oil is
 [0 removed by treatment with a treating solution containing at least a water-soluble monatomic
    sulfur species, e.g., sulfides and hydrosulfides, wherein the non-volatile mercury is extracted
    into the aqueous phase as soluble mercury complexes and wherein very little or no solid
    mercury complex, e.g., HgS, is formed. Very little or no solid mercury complex means than
    less than 1%of the mercury in the crude oil after extraction is in the form of a solid such as
 [5 HgS in one embodiment; less than 0.10% HgS is formed in a second embodiment; and less
    than 0.05% HgS in a third embodiment. The percent of solid mercury complexes can be
    determined by filtration, e.g., through a 0.45 micron (or less) filter.
             [042] In one embodiment, the treatment is in-situ in the formation, wherein the
    treating solution is injected into the formation in the process of water injection or water
 !o flooding. Water injection or waterflooding is a widely applied method of improved oil
    recovery, wherein water is used as the dilution fluid for injecting into the rock formation
    through a system of injection boreholes to facilitate recovery of hydrocarbons from
    subsurface formations. In another embodiment, the treatment is in-situ via pipeline reaction,
    wherein the treating solution is injected into the wellbore, and the reaction for the removal of
25  mercury occurs in the pipeline or borehole of the production well as the crude oil is being
    extracted.
             [043] In one embodiment prior to treatment with a treating solution, the crude oil
    stream produced from an oil reservoir via a production well prior to treatment is first passed
    to a separation device for the separation of the crude from dissolved natural gas and at least a
30  portion of the produced water. The separated natural gas can be directed to an absorber /
    scrubber for the removal of mercury separately.
             [044] The treating solution used to remove the non-volatile mercury is formed by
    combining at least a portion of the produced water with the water-soluble sulfur species,
    which may be added to the mixture as a concentrated solution in fresh or produced water.
                                                      7

    Examples of water-soluble monatomic sulfur compounds include sodium hydrosulfide,
    potassium hydrosulfide, ammonium hydrosulfide, sodium sulfide, potassium sulfide, calcium
    sulfide, magnesium sulfide, and ammonium sulfide.
             [045] After contacting the crude oil with the aqueous solution, the mixture is
  5 separated to produce a treated oil containing a reduced concentration of mercury and a
    mercury-rich wastewater. At least a portion of the mercury rich wastewater is injected into
    an underground reservoir which may be the same or different from the reservoir from which
    the crude oil containing mercury was produced. In one embodiment, at least a portion of the
    mercury-rich wastewater is recycled and combined with produced water and additional
 [0 sulfur-containing reagent to produce the treating solution for removing mercury from a
    mercury-containing crude oil.
             [046]  The monatomic sulfur compound ("additive") can be introduced
    continuously, e.g., in a water stream being brought into contact continuously with the crude
    oil stream in a crude processing facility, or intermittently, e.g., the injection of a water stream
 [5 containing the additive batch-wise into operating gas or fluid pipelines in a crude production
    facility. The water is non-potable water selected from any of connate water, aquifer water,
    seawater, desalinated water, oil field produced water, industrial by-product water, or
    combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the water stream consists essentially of produced
    water. In one embodiment, the water for use in the removal of mercury is from a water
 !o storage / treatment facility connected to the crude processing facility, wherein produced
    water, seawater, etc., is recovered and prepared with the addition of the monatomic sulfur
    compound needed for the removal of the heavy metals. The water containing the monatomic
    sulfur compound may be cold, heated, or at ambient temperature prior to being mixed with
    the crude oil.
25           [047]  The amount of additive needed for mercury removal is determined by the
    effectiveness of the monatomic sulfur compound employed.           The amount of sulfur used is at
    least equal to the amount of mercury in the crude on a molar basis (1:1), if not in an excess
    amount. In one embodiment, the molar ratio ranges from 5:1 to 50:1. In another
    embodiment, from 10:1 to 25:1. In yet another embodiment, the molar ratio of sulfur
30  additive to mercury ranges from 1.5:1 to 200000:1.
             [048]  In one embodiment, the additive is added to the crude oil in solution (aqueous
    form), at a volume ratio of water containing additive to crude oil ranging from 0.05:1 to 5:1
    in one embodiment; from 1:1 to 2:1 in a second embodiment; from 0.1:1 to 1:1 in a third
    embodiment; and at least 0.5:1 in a fourth embodiment. The pH of the water stream or
                                                     8

    treatment solution containing the additive is adjusted to a pre-selected pH prior to addition to
    the crude oil to at least 8 in one embodiment; at least 9 in a second embodiment; at least 10
    in a third embodiment; and at least 11 in a fourth embodiment. The pH can be adjusted with
    the addition of amines such as monoethanol amine, ammonia, diethanol amine, or a strong
  5 base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc. The base can be added
    concurrently with the additive solution, or separately before or after the addition of the
    additive to the crude oil, or intermittently in the mixing of the additive and the crude oil.
             [049] The contact with the additive for mercury removal is for any period of time of:
    at least thirty seconds, at least 15 minutes; at least 30 minutes; at least 1 hr.; at least 2 hrs.; at
 [0 least 4 hours; and at least 12 hours, forming an emulsion which subsequently separates into
    two phases, a water phase with mercury rich wastewater, and an oil phase with reduced
    mercury concentration.       After the conversion of the non-volatile mercury to the water
    soluble form, at least 50% of the non-volatile mercury originally in the crude is extracted into
    the water phase in one embodiment; at least 75% removal in a second embodiment; at least
 [5 80% removal in a third embodiment; at least 90% in a fourth embodiment; and at least 95%
    in a fifth embodiment. The treated crude stream contains less than 100 ppbw in non-volatile
    (particulate) mercury in one embodiment, less than 50 ppbw particulate mercury in another
    embodiment; and less than 10 ppbw in a third embodiment.
             [050]   The contact between the crude oil and the additive can be either via a non
 !o dispersive or dispersive method. The dispersive contacting method can be via mixing
    valves, static mixers or mixing tanks or vessels, or other methods known in the art. The non
    dispersive method can be any of packed inert particle beds, fiber film contactors, or other
    method known in the art.       The separation of treated crude from the aqueous phase can be
    carried out by methods known in the art, e.g., gravity settling, coalescing.
25           [051]   In one embodiment, the removal of mercury is carried out in an integrated
    unit, e.g., a single vessel having a contact zone for crude containing heavy metals to be in
    intimate contact with the additive, and a settling zone for the separation of the treated crude
    (with volatile mercury) from water phase. The additive can be mixed with the crude oil prior
    to entering the contact zone, or injected as a separate stream into the contacting zone. The
30  flow of the additive and the crude oil in the unit can be counter-current or concurrent. In yet
    another embodiment, the mercury removal is conducted in a single tower with a top section
    for the mixing of the crude oil with the additive and a bottom section for the separation of the
    treated crude from the water phase containing the removed mercury. In one embodiment, the
                                                      9

    top section comprises at least a contactor characterized by large surface areas, e.g., a plurality
    of fibers or bundles of fibers, allowing mass transfer in a non-dispersive manner.
             [052] In one embodiment, the equipment contains at least two contactors comprising
    fibers in series. The fibers in each contactor are wetted by the additive to form a thin film on
  5 the surface of fibers, and present a large surface area to the crude oil to be in contact with the
    same or different additive (e.g., sulfur-containing reagent). In one embodiment, the
    admixture of the treated crude oil and the additive exits the bottom of the first contactor and
    flows into the next contactor in series, wherein additional additive is introduced. The
    admixture exits the bottom contactor and is directed to a bottom separation section. In one
 [0 embodiment, the bottom section also comprises fibers to aid with the separation, wherein the
    mixture of treated crude oil and the aqueous phase flows through the fibers to form two
    distinct liquid layers, an upper layer of treated crude with reduced mercury content and a
    lower aqueous phase layer containing dissolved mercury species. Further details regarding
    the description of examplary treatment units are described in US Patent Publication Nos.
 [5 US20100200477, US20100320124, US20110163008, US20100122950, and
    US20110142747; and US Patent Nos. 7326333 and 7381309, and the relevant disclosures are
    included herein by reference.
             [053]   In one embodiment, the waste water containing extracted mercury after
    separation can be disposed by pumping it underground into a crude or oil reservoir (in
 !o production or depleted). In one embodiment, the waste water after separation is treated prior
    to disposal, e.g., including the removal of any suspended oil and solids prior to injection. The
    oil / water separation and water treatment can be carried out using processes and equipment
    known in the art, including separators, hydroclone, mesh coalescer, filter, membrane,
    centrifuge and the like for the oil / water separation; ion exchange, electrodialysis,
25  electrodialysis reversal, electrochemical, deionization, evaporation, electro-deionization,
    reverse osmosis, membrane separation, oxidation reactor, filtration, and combinations
    thereof.
             [054] In one embodiment, the waste water can be treated and regenerated by
    stripping to liberate the mercury into a vapor stream for removal via adsorption in a
30  conventional gas-phase mercury removal unit. Examples of a stripping gas for include but
    are not limited to air, N 2, C0 2 , H2 , methane, argon, helium, steam, air, natural gas, and
    combinations thereof       In one embodiment, the stripping gas is a gas that originally
    contained mercury, such as the natural gas removed from the crude oil before treatment with
    the aqueous sulfur-containing solution, but from which the mercury has been removed by an
                                                        10

    Hg adsorbent. In this fashion, a gas can be recycled between the mercury-rich wastewater
    water and an Hg adsorbent, with mercury in the aqueous phase being transferred to the
    adsorbent.
             [055] The mercury removal methods and equipment described herein may be placed
  5 in the same location of a production facility, i.e., subterranean hydrocarbon producing well,
    or placed as close as possible to the location of the well. In one embodiment, the monatomic
    sulfur additive is introduced to the oil-water mixture at the well head, for the simultaneous
    reaction to remove mercury from the crude oil to occur in the pipeline as the material flows to
    an oil processing facility located at a different location further away. The natural mixing in
 [0 the pipeline can be augmented with the use of mixers at the point of introduction of the
    monatomic sulfur additive, or at intervals downstream in the pipeline. Examples include
    static or in-line mixers. In another embodiment, the monatomic sulfur additive is introduced
    to the oil-water mixture in the well itself underground.
             [056] In another embodiment, the method is employed to remove predominantly
 [5 non-volatile mercury from crude during refinery processing steps that precede distillation.
    This reduces or eliminates mercury contamination in distilled products. In yet another
    embodiment, the mercury removal equipment is placed at an offshore facility for the
    production of oil and/or natural gas, such as but not limited to a floating production, storage
    and offloading (FPSO) unit. A FPSO is a floating vessel for the processing of hydrocarbons
 !o and for storage of oil. The FPSO unit processes an incoming stream of crude oil, water, gas,
    and sediment, and produces a shippable crude oil with acceptable properties including levels
    of heavy metals such as mercury, vapor pressure, basic sediment & water (BS&W) values,
    etc.
             [057]   EXAMPLES:       The following examples are given to illustrate the present
25  invention. However, that the invention is not limited to the specific conditions or details
    described in these examples.
             [058]   Example 1:    In this example, a sample of volatile Hg0 in simulated crude was
    prepared. First, five grams of elemental mercury Hg0 was placed in an impinger at 100'C
    and 0.625 SCF/min of nitrogen gas was passed over through the impinger to form an Hg
30  saturated nitrogen gas stream. This gas stream was then bubbled through 3123 pounds of
    Supurla@ white oil held at 60-70'C in an agitated vessel. The operation continued for 55
    hours until the mercury level in the white oil reached 500 ppbw. The simulated material was
    drummed and stored.

             [059]  Example 2:     The example illustrates the stripping of volatile elemental Hg
    from a crude. First, 75 ml of the simulated crude from Example 1 was placed in a 100 ml
    graduated cylinder and sparged with 300 ml/min of nitrogen at room temperature. The
    simulated crude had been stored for an extended period of time, e.g., months, and its initial
  5 value of mercury had decreased to about 375 ppbw due to vaporization (at time 0). The
    mercury in this simulated crude was rapidly stripped consistent with the known behavior of
    elemental Hg, as shown in Table 1, and contained little or any non-volatile (particulate)
    mercury. The effective level of mercury at 60 minutes and onward is essentially 0 as the
    detection limit of the mercury analyzed used for this test was 50 ppbw

             [061]  Example 3: The example illustrates the removal of mercury from a crude oil
    sample containing volatile mercury with a sulfur compound in the prior art, Na 2 Sn with n >=
    2. The crude oil prepared in Example 1 was mixed with aqueous sodium polysulfide in a
15  stirred batch reactor for 90 minutes after initially purging the reactor with nitrogen to remove
    oxygen. The ratio of oil volume to total volume of liquid in the reactor was 0.5, and
    concentration of sodium polysulfide in the aqueous phase was 1 wt%, equivalent to 0.57
    wt.% sulfur.    The mercury concentrations in the oil and aqueous phases were measured.
    Table 2 shows the mass fraction of mercury remaining in the oil and mercury extracted to the
20  aqueous phase over time, with greater than 90% of the mercury content in the oil was
    extracted to the aqueous phase. Centrifugation of the aqueous phase after separation from the
    oil layer did not reduce the mercury concentration, showing that the mercury extracted into
    water is a dissolved compound, e.g., an ionic species containing mercury and sulfur.

    mercury) and aqueous solution of sodium sulfide at 1 wt.% concentration (0.4 wt.% sulfur)
    were mixed at 80'C for 90 minutes. The mercury concentrations in the oil and aqueous
    phases were measured. Table 6 shows the mass fraction of mercury remaining in the oil and
    mercury extracted to the aqueous phase over time, with over 80% of the mercury in the oil
  5 being extracted to the aqueous phase. As shown, mercury was removed from the crude oil as
    a water-soluble mercury compound, contrary to the prior art's teaching of removing mercury
    as a solid precipitate. The removal of mercury as water-soluble mercury compound
    facilitates the disposal of the mercury via reinjection of the mercury-rich wastewater into to
    an underground reservoir.
