   Abstract
   The invention concerns an arrangement for moving and locking of slats of a slat
   arrangement, which are used in particular in building installations.
   An arrangement is proposed which enables, firstly, to lock the slats in all positions
 5 due to a self-locking functionality of an electromechanical drive train which couples to
   and with all slats, secondly, in a defined closed position of the slats an additional self
   locking effect occurs between a catch pin retainer and a follower lever associated
   with each slat, and thirdly, a latch pivoted the frame is displaced into of a recess of
   the slats whilst in the closed position which locks these in that position, so that an
10 opening from outside the slats arrangement without destroying the arrangement is
   prevented. Such arrangement is configured to achieve an RC3 classification.

 5 slat arrangement, which are used in particular in building installations.
   1A.     CROSS-REFERENCE TO EARLIER PATENT APPLICATIONS
           The present patent application claims Paris Convention priority from German
   patent application DE 10 2017 100 658. The contents and disclosure of the
   specification of that patent application is incorporated herein by way of shorthand
10 cross-reference
   2.      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           Slat arrangements, otherwise known in Australia as shutters, blinds or louvres,
   are commonly comprised of a plurality of rotatably or pivotally supported slats which
   may be moved (rather: rotated) back and forth between a closed and an open state
15 by means of a movement or gear mechanism (or arrangement). Patent documents
   US 2819065 A and US 3430383A disclose examples of such slat arraignments.
           Depending on the size and/or function of the slat arrangement, it may be
   required to lock the same in the closed position. As a result it is, for example,
   possible to decouple the movement mechanism and the drive from forces that are
20 generated in the process of sealing the slat arrangement with sealing elements. With
   a suitable locking means it is, moreover, possible to protect the slat arrangement
   from the direct effect of wind loads, or to effectively prevent a forced opening from
   the outside. Patent document JP H08-86162 A discloses an arrangement for such
   purpose.
25         A forced opening test for slat arrangements used in buildings may be
   performed according to DIN Standard EN 1627 (September 2011). According to this
   Standard, burglar-resistant windows are components which, apart from their usual
   functions, provide a defined level of resistance to intrusion attempts. Most slat
   arrangements (eg window shutters) are hard-pressed to make the RC2 classification.
30 In order to achieve a RC3 classification, an extraordinary effort is required.

            For aesthetic reasons, and for protection from the environment and to prevent
   dirt build-up, the movement mechanism is preferably disposed inside the slat
   arrangement. It is thus necessary to keep the entire arrangement for moving and
   locking the slats as compact as possible.
 5 A movement mechanism (or simply: movement), which incorporates a locking means
   and which is disposed within the frame of a slat arrangement, is disclosed in patent
   document DE 10 2009 005 594 B4. The movement consists of multiple levers on
   both sides of the slats. The levers are attached to individual slats via two revolute
   joints and to the frame via also two revolute joints. A further respective revolute joint
10 connects the movement to a drive element, which is able to move in a linear manner
   inside the frame, and to two of the levers. The lengths of the levers and positioning of
   the revolute joints is chosen such as to enable a tilting and outwards movement of
   the slats during the opening and closing movement. In order to lock the slats in their
   closed position, one of the levers is provided with a hook-like end which, when
15 closing the slat arrangement, engages with a bolt that is attached to the slat.
           One disadvantage of this movement mechanism is the relatively complex
   design / layout, which requires 12 revolute joints per slat. The greater the number of
   joints is in such a design, the greater the level of maintenance that is required.
            Patent document GB 1396285 A discloses a manually operated movement
20 means for a slat arrangement, in this case a window louvre. The slats are provided
   on both sides with a short shaft each, through which the pivoting axis of the slats
   extends.
           To facilitate the opening and closing of the slats, the shafts are pivotally
   supported in pivot bearings in the frame of the slat arrangement. In order to couple
25 the rotational movement of the individual slats, the end of one of the shafts on one
   side of the slats is attached to two coupling rods that are able to move in an
   antiparallel manner. The coupling rods are moveably engaged with two pins that are
   oriented axially parallel to the rotating axis, wherein said pins are attached to the
   respective shaft on both sides of the rotating axis. A plate with a slot-like cut-out is
30 attached to one of the coupling rods between the pivot bearings of two adjacent slats.
   An operating lever with handle is pivotally attached in approximately in the same
   position on the other coupling rod. On the side of the pivoting point opposite the

   handle, the operating lever is provided with a catch that engages with the slot-like
   cut-out in the plate. The catch is implemented as a rotatable roller on a bolt. As a
   result of the rotating motion of the operating lever, the coupling rods are moved
   antiparallel via the bearing of the operating lever and via the catch that is guided
 5 inside the cut-out. Said movement is transferred by means of the pins to the shafts,
   which causes all slats that are attached to the coupling rods to be rotated about the
   rotational axes.
          To be able to lock the slats in their closed position, the otherwise linearly
   extending, slot-like cut-out is provided with an angled end. This is where the catch of
10 the operating lever is located in the closed state of the slat arrangement. To provide
   the locking function, the angled end and the catch are positioned such in relation to
   the pivoting point of the operating lever that the catch, prior to reaching the angled
   end, must pass an inversion point after which the operating lever is retained in the
   locked position through a force that is extended by the slats. The location of the
15 inversion point is where the catch moves past an imagined connecting line that
   extends perpendicular to the movement vector of the coupling rods towards the
   pivoting point of the operating lever. The force that is extended by the slats is in this
   instance caused by the counter-pressure of the elastic sealing elements against
   which the slats are pressed in the closed state. The inversion point can only be
20 overcome by the manual rotating motion of the operating lever, which makes it
   impossible to open the slat arrangement from outside. The locking action would also
   work with a linearly extending cut-out, without the angled end. However, the angled
   end makes it possible to shorten the path of the operating lever that is required to
   achieve the locked position. One disadvantage is that after the inversion point has
25 been passed, the force acting on the sealing elements in the closed position is
   reduced again, which may have a negative effect on the sealing effect of the slat
   arrangement.
           Depending    on   the   size   of the   slat arrangement     it  may  also    be
   disadvantageous that only one movement means is provided for the locking of slats
30 that are coupled via the coupling rods. The sealing of the entire slat arrangement with
   the elastic sealing elements requires a certain contact pressure. The resulting motion
   resistance may cause a rather large mechanical load for the single movement
   mechanism or arrangement.

           In the implemented principle of the movement, five revolute joints per slat are
   required to be able to transfer the rotational movement, wherein greater tolerances
   must be allowed for for the moveable connection between the coupling rods and the
   pins, which poses an additional difficulty for providing a reliable sealing of the slat
 5 arrangement.
           Against this background, it would be advantageous to provide a movement
   and locking mechanism for slats of a slat arrangement (such as horizontal or vertical
   blinds, shutters or louvres for windows, doors and the like of a building) which is low
   in maintenance and consists of as few as possible and simple parts (components).
10         A particular benefit would flow from such improved movement and locking
   mechanism enabling the creation of a slat arrangement that meets RC3 classification
   according to the above mentioned DIN EN 1627 Standard.
   3.      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           In accordance with a first aspect, the present invention provides a mechanism
15 for opening, closing and locking of slats of a slat arrangement having at least one
   fully framed slat and a surrounding frame profile (also referred to as casing),
   comprising an opening drive unit, at least one coupling rod, at least one catch pin, at
   least one lever, at least one cam plate and at least one latch. Each of the slats is
   supported at its lengthwise-opposite ends to the blind frame profile via a respective
20 pivot bearing which together define an axis of rotation. At least one of the pivot
   bearings of each slat has a shaft with a first end-face, which is provided with a
   connecting piece to engage with the slat, and a second end-face. In embodiments
   having a single coupling rod, the other one of the pivot bearings of the slat is a non
   driven pivot bearing. In embodiments where a respective coupling rod is provided at
25 both longitudinal ends of the slat, the design of the movement mechanisms at both
   slat ends is mirror-symmetrical. The opening drive unit consists of a linear drive,
   either one or two tie (or connecting) rods and one or two corner drive assemblies,
   wherein the linear drive may be disposed either at the bottom or at the top on the
   horizontally extending part of the frame profile. In the instance that two connecting
30 rods are provided, the force is transferred to both connecting rods simultaneously,
   which then move in opposite directions. A motorised lever is attached to each
   connecting rod. The horizontal movements of the connecting rods are transferred via

   corner drive assemblies located in the corners of the frame into vertical movements
   of the lateral, vertically disposed coupling rods. A catch pin retainer with a catch pin
   and a lever is assigned to each driven pivot bearing. In this instance, the lever arm is
   attached non-rotatably with a fixed end thereof to the second end-face of the shaft.
 5 Provided in the lever is an angled slot comprised of (or subdivided notionally into) a
   first leg that is oriented radially with respect to the axis of rotation, an apex and a
   second leg that extends at an angle c to the first leg, wherein the catch pin retainer is
   rigidly attached to the coupling rod and the catch pin protrudes into said slot. This
   arrangement enables conversion of the linear movement of the coupling rod between
10 an upper and lower travel end-position into a rotational movement of the slat, via the
   catch pin retainer, catch pin, lever and pivot bearing, between a closed position and
   an open position. According to the invention, the second leg is oriented parallel to the
   coupling rod when the slat is closed as long as the catch pin is guided in the second
   leg between the upper end-position and the apex. This also means that the catch pin
15 transmits no rotational movement to the slat during its movement path between the
   upper end-position and the apex. This idle movement is utilised to achieve locking of
   the at least one slat either on one side or on both sides (where the slat has mirror
   symmetrical movement and locking mechanisms on either end.) Each lock has the
   same design, in that a cam plate is solidly attached to the coupling rod in a free
20 section. This preferably takes place left and/or right above or below of the driven
   pivot joint of the respective slat. A slot is machined into each cam plate, which is
   divided into two sections, wherein a first section extends parallel to the coupling rod,
   and the successive second section extends at a second angle P in the direction of the
   slat. A latch is assigned to each cam plate, wherein the latch is arranged non
25 rotatably at the frame profile. Moreover, the latch is provided with a guide pin which is
   arranged such that it protrudes into the slot of the cam plate. The latch protrudes into
   a recess that is machined into the blind frame and the adjacent, framed slat for the
   instance when the coupling rod has assumed its upper, travel-end position. In this
   end-position of the coupling rod, the guide pin is located at the end of the second
30 section of the slot, and all catch pins are located in the end sections of the second
   legs. The slats have simultaneously assumed the closed position. In the instance that
   the coupling rod is moved from the upper end-position to the lower travel-end
   position, the guide pin is moved away from the slat through the second section of the
   slot that is angled away, which causes the latch to move out of the recess. The latch

   is fully retracted out of the slat as soon as the guide pin has left the second section of
   the slot and has moved into the first section of the slot. At the same time, the catch
   pin is still located in the second leg or just at the apex of the slot.
        One significant advantage provided by the mechanism / arrangement according
 5 to the invention is that, firstly, the slats are locked in all positions due to the self
   locking of the electromechanical drive, secondly, in the vertical position of the slats
   (closed position) an additional self-locking effect occurs between catch pin retainer
   and lever and, thirdly, a latch pivots out of the frame into the closed slat and locks it
   so that an opening from outside is impossible without destroying the arrangement.
10 Implementing the movement mechanism configuration according to the invention can
   provide a slat arrangement that enables an RC3 classification.
        The invention will now be explained in greater detail in the following description of
   non-limiting embodiments which is provided with reference to the accompanying
   drawings.

   5.       DETAILED       DESCRIPTION       OF   PREFERRED        EMBODIMENT        OF THE
 5 INVENTION
           The significant components of a slats arrangement with opening / closing
   mechanism and slat movement locking arrangement according to the invention are
   illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. The slats arrangement comprises a frame profile or
   casing 1, a plurality of slats 2 arranged therein, which are pivotally attached to said
10 frame profile 1 via two pivot bearings 3 each, a linear drive 4, which is able to move
   coupling rods 7 disposed on the left and right sides of frame 1 linearly between an
   upper end-position 0 and a lower end-position U (see Fig. 2), catch pin retainer 8,
   levers 9, a cam plate 10 and a latch 11.
            Referring next to Fig. 2, the mechanism for opening and closing of a slat 2 will
15 now be described. The pivot bearing 3 with its axis of rotation 12 is provided in form
   of a cylindrical sleeve that is rigidly attached to the frame profile 1.
           The pivot bearing 3 supports a shaft 13 which rotates about axis of rotation 12.
   The shaft 13 is provided with a first end-face 14 and a second end-face 15. As best
   seen in Fig. 3, the first end-face 14 faces a slat 2 (illustrated in dotted outline only) to
20 which a connecting piece 16 is non-rotatably attached. The connecting piece 16 is a
   parallelepiped-shaped body with which an interlocking and frictional connection to
   slat 2 can be established. The second end-face 15 of shaft 13 is provided with a
   coaxially-disposed profile extension 17 to provide an interlocking and frictional
   connection to the lever 9.
25         The lever 9 consists of a strip-like, flat material with a fixed end 18 and a
   moveable end 19. The lever 9 lies flat against the second end-face 15 with its fixed
   end 18, and is non-rotatably attached to shaft 13 through an interlocking connection
   with the profile extension 17.
           The lever 9 is provided with an angled slot 20 that has a constant width b.
30 Said slot 20 is comprised of (or         notionally subdivided into) a first leg 21 and a
   straight second leg 22 with the apex S separating the two legs which are angled to
   each other. The included first angle a is 1350. The angled expansion 23, shown in

   Fig. 2, is optional but certainly advantageous, as will be explained later. The first leg
   21, which extends from the apex S to the fixed end 18, extends in radial direction
   with respect to the axis of rotation 12.
           A cylindrical catch pin 24 is disposed axially parallel to the axis of rotation 12
 5 and engages in slot 20. It has a slightly smaller diameter than the width b of the slot
   20 so that it is able to move with little play.
           The catch pin 24 is fixedly attached to a catch pin retainer 8. The catch pin
   retainer 8 is a body that is adjustably attached to a coupling rod 7.
           The coupling rod 7 is disposed with its longitudinal axis extending along the
10 frame profile 1, orthogonal to the axis of rotation 12 and at an axial distance to the
   axis of rotation 12. The coupling rod 7 has a circular cross-section and is supported
   along its axis inside two friction (or glide) bearings 25 for linear reciprocating
   movement along frame 1. The friction bearings 25 are disposed along the coupling
   rod 7, symmetrical at both sides of the pivot bearing 3, and are mounted in fixed
15 locations to the frame profile 1.
           The catch pin retainer 8, which supports the catch pin 24, is located on the
   coupling rod 7 between the friction bearings 25. To facilitate this, the catch pin
   retainer 8 is provided with a through-hole with which it is slid onto the coupling rod 7.
   The attachment of the catch pin retainer 8 on the coupling rod 7 is detachable by
20 means of grub screws 26 which are screwed in in radial direction to the coupling rod
   7.
           To enable controlled movement (rotation) of the slat(s) 2 between an open
   and a closed and locked state, the coupling rod 7 is attached via corner drive
   assembly 6 and connecting rod 5 to the linear drive 4. Suitable linear actuators 4 are
25 known from prior art and are not described here any further. The linear actuator 4 is
   used to linearly move the coupling rod 7 whilst supported at its friction bearings 25.
           Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 depict an enlarged section of the slat locking arrangement.
   As already indicated in Fig. 1, a cam plate 10 is attached to the upper end of the
   coupling rod 7. Like the catch pin retainer 8, the cam plate 10 is removably fastened /
30 attached to the coupling rod 7 by means of grub screws 26 which are screwed-in in
   radial direction to the coupling rod 7. A slot 28 is machined into one face of the cam
   plate 10, wherein slot 28 is subdivided into two sections, a first section 29 which

   extends parallel to the coupling rod 7, and an adjoining second section 30 which
   extends at a second angle     P (Fig. 5) in the direction of the slat 2. Assigned to the cam
   plate 10 is latch 11, wherein the latch 11 is mounted to the frame profile 1 by means
   of a connector 31. Moreover, the latch 11 is provided with a guide pin 32 which is
 5 arranged such that it protrudes into the slot 28 of the cam plate 10. As can be seen in
   Fig. 4, the latch 11 protrudes through a cut-out 33 in the frame profile 1 into a recess
   27 that is machined into the adjacent slat 2 framed by the frame profile 1. Fig. 2 and
   Fig. 4 depict a mechanism state in which slat 2 is closed and locked, wherein the
   coupling rod 7 is located in the upper end-position 0. Fig. 2 shows that the coupling
10 rod 7 can protrude slightly beyond the upper end-position 0. This guides the catch
   pin 24 into the angled extension 23 of lever 9, which causes pressure to be applied
   and results in a tight closing of the slat 2.
           Considering the forces required to move the slat 2, as well as considering the
   requirement for keeping the overall configuration as small as possible for integration
15 into the frame profile 1, the axial distance between the axis of rotation 12 and the
   coupling rod 7 and thus also the lever 9, are designed to be as small as possible. In
   the closed state, the lever 9 is at an approximate angle of 450 relative to the
   imaginary horizontal line H.
           The angle a and a radius r of the apex S of slot 20 to the axis of rotation 12
20 are matched to each other. In the embodiment shown in the Figures, the radius is r =
   45 mm and the angle is set to a = 1350. Within a range of c from >900 bis <1800,
   other values for the radius r and the first angle c are possible; however, in taking
   account of the above-stated requirements and of the usual opening angles of slats 2
   of a slat arrangement, only a first angle aYin the range between 1200 and 1500 is
25 practicable and meaningful. The values for the first angle a should be chosen such
   that the second leg 22 extends parallel to the coupling rod 7 in the closed state of slat
   2. Such configuration ensures that the slat 2 is already locked against opening from
   the outside, given that the coupling rod 7 is decoupled from any force application (ie
   moments about the axis of rotation 12). Decoupling of the coupling rod 7 is achieved
30 given that the catch pin retainer 8 is in form-fitting engagement with the frame profile
   1 in order to drive the slat 2, but is able to carry out the movement direction of the
   coupling rod 7.

           If an attempt is made to twist the slat 2 through an external force, said force is
   transferred from shaft 13 via the lever 9 to the catch pin 24. The torque acting on the
   catch pin 24 is directed almost perpendicular to the extension of the coupling rod 7
   due to the orientation of the second leg 22 of slot 20 in lever 9. The applied force is
 5 transferred via the catch pin retainer 8 and the coupling rod 7 radially to the friction
   bearings 25 and into the frame profile 1. A portion of the force that acts in axial
   direction of the coupling rod 7 is negligibly small, if it exists at all, so that any
   externally applied force on slat 2 cannot be transformed into a directed force in the
   movement direction of the coupling rod 7. Thus the linear actuator 4 that is attached
10 to the coupling rod 7 does not require high retaining forces, which means it may be
   designed as a correspondingly small and low-cost item. Moreover, as is apparent
   from Fig. 4, latch 11 additionally prevents an opening.
           The process of unlocking and rotating (ie opening) a slat 2 from its closed and
   locked state will now be explained with reference to Figures 6a to 6c. In Fig. 6a, the
15 coupling rod 7 has assumed and is in its upper travel end-position 0 (see also Fig.
   2). Further, to facilitate and gain a better understanding of the process, the relevant
   components of the movement mechanism and locking arrangement are not shown as
   in reality, above each other as in Fig. 1, but are shown beside each other and and
   one of the illustrations is rotated by 900 about the coupling rod 7 and in reference to
20 the other illustration. That is, the two side-by-side illustrations of Fig. 6a show one
   and the same coupling rod 7, but the illustration on the right is turned horizontally by
   900 from the elevation.
           During the controlled movement for opening of the slat 2 from its closed and
   locked state, the coupling rod 7 is linearly displaced downwards from the upper end
25 position 0 by the linear drive 4. Because the catch pin 24 is fixed to the coupling rod
   7, the former is simultaneously moved downwards within the second leg 22 of the
   slot 20, as is the case with the guide pin 32 in the second section 30 of slot 28 of cam
   plate 10, by a distance c. This distance c is 12 mm in the preferred embodiment.
   Because the second leg 22 extends parallel to the coupling rod 7, displacement of
30 the catch pin 24 within the second leg 22 causes at first no movement of the lever 9
   and thus also no movement of the slat 2. This is also of importance since the latch
   11, over the distance c from the upper end-position 0, still protrudes into the recess
   27 of the slat 2, which prevents the rotation of the slat 2. Only once the guide pin 32

   leaves the second section 30 and enters into the first section 29 of the slot 28 (see
   Fig. 6b), the latch 11 is moved out of the recess 27 so that the slat 2 is no longer
   locked. As displacement of the coupling rod 7 is continued, the guide pin 32 is then
   moved into the first section 29 of the slot 28, and since the first section 29 extends
 5 parallel to the coupling rod 7, the latch 11 no longer changes its position during a
   further displacement of the coupling rod 7 in the direction of the lower end-position U.
   During this same sequence, the catch pin 24 is moved and enters the first leg 21 of
   the slot 20 and pushes the lever 9 in the direction of the lower end-position U (see
   Fig. 6c). This causes shaft 13 to rotate about its axis of rotation 12, resulting in
10 rotational opening of slat 2.
           The controlled movement of the slat 2 may be continued until the lower end
   position U of the coupling rod 7 is reached. In the lower end-position U, the slat 2 is
   in the fully open state. The locations of the upper end-positions 0 and the lower end
   position U depend on the desired locations of the slat 2 in the open and closed state
15 and is determined by configuration of the linear actuator 4.
           In order to reach the lower end-position U, it is possible for the catch pin 24 to
   move past the imaginary horizontal line H. When moving past the horizontal line H,
   the catch pin 24 comes tangentially closer to the axis of rotation 12. The distance a
   between the axis of rotation 12 and the end of the first leg 21 is therefore chosen
20 such that the first leg 21 does not limit this tangential approach.
           It is understood that in a slat arrangement with a plurality of slats 2, as per Fig.
   1, each slat 2 is connected through a single lever 9, a single catch pin retainer 8 and
   a single catch pin 24 to the coupling rod 7 which is common to all slats 2. Multiple
   friction bearings 25 are provided along the (vertical section) of the frame 1 to
25 enhance guidance of the linearly moveable coupling rod 7. The number of friction
   bearings 25 corresponds to at least the number of slats 2, wherein an arrangement is
   preferred wherein respective friction bearings 25 are disposed symmetrically either
   side of the pivot bearing 3 of each of the slats 2. All slats 2 of the slat arrangement
   are moved collectively and synchronously by the coupling rod 7 propelled by linear
30 actuator 4.
           As will be noted from Fig.1, the preferred embodiment provides for a slat
   movement mechanism on either length-wise side of the slats 2 which extend parallel
   to each other within the surrounding casing (ie frame 1), although it is conceivable for

   the slats 2 to be moved by a single drive train located on one side only. As noted
   above, the two coupling rods 7 are coupled to and synchronously moved via corner
   drive elements 6 by a single, horizontally disposed linear actuator 4.
          The slat arrangement with its plurality of slats 2 and incorporating the inventive
 5 movement and locking arrangements described above, has the advantage of
   allowing individual and independent adjustment of the slats 2 with respect to the
   driving coupling rod 7, by virtue of the provision of the detachable mounts for the
   catch pin retainers 8 and the cam plate 10 at the coupling rod 7.
          A further possible embodiment is one in which two latches 11 are provided at
10 the surrounding frame 1 for and at each of the slats 2, thus improving the locking
   function. For reasons of stability it may be advantageous to provide two coupling rods
   7 instead of one coupling rod 7, which are then synchronously connected to each
   other.
