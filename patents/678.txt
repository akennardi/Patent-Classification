                                     Field of the invention
        This disclosure relates to an adjustable mounting assembly for mounting an
electrical module relative to a supporting surface.
                                Background of the invention
        Indoor electrical outlets are usually placed where they can be easily accessed by
 users, meaning that electrical outlets are usually visible and can therefore influence the
aesthetic appearance of an indoor surface, such as a wall.
        Trimmed electrical outlets can be aesthetically unappealing as they protrude
outwards from an indoor surface. Electrical outlets can be trimless and recessed into
the surrounding surface to provide a flush finish. While these trimless electrical outlets
are usually more aesthetically pleasing than trimmed electrical outlets, they can be
 laborious to install, often requiring accurate positioning during installation to achieve a
flush finish with the surface on which the installation is performed. Furthermore, walls of
different wall thicknesses require different positioning for a flush finish. Therefore any
 post-installation work on the surface, such as re-rendering, can affect the original flush
finish.
        Reference to any prior art in the specification is not an acknowledgment or
suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any
jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be understood,
 regarded as relevant, and/or combined with other pieces of prior art by a skilled person
 in the art.
                                  Summary of the invention
                                                    1

        According to the present invention, there is provided an adjustable mounting
assembly for mounting an electrical module relative to a supporting surface, comprising:
        mounting means adapted for embedded anchorage relative to the supporting
surface;
        a holder having an aperture for receiving and holding the electrical module, the
holder being adapted for moveable engagement with the mounting means to facilitate
adjustment of a position of the electrical module relative to the supporting surface; and
        fastening means for fastening the holder to the mounting means, the fastening
means being accessible for unfastening and refastening via the aperture to facilitate re
adjustment of the position of the electrical module relative to the supporting surface.
        The holder may include an engaging surface shaped to correspond with a
corresponding engaging surface of the mounting means to facilitate the movable
engagement. The engaging surface of the holder has an oval-shaped cross-section,
and the corresponding engaging surface of the mounting means includes a similar oval
shaped cross-section.
        The mounting means may include an opening for receiving the holder. The
fastening means, in a fastened configuration, may be clear of the opening of the
mounting means.
        The holder may include at least one angled contacting surface for contact with at
least one corresponding angled contacting surface of the fastening means. The
fastening means may include a dovetail-shaped washer for contacting the at least one
angled contacting surface.
        The supporting surface may be a substantially flat supporting surface, and the
mounting means may include a substantially flat portion for substantial alignment with
the flat supporting surface. The supporting surface may be any one of a wall surface, a
ceiling surface, and a floor surface.
        The assembly may further comprise a faceplate for covering an exposing side of
the aperture of the holder. The faceplate may be adapted to magnetically attach to the
electrical module. The faceplate may include one or more magnets.
                                                2

       The assembly may further comprise a back cover for covering an exposed side
of the aperture of the holder. The back cover may be made of silicon.

                         Detailed description of the embodiments
        Disclosed herein is an adjustable mounting assembly for mounting an electrical
module relative to a supporting surface. The disclosed assembly, when installed to the
supporting surface, enables a flush finish of the electrical module with the supporting
surface. As described further below, the disclosed assembly allows for adjustment of
the position of the electrical module relative to the supporting surface during installation,
as well as allowing for re-adjustment after installation, for example, when another layer
of rendering is applied which may be affect the original flush finishing.
        The supporting surface may be a surface of any supporting structure. For
example, the supporting structure may be an internal building structure, such as a wall,
a floor or a ceiling. As another example, the supporting structure may be a non-building
related structure or aesthetic finish, such as a joinery, a wardrobe or an island bench.
The supporting surface can be of any suitable material, wet or dry installed surface,
such as wood or timber, plasterboard, stone, tile, cement, glass, metal or the like. While
the following description uses a wall surface as a non-limiting example of a supporting
surface, the description is understood to be applicable to other types of supporting
surfaces.
        The disclosed assembly may be sold, packaged or otherwise provided in an
assembled form, a partly assembled, or an unassembled form. In a partly assembled or
an unassembled form, the assembly may be assembled by, for example, a builder or
tradesman on site. While some description herein is directed to the disclosed assembly
                                                  5

when assembled or installed to a wall surface, it should not be taken as describing that
the disclosed assembly is limited to an assembled form.
        Figures 1, 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B shows an arrangement of the disclosed assembly
10. Figure 1 illustrates the assembly 10 in an unassembled form, while Figures 2A, 2B,
3A and 3B illustrate the assembly 10 in an assembled form. The assembly 10
comprises mounting means 12, a holder 14 and fastening means 20. The mounting
means 12 is adapted for embedded anchorage relative to the supporting surface (not
shown). In one case, where the assembly is to be installed in a wall, the mounting
means 12 is embedded at least partially below the wall surface. For example, for a flat
supporting surface, such as a vertical wall, the mounting means 12 includes a
substantially flat portion 13 for embedment in substantial alignment with the wall. In this
example, the substantially flat portion 13 has an annular shape, and the embedment
may be achieved by plastering over the annularly-shaped substantially flat portion 13. In
some cases, the embedment (such as by the plastering) may provide sufficient
anchorage of the mounting means to the wall. In other cases, in-wall anchors or
construction adhesive (not shown) may be used to assist with the anchorage of the
mounting means 12 to the wall. For example, anchoring holes 15 are adapted to receive
in-wall anchors for additional anchorage.
        In the arrangement shown, the annularly-shaped mounting means 12 includes an
opening 12a adapted to receive the holder 14. In another arrangement (not shown), the
substantially flat portion of the mounting means may be half-annular (e.g. taking a
shape of only the bottom half of mounting means 12 shown in Figures 2A and 2B), and
such mounting means includes a cradle (instead of an opening) adapted to receive the
holder 14.
        The holder 14 includes an aperture 19 for receiving and holding an electrical
module, such as an electrical receptacle (see Figures 6 and 7) or an electrical switch
assembly (see Figure 8). The holder 14 is adapted for moveable engagement with the
mounting means 12. The movable engagement facilitates adjustment of a relative
position between the holder 14 and the mounting means 12, thereby facilitating
adjustment of a position of the electrical module relative to the supporting surface. Such
adjustment allows the assembly 10 to be used to achieve a flush finish for a range of
wall thicknesses.
                                                6

        The holder 14 includes one or more tracks (e.g. 14a and 14b) for engaging
fastening means 20. The fastening means 20 is adapted for fastening the holder 14 to
the mounting means 12, for example, once a desired relative position of the electrical
module relative to the supporting surface is reached. In the arrangement shown in
Figure 1, the fastening means 20 includes rim 20a, one or more screws 21 and one or
more washers 22. In this illustrated arrangement, the rim 20a is annular. In the
arrangement where the mounting means is half-annular, the rim is also half-annular. In
either arrangement, the rim 20a is secured or otherwise attached to the substantially flat
portion 13 of the mounting means 12, for example by adhesives such as epoxy glue or
fasteners such as screws. The rim 20a defines an opening 20b no smaller than the
opening 12a so as not to obstruct movement of the holder 14 relative to the mounting
means 12. To engage with the one or more screws 21, the rim 20a may include one or
more corresponding threaded screw holes (not shown), and/or the fastening means 20
may include a corresponding nut (not shown). Two washers, one for an upper arm and
another for a lower arm of the rim 20a, are illustrated. In other arrangements (not
illustrated), there may be more washers, such as two for the upper arm and another two
for the lower arm of the rim 20a.
        To facilitate the movable engagement between the holder 14 and the mounting
means 12, in the arrangement of Figure 1, the holder 14 includes an outer engaging
surface 16a shaped to correspond with a corresponding inner engaging surface 16b of
the mounting means 12. The pair of corresponding engaging surfaces 16a and 16b are
similar in cross-section (in size and/or shape) to allow the holder 14 and the mounting
means 12 to slide over each other. For example, in this arrangement, the holder 14 and
the mounting means 12 both have an oval-shaped cross-section, with the mounting
means 12 having a slightly larger cross-sectional size to accommodate and receive the
holder 14. Compared to a square or rectangular cross-section, the oval-shaped cross
section provides a smoother and curved surface, instead of any sharp corners, to assist
in a sliding motion between the holder 14 and the mounting means 12. Also, the oval
shape avoids complex pre-installation drilling and cutout in a variety of surfaces. For
example, an oval-shaped cutout may be achieved by performing cuts of two 50mm
holes (corresponding to a standard available electrical hole-saw size) and two straight
cuts between the outsides of these holes. The required finished surface cutout can be
quickly and simply completed in a variety of surfaces such as stone, tile, timber/wood
and metal. Further, as illustrated in Figures 6 and 7, the two curved opposite ends of
                                                7

the oval shape correspond to two outermost electrical receptacles, and each has a
semi-circle outline that is concentric at the respective receptacle. The two semi circles
are designed to follow closely the shape of a male electrical plug 80 (see Figure 8),
cooperating with the flush finish of an installed mounting assembly to provide a
minimalist appearance.
        As mentioned above, in the arrangement of Figure 1, the mounting means 12
includes an opening for receiving the holder 14. Upon receipt, the holder 14 may
movably engage the mounting means 12. Where the mounting means 12 has been
anchored in a wall, and where an electrical module has been received and held in the
holder 14, the movable engagement between the holder 14 and the mounting means 12
facilitates adjustment of a position of the electrical module relative to the supporting
surface. In turn, the adjustment of this relative position allows a flush finish of the
electrical module with a range of wall thicknesses.
         For example, Figures 2A and 2B show the holder 14 of the assembly 10
configured in one position (a first position), whereas Figures 3A and 3B show that
holder 14 is configured in another position (a second position), The movable
engagement allows the assembly 10 to be configured anywhere between the first and
the second position. Positions towards the first position tend to accommodate smaller
wall thicknesses, whereas positions towards the second position tend to accommodate
larger wall thicknesses.
         In the arrangement shown in Figure 1, to fasten the holder 14 to the mounting
means 12 once they are in a desired relative position, the one or more washers 22 and
the rim 20a may be arranged to sandwich and press against the one or more tracks 14a
and 14b of the holder 14 for securement via the one or more screws 21. Figures 4A to
4C illustrate an example of the fastening means 20 in an unfastened (Figures 4A and
4B) and a fastened configuration (Figure 4C) in respect of the holder 14. In this
example, the washer 22 takes a dovetail shape to accommodate the shape of the tracks
14b and the shape of the head of the screw 21. The washer 22 includes outer angled
contacting surfaces 22a and 22b, and an inner angled contact surface (denoted by
22c). The outer angled contacting surfaces 22a and 22b are flat and shaped to
correspond to two corresponding angled contacting surfaces 14c and 14d of the bottom
track 14b which are also flat. The inner angled contact surface (denoted by 22c) is
                                                 8

frustoconical and shaped to correspond to the screw head of the screw 21, which is
also frustoconical.
        Compared to an arrangement without the use of washer 22, the corresponding
surfaces when pressed against each other (22a with 14c and 22b with 14d), for
example, by tightening the screw 21 inserted through the washer 22 and the track 14b,
allow a greater contact area for more evenly distributing a pressing force to fasten the
holder 14 to the mounting means 12. Without the use of the washer 22, the curved
frustoconical contacting surface of the screw head of screw 21 does not engage the flat
surfaces of the track 14b as effectively as the arrangement using the washer 22. The
screw 21 may be tightened by, for example, threaded engagement with a threaded
screw hole (not shown) of the rim 20a or with a corresponding nut (not shown). Further,
the corresponding surfaces (22a with 14c and 22b with 14d) allow relative movement,
such as by sliding, between the holder 14 and the mounting means 12 while still
keeping holder 14 and mounting means 12 partially bound to each other. Further still,
the angled contacting surfaces 22a, 22b, 14c and 14d allow the screw 21 in a fastened
configuration to be clear of the opening of the mounting means 12. The clearance in
turn allows for more space to hold the electrical module.
        The fastening means 20 is accessible for unfastening and refastening via the
aperture 19, allowing for re-adjustment of the position of the electrical module relative to
the supporting surface. For example, Figures 5A and 5B illustrate the assembly 10
installed in thinner and thicker walls 50 and 51, respectively. In one scenario, Figure 5A
may represent an initial installation, whereas Figure 5B represents a modified wall
thickness, e.g. by additional rendering to the wall surface of Figure 5A. In both Figures
5A and 5B, the fastening means 20 of the installed assembly 10 can be accessed via
aperture 19, even after installation of the assembly 10. While only a portion of the wall
(50 and 51) is shown, it should be appreciated that the wall (50 and 51) extends beyond
the illustration of the figures and may fully enclose a room so that only the internal wall
surface is visible or accessible. Accessing the fastening means 20 via the aperture 19 is
therefore advantageous, since once the assembly is installed in a wall, it may be
impossible to reach behind the wall for any re-adjustment. The access to the fastening
means 20 via the aperture 19, which remains open (once the electrical module is
removed) even when the assembly is installed in a wall, facilitates re-adjustment of the
position of the electrical module relative to the supporting surface. This arrangement is
                                                 9

therefore particularly useful for post-installation adjustment for a flush finish, for
example, if due to another layer of rendering post-installation or other changes to the
wall thickness.
         In another arrangement, an assembly is provided with the holder 14 to hold an
electrical module, but without the mounting means or the fastening means. In this
arrangement, the holder 14 is directly inserted into a wall opening relative to a wall
surface. The holder 14 is attached, epoxy-glued, or otherwise secured to the wall
opening once a desired position of the holder 14 relative to the wall surface is reached.
This arrangement is particularly useful for installing a trimless electrical outlet in a thick
non-rendered solid stone wall or an already finished wall where rear access to the wall
is limited or not optional, where some wall surfaces in their current conditions, such as
in a heritage-listed building are required to be preserved as much as possible.
          As shown in Figures 6 and 7      (both of which include substantially the same
assembly as that shown in Figure 1), in some arrangements where the electrical
module is an electrical receptacle, the electrical receptacle includes an electrical cover
60 and 70 for covering the electrical receptacle that is being held within the holder 14.
The electrical cover can have one or more pin receptors 61 and 71 shaped to receive
an electrical plug or connector of an electrical appliance. In other arrangements, the
electrical cover 90 can have one or more slots 91 shaped to receive an electrical switch
assembly, as shown in Figure 9 (which includes substantially the same assembly as
that shown in Figure 1). In yet another arrangement (not shown), the slots 91 may be
shaped to receive data or switch mechanism, such as a data connecting device, via a
universal serial bus (USB)
         In other arrangements, the holder 14 may hold a distribution box and/or other
electrical DC or AC outlets.
        The disclosed assembly may include a faceplate 63 for the electrical module. For
example, as shown in Figure 6, the pin receptors 61 shaped to receive an electrical plug
or connector protrude above the surrounding surface of the electrical cover 60 to
engage corresponding cut-outs 62 of the faceplate. Furthermore, as seen in Figure 6,
the electrical cover 60 comprises one or more guiding channels 64, each terminating at
a recess within the guiding channel, so that the recesses are adapted to abut against
four guides 65 located within the holder 14. The electrical cover 60 may be affixed to
                                                 10

the holder 14 through, for example, fasteners extending through the recess into the
guides 65 and resides at a depth lower than the holder 14 for the insertion of a
faceplate 63.
       The faceplate 63 can cover the electrical cover 60 and any fasteners for the
guides 65 in order to obtain a flush finish with the wall surface. In some arrangements,
the faceplate 63 comprises a similar material, such as plaster, wood, metal, marble or
the like, as the supporting surface. In some arrangements, the faceplate 63 is
interchangeable and may be useful if the surface surrounding the adjustable mounting
assembly is changed.
       The faceplate 63 may be adapted to magnetically attach to the electrical module.
For example, the electrical cover 60 and faceplate 63 may contain magnetic material,
such as one or more magnets.
       As can also be seen from Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9, the adjustable mounting
assembly may include a back cover in the form of an open-ended box 66 or a flat cover
76 for covering an exposed side of the aperture 19 of the holder 14. The back cover
may be made of silicon, or other material. The back cover is designed to cover a back
side of the holder 14 to stop debris or dust from entering the aperture of the holder 14.
In some arrangements, the back cover may be puncturable to form one or more
openings for the passage of one or more electrical wires. Alternatively or additionally,
the body of the holder 14 may be puncturable to form openings, such as circular
openings. To aid the puncturing, for example, a substantial but not complete length of
the perimeter of each opening may be partially pre-cut to facilitate removal of a portion
of the holder 14. In one arrangement, four arcs along a circular opening have been pre
cut, leaving four short connections in between consecutive arcs to hold the removal
part. A user needs only break the short connections to remove the removal part to
expose the opening, through which electrical wires or cables may pass.
       It will be appreciated that the mounting means and holder can be of any shape,
for example, a square or rectangle and that multiple openings for the insertion of one or
more holders may be located anywhere within the mounting means.
       Figures 1OA-20 show further arrangements of an adjustable mounting assembly
10' for mounting an electrical module relative to a supporting surface. The same
                                                11

reference numerals are adopted for like components in the arrangements of Figures
10A to 20. Figure 10A illustrates an assembly 10' in an unassembled form, while
Figures 1OB-10C and Figures 11A-11C illustrate an assembly 10' in an assembled
form.
         The assembly 10' comprises a mounting means 12', a holder 14' and a fastening
means 20'. The mounting means 12' includes a substantially flat portion 13' that is
adapted for anchorage relative to a supporting surface. In one example, mounting
means 12' can be embedded relative to the supporting surface by plastering over the
rectangular shaped flat portion 13'. In some instances, this embedment may be
sufficient to anchor the mounting means 13' to the supporting surface. In another
example, the mounting means 12' can be anchored relative to the supporting surface
before plaster is applied by inserting one or more in-wall anchors through one or more
anchoring holes 15' located within the rectangular shaped flat portion 13'. As shown in
Figures 10 to 13, the mounting means 12' may be rectangular in shape. In alternative
embodiments other shapes may be adopted. Embodiments with a flat portion 13'
facilitate installations in which the assembly 10' is flush or substantially flush with a
supporting surface. Where one or more protrusions from the supporting surface is
desired, for example to achieve a particular aesthetic appearance around the electrical
connectors, then the one or more protrusions may be provided on the mounting means
12', for example integral with the mounting means 12'. The supporting surface may be
a surface of any supporting structure. For example, the supporting structure may be an
internal building structure, such as a wall, a floor or a ceiling. As another example, the
supporting structure may be a non-building-related structure or aesthetic finish, such as
a joinery surface, a wardrobe surface, an island bench surface or a furniture surface. In
one example, the furniture surface may be a bed head, table or desk surface.
         The mounting means 12' includes a support 36, which defines an opening 12a
that is adapted to receive the holder 14'. In some embodiments the support 36 is an
integral part of the mounting means 12'. The support 36 includes a projection or flange
that extends substantially transverse to the flat portion 13', whereby when the mounting
means 12' is anchored to a front or outer surface of the substrate forming the support
surface, the support 36 extends into a substrate of the support surface and when the
mounting means 12' is anchored to a back or inner surface of the substrate forming
support surface the support 36 may extend either out the back of the substrate or into
                                                 12

the substrate. In some embodiments the support extends transverse to the flat portion
13' to an extent approximately the same as the depth of a substrate to which the
mounting means 12' is anchored. In the arrangement shown in Figures 11B-11C one or
more wedges 37 are provided on an exterior surface of the flange of the support 36 to
engage the substrate of the supporting surface. The holder 14' includes a sidewall 26
connected to a rearwall 42 whereby the sidewall 26 defines an aperture 19 for receiving
and holding an electrical module (not shown). As shown in Figure 10, the sidewall 26
and/or rearwall 42 of the holder 14' can include one or more puncturable openings 28 to
form one or more openings for the passage of one or more electrical wires. In order to
assist puncturing of these openings and subsequent removal of a portion of the sidewall
26 and/or rearwall 42 of the holder 14', a substantial but not complete length of the
perimeter of each puncturable opening 28 is partially pre-cut or includes lines of
weakening.
        The holder 14' is adapted for moveable engagement with the mounting means
12'. The movable engagement facilitates adjustment of a relative position between the
holder 14' and the mounting means 12', thereby facilitating adjustment of a position of
the electrical module relative to the supporting surface. Such adjustment allows the
assembly 10' to be used to achieve a flush finish for a range of wall thicknesses. For
example, Figures 10B shows the holder 14' of the assembly 10' configured in one
position (a first position), whereas Figure 10C shows that holder 14' is configured in
another position (a second position), In another example, Figure 11 B shows the holder
14' of the assembly 10' configured in one position (a first position), whereas Figure 11C
shows that holder 14' is configured in another position (a second position).
        To facilitate the movable engagement between the holder 14' and the mounting
means 12', in the arrangement of Figure 10A-11C, the sidewall 26 of holder 14' is
shaped to correspond with the corresponding support 36 of the mounting means 12'.
The sidewall 26 and support 36 are similar in cross-section (in size and/or shape) to
allow the holder 14' and the mounting means 12' to slide relative to each other. For
example, in this arrangement, the holder 14' and the support 36 both have an oval
shaped cross-section, with the support 36 having a slightly larger cross-sectional size to
accommodate and receive the holder 14'. In alternative embodiments other shapes may
be adopted, for example, a circular-shaped cross section of the holder 14' and support
36.
                                               13

        Compared to a square or rectangular cross-section, an oval-shaped or circular
shaped cross section provides a smoother and curved surface, instead of any sharp
corners, to assist in a sliding motion between the holder 14' and the mounting means
12'. Also, the oval or circular shape avoids complex pre-installation drilling and cutout in
a variety of surfaces. For example, an oval-shaped cutout may be achieved by
performing cuts of two 48mm holes (corresponding to a standard available electrical
hole-saw size) and two straight cuts between the outsides of these holes. The holder
14' can further include one or more grooves 30 located on an exterior surface of the
sidewall 26 for engaging one or more corresponding tongues 32 of support 36 to assist
sliding of holder 14' with respect to the mounting means 12'.        Holder 14' may also
engage fastening means 20' via one or more tracks 34a-34d provided within the
sidewall 26 of holder 14". As shown by example in Figures 10-11, the holder 14' is
provided with a total of four tracks 34a-34d for engaging four washers 22', whereby two
tracks 34a-34b are provided on a lowermost portion of the holder 14' and two tracks are
provided on an uppermost portion of holder 14'. In another arrangement, the holder 14'
is provided with a total of two tracks 34a-34b for engaging two washers 22, whereby
one track 34a is provided on a lowermost portion of the holder 14' and another track is
provided on an uppermost portion of holder 14'.
       Fastening means 20' is adapted for fastening the holder 14' to the mounting
means 12', for example, once a desired relative position of the electrical module relative
to the supporting surface has been reached. In the arrangement shown in Figures 10
11, the fastening means 20' includes one or more screws 21 and one or more washers
22'
       The support 36 of mounting means 12' further includes one or more tracks 24a
24d for engaging one or more washers 22'. Each of these tracks 24a-24d may further
be provided with threaded screw holes (not shown) for engaging screws 21 inserted
through washers 22'.In the arrangement shown in Figures 10-11, the support 36 of the
mounting means 12' is provided with four tracks 24a-24d, whereby two tracks 24a-24b
are provided on an uppermost portion of holder 14'. In another arrangement, the
support 36 of the mounting means 12' is provided with two tracks 24a-24b, whereby
one track 24a is provided on a lowermost portion of the holder 14' and another track is
provided on an uppermost portion of holder 14'.
                                                14

        In the arrangement shown in Figures 10-12, the washer 22' takes a dovetail
shape to accommodate the shape of the tracks 34a-34d of the holder 14' and the shape
of the tracks 24a-24d of the support 36. Each washer 22' is provided with outer angled
contacting surfaces 25 and an inner angled contacting surface 22c. The outer angled
contacting surfaces 25 of each washer 22' engage corresponding inner angled
contacting surfaces 40 of each track 34a-34d of holder 14'. The inner angled contacting
surface 22c of each washer 22' is frustoconical and shaped to correspond to the screw
head of the screw 21, which is also frustoconical.
        As shown in Figure 11, to fasten the holder 14' to the fastening means 20' once
the holder 14' is in a desired relative position to the mounting means 12', the one or
more washers 22' may be arranged to sandwich and press against the one or more
tracks 34a-34d of the holder 14' and the one or more tracks 24a-24d of support 36' for
securement via the one or more screws 21.Tracks 24a-24d of rim 20a and tracks 34a
34d of holder 14' may permit screws 21 in a fastened configuration to be clear of the
opening 12a of the mounting means 12' and to provide more clearance for storage of
the electrical module.
        In one example, the materials of the holder 14', mounting means 12' and/or the
washers 22' may be selected from one of plastic, polycarbonate or metal such as cast
steel or aluminium      to provide increased friction between the inner angled contacting
edges 40 of the tracks 34a-34d and the outer angled contacting surfaces 25 of the
washers 22' during adjustment of holder 14' with respect to the mounting means 12'. In
order to provide additional friction during adjustment of the holder 14' with respect to the
mounting means 12', one or more serrations 23 may be provided on one or more inner
angled contacting edges 40 of each track 34a-34d and/or one or more corresponding
outer angled contacting surfaces 25 of washer 22'. In one example shown in Figure 12,
a plurality of serrations 23 are provided on the inner angled contacting edges 40 of track
34a to frictionally engage the serrated outer contacting surfaces 25 of washer 22'.
These serrations 23 may also assist in accommodating the mechanical load of the
electrical cover 60 and faceplate 63' when the mounting assembly 10' is in a fastened
configuration and installed into a supporting surface 50, as shown by example in Figure
13. In the arrangements shown in Figures 15-17 and 19-20 faceplate 63'-63"' are
dimensioned to be larger than electrical covers 60'-60" and 90' (corresponding to
electrical cover 60 and 90 described herein) and has an angled edge 66 located on its
                                                  15

rear surface 68 for engaging a groove 38 of the holder 14' (see Figure 10) in order to
obtain a flush finish with the supporting surface 50.
        In one arrangement, the faceplate 63' or 63" includes one or more cut-outs 62'
for engaging one or more protruding receptors 61' of the electrical cover 60' or 60". In
the arrangement shown in Figures 14-15 and 18-19, these cut-outs 62' are shaped as
an electrical plug or receptor cut-outs 86' for receiving an electrical plug and/or outlet
cover 92. In the arrangement shown in Figures 14-15 and 19, these cut-outs 62' may
also be shaped as a data mechanism, such as a universal serial bus 84. In another
arrangement, the electrical cover 90' and faceplate 63"' can have one or more slots 91'
shaped to receive an electrical switch assembly, as shown in Figure 20.
        In the arrangements shown in Figures 14 and 18-20, the faceplate 63'-63"'
further comprises an aperture 64 configured to receive a tool for removing the faceplate
63'-63"' from the electrical cover 60'-60" or 90' when installed into a supporting surface
50, for example, to gain access to the electrical cover. In some cases, the force applied
to remove the faceplate 63'-63"' via aperture 64 is enough to remove both the faceplate
63'-63"' and electrical cover 60'-60" or 90' from the mounting assembly 10' when
installed into a supporting surface 50. In yet another arrangement, the aperture 64
extends through the faceplate 63'-63"' and the electrical cover 60'-60" or 90' to receive
a tool for removing the faceplate 63'-63"' and electrical cover 60'-60" or 90' from the
mounting assembly 10'.
        One or more tabs 70 may also be provided on the rearward surface 68 of
faceplate 63'-63"' for engaging one or more corresponding apertures 72 located on a
front surface 74 of the electrical cover 60'-60" or 90'. In the arrangements shown in
Figures 15-17, the one or more tabs 70 are snap-fit joints connected to the rear surface
68 of faceplate 63' that comprise a hook 76 located at a free-end 78 of a beam 80.
During connection of faceplate 63' to the electrical cover 60', the one or more tabs 70
deflect upon insertion into the one or more corresponding apertures 72 of the electrical
cover 60'. Once the faceplate 63' has been connected to the electrical cover 60', the
one or more tabs 70 engage latch plates 82 located within the one or more apertures 72
of the electrical cover 60' into a locked position, as shown by example in Figure 16.
When a force is applied to remove the faceplate 63' from electrical cover 60', for
example, by a force being applied to aperture 64, the one or more tabs 70 deflect to
                                                 16

release from latch plates 82. As shown in Figures 15 and 17, one or more protrusions
84 may also be provided on the rear surface 68 of faceplate 63' to engage one or more
corresponding apertures (not shown) of electrical cover 60' for guiding and retaining
faceplate 63' with respect to electrical cover 60'.
        In the arrangement shown in Figure 20, the electrical cover 60"' includes a cover
plate 94' having one or more apertures 72 for receiving one or more tabs 70 and/or
protrusions of faceplate 63"' and one or more slots 91' shaped to receive an electrical
switch assembly. In another arrangement shown in Figures 18-19, the electrical cover
60" comprises a cover plate 94 and body 96. The cover plate 94 comprises one or more
protruding receptors 61', one or more apertures 72 for engaging the one or more tabs
70 and/or protrusions 84 of faceplate 63' or 63". The cover plate 94 is further provided
with one or more apertures 98 for engaging one or more fasteners to affix the cover
plate 94 to the body 96 of the electrical cover 60".The body 96 is provided with one or
more guiding channels 64', each terminating at a recess within the guiding channel, so
that the recesses are adapted to abut against four guides 65' located within the holder
14'. As shown in Figures 18-19, the body 96 may further comprise one or more
electrical connectors 98 for connecting one or more electrical wires to the electrical
cover 60".
        It will be appreciated that one or more of the mounting means 12', holder 14',
faceplate 63' and/or electrical cover 60' can be of any shape, for example, a square, a
rectangle or a circle. In one example, the mounting means 12', holder 14', electrical
cover 60' and faceplate 63' are shaped as a circle for receiving a single round electrical
outlet. In another example, the mounting means 12', holder 14' electrical cover 60' and
faceplate 63' are shaped as a rectangle for receiving one or more electrical switches
and/or one or more electrical outlets.
        It will be understood that the invention disclosed and defined in this specification
extends to all alternative combinations of two or more of the individual features
mentioned or evident from the text or drawings. All of these different combinations
constitute various alternative aspects of the invention.
