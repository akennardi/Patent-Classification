DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0037] A preferred embodiment of the golf club head 10 with structural connectors is shown in
FIGS. 1-8. The golf club head 10 preferably includes a body 20 having a striking face section 30
with a face center 34, a return section 32 extending rearwards away from an upper edge 31 of
the striking face section 30, sole section 22 extending rearwards away from a lower edge 33 of
the striking face section 30, a hosel 24 for engaging a shaft, a heel end 23, a toe end 25, an upper
opening 26, a hollow interior 27, and an aft end 28. A crown section 40 is comprised of the
return section 32 and a crown insert 42 that is placed over the upper opening 26 to enclose the
hollow interior 27. The body 20 also includes three cutouts 70, 72, 74 in a center area 21 of the
sole section 22, which are closed by a cover piece 80 having a density that is lower than the
density of the material used to make the body 20. Each of the crown section 40 and cover piece
80 preferably is composed of a carbon composite material, while the body 20 is composed of a
metal material such as titanium alloy or steel.
[0038] Within the hollow interior 27, two structural connectors 50, 52 extend from the sole
section 22 upward to the return section 32 approximately parallel with the rear surface 36 of the
striking face section 30 and with each other. In an alternative embodiment, the structural
connectors 50, 52 extend to the crown insert 42 instead; what is important is that the structural
connectors 50, 52 connect the crown section 40 to the sole section 22 proximate the striking face
section 30, without making contact with any portion of the striking face section 30, even when
the striking face section 30 impacts a golf ball. The structural connectors 50, 52 must, in any
event, be closer to the striking face section 30 than to the aft end 28 of the body 20.
[0039] As shown in Figure 3, the preferred embodiment has two structural connectors 50, 52,
each of which is a solid rod composed of a lightweight, strong metal material such as titanium
alloy or steel, though in an alternative embodiment the structural connectors 50, 52 each may be
a hollow tube or other hollow structure made of a strong lightweight metal or a composite
material. In another embodiment, the golf club head 10 may include both the solid rod and
hollow types of structural connectors 50. The structural connectors 50, 52 preferably are co-cast

                                                   11
[0040] In the preferred embodiment, each of the structural connectors 50, 52 has a diameter of
0.050 inch to 0.200 inch and a length of 1 to 2.5 inches. The structural connectors 50, 52 are
both preferably located within 1 inch of the rear surface 36 of the striking face section 30
measured along a vertical plane 60 extending through the face center 34 perpendicular to the
striking face section 30. No portion of any structural connectors 50, 52 should be located outside
of this 1-inch range; in fact, it is more preferable for each structural connector 50, 52 to be
located even closer to the rear surface 36 of the striking face section 30. In the preferred
embodiment, the structural connectors are spaced 0.136 inch to 0.210 inch from the rear surface
36, with the upper end 50a, 52a of each structural connector 50, 52 spaced a distance Di that is
slightly closer to the rear surface 36 than the spacing D 2 of the lower end 50b, 52b. In the
preferred embodiment, D1 ranges from 0.120 inch to 0.150 inch, while D2 ranges from 0.180
inch to 0.2 10 inch. The structural connectors 50, 52 are also spaced from one another by a
distance D 3 of 0.500 to 2.00 inch, more preferably approximately 0.75 to 1.50 inch, and most
preferably approximately 1.00 inch. This positioning of the structural connectors 50, 52
optimizes the normalized ball speed relationship to Characteristic Time (CT), as measured in ps
by the U.S. Golf Association (USGA) CT test.
[0041] Normalized ball speed removes the variable effect of a golf club head's mass and loft,
and the construction of a particular golf ball, from testing the speed of a golf ball upon impact
with any given golf club head, including the golf club head 10 of the present invention; in other
words, it allows an apples-to-apples comparison of golf club head performance. Normalized ball
speed can be determined for a golf club head using the following steps, which are also outlined
in the flow chart of Figure 9.
[0042] First, provide a titanium 6-4 calibration plate 90 with a mass of approximately 190
grams, a diameter D4 of approximately 4 inches, a minimum thickness T1 of approximately
0.100-0.150 inch, and a maximum thickness T2 of approximately 0.200-0.400 inch, as shown in
Figures 10 and 11, and strike the center 92 of the calibration plate with a test golf ball moving at
approximately 109 mph (step 100). Measure the return velocity Vbr of the ball (step 110). Then,
strike the same test golf ball, again traveling at approximately 109 mph, with the center 34 of the
striking face section 30 of the golf club head 10 being assessed (step 120), and measure the
rebound velocity Vcr of the test golf ball (step 130). Next, measure and record the mass of the
plate my, golf ball mb, golf club head 10 me, measured head test ball in velocity (109 mph
target) Vi,, measured plate test ball in velocity (109 mph target) Vbi,,, measured head test ball

                                                  12
return velocity Vcr, and measured plate test ball return velocity Vbr (step 140). Finally, calculate
the normalized ball speed (Vbalinorm) using the following equation (step 150):
                   mhVinh+mhVinh            (1+      )+     +          1+        +    _ -0.822]
      Vballnorm
                                                     mh + Mb
In this equation, Vinh is 100 and mh is 200.
[0043] The golf club head 10 of the present invention has a Vballnorm        0.0356x + 140.82, and
more preferably a Vballnorm      0.0356x + 141.19. The positioning of the structural connectors
50, 52 allow the golf club head 10 to satisfy this equation; as shown in Figure 12, prior art golf
club heads, which do not include the structural connector structure, fall well short of this
performance metric.
[0044] In addition to optimizing the normalized ball speed of the golf club head 10, locating the
stiffening members 50, 52 within the region of the golf club head 10 defined above has the
greatest stress-reducing effect on the golf club head 10. If any of the structural connectors 50, 52
are placed more than 1 inch away from the rear surface 36 of the striking face section 30, they
will not have a noticeable effect on the stress placed on the striking face section 30 when the
golf club head 10 is in use, and will use discretionary mass without providing a significant
performance benefit.
[0045] FIGS. 13-19 illustrate the contact surface area 55a and 55b between each of the
structural connecting 50 and 52 and the return section 32 of the body 20 of the golf club head
