                                            ABSTRACT
          Systems, methods, and devices are described for providing a fluid control means for
  an inflation system. The control directs fluid flow from an inlet to one or more outlets of the
5 control. The outlets are independently connected in fluid communication with the inlet by
  through the control. The control allows a user to create a fluid path between the inlet and a
  selected outlet by positioning the control in an orientation corresponding to the desired outlet.
  Each outlet is independently connected in fluid communication with the inlet in various
  orientations of the control.

   <removed-apn> (AU <removed-apn>). In the description in this specification, reference may be
   made to subject matter which is not within the scope of the appended claims. That subject

 5 [0003]     AU <removed-apn> is the national phase entry in Australia of PCT international
   application PCT/US2013/056518 (published as W02014/032029). The full disclosure of
   W02014/032029 is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
   Background
   [0004]     Orthopedic braces are often used to provide support to injured limbs. For example,
 0 ankle braces, knee braces and wrist braces are used when a bone is fractured or a ligament is
   sprained, or under conditions of arthritis or other injuries to aid a patient's recovery by
   supporting the injured area until it heals and regains strength. Patient comfort is an important
   consideration in designing and applying these braces, and most braces include cushioning
   that provides comfort for a user wearing the brace. This cushioning is usually in the form of
25 a foam pad or other compressible material lining the inside of the brace and contacting the
   patient's skin. In addition to foam pads, some braces also include inflatable components to
   provide comfort and allow a user to adjust the level of compression provided by the brace.
   An external pump or valve is provided to allow the user to increase or decrease the amount of
   fluid in the inflatable component and thereby adjust the amount of compression provided by
30 the brace.
                                                   -1-

   [0005]    While the use of inflatable components gives the user some control over
   compression, these cells often require an external pump in order to inflate and deflate the
   brace pads. If the pump is connected to the brace, it can be a bulky extra component on the
   outside of the brace, which can impair the wearability of the brace. If the pump is detachable
 5 from the brace, it may be inconvenient for the user to carry around so that he or she can
   inflate or deflate the brace, and the pump may be lost when it is not connected to the brace.
   [0006]    In many braces, a single pump and valve inflates or deflates the inflatable cells of
   the brace all to an equal pressure which does not allow a user to independently control the
   pressures in different inflatable cells in a brace. If a user desires more compression in one
 0 area and less in another, such a brace is unable to provide the customized compression
   desired by the user. In other braces, each inflatable cell of the brace has its own port that
   allows the user to selectively inflate or deflate individual cells. In these braces, multiple
   valves are provided with either multiple pumps connected to the valves or a single pump that
   is moved from valve to valve as needed to independently control the inflation and deflation of
 5 the corresponding individual cells. The pumps provided, such as hand-pump bulbs, are
   inconvenient to handle and can be easily lost if detached from the brace.
   Summary
   [0007]    Disclosed herein are systems, devices, and methods for providing braces having an
   on-board pump that inflates or deflates multiple inflatable cells. The braces provided include
 0 a control that allows a user to select between individual cells of the brace for inflation or
   deflation. A user selects an individual inflation cell using the control and then activates either
   a pump or release valve to inflate or deflate the cell to a desired compression pressure. With
   this control, the user is able to customize the compression provided in different areas of the
   brace. Additionally, the on-board pump is housed on the brace by a low-profile connection
25 and reduces the inconvenience of having an external pump.

   Detailed Description
   [0061]     To provide an overall understanding of the systems, devices, and methods described
   herein, certain illustrative embodiments will now be described. For the purpose of clarity and
   illustration, these systems, devices, and methods will be described with respect to an
 5 orthopedic walking brace applied to a wearer's lower leg and ankle. It will be understood by
   one of ordinary skill in the art that the systems, devices, and methods described herein may
   be adapted and modified as appropriate. These systems, devices, and methods may be
   employed in other suitable applications, such as for other types of braces that include other
   types of inflation components and dials, and that other such additions and modifications will
 0 not depart from the scope hereof.
   [0062]     Figure 1 shows a brace 100 configured to support a user's lower leg and ankle. The
   brace 100 includes a shell component 102 that has a footbed portion 114, a heel portion 116,
   and an upright support portion 118. The inside of the shell 102 is lined with three inflatable
   cells 104a, 104b, and 104c for cushioning and applying compression to a wearer's leg. In
 5 addition to cells 104a-c, the interior of brace 100 may include foam pads or other padding
   components to aid user comfort. The level of compression provided by the inflatable cells
   104a-c is controlled through a pump 106 and a release valve 108. A control, shown as a dial
   110 in Figure 1, allows a user to select one of the inflatable cells 104a-c for individual
   inflation or deflation to change the amount of compression applied to the leg by cells 104a-c.
 0 The dial 110 is a rotatable control, but other types of fluid controls that pass fluid from an
   inlet to an outlet may be used instead of a dial control.
   [0063]     The inflatable air cells 104a-c are positioned within the brace 100 to provide
   customizable support and compression to a wearer's leg. For example, the inflatable cell
   104a is positioned to support the back of the user's calf, and the inflatable cells 104b and
25 104c are positioned to support the medial and lateral sides, respectively, of the user's lower
   leg and ankle. The positioning of the inflatable cells 104a-c in different areas of the interior
   of the brace 100 allows a user to adjust the pressure provided by the brace in each of these
   three areas in order to increase comfort or to treat a particular injury. The user can selectively
   inflate or deflate each of the inflatable cells 104a-c until a suitable and comfortable
30 combination of pressures is provided by the inflatable cells. For example, to treat a particular
   injury, it may be preferable to have more compression in one area of the leg than in others.
   For example, if there is swelling on the medial side of the lower leg, the user may wish to
                                                    -11-

   inflate inflatable cell 104c to a higher pressure than inflatable cell 104a or 104b to decrease
   swelling on the medial side of the leg.
   [0064]    The control and selective inflation and deflation of the cells 104a-c is provided by
   the dial 110. The dial 110 is rotatable to multiple orientations, with individual orientations
 5 corresponding to inflation or deflation of one of the inflatable cells 104a-c. For example,
   when the dial 110 is in a first orientation, a fluid path is created between pump 106 and
   inflatable cell 104a, allowing user to inflate or deflate that individual cell. If the dial 110 is
   then rotated to a second orientation, a fluid path is created between the pump 106 and the
   inflatable cell 104b, and that cell is individually inflated or deflated. By positioning the
 0 dial 110 in a given orientation, the user can inflate or deflate a selected one of the inflatable
   cells 104a-c to the desired pressure while blocking air flow into and out of the other cells, to
   customize the inflation level of the selected cell. The user can select a different cell by
   adjusting the dial 110 to create a fluid path between that cell and the inflation source, which
   allows the user to adjust the inflation of that second cell without having to disconnect and
 5 move the inflation source. The user can similarly adjust the remaining third cell, to provide
   customized pressure in three different areas of the brace 100. While three inflatable cells are
   shown in Figure 1, a brace may include any suitable number of inflatable cells, for example
   two cells or more than three cells, that are individually inflatable and deflatable through a
   control.
 0 [0065]    The dial 110 has a single input port and three separate output ports. The fluid input
   is connected to the pump 106 and the release valve 108 by flow tube 120. The outlet ports of
   the dial 110 are connected to the inflatable cells 104a-c by flow tubes 122a, 122b and 122c,
   respectively. As the dial 110 is rotated through different orientations, flow paths across the
   center of the dial 110, and internal flow direction components of the dial, are created with
25 each of the flow tubes 122a-c. For example, in the orientation of the dial shown in Figure 1,
   a flow path is created between the pump 106 and the inflatable cell 104b through flow tubes
   120 and 122b. The flow path enters the control dial 110, passes through the center of the dial
   110 via interior flow channels, and exits through an outlet of a valve in the dial 110. At the
   same time, the paths between the pump 106 and inflatable cells 104a and 104c are sealed off
30 by the dial 110. When a user applies pressure to the pump 106, air is forced from the pump
   through the flow tube 120, into the dial 110, through the flow tube 122b, and into the
   inflatable cell 104b. Using the same fluid communication path, the user may also remove air
   from the inflatable cell 104b by pressing the release valve 108. Also in the orientation shown
   in Figure 1, an indicator 112a on the dial 110 identifies the particular inflatable cell, cell
                                                    -12-

   104b, with which a fluid path is created.     While the indicator 112a is shown as viewable
   through the window in the dial 110, an indicator may also be printed on the dial itself. In
   such embodiments, the support structure of the brace housing includes a window, arrow, or
   other indicator that highlights the correct indicator on the dial 110 for the wearer.
 5 [0066]    The dial 110 controls the flow pathways between the inflatable cells 104a-c and the
   pump 106 so that the inflatable cells are not in fluid communication with each other. In
   contrast to braces having a single pump that is in communication with multiple inflatable
   cells and inflates the cells equally, the brace 100 allows for customizable pressures in each of
   the inflatable cells. For example, in the orientation shown in Figure 1, while the fluid path is
 0 created with inflatable cell 104b, inflatable cells 104a and 104c are blocked by the dial 110
   from both the pump 106 and from the inflatable cell 104b. This ensures that the air pressure
   created within inflatable cell 104b is not communicated or equalized with the other two
   inflatable cells. In addition to creating separately controllable flow paths with each of the
   inflatable cells 104a-c, the dial 110 may also include an orientation that is an "off' position in
 5 which no fluid path is created between the pump 106 and any of the inflatable cells. In the
   off position, the inflation cells maintain a set pressure and are not inflated by pump 106 or
   deflated by release valve 108.
   [0067]    Once the desired pressure is set in the inflatable cell 104b, the user may rotate the
   dial 110 to set the pressure in one of the other inflatable cells. The dial 110 can include one
 0 or more grip components on the exterior surface of the dial to facilitate rotation of the dial.
   For example, ridges extend from the exterior surface of the dial 110 to facilitate grip and
   rotation by application of a force to the ridges. Alternative embodiments may include pads or
   other features to improve grip and facilitate rotation of the dial. For example, the user may
   rotate dial 110 to a second orientation shown in Figure 2. In this orientation, the flow path
25 between the pump 106 and the inflatable cell 104b is sealed by the dial 110, and a new flow
   path is created between the pump 106 and the inflatable cell 104a across the center of the dial
   valve. As in the first orientation shown in Figure 1, in this orientation the flow path with
   inflatable cell 104c remains sealed by the dial 110. In this orientation, the user is able to
   inflate or deflate inflatable cell 104a and set the desired level of compression for the back of
30 the leg covered by that inflatable cell.
   [0068]    A wearer may inflate the inflatable cell 104a to a pressure that is less than, greater
   than, or equal to the pressure in inflatable cell 104b depending on the user's comfort or the
   desire for more or less pressure based on the particular injury or swelling of the wearer's leg.
   Once the pressure in inflatable cell 104a is set to the desired level, the user may again rotate
                                                    -13-

    the dial 110 to a third orientation in which inflatable cells 104a and 104b are sealed off, and a
    flow path is created between the pump 106 and the third inflatable cell 104c. After setting
    the desired level of pressure in that inflatable cell, the user has customized the brace 100 with
    three potentially different levels of compression in the different areas of the leg supported by
 5  the inflatable cells 104a-c.
    [0069]    As indicated above, the dial 110 allows the user to switch between each of the
    inflatable cells 104a-c without having to use multiple pumps or reconnect a single pump to
    multiple different valves. The on-board pump 106 and release valve 108, housed within the
    shell 102 of the brace, maintain a low profile on the brace and eliminate the need for external
 0  pumping components to inflate and deflate the inflatable cells 104a-c. The use of the on
    board pump provides a brace that is easy to use with streamlined inflation, as only one pump
    is necessary (although other pumps could be used to supplement the inflation) and does not
    need to be disconnected or reconnected to multiple valves. The inclusion of the pump 106
    within the shell 102 also protects against the user losing or misplacing the pump. The on
 5  board pump and the simple mechanism for pumping air into the inflatable cells also makes
    the brace easy to use for elderly and injured patient populations that may have difficulty
    using other inflation systems.
    [0070]    Figure 3A shows a view of the on-board pump 106 and the release valve 108. This
    on-board assembly allows a wearer to apply air for inflation using the pump 106 and remove
 '0 air for deflation using the release valve 108. To inflate a cell, the user depresses the bladder
    124 of the pump 106. The depression of the bladder 124 forces air through one-way valve
    130, past the release valve 108, and into the flow tube 120. From the flow tube 120, the air
    passes through the dial 110 and into one of the inflatable cells 104a-c. When the user
    releases the bladder 124, the pump 106 refills with air through a one-way valve 126. The
25  one-way valve 126 maintains a seal while the user depresses the bladder 124, forcing the air
    in the bladder 124 through one-way valve 130 towards the flow tubing 120, but allows air to
    enter and refill the bladder 124 when the bladder is released. Because one-way valve 130
    does not allow air to pass from release valve 108 to the pump 106, a negative pressure in the
    bladder 124 is created when the bladder is depressed and pulls air in through the valve 126
30  until the bladder 124 is refilled. The one-way valve 130 thus allows air to pass from the
    pump to the inflatable cells, but prevents air from passing from the cells back to the pump
    when there is a negative pressure in the bladder 124. Because the one-way valve 126 does
    not let air escape the bladder 124, no air leaks from the system when a user is not using the
    pump 106.
                                                    -14-

    [0071]     A user releases air from a selected inflatable cell by depressing a button 128 of the
    release valve 108. When the button 128 is depressed, the release valve 108 opens a fluid path
    to ambient air. When this path is open, air leaks out of the release valve assembly. Thus,
    when the button 128 is depressed, an inflatable cell connected to the assembly through the
 5  dial 110 and the flow tube 120 will deflate as air leaves the inflatable cell and exits the brace
    at the release valve. When the wearer releases the button 128, the path to ambient air is
    closed, and the inflatable cell in communication with the release valve 108 is again sealed to
    maintain a constant pressure.
    [0072]     The pump and release valve shown in Figure 3A are merely illustrative, and other
 0  suitable inflation and deflation components may be incorporated into the brace 100. Figure
    3B shows a diagram of an illustrative flow circuit 400 that may accommodate different types
    of pumps or release valves in the brace. Flow circuit 400 includes a pump 404 and a release
    valve 408 that allow a user to inflate and deflate inflatable cells 412, 414, and 416. A dial
    410 is disposed between the release valve and the inflatable cells to allow for individual
 5  control over the cells.
    [0073]     In the flow circuit 400, fluid control dial 410 and one-way valves 402 and 406 direct
    fluid from the pump 404 into one of the inflatable cells 412, 414, and 416 for inflation and
    from the inflatable cells out of the circuit through release valve 408 for deflation. One-way
    valve 402 allows ambient air to enter the pump 404 for inflation and prevents the air from
 '0 leaking out of the pump into the ambient air. When the pump 404 is actuated, air flows only
    in the direction of one-way valve 406. The one-way valve 406 then prevents the pumped air
    from flowing back into the pump 404, and the pump 404 pulls more ambient air through the
    one-way valve 402 to refill the pump for subsequent actuation.
    [0074]     Air passes from one-way valve 406 through release valve 408 and dial 410 into one
25  of the inflatable cells 412, 414, and 416. Because the release valve 408 is positioned between
    the one-way valve 406 and the dial 410, a user can select a single one of the inflatable cells to
    deflate when release valve 408 is opened. By adjusting the dial 410 to select the desired cell,
    the flow circuit 400 provides the user with the ability to individually inflate a cell with the
    pump 404 or deflate the cell with the release valve 408.
30  [0075]     The combination of the pump 106 and the release valve 108 provides a single
    inflation and deflation component on board the brace 100. The single on-board pump
    minimizes the number of components needed to inflate the inflatable cells 104a-c and reduces
    the potential for loss of the inflation component, for example, compared to a brace that
    requires a wearer to use a separate component to inflate inflatable cells. The pump 106 and
                                                     -15-

   release valve 108 provide inflation and deflation to each of the multiple inflatable cells 104a
   c through the single flow tube 120 by the control afforded to a wearer by the dial 110.
   [0076]     Figure 4 shows a control dial 210, which may correspond to dial 110 of brace 100.
   While dial 210 is a rotatable dial component, other fluid controls and selectors can be
 5 incorporated with the fluid passages and control valves discussed herein. This view shows
   the body 138, single inlet port 132, and the three outlet ports 134a, 134b and 134c of the dial
   210. The dial 210, and other controls that include the valve components of the dial, are
   suitable for many applications in which selective fluid control is desired. The dial 210, for
   example, may be incorporated into a foot brace like the brace 100 in Figure 1, or another type
 0 of brace with multiple inflation components, for example braces for supporting a wrist or
   shoulder or other body part. In addition, the dial 210 and its interior valve components may
   be incorporated into another flow circuit outside of the orthopedic space in which convenient
   control between an inlet and multiple outlets is desired. The dial is suited to applications that
   require a low-profile valve, as the flow paths through the center of the valve and orientation
 5 of flow outlets within the dial can reduce the overall size of the valve. When the dial 210 is
   attached to a brace, such as the brace 100, the rim 140 of the body 138 abuts the exterior
   surface of the brace, and the ports 132 and 134a-c are disposed on the interior of the brace.
   In this configuration, the body 138 of the dial 210 is on the exterior of the brace, where it is
   actuatable and rotatable by a user, and the ports 132 and 134a-c are on the interior of the
 0 brace, where they are connected to flow tubes, such as flow tubes 120 and 122a-c of brace
   100. The body 138 includes a concave interior portion and a convex exterior portion. This
   shape allows the body to cover and shield the fluid control valve components that extend
   inward from the concave portion. The shape also provides for a low profile of the valve and
   facilitates gripping and adjusting of the valve as well as improving the appearance of the
25 valve.
   [0077]     Inlet port 132 can be coupled to an inflation or deflation component, for example
   pump 106 and release valve 108 of brace 100, by a flow tube, and each of the outlet ports
   134a-c is connected to inflatable cells, for example inflatable cells 104a-c of brace 100, by
   flow tubes. To select which inflatable cell is inflated or deflated, a wearer turns the dial 210
30 to the desired setting. At certain orientations of the body 138 of the dial 210, flow paths are
   created between the inlet port 132 and one of the outlet ports 134a-c through interior flow
   channels that pass through the center of the dial 210. Passing the flow paths through the
   center of the component, as opposed to around the outside of an interior component in the
   valve, can reduce the overall profile of the valve.
                                                   -16-

    [0078]    The body 138 of the dial 210 is dome-shaped and thus conceals the interior
    components of the dial when the dial is incorporated into a brace and the rim 140 abuts the
    exterior surface of the brace. This concealment allows the body to hide the interior
    components, reducing the chance that the components will be damaged and also contributing
 5  to the low profile of the dial, as a user sees only the exterior surface of the body 138. In
    addition, a manufacturer may print or adhere a label to the exterior top surface of the
    body 138 (not shown). The concave inner surface of the body 138 creates a protected void on
    the outside of a brace or other component that the dial 210 is connected to for the fluid
    control valve components to be placed. The convex outer surface of the body 138 protects
 0  those components and provides a sleeker appearance for the outside of the fluid control. This
    design, combined with the design of the internal valve components that extend from the
    interior convex surface, reduce the overall profile of the valve and dial and facilitate
    connection of the valve in a full fluid system provided on-board an inflation system, for
    example the brace 100 in Figure 1.
 5  [0079]    A viewing window 136 is cut from into the body 138 to allow a user to view an
    indicator, such as indicator 112a in Figure 1, identifying a selected inflatable cell. Such
    indicators can be provided in an arc underneath the body 138, and the window 136 can be
    sized such that only a single indicator is viewable in one orientation. The remainder of the
    indicators are hidden from a user's view by portions of the body 138 surrounding the
 '0 window 136. The window 136 provides the user with a quick indication which outlet of the
    flow valve within the dial 210 is selected and indicates when the valve is positioned between
    outlets. In alternative embodiments, a window may be provided on an extension of the
    housing itself, with a window cut out from the extension, and the indicators may be printed
    directly on the dial body. The housing extension blocks the dial on either side of the window
25  such that only an indicator on the dial positioned within the window is viewable by a user.
    [0080]    The body 138 includes an inner cylinder 142, shown in Figure 5A and clips 184a-f
    that extend from the interior surface of the body to engage the outer bore 144. In use, the
    outer bore 144 remains stationary, and rotation of the body 138 rotates the inner cylinder 142
    inside the outer bore 144 and the clips 184a-f around the exterior of the outer bore 144. This
30  rotation of the inner cylinder creates the desired fluid paths between inlet port 132 and outlet
    ports 134a-c, as discussed in more detail below with respect to Figures 7A-E. Because outer
    bore 144 remains stationary while the body 138 rotates, the ports 132 and 134a-c remain
    connected to flow tubes without risking tangling or removal of the tubes that may be caused
    if the outer bore 144 were quickly rotated.
                                                    -17-

    [0081]    Figure 5A shows an exploded view of the dial 210 with an outer bore 144 removed
    from an inner cylinder 142. This exploded view shows three inlet channels 146a-c of the
    inner cylinder 142. The inlet channels each extend from an opening in an exterior surface of
    the inner cylinder 142 and in towards the center of the cylinder. In three different
 5  orientations, one of the inlet channels 146a-c aligns with the inlet port 132 of the outer bore
    144 and allows air to flow into the interior channels of the inner cylinder 142, as discussed in
    more detail below with respect to Figures 7A-E. On the outlet side of inner cylinder 142,
    Figure 5B shows a single outlet channel 148 that extends from an opening in the exterior
    surface of the inner cylinder 144 in towards the center of the cylinder. The outlet channel
 0  148 aligns with one of outlet ports 134a-c in each of the three different orientations of the dial
    210. As discussed below, the interior channels 146a-c and 148 creates the flow paths and
    seals two of the outlet ports when a flow path is created with the other one of the outlet ports
    134a-c.
    [0082]    Figure 6 shows a bottom view of the dial 210 with the outer bore 144 removed,
 5  exposing the inner cylinder 142. The interior channels of the inner cylinder 142, including
    inlet channels 146a-c and the outlet channel 148, are shown by dotted lines. Each channel
    shown in Figure 6 has an opening in the exterior surface of the inner cylinder 142 and
    extends inwards through the interior of the cylinder. The channels form a t-shaped junction
    inside the inner cylinder 142. This view shows the three inlet channels 146a-c, which are
 '0 positioned near inlet port 132 shown in Figure 5B during use, and the outlet channel 148,
    which is positioned toward the side of outlet ports 134a-c shown in Figure 5B during use.
    Rotation of the dial 210 by a wearer to different orientations creates fluid flow paths from the
    inlet port 132 of the outer bore to the outlet ports 134a-c of the outer bore through the
    channels 146a-c and 148. When a fluid path is created between the inlet port 132 and one of
25  the outlet ports 134a-c, the outer wall 150 of the inner cylinder 142 blocks the remaining
    outlet ports as a result of the close fit between the inner cylinder 142 and the outer bore 144.
    [0083]    The positioning of the channels and ports directs flow within the cylinder. The flow
    pass from one of the openings in the exterior surface of the cylinder, through the interior
    channels that extend towards the center of the cylinder, and out from another opening in the
30  exterior surface of the cylinder. When the inner cylinder is coupled with the outer bore 144,
    the cylinder and bore can be adjusted such that the openings in the exterior surface of the
    inner cylinder align with selected opening in the interior surface of the outer bore. These
    openings lead to inlet or outlet ports of the outer bore, and the alignment of the openings
    creates the flow path from an inlet, through the center of the cylinder, and out an outlet of the
                                                    -18-

    bore. Figures 7A-E show illustrative views of the outer bore 144 and inner cylinder 142 in
    multiple orientations that create flow paths between ports and channels or constitute off
    positions in which no flow path is created between any ports. Figure 7A shows a first
    orientation of the outer bore 144 and the inner cylinder 142 in which a flow path is created
 5  from the inlet port 132 to the outlet port 134b, as shown by the arrow 152. In this
    configuration, air from a pump in fluid communication with the dial 210 enters the inlet port
    132 through an opening at the exterior end of the inlet port 132. The fluid passes through an
    opening in the interior of the outer bore, at the end of the passage through the inlet port 132,
    and then passes through an opening in the exterior surface of the inner cylinder that leads to
 0  inlet channel 146a. The fluid passes through the inlet channel 146 to the outlet channel 148
    and exits the inner cylinder at an opening in the exterior surface of the cylinder at the end of
    outlet channel 148. The fluid then exits the valve through a first opening in the interior of the
    outer bore, through the passage of outlet port 134b, and out through an opening at the exterior
    end of the outlet port 134b. From outlet port 134b, the air may pass through a flow tube and
 5  inflate an inflatable cell. For deflation, air can pass in the opposite direction of arrow 152
    from the inflatable cell out of the system through a release valve in fluid communication with
    inlet port 132.
    [0084]    Because of the geometry of the interior channels 146a-c and 148 and the location of
    the outlet ports 134a-c, the unused inlet channels 146a and 146c abut the interior surface of
 ,0 the inner wall 154 of outer bore 144 and the unused outlet ports 134a and 134c abut the outer
    wall 150 of the inner cylinder 142, thereby blocking the unused ports and channels from
    receiving fluid. The shape of the inner cylinder 142 and the inner wall 154 of the outer bore
    144 creates a close interference fit that results in the sealing of the unused channels and ports
    when those channels and ports are not aligned with each other. In the orientation shown in
25  Figure 7A, a first portion 156a of the inner cylinder wall 150 is positioned in front of and
    blocks the outlet port 134c, while a second portion 156b of the inner cylinder wall 150 is
    positioned in front of and blocks outlet port 134a. The interior channels 146a and 146c are
    blocked by the outer bore, as a first portion 156b of the outer bore wall 154 is positioned in
    front of and blocks the input channel 146a. A second portion 158a of the outer bore wall 154
30  is positioned in front of and blocks the inlet channel 146c. The interference fit prevents air
    from leaking out of the blocked interior channels. Also, the interference fit inhibits fluid
    communication between the inflatable cells, as the outlet ports 134a and 134c are sealed off
    from both inlet port 132 and the open outlet port 134b.
                                                     -19-

    [0085]    Rotation of the dial 210 changes the alignment of the inner channels 148 and 146a-c
    with the ports 132 and 134a-c and can create different flow paths through the dial 210. For
    example, clockwise rotation of the inner cylinder 142 from the orientation shown in Figure
    7A positions the cylinder in a second orientation shown in Figure 7B. In Figure 7B, a flow
 5  path is created between inlet port 132 and outlet port 134a, as shown by the arrow 164. In
    this orientation, air enters the inlet port 132 and passes through the inlet channel 146a to the
    outlet channel 148, which is aligned with outlet port 134a. When the dial is in this
    orientation, the user may inflate or deflate a second inflatable cell is in fluid communication
    with the outlet port 134a. In addition to a visual cue, for example the indicator 1 12a
 0  discussed above with respect to Figure 1, the dial 210 may provide a tactile feedback
    mechanism for indicating to a user that the dial 210 is in an orientation that allows for
    inflation. For example, the outer bore 144 includes protrusions 182a-e, shown in Figure 7B,
    around its perimeter that interact with clips 184 a-f, shown in Figure 4, that extend from the
    body 138 of the dial 210 to provide a tactile click when the inner cylinder 142 snaps into each
 5  orientation. The dial 210 also includes a tab 180 that extends outward from the perimeter of
    the inner cylinder 142 and contacts the protrusions 184a and 184f shown in Figure 4 during
    rotation of the outer bore 144 to create hard stops that limit the rotation of the dial 210. The
    tactile feedback mechanism and hard stop are discussed in more detail below with respect to
    Figures 8A-E.
 '0 [0086]    As shown, the unused channels 146b and 146c, as well as the unused outlet ports
    134b and 134c, abut the walls 150 and 154 in this second orientation, thereby blocking the
    unused channels and ports from the inlet fluid and providing a flow path inside the dial. For
    example, a first portion 160a of the inner cylinder wall 150 is positioned in front of and
    blocks outlet port 134b, and a second portion 160b of the wall 150 blocks the outlet port
25  134c. For the unused channels, a first interior surface (concave) 162a of the outer bore wall
    154 blocks the inlet channel 146c, and a second portion 162b of the wall 154 blocks the inlet
    channel 146b.
    [0087]    As shown in Figures 7A and 7B, the outlet ports 134a-c are installed so as to extend
    from a perimeter surface 155 of the outer bore 144, with each having an opening passing
30  through the surface 155 to the inner wall 152 of the bore. The respective openings for
    ports 134a-c are installed along the left half of the outer bore 144 and are spaced apart
    angularly, e.g., at approximately right angles between ports 134a and 134b, and at
    approximately 180 degrees between ports 134a and 134c. Port 132 is installed on the right
    half of the outer bore 144 at an angle of about 90 degrees with respect to ports 134a and 134c.
                                                     -20-

   As shown, the outlet ports 134a and 134c are positioned closer to outlet port 134b than to
   inlet port 132, and therefore rotation of the inner cylinder 142 to the orientation shown in
   Figure 7B positions the outer end of inlet channel 146c along the inner cylinder wall 150 at
   an angular position that does not overlap with inlet port 134c, thereby blocking fluid flow
 5 between inlet channel 146c and outlet port 134c.
   [0088]    Figure 7C illustrates an alternative orientation in which the inner cylinder 142 is
   rotated counterclockwise from the orientation shown in Figure 7A to create a third flow path,
   shown in Figure 7C. In this orientation, a flow path extends through the interior of the dial
   210 from inlet port 132 through inlet channel 146c and outlet channel 148 to outlet port 134c,
 0 as shown by arrow 166. This path allows the user to selectively inflate or deflate an
   inflatable cell that is in fluid communication with the outlet port 134c. The walls 150 and
   154 of the inner cylinder 142 and outer bore 144, respectively, again block the unused
   channels and ports in this third orientation. A first portion 168a of the inner cylinder wall
   150 blocks the outlet port 134b, while a second portion 168b of the wall 150 blocks the outlet
 5 port 134a. Also, a first portion 170a of the outer bore wall 154 blocks the inlet channel 146a,
   while a second portion 170b of the wall blocks the inlet channel 146b.
   [0089]    In the orientation shown in Figure 7C, a second hard stop is created by contact
   between the inner cylinder 142 and the clips extending from the body 138 of the dial 210.
   The hard stop prevents the inner cylinder 142 from rotating further in the counterclockwise
 0 direction from the orientation shown in Figure 7C. Prevention of this rotation avoids
   alignment of the inlet channel 146a with the outlet port 134a, which could compromise the
   single flow path created with the outlet port 134c.
   [0090]    In addition to the three orientations shown in Figures 7A-C, the dial 110 may
   include one or more "off' orientations in which no fluid flow path extends between the inlet
25 port 132 and any of the outlet ports 134a-c. In the "off' orientations, the wall 150 of the
   inner cylinder 142 blocks all of the outlet ports 134a-c, and the wall 154 of the outer bore 144
   blocks all three of the inlet channels 146a-c. In these orientations, the port openings on the
   interior surface of the outer bore 144 are misaligned with the channel openings in the exterior
   surface of the inner cylinder 142. When the openings are misaligned, there is no flow path
30 opened from one port to another through the center of the inner cylinder 142. Such an
   orientation may be desired, for example, when the user has set the desired levels of
   compression in all inflatable cells coupled to the dial 210 and does not want to accidentally
   inflate or deflate one of the inflatable cells. The interface between the respective ends of the
                                                   -21-

   channels and inner wall 150 can provide a fluid-tight seal between the channels and wall to
   block all fluid flow through the dial 210.
   [0091]    Figure 7D shows a first "off' orientation of the inner cylinder 142 and the outer bore
   144. In the orientation shown in Figure 7D, all of the ports 132 and 134a-c are blocked by
 5 the wall 150 of the inner cylinder. None of the channels overlap with the ports; instead all of
   the channels 146a-c and 148 of the inner cylinder are blocked by the wall 154 of the outer
   bore. As shown, four portions 172a-d of the wall 150 block each of the ports 134a-c and 132
   from fluid flow, respectively. Four portions 174a-d of the wall 154 block off each of the
   channels 146a-c and 148, respectively to stabilize the inflation levels of the cells. In this
 0 orientation, no air can enter the system through inlet port 132 or leave the system through
   outlet ports 134a-c, thus sealing the inflatable cells that are in fluid communication with
   outlet ports 134a-c and avoiding inadvertent inflation or deflation of the cells. The dial 210
   may include an additional indicator, similar to the indicators 112a and 112b discussed above
   with respect to Figures 1 and 2, to notify the wearer that the dial 210 is in an off position in
 5 which no inflatable cells can be inflated or deflated.
   [0092]    Figure 7E shows a second off orientation in which no inflatable cell can be inflated
   or deflated. As in Figure 7D, in Figure 7E each of the ports 134a-c and 132 and each of the
   channels 146a-c and 148 are blocked by the walls 150 and 154. For example, four portions
   176a-d of the wall 150 block each of the ports 134a-c and 132, respectively. Four portions
 0 178a-d of the wall 154 block each of the channels 146a-c and 148, respectively. As with the
   first "off' orientation of Figure 7D, the dial 210 may include another indicator similar to
   indicators 112a and 112b to alert the user that the dial 210 is in an off orientation.
   [0093]    Rotation of the dial 210 to discrete orientations is facilitated by mechanical
   interaction between the inner cylinder 142, outer bore 144, and body 138 of the dial 210. In
25 particular, the interactions between these components provide a tactile indication to a user
   when the dial 210 is rotated into each of the available orientations and prevents over-rotation
   of the dial that may otherwise compromise the individual flow paths that maintain
   independent control of the inflation levels of the cells. Examples of such mechanical
   interactions are discussed below with respect to Figures 8A-E.
30 [0094]    Figure 8A shows a cross-sectional view of the inner cylinder 142, outer bore 144,
   and clips 184a-f in the dial orientation depicted in Figure 7A. This cross-sectional view
   shows the interactions between protrusions 182a-e and clips 184a-f in this first orientation.
   Each of the clips 184a-f include notches, for example notch 186a on clip 184a and notch
   186b on clip 184b, on either end of the clip. The shape of the notches corresponds to the
                                                   -22-

   rounded shape of the protrusions and accommodates the protrusions in each orientation of the
   dial. In particular, in the orientation shown in Figure 8A, the protrusion 182a fits closely
   within notches 186a and 186b. These mechanical interactions allow a user to easily position
   the dial in the orientation shown in Figure 7A, and thereby create the desired flow path. In
 5 particular, the interaction between clips 184a-f and protrusions 182a-e allow a user to feel
   when the protrusions "click" into the notches when the dial is rotated. The position and
   spacing of the matches and protrusions thus provide a tactile indicator when the cylinder, and
   thus the interior channels, is properly oriented.
   [0095]    From the orientation depicted in Figure 8A, a user may turn the dial 210 in the
 0 direction or arrow B to a second orientation, such as the orientation shown in Figure 7B. To
   rotate the dial, the user must apply a starting force to the dial, in a clockwise or counter
   clockwise direction, that is sufficient to displace the clips outwards, for example in the
   direction of arrow A shown in Figure 8A for clip 184a, so that clips 184a-f rotate around the
   stationary outer bore 144. When the dial is rotated in the direction of arrow B different, each
 5 protrusion contacts clips and notches than in Figure 8A when the dial reaches a second
   orientation. For example, when the clips 184a-f and inner cylinder 142 in Figure 8A are
   rotated in a clockwise direction, protrusion 182a passes clip 184b and snaps into notch 186c
   of clip 184b and notch 186d of clip 184c. When the protrusion 182a reaches the notches
   186c and 186d, the user feels or hears a "click" that indicates a second orientation has been
 0 reached.
   [0096]    Figure 8B shows the orientation of the dial 210 when it is rotated clockwise from
   the orientation shown in Figure 8A. The orientation depicted in Figure 8B corresponds to the
   "off' orientation discussed above with respect to Figure 7E. In this orientation, the clips
   184a-f and inner cylinder 142 are rotated relative to the first orientation such that each
25 protrusion 182a-e is displaced in a counter-clockwise direction to a new set of notches in the
   clips. In order to rotate the dial further to a new orientation, the user again applies a rotation
   force to the dial 210 that is sufficient to displace the clips 184a-f outward and allow the
   protrusions 182a-e to pass the clips.
   [0097]    Figure 8C shows the orientation of the dial 210 when it is further rotated clockwise
30 from the orientation shown in Figure 8B. This orientation corresponds to the dial orientation
   shown in Figure 7B, in which a fluid path is created between inlet port 132 and outlet port
   134a. In this orientation, the clips 184a-f and inner cylinder 142 have again rotated such that
   the protrusions 182a-e are displaced to within a new set of notches, as protrusion 182a is now
   snapped into notch 186e of clip 184c and notch 186f of clip 184d.
                                                    -23-

    [0098]    In addition to the tactile feedback indicating that the dial has reached a new
    orientation, a hard stop is created by contact between the outer bore 144 and inner cylinder
    142 in the orientation shown in Figure 8C. Specifically, an edge 188a of the outer bore 144
    contacts a side wall 190a of the tab 180 that extends from the inner cylinder 142. This
 5  contact prevents the dial 210 from rotating further in a clockwise direction if the user applies
    a further rotational force. As discussed above with respect to Figure 7B, this hard stop
    prevents over-rotation of the dial that could compromise the individualized inflation and
    deflation control of inflatable cells that are in fluid communication with the dial 210. Thus,
    the tab 180 limits the rotational range of the dial 210, and the dial can only be rotated in a
 0  counter-clockwise direction from the orientation shown in Figure 8C.
    [0099]    When the user applies a counter-clockwise force to the dial 210 in the orientation
    shown in Figure 8C in the direction of arrow C, the dial rotates back through each of the
    orientations shown in Figure 8B and 8A and into the orientation shown in Figure 8D. This
    orientation corresponds to the "off' orientation shown in Figure 7D. The dial may then be
 5  rotated further in the counter-clockwise direction to the orientation shown in Figure 8E,
    which corresponds to the orientation shown in Figure 7C. This orientation depicts the second
    limit on the rotational range of the dial, as edge 188b of the outer bore 144 contacts a side
    wall 190b of the inner cylinder tab 180. This contact creates an interference that prevents
    further counter-clockwise rotation of the dial 210, as discussed above with respect to Figure
 ,0 8C, and again prevents compromising the individualized inflation control provided by the
    dial 210.
    [0100]    The dial 210 illustrates controls that may be incorporated into a fluid control system,
    for example into an orthopedic brace or other component having inflatable members, to
    provide control over inflation and deflation of compressible components or inflatable cells.
25  In certain implementations, other controls and control dials may be used to provide a user
    with control over individual inflatable cells or groups of inflatable cells. Such other controls
    may incorporate alternate mechanisms of diverting flow from an inflation source, such as
    pump 106, to inflatable cells, such as cells 104a-c, to provide a user with customizable
    inflation and deflation of brace components. For example, dial 310 depicted in Figures 9
30  12C may be used to provide inflation control for a brace, such as brace 100 shown in Figure
    1.
    [0101]    Figure 9 shows a top view of the dial 310, which includes a body 338 that is
    rotatable by a user. As discussed above with respect to dial 210, the dial 310 is rotatable
    between multiple dial orientations, where separate orientations create separate flow paths
                                                     -24-

   between an inlet port and a plurality of outlet ports of the dial 310. In Figure 9, a window
   314 in the housing 340 allows a user to see an indication of the dial orientations, for example,
   outer surface 312 of the dial 310 that contains a printed indication of an inflatable cell or
   other indicator that corresponds to the depicted dial orientation. In each orientation, an
 5 internal diverter in the dial 310 directs flow from an inlet port to the cell or group of cells
   indicated on the outer surface 312.
   [0102]     Figure 10 shows the dial 310 with the body 338 removed. The dial 310 has an inlet
   port 320, outlet ports 322a-c, and a diverter 318 that directs flow from the inlet port to one of
   the outlet ports. The diverter 318 includes slots 336a-d that couple with clips 316a-d on the
 0 body 338 of the dial 310 when the body 338 is snap-fitted to the diverter 318. The coupling
   of the slots 336a-d and the clips 316a-d rotates the diverter 318 when a user rotates the body
   338. The diverter 318 includes an internal channel, having a funnel inlet 324 and an outlet
   340 that is narrower than the inlet. Fluid is directed through the diverter from inlet port 320
   through funnel inlet 324, through outlet 340, and out through one of the outlet ports 322a-c
 5 that is aligned with the outlet 340. Similar to the flow path in the dial 210, the funnel shape
   of the flow path in the diverter 324 passes fluid directly through the center of the valve
   assembly, rather than around the exterior of the diverter. The orientations and flow paths
   created by each orientation are discussed in more detail below with respect to Figures 12A-C.
   [0103]     The diverter 318 shown in Figure 10 turns within a manifold body, which contains
 0 the inlet port 320 and outlet ports 322a-c and remains stationary while the diverter 318
   rotates. To help maintain the overall low profile of the dial 310, the manifold body includes
   two tabs 326a and 326b that extend outward from the manifold body and receive a
   connecting member that fastens the manifold body to a brace shell. A perspective view of the
   diverter 318 and manifold body 328 is shown in Figure 11. Tab 326 extends from and flush
25 with a lower edge 342 of the manifold body 328. This position of the tab 326a allows the
   manifold body 328 to be fastened to a brace without adding height to the combination of the
   body 328 and the diverter 318, thus contributing to the low profile of the combination. The
   ability to fasten the body 328 to a brace, or other component, without adding height is
   particularly beneficial in implementations in which a low-profile fluid control is desired.
30 Because the tab does not add height to the valve, the oversize of the valve can be reduced and
   fit within other components of the system. For example, if the valve is connected to a dial
   having a convex body, like the body 138 discussed above, the smaller size of the valve allows
   the convex body to also be smaller.
                                                   -25-

   [0104]    While the tab 326 reduces the height of the valve, the orientation of the outlet ports
   322a-c can further reduce the valve size by reducing the width of the valve. As shown in
   Figures 10 and 11, the outlet ports 322a-c extend at a downward angle away from the body
   328, with the openings of the port on the interior surface of the body 328 positioned higher
 5 than the outer openings of the ports. This angling creates a width, for example from the outer
   end of outlet port 322b to the outer end of inlet port 320, that is smaller than the width would
   be if the same ports extended straight outward from the body 328 in a common plane. The
   downward angle positions the inner openings of the ports, the openings in the interior surface
   of the body 328, in a first common plane, and the outer openings at the exterior ends of the
 0 ports to be located in a second common plane that is parallel to but positioned lower on the
   valve than the first plane.
   [0105]    The angling of the ports 320 and 322a-c may also increase the efficiency of fluid
   flow through the body 328 and diverter 318. The downward angle of the ports point flow
   inward towards the surface of a component that the body 328 is connected to, for example a
 5 surface to which the body 328 is fastened by the tab 326a. This orientation is advantageous if
   the ports are connected to flow tubes that pass through to an interior of the component to
   which the body 328 is connected. For example, if the body 328 were connected to a brace
   such as brace 100, fluid flow components on the inside of the brace may connect to the ports
   320 and 322a-c positioned on the outside of the brace where a user can easily adjust them.
 0 Angling the ports 320 and 322a-c directs the flow towards the interior before it leaves the
   brace, rather than requiring an elbow or kink in the flow tubes that can complicate flow and
   increase pressure in the system. This is shown in Figures 10 and 12, in which the outer
   openings of each port are directed into a gap in the surface to which the body 328 is fastened.
   The downward angle directs flow towards the gaps and into the interior of the surface, rather
25 than passing flow outward perpendicular to the body 328 and requiring an elbow at the
   exterior opening of each port to direct the flow inwards.
   [0106]    Multiple orientations of the dial 310, each corresponding to a discrete flow path
   through the manifold body 328 and diverter 318, are shown in Figures 12A-C. Similar to the
   orientations of dial 210 shown in Figures 7A-C, each depicted orientation of dial 310 creates
30 a flow path between the inlet port 320 and one of the outlet ports 322a-c of the dial. In
   Figure 12A, a first flow path, shown by arrow 330, is created between the inlet port 320 and
   outlet port 322a. Air entering the inlet port 320 passes through the funnel inlet 324 to the
   outlet 340 to the outlet port 322a aligned with the outlet 340. While this outlet port is open,
   the remaining outlet ports 322b and 322c are blocked by wall portions 344a and 344b,
                                                  -26-

   respectively, of the diverter 318. This orientation and flow path thus provide a single fluid
   communication between an inflation component coupled to the inlet port 320 and inflatable
   component or components coupled to one of the outlet port 322a while closing off any
   components couple to the other outlet ports 322b and 322c. Because the ports 322a and 320
 5 are oriented at a downward angle, fluid enters the opening of port 320 at the exterior end of
   the port, flows at an upward angle through the flow channel of the port, and enters the
   diverter 318 at the interior opening at the inner surface of the body 328. This opening is
   higher on the valve than the exterior opening through which the fluid entered the port 320.
   After passing through the center of the diverter 318, the fluid then exits through the port 322a
 0 at a downward angle, starting at the opening in the interior surface of the body 328 and
   flowing outward through the opening at the exterior end of the port 322a, which is located
   lower on the valve than the inlet opening.
   [0107]    A user may rotate the dial 310 clockwise to provide inflation or deflation for a
   second inflatable cell or group of cells. A clockwise force to the body 338 of the dial 310 is
 5 transferred through the clips 316a-d to the slots 336a-d, rotating the diverter 318 within the
   manifold body 328. Such rotation positions the diverter in the orientation shown in Figure
   12B. In Figure 12B, a flow path, shown by arrow 332, is created between the inlet port 320
   and the outlet port 322b while outlet ports 322a and 322c are blocked. The shape and width
   of the funnel inlet 324 on the diverter 318 allow the inlet 324 to maintain fluid
 0 communication with inlet port 320 while the dial 310 is rotated from the first orientation to
   the second orientation. In particular, the inlet 324 is wide enough that the inlet 324 remains
   in communication with the inlet port 320 over the full range of rotation of the diverter 318,
   from the orientation shown in Figure 12A to the orientation shown in Figure 12C. In
   addition, the positioning of the outlet ports 322a-c around one half of the diverter and the
25 inlet port 320 on the other half of the diverter allows for a wide inlet 324 to be used without
   the inlet being in communication with any of the outlet ports 322a-c over the range of
   rotation of the diverter 318. In this second orientation, fluid from a pump connected to the
   inlet port 320 passes through the funnel inlet 324, outlet 340, and out to an inflation
   component or components contained within the brace, via fluid communication with the
30 outlet port 322b.
   [0108]    Further clockwise rotation of the dial 310 in turn rotates the diverter 318 from the
   orientation shown in Figure 12B to the orientation shown in Figure 12C. In Figure 12C, a
   flow path, shown by arrow 334, is created between the inlet port 320 and the outlet port 222c
   while the outlet ports 322a and 322b are sealed. Again, the shape and width of the funnel
                                                   -27-

   inlet 324 allows the inlet to maintain fluid communication with the inlet port 320 in this
   orientation. Thus, the inlet of the diverter 318 is in constant fluid communication with the
   inlet port 320 over the full range of rotation from the orientation shown in Figure 12A to the
   orientation shown in Figure 12C, while the narrower outlet 340 is in communication with
 5 only one outlet port in each orientation.
   [0109]     In addition to a control dial such as dial 310 that diverts airflow from an input to one
   of multiple outputs, other controls may be incorporated into a brace that actively close or
   pinch one or more outputs rather than by diverting airflow. Figures 13-15 show one
   illustrative control assembly 500 which operates by pinching one or more output tubings.
 0 The control assembly 500 includes a single input 502 and four outputs 504a-d. In use, a
   rotatable dial 506 is used to select one of the outputs 504a-d to allow air to pass into the input
   in the direction of arrow 526 and out of one of the outputs 504a-d. To select a tubing for
   output, a user may turn the dial 506 to select one of the outputs indicated by indicators 508a
   d. For example, in the orientation of the dial 506 shown in Figure 13, the indicator 508c is
 5 selected, and air enters the inlet 502 in the direction of arrow 526 and exits the outlet 504c in
   the direction of arrow 510.
   [0110]     The dial 506 is positionable in four different orientations. In each of the four
   orientations, the marker 528 on the dial 506 points to one of the indicators 508a-d. Each of
   the indicators 508a-d corresponds to one of the outlets 504a-d that is open for air to pass
 0 when the marker 528 points to its respective indicator. The remaining three outlets in each
   orientation are closed by a pinching of the tubes in the internal components of the dial 506, as
   discussed below with respect to Figures 14 and 15. For example, in Figure 13 outlets 504a,
   504b and 504d are pinched closed within the dial 506 so that air entering the inlet 502 can
   only pass through the outlet 504c.
25 [0111]     Figure 14 shows an exploded view of the control assembly 500 that exposes the
   internal components of the control that open and close the outputs 504a-d. The components
   of the control 500 are contained between an upper housing 512a and a lower housing 512b.
   Seated in the lower housing 512b is a tubing assembly 532 that includes the fluid input 502
   and the four fluid outputs 504a-d. Above the tubing assembly 532 is a plate 514 that has four
30 ports 534a-d. Beneath each of the ports is one of lower bearings 516a-d. The lower bearings
   516a-d each contact the springs 518a-d, respectively. The springs 518a-d each pass through
   one of the ports 534a-d and contact one of the upper bearings 520a-d that are seated within
   one of the ports 534a-d. In each orientation of the dial 506, three of the lower bearings 516a
                                                    -28-

    d close off three of the outlet ports 504a-d. The remaining lower bearing does not pinch off
    the outlet, which allows air to flow through the assembly 500.
    [0112]    The selection of the outlet 504a-d that allows air to pass is made with the dial 506.
    On the bottom surface 530 of the dial 506, there are three shallow cavities 522a-c and one
 5  deep cavity 524. In each orientation of the dial 506 the four upper bearings 520a-d are
    positioned within the three shallow cavities 522a-c and the one deep cavity 524. The three
    upper bearings that are positioned in the shallow cavities 522a-c press down on three of their
    respective springs 518a-d, which places pressure on three of the lower bearings 516a-d. The
    downward pressure causes three of the lower bearings to close off their respective three
 0  outlets from the tubing assembly 532. The remaining upper bearing positioned within the
    deep cavity 524 is not pressed down onto its respective spring and lower bearing, and the
    outlet of tubing assembly 532 which corresponds to the upper bearing that is within the deep
    cavity 524 remains open because there is no downward pressure on the respective lower
    bearing to close off the outlet.
 5  [0113]    Figure 15 shows a cross-sectional view depicting the interaction of the cavities
    522a-c and 524 and the upper bearings 520a-d that closes off three of the outlets 504a-d. In
    the configuration shown, the dial 506 is in an orientation that opens outlet 504a. For
    example, the dial 506 may be positioned such that the marker 528 on the dial points to
    indicator 508a which corresponds to the outlet 504a. In this configuration the upper bearing
 '0 520a that corresponds to the outlet 504a is positioned in the deep cavity 524 while the
    remaining three upper bearings 520b-d are positioned in the shallow cavities 522a-c.
    Because upper bearing 520d is in the shallow cavity 522a, it is not able to move up into the
    dial 506 and instead exerts a downward pressure on the corresponding spring 518d and lower
    bearing 516d. This downward pressure pushes the lower bearing 516d down onto the tubing
25  of outlet 504d thus closing the outlet and preventing any air that enters the input 502 from
    exiting through the outlet 504d. In contrast, the upper bearing 520a is able to move up into
    the dial 506 farther than the upper bearing 520d due to the increased depth of the deep cavity
    524. The positioning of the upper bearing 520a within the deep cavity 524 relieves pressure
    from the spring 518a and the lower bearing 516a. As a result, the lower bearing 516a is not
30  pressed down on the outlet 504a, and the outlet 504a remains open for air entering the input
    502 to exit through the outlet 504a.
    [0114]    The inflation controls discussed above employ a rotational dial to control direction
    of fluid input to one or more fluid outputs. In addition to the rotational controls, a linear or
    otherwise non-rotational control may be used in a brace to direct fluid from an input source to
                                                   -29-

   one or more outputs and one or more inflatable cells of a brace. Figure 16 shows a control
   assembly 600 that employs a linear moving control 602 to direct fluid from a single input 604
   to one of three outputs 606a-c. The control 602 is seated within a linear trough 610 and may
   move laterally in the directions shown by arrow 608 to select one of the outlets 606a-c.
 5 Similar to the controls discussed above the inlet 604 may include communication with an
   inflation and deflation source while each of the outlets 606a-c may be connected to an
   inflatable cell. By moving the control 602 within the trough 610 a wearer is able to
   selectively direct flow to the inflatable cells connected to the outlets.
   [0115]     Figure 17 shows a cross-sectional view of the assembly 600 in the orientation shown
 0 in Figure 16. In this orientation air enters the inlet 604, passes through the control 602 and
   exits through the outlet 606a. The control 602 has a wide inlet portion 612 and narrow outlet
   portion 614. The wide inlet 612 allows the inlet to remain in fluid communication with the
   inlet port 604 over the full range of translation of the control 602 within the trough 610. As
   shown in Figure 17, air is able to follow the path shown by arrow 616 entering the inlet 604,
 5 passing through the inlet 612 and through the outlet 614 and ultimately out through the outlet
   port 606a. Because the outlet 614 is narrower than the inlet 612, the air that enters the inlet
   port 604 is directed only to the outlet port 606a. A first portion 618a of the control 602
   blocks the outlet port 606b, and a second portion 618b of the control 602 blocks the outlet
   port 606c. This block prevents air from entering or exiting the outlet port 606b and c and
 0 seals any inflatable cells that are connected to those outlet ports.
   [0116]     A wearer may select a different output port by moving the control 602 laterally in
   the direction shown by arrow 622 in Figure 17. Movement of the control 602 in this direction
   results in the orientation shown in Figure 18. In Figure 18, the control 602 is positioned such
   that air is able to enter the input port 604 and exit the output port 606b in the direction shown
25 by arrow 620. In this orientation the outlet channel 614 has been moved laterally and now
   the outlet port 606a and 606c are blocked while outlet port 606b is open to the inlet port 604.
   [0117]     To select the third output port 606c a user may move the control 602 laterally in the
   direction shown by arrow 624 in Figure 18. Movement in this direction results in the
   orientation shown in Figure 19. In this orientation, air is able to pass from the inlet port 604
30 out through the third outlet port 606c as shown by arrow 626. In this third orientation the
   remaining two outlet ports 606a and 606b are now blocked while the outlet channel 614 is
   aligned with the outlet port 606c.
   [0118]     As discussed above for rotational controls, linear controls may also utilize a pinch
   tubing mechanism rather than a fluid flow direction mechanism. Figure 20 shows a control
                                                    -30-

    assembly 700 that utilizes pinch tubing to direct air flow from an inlet port 702 to one of four
    outlet ports 704a-d. The assembly 700 includes a control 710 that is disposed within a trough
    712. The control 710 is moveable laterally in the directions shown by arrows 714. By
    moving the control 710, a wearer is able to align the control with one of the indicators 726a
 5  d, which correspond to the fluid outlets 704a-d, respectively. As shown in Figure 20 the
    control 710 is aligned with indicator 726c, which corresponds to the outlet 704c. In this
    orientation air enters the inlet port 702 in the direction shown by arrow 706 and exits through
    the outlet port 704c in the direction shown by arrow 708. The remaining three outlet ports
    704a, 704b and 704d are pinched off and closed by internal components of the control
 0  assembly 700.
    [0119]    Figure 21 shows an exploded view of the control assembly 700 exposing the internal
    components of the control that pinch three of the outlets 704a-d. The control 700 includes an
    upper housing 716a and a lower housing 716b. Between the two housings is a connection
    assembly 728a that couples the inlet port 702 to the four outlets 704a-d. The fluid flow out of
 5  these outlets is controlled by a blocker 718 that sits on top of the outlet tubings 704a-d. The
    blocker 718 includes an upper tab 730 that extends through the trough 712 and couples to the
    control 710. Movement of the control 710 within the trough 712 thus moves the blocker 718
    laterally. The blocker 718 includes a window 722 with two edges 724a and 724b on either
    side of the window. In use, the blocker 718 is moveable such that the window 722 aligns
 '0 with one of the outlets 704a-d to allow fluid flow from the selected outlet. The two edges
    724a and 724b compress the remaining three outlets against the upper surface 720 of the
    lower housing 716b thus pinching the remaining three outlets closed.
    [0120]    Figure 22 shows a cross-sectional view illustrating the operation of the blocker 718
    within the control assembly 700. As shown in Figure 22, the blocker 718 is positioned such
25  that the outlet 704b is open for fluid flow while the remaining outlets 704a, 704c and 704d
    are pinched closed by the edges 724a and 724b of the blocker 718. In this orientation, for
    example, the wearer may position the control 710 aligned with the indicator 726b shown in
    Figure 20 to select the outlet 704b that corresponds to that indicator. The edges 724a and
    724b compress the outlets 704a, 704c and 704d against the surface 720 such that those outlets
30  are closed and any air entering the inlet port 702 may pass only through the selected outlet
    704b.
    [0121]    For some braces it may be preferable to provide individual controls for each
    inflatable cell in a brace. Such controls may be preferred if, for example, a user wishes to
    inflate or deflate more than one inflatable cell of the brace at one time. By giving the user
                                                     -31-

   individualized control over each pathway, the user is able to select an inflatable cell or
   combination of inflatable cells to inflate or deflate through the control. Figure 23 shows one
   control assembly 800 that provides a user with individual control over opening and closing
   four separate fluid outputs. The control assembly 800 includes a fluid input 802 and four
 5 plungers 804a-d. Each of the plungers 804a-d controls fluid flow through a single outlet.
   Thus the user is able to control flow from input 802 to four different outputs and is able to
   select any combination of those outputs to inflate or deflate.
   [0122]    Figure 24 shows an exploded view of the assembly 800 revealing the four fluid
   outputs 806a-d and illustrating the positioning of the plunger 804c. As shown in Figure 24,
 0 the input 802 couples with the valve 808 that flows into a circular tubing 810. The circular
   tubing 810 connects to each of the output tubings 806a-d. Each of these outputs 806a-d has a
   respective one of plungers 804a-d coupled over its fluid path to control opening and closing
   of the tubing.
   [0123]    The plunger 804c is surrounded by a spring 812 and enters a top collar 814 before
 5 passing over its respective outlet tubing 806c. On the lower side of the control assembly 800,
   the plunger 804c then passes through a lower collar 816c and couples with a base 818c. By
   pressing on the plunger 804c, a wearer is able to toggle the control assembly between
   opening and closing the outlet tubing 806c. The plunger 804c includes a locking mechanism
   that keeps the plunger in the closed state when activated by a user. For example, a user may
 0 depress the plunger 804c to close off outlet tubing 806c and then turn the plunger a quarter
   turn to engage a locking feature on the lower collar 816c or base 818c that holds the plunger
   804c against the force exerted by the compressed spring 812. To release the plunger 804c
   and open the outlet tubing 806c, a user can turn the plunger back a quarter-turn, releasing the
   locking feature and allowing the spring 812 to extend.
25 [0124]    Figure 25 illustrates the opening and closing mechanism employed by the plungers
   804a-d. As shown in Figure 25, plunger 804c is blocking off the outlet tubing 806c while
   plunger 804a is allowing fluid flow through the outlet tubing 806a. In the closed
   configuration shown, the plunger 804c is in a raised configuration as the spring 812c is
   expanded. In this orientation, the plunger base 818c presses on the tubing 806c and closes
30 the outlet from fluid flow. In contrast, the plunger 804a is depressed in the open
   configuration such that the spring 812a is compressed. In this orientation, the plunger base
   818a does not pinch the outlet tubing 806a and this outlet is open for fluid flow. A user may
   toggle a plunger between the closed configuration of plunger 804c and the open configuration
   of plunger 804a by depressing the plunger and engaging or unlocking a locking mechanism
                                                  -32-

   that either holds the spring 812a compressed or allows the spring to expand as shown for the
   spring 812c.
