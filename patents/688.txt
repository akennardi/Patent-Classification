                                         Technical         Field
             The   present         invention           generally        relates         to      composite
   pigments.         The    composite           pigments         may     be     used       in      a    paint
   formulation          so    as     to      increase         the      opacity         of     the       paint
15 formulation.
                                              Background
             The       application              of        nanomaterials                to         various
   industrial          uses        has      gathered           substantial           interest           both
20 industrially           and      academically.            The      main      motivating             force
   for      this    momentum         is     the      ability        of    nanomaterials,                with
   their       near-atomic         dimensions,           to    substantially             improve         the
   properties of final products.
             For   example,         nanomaterials            have      been      used      in     coating
25 applications.           Metal       oxides         like    nano-titanium             dioxide          and
   silicon        dioxide       have       been       extensively           used       to     formulate
   polymeric          coatings         to        provide         properties             like        photo
   catalysis and excellent abrasion resistance.
             Titanium          dioxide            (TiO2 )       is      the        pervasive             and
30 unchallenged          pigment        in    the      coating       industry        mainly        due    to
   its      excellent      ability         to    scatter       visible        light.        Thus,       TiO 2
   has      very    high    refractive           index      and     has    been       commonly          used
   to      enhance      the    opacity         of     paints.        However,         the      price      of
   TiO   2    in    recent        years         has      fluctuated           very        widely         and
35 increased          substantially.             This      prevents          TiO2 -based            paints
   from being              economically                   competitive.                  Furthermore,
   conventional           paints        for      external        architectural              use       often
   experience           "yellowing"              due      to     the      exposure            to      solar
   radiation. High              humidity           and      frequent          rainfall           in      the
40 tropical       region also          result       in   bacterial         and algae          growth on
   walls.

   WO 2015/038073                                                             PCT/SG2014/000432
             The   opacity       or    hiding       power      of    paints        depends      on
     numerous factors          such as particle              size,      crystalline phase
     of pigment,        refractive       index of pigments and polymer,                       and
     the      dispersion          or    crowding            of      individual            pigment
 5   particles.             All      these       factors         influence            the    back
     scattering       of   the     light    by    individual          pigment        particles.
     Pigment        crowding         of     TiO 2        is     the       most         important
     consideration in designing of paints. This is because even
     though      TiO2 confers        opacity      to     the paints,           by    increasing
10   the    TiO2   content     in    the   paint       above     a   certain        point,    the
     pigment      particles       are   brought        to    close proximity             of  each
     other,       thereby      interfering           with      the      ability         of   such
     pigments to scatter light efficiently.
             To overcome the problem of pigment crowding, extender
15   pigments      possessing        smaller      dimensions         are used as           spacer
     units      to   isolate       TiO2 pigments           and     increase         the    hiding
     power of the paints.
             The   concept      of using       the      spacer      material         along with
     TiO 2 pigments         to    improve      opacity        of    the     paint      has   been
20   known      for    some    time.         For      example,        there        is   a   known
     product      that uses differences               in    refractive          index between
     the     different       materials       to     increase         scattering.            Other
     known products physically coat the TiO 2 pigment to enhance
     the     separation.            Clays    may      also     be     used       for     such   an
25   application        as   they have       high       surface      area.         However,     it
     has      been       difficult        to       practice           such        applications
     commercially         due   to   requirement          of   large      amount       of  spacer
     material       leading      to   high     comparative           cost      of    the   paint.
     Furthermore clays as             spacer material also tend to decrease
30    the   gloss     of   the     final   paint        film and        alter       rheological
     properties of the paint.
             Alternatively           commercial          micron        sized        zinc    oxide
     particles       with a      refractive        index      of    2.01 can be used as
      the   pigment.       However,      commercial          micron-sized            zinc   oxide
                                                   2

   WO 2015/038073                                                             PCT/SG2014/000432
     possesses        larger       average        particle         dimensions        and   thus,
     suffers      from     lower     surface       area.        As   a  result,      commercial
     micron-sized         zinc oxide         has    little        or negligible power to
     influence        the      opacity         provided          by    TiO2      pigments.      In
 5   addition,       while     nano-sized          zinc       oxide    particles       are   able
     to increase the opacity of a paint formulation, such paint
     formulations        have been shown to be unstable                          (as evidenced
     by the increase           in   the viscosity of the paint formulation
     to the point of gelation) when stored for long periods of
10   time such as two to three months. In addition, formulation
     of     water      based        paints         using         ZnO     requires        careful
     consideration          of    various        parameters          and   materials.          The
     interaction        of     ZnO    with       TiC2      is    very    strong       under    the
     alkaline       pH   range      that      normally         prevails      in    water   based
15   paints.         This invariably results in poor stability of the
     paint     leading        to   progressive            increase       in    viscosity       and
     possible       irreversible          gelling         at    room    temperature.           The
     paint often fails in accelerated storage test conducted at
     600 C for 14 days.
20           Further,        other     pigments           such     as    white      lead,    zinc
     sulphide, lithopone and antimony oxide have also been used
     as   alternative         pigments        in   paints.        However,       TiC 2 pigments
     are always        ultimately chosen due                   to its    higher refractive
     index.
25           There      is,       therefore,           a      need     to     provide      paint
     formulations         that overcomes,             or at least         ameliorates,         one
     or more      of   the disadvantages                described       above.      There   is   a
     need to provide            stable paint formulations                   that     overcomes,
     or at least ameliorates,                   one or more of the disadvantages
30   described above.
                                                Summary
             According        to    a   first       aspect,         there     is    provided     a
     paint      formulation         comprising           a     composite       pigment,      said

     composite pigment being selected from the group consisting
     of     metal      oxide/silica,               metal        oxide/silicate,             metal
     oxide/alumina,            metal           oxide/metal          oxide         and       metal
     oxide/zirconia,           wherein          the      size     and    amount         of    said
 5   composite      pigment are           selected to increase              the opacity of
     said paint formulation.
             The   composite pigment may have opaque                         properties        and
     hence     may   be used to            maintain        or enhance       the    opacity      of
     the paint or paint formulation.                        The composite pigment may
10   reduce     the amount of            titanium dioxide that               is   required      in
     the paint formulation due                   to the opaque properties                  of the
     composite pigment.             Hence,       the     composite pigment may be an
     alternative to titanium dioxide. Due to the replacement of
     the    more    expensive          titanium         dioxide     with    the     composite,
15   the costs of producing                  the paint or paint            formulation may
     be effectively reduced.
             As the composite pigment                    enhances     the opacity of the
     paint     formulation,           the     composite        pigment     may     not     affect
     the     stability        of       the      paint        formulation.         Hence,       the
20   composite      pigment        may at        least maintain          the    stability       of
     the paint formulation or may increase the stability of the
     paint      formulation.          Hence,        the     composite      pigment        may   be
     able to enhance the opacity of the paint formulation while
     not    affecting      the      stability         of    the paint      formulation,         or
25   have    any detrimental effect                  on the stability           of the paint
     formulation.         This         is      compared        to   prior        art      opacity
     enhancing       agents        in     which       the     stability        of   the     paint
     formulation decreases over time.
             The    composite          pigment        may     be  able     to     maintain      or
30   enhance      the   stability           of    the     paint    or   paint      formulation
     when     stored     for      a    period        of    time.       The     composite       may
     enable      the paint        or paint         formulation        to be resistant            to
     viscosity       changes.        The      composite may prevent               or at      least

     reduce the gelation or agglomeration of the paint or paint
     formulation during storage for a period of time.
             In   a   second      aspect,    there     is   provided     a   method     for
     preparing        a    paint     formulation        comprising       the    step      of

20   relate     to    an average particle            size of     a    particle   of    less
     than about         1000nm,     less than about          300    nm,  between     about
     200 nm to about 300 nm,              between about 5 nm to about 200 nm
     or less than about             100 nm.    The particle size may refer to
     the diameter of the particles where they are substantially
25   spherical.         The      particles    may     be    non-spherical        and    the
     particle       size     range   may refer to          the   equivalent     diameter
     of the particles relative to spherical particles.
              The term "opacity", and grammatical variants thereof,
     is    used      to    denote     the   impermeability           of  a   coating      to
30   light.
              The term "stable", when referring to a paint or paint
      formulation,         refers    to the    ability       of   the paint     or paint
      formulation         to    be  stirred     to    form    a   homogeneous       liquid
      even when stored at long periods of time. The viscosity of

     the     paint    or    paint     formulation         may be       a  measure     of   the
     stability       of   the      paint    or paint       formulation         such   that     a
     stable paint or paint formulation                      is    considered as one          in
     which the viscosity remains substantially constant or does
 5   not increase         substantially during storage                   of the paint        or
     paint formulation. During accelerated storage experiments,
     a   stable     paint     is    one    which has       a    viscosity       increase     of
     about      less than 20         KU units.       For the avoidance            of   doubt,
     any paint or paint formulation that results in gelation or
10   agglomeration           when      stored       for     a     period      of    time     is
     considered as "unstab-le

      embodiment,       the wt% of the composite pigment may be about
      2 wt%.
              The particle size of the metal oxide in the composite
      pigment      may be    in    the     nano-range.          The   particle       size    of

20    about 60 nm to about 100 nm and about 80 nm to about 100
      nm.       In  one   embodiment,          the     particle     size    of    the   metal
      oxide in the composite may be about 10 nm.
              The    surface    area       of   the     composite      may    be    selected
      from the range of about 20 m 2 /g to about 100 m 2 /g, about 20
25    m 2 /g to about 80 m 2 /g,        about 20 m 2 /g to about 60 m 2 /g, about
      20 m 2 /g to about 40 m 2 /g, about 40 m2 /g to about 100 m 2
      about 60 m 2 /g      to about 100 m 2 /g            or about     80 m2 /g     to  about
      100 m 2 /g
              The composite may be made either in a two-step method
30    or in a one-step method. In the two-step method, the metal
      oxide particles are formed first followed by precipitation
      or coating with the silica                  or alumina on the metal oxide.
      Where the metal oxide is zinc oxide, the zinc oxide may be
      made     by mixing      zinc      salts      in   a  base   and     collecting       the

     precipitates          of     zinc       oxide        formed.         A    surfactant          or
     dispersant may be added to reduce the particle size of the
     zinc      oxide     particles          such      that     the      formed         zinc     oxide
     particles are in the nano-range. The zinc salt used may be
 5   selected       from    the    group       consisting          of     zinc     nitrate       salt
      (such as      zinc nitrate          hexahydrate),            zinc     acetate        and zinc
     chloride.        The      base      may      be      selected          from        the     group
     consisting         of    sodium       hydroxide,          potassium          hydroxide        or
     calcium hydroxide. It is to be appreciated that the method
10   to make the zinc            oxide is       not limited to the above method
     and can encompass any method known to form nano-sized zinc
     oxide      particles.       Following which,              an amine        surfactant may
     be added to         create     a    charge        on the zinc          oxide particles.
     Silica or alumina             (or their precursors)                   is    then added to
15   form      a   composite       with       the      zinc     oxide.        To    enhance       the
     precipitation         or coating of              the   silica        or alumina on the
     zinc oxide particles,                a  charge modifier may be added.                        The
     charge      modifier       may be       aluminium         chloride        solution which
     functions       to precipitate or coat                  silica       on the zinc           oxide
20   particles by disturbing its residual charge.
              The   one    step    method       may      involve        a   reaction         mixture
     comprising        a   metal    salt,      a    base     solution and a               precursor
     of   silica      or alumina.          Where      the metal         oxide      to be formed
     is    zinc    oxide,      the   metal       salt     may be         zinc     salt      selected
25   from      the   group     consisting         of     zinc     nitrate       salt        (such as
     zinc nitrate hexahydrate),                   zinc acetate and zinc chloride.
     A   surfactant         or   dispersant            may   be     added      to      reduce     the
     particle       size     of   the     zinc     oxide      particles          such      that   the
     formed       zinc    oxide     particles           are    in     the     nano-range.         The
30   base     may be selected            from the         group      consisting          of    sodium
     hydroxide,          potassium          hydroxide          or       calcium         hydroxide.
     During formation of              the composite,             the pH of the reaction
     mixture       may     be    adjusted         appropriately.              The      pH     of  the

 5           In     the      above        embodiments,               the      difference            in
     refractive indices of different layered materials improves
     the     back      scattering           of     light.             In     the      core-shell
     structure, more substantial difference in refractive index
     are      created      by       forming        a     hollow         layered         inorganic
10   composite       pigment.          Such     a   pigment        upon     drying       leaves       a
     hollow      space     that       helps       in    better        back      scattering          of
     light, leading to better opacity.
             The    composite        may    act     as     a    substitute         for    titanium
     dioxide in the paint formulation while keeping the opacity

     without       the    composite.           The     composite          may       maintain        or
     enhance       the    stability          of     the       paint      formulation             while

             The    composite        may act       as    a     substitute to          replace       up

             The    paint      formulation           may       have    an    opacity          in   the

     possible         to use     a     lesser amount         of the       titanium        dioxide,

     without         compromising         on   the    opacity          and/or     stability           of
     the paint formulation.
              The paint formulation may have substantially the same
     opacity or increased                 opacity as compared to another paint
10   formulation without the composite.
              The     metal     oxide      in   said     composite          may     be     selected
     from      the     group     consisting        of     zinc      oxide,       barium       oxide,
     aluminium           oxide,        antimony      oxiae,         magnesium         oxide         and
     zirconium          oxide.       In   one   embodiment,            the    metal      oxide        is
15   zinc oxide.
              The     composite         pigment    may      be    toxic      to   microbes          and
     hence      may     have    an      anti-microbial         (such as         anti-bacterial
     or anti-fungal)             effect.      Hence,     the composite            pigment         in    a
     paint       formulation          may   be   able     to    enhance        the    opacity         of
20   the     paint      formulation         while    maintaining           or    enhancing          the
     stability         of   the paint formulation.                 At the same time,                the
     composite pigment               may be      able    to exert         an anti-microbial
     effect        so   as   to   increase       the    durability          and life-time             of
     the      paint       formulation.          When     the       paint       formulation            is
25   applied to a           surface       and dried,         the anti-microbial               effect
     of the composite pigment may also be expanded to the dried
     paint.
               The composite having a metal oxide such as zinc oxide
     may      function        as      a   UV   absorbent         and      may     confer         anti
30   microbial          properties        to   the paint         formulation.             This may
     be     due     to   the    particle       size     of    the      zinc    oxide,       such      as
     lesser         than     40    nm,     which     result         in    these      properties.
     Hence, the overall durability of the paint formulation may

     mixture       was      stirred          for     one     hour       until        pH    gradually
     reaches      9.5.         The     pH    was    again      adjusted          to    7.5   and    the
     reaction       mixture       was      stirred       for     an additional            one    hour.
 5   The    reaction        mixture         was     then      filtered          and    washed     with
     water.       The filtered solid was dried in an oven at 800 C for
    *24 hours.
             The dried         solid was          powdered and characterised                     using
     BET    surface      area analysis               (21.97      m 2 /g),      XRD    (see Fig.       1)
10   and TEM (Fig. 2).
             From the         XRD pattern of Fig.                  1,    the major peaks            are
     at   about     31.76,        34.39,        36.24,      47.52,        56.59,      62.81,     66.37
     and 67.92        ('20),      which        confirmed' the presence of                   ZnO with
     hexagonal structure                 (space group- P63mc) . Using Scherrer' s
15   equation,       the crystalline               size     of 23.5          nm was      calculated.
     The    remaining         peaks       correspond          to     SiO2 and        Zn(OH) 2 .   From
     the pattern,          it    is    evident        that the formation of SiO2 was
     amorphous.        After       silica        coating on           ZnO,      this    shifted      the
      ZnO peaks       0.02A towards the                left      side which confirmed the
20   presence of SiO 2 .
             From the TEM image of Fig.                       3 (a),      it    can be seen that
      the    synthesized          powder         had    an     inhomogeneous            morphology,
      which       is     a      mixture           of      nanorods            and      multifaceted
      morphology.        Higher         magnification             (see       Fig.     3(b))     showed
25    that    the    nanorods          consisted        of    -10      nm     ZnO embedded        in    a
      continuous       amorphous           SiO2    phase.       The      inter-planar         spacing
      (see    Fig.     3(c))       was      3.3    A    and    was      close       to   the    inter
      planar spacing of              (100) plane of ZnO                (3.25     A).

     Paint Formulation using nano-ZnO-silica composite

15   together with titanium dioxide                  (TiO2 )   as   the main pigment
     was     used    to   formulate      an acrylic       water-based       paint.      The
     formulation              was      named         "N-ZnO-silica             composite
     Formulation".           The    weight    of    the    TiO2    present       in   this
     formulation was reduced as compared to that present in the
20   Standard         Formulation        described       below.        A    comparative

25   composite        Formulation"       with     the   composite,        there     was    a
     decrease       in    the    total   pigment      volume.      This    decrease       in
     pigment volume was compensated by increasing the amount of
     silica        and/or        talc     to      keep     the       pigment        volume

      Characterization of nano zinc oxide
 5           The      fine     white      powder       was      analyzed      by       X-ray
      diffraction       (XRD)    and the XRD pattern is             shown in      Fig.     5.
      From Fig. 5, the XRD pattern confirms that pure zinc oxide
       (ZnO)    was   obtained.      Specifically,         the   three   main 2        Theta
      peak     values    in    Fig.   5    are    at   31.72;      34.45;    and     36.21,

      Joint     Committee      on    Powder     Diffraction        Standards        (JCPDS)

              The    fine     white    powder       wa's    also    analyzed       by     the
      Brunauer-Emmett-Teller             (BET)    method.      The  BET    surface      area
15    measurement        showed     that     the   ZnO    obtained     has    a     surface
      area of 27.8 m 2 /gram.
      Paint Formulation using nano-ZnO
              The    nano    zinc    oxide     (n-ZnO)      together     with    titanium
20    dioxide      (TiO2 ) as the main pigment was used to formulate an
      acrylic      water-based       paint.     The    formulation      was    named      "n
      ZnO    Formulation".        The weight       of    the TiO2     present      in    this
       formulation       was     70%    of    that     present      in    the    Standard
      Formulation       described below.           A comparative        acrylic       water
25    based     paint    formulation based           on TiO2      pigments     alone      was
      made. This formulation was named "Standard Formulation".
              When 30% of the required TiC2 was replaced in                         the "n
       ZnO     Formulation"        with     nano     zinc      oxide,    there        was     a
       decrease      in   the    total    pigment       volume.     This    decrease        in
30     pigment volume was compensated by increasing the amount of
       silica       and/or       talc       to     keep       the     pigment         volume
