                             PROCESSING BIOMASS
  [0001]       This application incorporates by reference the full disclosure of the following
  co-pending provisional applications: USSN 61/824,597, filed May 17, 2013 and USSN
  61/941,771 filed February 19, 2014.
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
  [0002]       Many potential lignocellulosic feedstocks are available today, including
  agricultural residues, energy grasses, woody biomass, municipal waste, oilseeds/cakes and
  seaweed, to name a few. At present, these materials are often under-utilized, being used,
  for example, as animal feed, biocompost materials, burned in a co-generation facility or
  even landfilled.
  [0003]       Lignocellulosic biomass includes crystalline cellulose fibrils embedded in a
  hemicellulose matrix, surrounded by lignin. This produces a compact matrix that is
  difficult to access by enzymes and other chemical, biochemical and/or biological
  processes. Cellulosic biomass materials (e.g., biomass material from which the lignin has
  been removed) is more accessible to enzymes and other conversion processes, but even so,
  naturally-occurring cellulosic materials often have low yields (relative to theoretical
  yields) when contacted with hydrolyzing enzymes. Lignocellulosic biomass is even more
  recalcitrant to enzyme attack. Furthermore, each type of lignocellulosic biomass has its
  own specific composition of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.
                                            SUMMARY
  [0004]       Generally, this invention relates to methods and processes for converting a
  material, such as a biomass feedstock, e.g., cellulosic, starchy or lignocellulosic materials,
  to useful products, for example, amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids and derivatives of
  amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids. These amino dicarboxylic acids can be converted
  into other products, if desired. When the amino group is in the two position, the acid can
  be an amino acid, for example, an alpha-amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid. The
  amino group amino-alpha, omega dicarboxylic acid may be substituted on any atom on the
  carbon chain leading to, for example, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon amino
  dicarboxylic acids. In addition, the amino dicarboxylic acids may have multiple amines in
  the same dicarboxylic acid. The mono-amine and the poly-amino-carboxylic acid can be
                                              1

WO 2014/186670                                                                 PCT/US2014/038341
   substituted with other groups, e.g., alkyl groups. The carbon chain of the carboxylic acid
  may be straight chained, branched, cyclic, or alicyclic.
   [0005]      The amphiphilic nature of these structures leads to interesting properties for
  both low molecular products and polymeric products. The polymeric products can be
   amide condensation products. The amide product can be hydrolytically stable.
   [0006]      An amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid is shown in Structure I. This
   structure corresponds to an alpha-amino, alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid.

  [0029]       For example, in Structure I, m is chosen from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7; n is
  chosen from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7; with the limitation that n + m must be less than or
  equal to 10; and R 1, R 2 , R 3 are chosen from hydrogen, straight chain or branched alkyl
  groups, aromatic and alkyl aromatics where the limitation is that there are less than 24
  carbons. When n + m are 10, the amino dicarboxylic acid is a derivative of dodecanoic
  acid where the amine group can be substituted at any of the carbon positions.
  Furthermore, multiple amine substitutions can occur. For the symmetric 1, 10-diamino
  dicarboxylic acid o and p are 0; p and r are 1 and q is 8. Any combination of n, m and the
  R groups can be included in the alpha-amino, omega-dicarboxylic acid. Where p and r are
  1 or greater there are multiple amine substituents.
  [0030]       In one aspect the invention relates to a method for making a product including
  treating a reduced recalcitrance biomass (e.g., lignocellulosic and/or cellulosic material)
  with one or more enzymes and/or microorganisms to produce an amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid and converting the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid to the product.
  Optionally, the feedstock is pretreated with at least one method selected from irradiation
  (e.g., with an electron beam), sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis, size reduction, and steam
  explosion, for example, to reduce the recalcitrance lignocellulosic and/or cellulosic
  material.
  [0031]       Some examples of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids that can be
  produced and then further converted include aspartic acid, glutamic acid and the amino
  substituted malonic, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic and sebacic acids or their
  corresponding acidic or basic salts, e.g., their Na+, K+, Ca2+, or ammonium salts and
  mixtures of salts and acids.
  [0032]       In one implementation of the method, the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
  acids are converted chemically or biochemically, for example, by converting aspartic acid
  or glutamic acid to the respective polyamides. Other methods of chemically converting
  that can be utilized include polymerization, isomerization, esterification, amidation,
  cyclization, oxidation, reduction, disproportionation and combinations of these.
  [0033]       In another implementation, the lignocellulosic and/or cellulosic material is
  treated with one of more enzymes to release one or more sugars. For example, to release
  glucose, xylose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, mannose, galactose, arabinose, fructose, dimers
  of these such as cellobiose, heterodimers of these such as sucrose, oligomers of these, and
  mixtures of these. Optionally, treating can further include (e.g., subsequently to releasing
  sugars) utilizing (e.g., by contacting with the sugars and/or biomass) one or more
                                               4

WO 2014/186670                                                                   PCT/US2014/038341
  organisms to produce the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids. For example, the sugars
  can be fermented by a sugar fermenting organism to the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
  acids. Sugars that are released from the biomass can be purified (e.g., prior to fermenting)
  by, for example, a method selected from electrodialysis, distillation, centrifugation,
  filtration, chromatography, including simulated moving bed chromatography, cation
  exchange chromatography, and combinations of these in any convenient order.
  [0034]        In some implementation, converting comprises polymerizing the aspartic or
  glutamic acid to a polymer (e.g., polymerizing in a melt such as without an added
  solvent). For example, polymerizing methods can be selected from direct condensation of
  the aspartic or glutamic acid, azeotropic dehydrative condensation of the aspartic or
  glutamic acid, and cyclizing the aspartic or glutamic acid followed by ring opening
  polymerization. The polymerization can be in a melt (e.g., without a solvent and above the
  melting point of the polymer) or can be in a solution (e.g., with an added solvent). A
  polyamide can be a product of the polymerization process. Optionally, polymerizations
  can be done utilizing catalysts and/or promoters. For example, protonic acids, H 3 PO 4 ,
  H 2 SO 4 , methane sulfonic acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid, NAFION@ NR 50 H+ form from
  DuPont, Wilmington DE, acids supported on polymers, Mg, Al, Ti, Zn, Sn, metal oxides,
  TiO 2, ZnO, GeO2, ZrO2, SnO, SnO2, Sb 20 3, metal halides, ZnCl2, SnCl2, SnCl4,
  Mn(AcO)2, Fe2(LA)3, Co(AcO)2, Ni(AcO)2, Cu(OA)2, Zn(LA)2, Y(OA) 3 , Al(i-PrO)3,
  Ti(BuO)4, TiO(acac)2, (Bu)2SnO, tin octoate, solvates and hydrates of any of these and
  mixtures of these can be used.
  [0035]        Also optionally, the polymerizations or at least a portion of the polymerizations
  can be done at a temperature between about 100 and about 240 'C, such as between about
  110 and about 200     0 C, optionally between about 120 'C and about 170 'C, or between
  about 120 and about 160      0 C. Alternatively, at least a portion of the polymerizations can
  be performed under vacuum (e.g., between about 0.1 mm Hg to 300 mm Hg).
  [0036]        In the implementations wherein the polymerization method includes
  dimerizing the aspartic or glutamic acid to a lactam followed by ring opening
  polymerization of the lactam, the dimerization can include heating the aspartic or glutamic
  acid to between 100 and 200      0 C under a vacuum of about 0.1 to about 100 mmHg.
  [0037]         Optionally, the dimerization (e.g., dimerization reaction) can include utilizing
  a catalyst. Catalysts can, for example, include Sn octoate, Li carbonate, Zn diacetate
  dehydrate, Ti tetraisopropoxide, potassium carbonate, tin powder and mixtures of these.
  Optionally, a ring opening polymerization catalyst is utilized. For example, the ring
                                               5

WO 2014/186670                                                                  PCT/US2014/038341
  opening polymerization catalyst can be chosen from protonic acids, HBr, HCI, triflic acid,
  Lewis acids, ZnCl 2 , AlCl 3 , anions, potassium benzoate, potassium phenoxide, potassium t
  butoxide, and zinc stearate, metals, tin, zinc, aluminum, antimony, bismuth, lanthanide
  and other heavy metals, tin (II) oxide and tin (II) octoate (e.g., 2-ethylhexanoate),
  tetraphenyl tin, tin (II) and (IV) halogenides, tin (II) acetylacetonoate, distannoxanes (e.g.,
  hexabutyldistannoxane, R 3 SnOSnR 3 where R groups are alkyl or aryl groups), Al(OiPr) 3 ,
  other functionalized aluminum alkoxides (e.g., aluminum ethoxide, aluminum methoxide),
  ethyl zinc, lead (II) oxide, antimony octoate, bismuth octoate, rare earth catalysts, yttrium
  tris(methyl lactate), yttrium tris(2-N-N-dimethylamino ethoxide), samarium tris(2-N-N
  dimethylamino ethoxide), yttrium tris(trimethylsilylmethyl), lanthanum tris(2,2,6,6
  tetramethylheptanedionate), lanthanum tris(acetylacetonate), yttrium octoate, yttrium
  tris(acetylacetonate), yttrium tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptanedionate), combinations of
  these (e.g., ethyl zinc/aluminum isopropoxide) and mixtures of these.
  [0038]       After the polymerization has reached the desired molecular weight, it may be
  necessary to deactivate and/or remove the catalyst from the polymer. The catalyst can be
  reacted with a variety of compounds, including, silica, functionalized silica, alumina,
  clays, functionalized clays, amines, carboxylic acids, phosphites, acetic anhydride,
  functionalized polymers, EDTA and similar chelating agents.
  [0039]       While not being bound by theory for those catalysts like the tin systems, if the
  added compound can occupy multiple sites on the tin it can be rendered inactive for
  polymerization (and depolymerization). For example, a compound like EDTA can occupy
  several sites in the coordination sphere of the tin and, in turn, interfere with the catalytic
  sites in the coordination sphere. Alternatively, the added compound can be of sufficient
  size and the catalyst can adhere to its surface, such that the absorbed catalyst may be
  filtered from the polymer. Those added compounds such as silica may have sufficient
  acidic/basic properties that the silica adsorbs the catalyst and is filterable.
  [0040]       The by-product of the amide polymerization product is water. A means to
  remove the water efficiently during the polymerization can be effective in obtaining
  (co)polymers with a high degree of conversion.
  [0041]       In a particular embodiment, a method of making poly amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid by the conversion of a crude aliphatic amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic

       a) providing a source of monomer as amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid in a

      b) concentrating the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid in the hydroxylic medium
  by evaporating a substantial portion of the hydroxylic medium to form a concentrated acid
  solution;
      c) oligomerizing the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid to obtain an amino-alpha,
  omega-dicarboxylic acid oligomer;
      d) adding a polymerization catalyst to the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid
  oligomer;
      e) polymerizing the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid oligomer to obtain a poly amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid;
      f) transferring the poly amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid to a thin film
  polymerization/ devolatilization device;
      g) isolating the poly amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid.
  The thin film polymerization/devolatilization device is configured such that fluid polymer
  is conveyed to the device such that the film of the fluid polymer is less than 1 cm thick
  and provides a means for volatilizing the water formed in the reaction and other volatile
  components. The temperature of the thin film evaporator and
  polymerization/devolatilization device are from 100 to 2400 C and the pressure of the
  device is from 0.000014 to 50 kPa. A full vacuum may be used in the evaporator device.
  Pressures can be e.g., less than 0.01 torr, alternatively less than 0.001 torr and optionally
  less than 0.0001 torr.
  [0042]       The polymerization steps c, e, and f are three polymerization stages, 1, 2 and 3,
  of polymerization of the amino, dicarboxylic acid.
  [0043]       The thin film evaporator or thin film polymerization/ devolatilization device
  are also a convenient place to add other components to the poly amino, dicarboxylic acid.
  These other components can include other monomers including the other amino,
  dicarboxylic acid, homologues of the amino, dicarboxylic acid, diols, hydroxy
  dicarboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids, alcohol amines, diamines and similar reactive
  species. Reactive components such as peroxides, glycidyl acrylates, epoxides and the like
  can also be added at this stage in the process.
  [0044]       An extruder also can be in fluid contact or fluid communications with the thin
  film evaporator and/or thin film polymerization/devolatilization device and can be used to
  recycle the polymer and/or to provide the means to process the poly amino-carboxylic
  acid to the isolation portion of the process. The extruder is also a convenient device to
  add other components and reactives listed above and discussed below, especially if they
                                             7

  would be volatilized in the thin film polymerization/ devolatilization device. In one
  aspect, the disclosure relates to a method for making a product including treating a
  reduced recalcitrance biomass (e.g., lignocellulosic or cellulosic material) with one or
  more enzymes and/or organisms to produce amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and
  converting the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid to the product.
  [0045]       Optionally, when the polymerization method is direct condensation, the
  polymerization can include utilizing coupling agents and/or chain extenders to increase
  the molecular weight of the polymer. For example, the coupling agents and/or chain
  extenders can include triphosgene, carbonyl diimidazole, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide,
  diisocyanate, acid chlorides, acid anhydrides, epoxides, thiirane, oxazoline, orthoester, and
  mixtures of these. Alternatively, the polymer can have a co monomer which is a
  polycarboxylic acid polyamide or polyamines or a combination of these.
  [0046]       In the implementations wherein polymers are made from the aspartic or
  glutamic acid, the methods can further include blending the polymer with a second
  polymer. For example, a second polymer can include polyglycols, polyvinyl acetate,
  polyolefins, styrenic resins, polyacetals, poly(meth)acrylates, polycarbonate, polybutylene
  succinate, elastomers, polyurethanes, natural rubber, polybutadiene, neoprene, silicone,
  and combinations of these.
  [0047]       In other implementations wherein polymers are made from the aspartic or
  glutamic acid a co-monomer can be co-polymerized with the glutamic or aspartic acid or
  a lactide such as the lactide based on lactic acid. For example, the co-monomer can
  include elastomeric units, lactones, glycolic acid, carbonates, morpholinediones, epoxides,

  borate, 4,4'-thiodiphenol, glycerol and mixtures of these.
  [0049]       In any implementation wherein polymers are made, the method can further
  include branching and/or cross linking the polymer. For example, the polymers can be
  treated with a cross linking agent including 5,5'-bis(oxepane-2-one)(bis- c -caprolactone)),
  spiro-bis-dimethylene carbonate, peroxides, dicumyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide,
  unsaturated alcohols, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2-butene-1,4-diol, unsaturated
  anhydrides, maleic anhydride, saturated epoxides, glycidyl methacrylate, irradiation and
  combinations of these. Optionally, a molecule (e.g., a polymer) can be grafted to the
  polymer. For example, grafting can be done treating the polymer with irradiation,
  peroxide, crossing agents, oxidants, heating or any method that can generate a cationic,
  anionic or radicle on the polymer.
  [0050]       In any implementation wherein polymers are processed, processing can include
  injection molding, blow molding and thermoforming.
  [0051]       In any implementation wherein polymers are processed, the polymers can be
  combined with a dye and/or a fragrance. For example, dyes that can be used include blue3,
  blue 356, brown 1, orange 29, violet 26, violet 93, yellow 42, yellow 54, yellow 82 and
  combinations of these. Examples of fragrances include wood, evergreen, redwood,
  peppermint, cherry, strawberry, peach, lime, spearmint, cinnamon, anise, basil, bergamot,
  black pepper, camphor, chamomile, citronella, eucalyptus, pine, fir, geranium, ginger,

  orange, patchouli, rose, rosemary, sage, sandalwood, tea tree, thyme, wintergreen, ylang
  ylang, vanilla, new car or mixtures of these fragrances. Fragrances can be used in any
  amount, for example, between about 0.005 % by weight and about 20 % by weight (e.g.,
  between about 0.1 % and about 5 wt. %, between about 0.25 wt.% and about 2.5 %).
  [0052]       In any implementation wherein polymers are processed, the polymer can be
  blended with a plasticizer. For example, plasticizers include triacetin, tributyl citrate,
  polyethylene glycol, GRINDSTED@ SOFT-N-SAFE (from Danisco, DuPont, Wilmington
  DE, diethyl bishydroxymethyl malonate) and mixtures of these.
  [0053]       In any of the implementations wherein polymers are made, the polymers can
  be processed or further processed by shaping, molding, carving, extruding and/or
  assembling the polymer into the product.

  [0054]       In another aspect, the invention relates to products made by the methods
  discussed above. For example, the products include a converted amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid wherein the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids is produced by the
  fermentation of biomass derived sugars (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid and the amino
  substituted malonic, adipic, pimelic, suberic azelaic and sebacic acids). The biomass
  includes cellulosic and lignocellulosic materials and these can release sugars by acidic or
  enzymatic saccharification. In addition, the biomass can be treated, e.g., by irradiation.
  The products, for example include polymers, including one or more amino dicarboxylic
  acids in the polymer backbone and optionally non-amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids
  in the polymer backbone. Optionally, the polymers can be cross-linked or graft co
  polymers. Additionally, the polymer can be, blended with a second polymer, blended with
  a plasticizer, blended with an elastomer, blended with a fragrance, blended with a dye,
  blended with a pigment, blended with a filler or blended with a combination of these.
  [0055]       In yet another embodiment, the invention relates to a system for
  polymerization including a reaction vessel, a screw extruder and a condenser. The system
  also includes a recirculating fluid flow path from an outlet of the reaction vessel to an inlet
  of the screw extruder and from an outlet of the screw extruder to an inlet to the reaction
  vessel. In addition, the system includes a fluid flow path from a second outlet of the
  reaction vessel to an inlet of the condenser. Optionally, the system further includes a
  vacuum pump in fluid connection with the second fluid flow path for producing a vacuum
  in the second fluid flow path. Also optionally, the system can include a control valve that
  in a first position provides a non-disrupted flow in the recirculating fluid flow path and in
  a second position provides a second fluid flow path. In some implementations, the second
  fluid flow path is from the outlet of the reaction vessel to an inlet of a pelletizer. In other
  implementations the second fluid flow path is from the outlet of the reaction vessel to the
  inlet of the extruder and from the outlet of the extruder to the inlet of a pelletizer.
  [0056]       Some of the products described herein, for example, aspartic or glutamic acid,
  can be produced by chemical methods. However, fermentative methods can be much more
  efficient, providing high biomass conversion, selective conversion and high production
  rates. In particular, fermentative methods can produce D- or L- isomers or mixtures of
  amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids (e.g., aspartic or glutamic acid) at chiral purity of
  near 100% or mixtures of these isomers, whereas the chemical methods typically produce
  racemic mixtures of the D- and L- isomers. When an amino dicarboxylic acid is listed

   [0071]      Using the equipment, methods and systems described herein, cellulosic and
  lignocellulosic feedstock materials, for example, that can be sourced from biomass (e.g.,
  plant biomass, animal biomass, paper, and municipal waste biomass) and that are often
  readily available but difficult to process, can be turned into useful products such as sugars
   and amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids. Included are equipment, methods and
   systems to chemically convert the primary products produced from the biomass to
   secondary product such as oligomers, polymers (e.g., homo and hetero polyglutamic and
  polyaspartic acid) and polymer derivatives (e.g., composites, elastomers, and co
  polymers). An amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid is shown in Structure I with the
   amino group substituted at the 2-carbon. The omega denotes the last carbon in the carbon
  chain not including the carbon of the carboxylic acid group.

   [0094]      For example, in Structure I, m is chosen from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7; n is
  chosen from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7; with the limitation that n + m must be less than or
  equal to 10. and R1, R 2 , R 3 are chosen from hydrogen, straight chain or branched alkyl
  groups, aromatics, and alkyl aromatics where the limitation is that there are less than 24
  carbons. Any combination of n, m and the R groups can be included in the alpha-amino,
  omega-dicarboxylic acid.
   [0095]      The alkyl groups, aromatic groups, and alkyl aromatic groups for R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ,
  R4, R5 , R6 , R 7 , and Rs, can be straight chain and may include methyl, ethyl, propyl,
  butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, lauryl, myristic, palmitic, stearic,
   arachidic, behenic, up to and including a 24 carbons. The branched chain may include,
  isopropyl, 2-butanyl, fsa2 and 3-pentyl, 2, 3, and 4 hexyl and other branched hydrocarbons
  up to 24 carbons. The alkyl aromatic may include alkyl substituted benzene, alkyl
   substituted naphthalene, and similar substituted alkyl aromatic compounds.
   [0096]      The amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid exists in various forms depending
  on the pH of its environment. It is understood that the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
   acid is meant to include all of these pH dependent forms. For example, for glutamic acid,
  the pKai= -carboxyl group, pKa2 =a-ammonium ion, and pKa3           = side chain group as the
  omega carboxylic acid, are 2.19, 9.67, 4.25 respectively and the isoelectronic point is
   3.22. As with all amino acids, the presence of acid protons depends on the residue's local
  chemical environment and the pH of the solution. The amphiphilic nature of these
  compounds lead to useful and varied products.
   [0097]      Biomass is a complex feedstock. For example, lignocellulosic materials
  include different combinations of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Cellulose is a linear
  polymer of glucose. Hemicellulose is any of several heteropolymers, such as xylan,
  glucuronoxylan, arabinoxylans and xyloglucan. The primary sugar monomer present (e.g.,
  present in the largest concentration) in hemicellulose is xylose, although other monomers
   such as mannose, galactose, rhamnose, arabinose and glucose are present. Although all
  lignins show variation in their composition, they have been described as an amorphous
                                              15

WO 2014/186670                                                                 PCT/US2014/038341
  dendritic network polymer of phenyl propene units. The amounts of cellulose,
  hemicellulose and lignin in a specific biomass material depend on the source of the
  biomass material. For example, wood-derived biomass can be about 38-49% cellulose, 7
  26% hemicellulose and 23-34% lignin depending on the type. Grasses typically are 33
  38% cellulose, 24-32% hemicellulose and 17-22% lignin. Clearly lignocellulosic biomass
  constitutes a large class of substrates.
  [0098]      Enzymes and biomass-destroying organisms that break down biomass, such as
  the cellulose, hemicellulose and/or the lignin portions of the biomass as described above,
  contain or manufacture various cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases), ligninases, xylanases,
  hemicellulases or various small molecule biomass-destroying metabolites. A cellulosic
  substrate is initially hydrolyzed by endoglucanases at random locations producing
  oligomeric intermediates. These intermediates are then substrates for exo-splitting
  glucanases such as cellobiohydrolase to produce cellobiose from the ends of the cellulose
  polymer. Cellobiose is a water-soluble 1,4-linked dimer of glucose. Finally cellobiase
  cleaves cellobiose to yield glucose. In the case of hemicellulose, a xylanase (e.g.,
  hemicellulase) acts on this biopolymer and releases xylose as one of the possible products.
  [0099]      FIG. 1 is a flow diagram showing processes for manufacturing is a flow
  diagram showing processes for manufacturing amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids
  from a feedstock (e.g., cellulosic or lignocellulosic materials). In an initial step (110) the
  method includes optionally mechanically treating a cellulosic and/or lignocellulosic
  feedstock. Before and/or after this treatment, the feedstock can be treated with another
  physical treatment (112), for example, irradiation, sonication, size reduction, steam
  explosion, oxidation, pyrolysis or combinations of these, to reduce or further reduce its
  recalcitrance. A sugar solution e.g., including glucose and/or xylose, is formed by
  saccharifying the feedstock (114). The saccharification can be, for example, accomplished
  efficiently by the addition of one or more enzymes, e.g., cellulases and/or xylanases (111).
  A product or several products can be derived from the sugar solution, for example, by
  fermentation to amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids (116). Following fermentation, the
  fermentation product (e.g., or products, or a subset of the fermentation products) can be
  purified or further processed, for example polymerized and/or isolated (124). Optionally,
  the sugar solution is a mixture of sugars and the organism selectively ferments only one of
  the sugars. The fermentation of only one of the sugars in a mixture can be advantageous as

  described in U.S. Patent 8,415,122, issued April 9, 2013 the entire disclosure of which is
  incorporated herein by reference. Optionally, enzymes (e.g., in addition to cellulases and
  xylanases) can be added in step (114), for example, a glucose isomerase can be used to
  isomerize glucose to fructose. Some relevant uses of isomerase are discussed in PCT

  [00100]      In some embodiments the liquids after saccharification and/or fermentation can
  be treated to remove solids, for example, by centrifugation, filtration, screening, or rotary
  vacuum filtration. For example, some methods and equipment that can be used during or
  after saccharification are disclosed in International App. No. PCT/US2013/048963 filed
  July 1, 2013, and International App. No. PCT/US2014/021584, filed on March 7, 2014,
  the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. In addition, other
  separation techniques can be used on the liquids, for example, to remove ions and de
  colorize. For example, chromatography, simulated moving bed chromatograph and
  electrodialysis can be used to purify any of the solutions and or suspensions described
  herein.
  [00101]      Some of these methods are discussed in International App. No.
  PCT/US2014/021638, filed on March 7, 2014, and International App. No.
  PCT/US2014/021815, filed on March 7, 2014, the entire disclosures of which are

  [00102]      Optionally the sugars released from biomass as describe in FIG 1, for example
  glucose, xylose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, mannose, galactose, arabinose, dimers (e.g.,
  cellobiose, sucrose), trimers, oligomers and mixtures of these, can be fermented to amino
  alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids. In some embodiments the saccharification and
  fermentation are done simultaneously.
  PREPARATION OF AMINO-ALPHA, OMEGA DICARBOXYLIC ACID
  [00103]      Organisms can utilize a variety of metabolic pathways to convert the sugars to
  amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids, and some organisms selectively only can use
                                            17

WO 2014/186670                                                                 PCT/US2014/038341
  specific pathways. Some organisms are homofermentative while others are
  heterofermentative.
  [00104]     Using the methods, equipment and systems described herein, either D- or L
  isomers of aspartic acid at an optical purity of near 100% (e.g., at least about 80%, at least
  about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 99%) can be produced.
  Optionally mixtures of the isomers can be produced in any ratio, for example, from 0%
  optical purity of any isomer up to 100% optical purity of any isomer. For example,
  genetically modified organisms can also be utilized.
  [00105]     Co-cultures of organisms, for example chosen from organisms as describe
  herein, can be used in the fermentations of sugars to amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
  acids in any combination. For example, two or more bacteria, yeasts and/or fungi can be
  combined with one or more sugars (e.g., glucose and/or xylose) where the organisms
  ferment the sugars together, selectively and/or sequentially. Optionally, one organism is
  added first and the fermentation proceed for a time, for example, until it stops fermenting
  one or more of the sugars, and then a second organism can be added to further ferment the
  same sugar or ferment a different sugar. Co-cultures can also be utilized, for example, to
  tune in a desirable racemic mixture of D- and L- aspartic acid by combining a D
  fermenting and L-fermenting organism in an appropriate ratio to form the targeted mixture
  of stereoisomers. Co-cultures can also be utilized to prepare mixtures of amino-alpha,
  omega-dicarboxylic acids, specifically, aspartic and glutamic acid in such a ratio that can
  lead to a copolymer of the aspartic and glutamic acids in a desired ratio.
  [00106]     In some embodiments some additives (e.g., media components) can be added
  during the fermentation. For example, additives that can be utilized include yeast extract,
  rice bran, wheat bran, corn steep liquor, black strap molasses, casein hydrolyzate,
  vegetable extracts, corn steep solid, ram horn waste, peptides, peptone (e.g., bactopeptone,
  polypeptone), pharmamedia, flower (e.g., wheat flour, soybean flour, cottonseed flour),
  malt extract, beef extract, tryptone, K 2 HPO4 , KH 2PO 4 , Na2 HPO 4, NaH 2 PO4 , (NH 4 ) 2 PO4 ,
  NH 4 0H, NH 4 NO, urea. ammonium citrate, nitrilotriacetic acid, MnSO 4 -5H 2 0,
  MgSO47H2O, CaCl 2.2H 2 0, FeSO 4 -7H2 0, B -vitamins (e.g., thiamine, riboflavin, niacin,
  niacinamide, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxine
  hydrochloride, biotin, folic acid), amino acids, sodium-L-glutamate, Na 2 EDTA, sodium
  acetate, ZnSO47H2O, ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, CuCl2, CoCl2 and CaCO3.
  Addition of protease can also be beneficial during the fermentation. Optionally,
  surfactants such as TWEENTM80 and antibiotics such as penicillin and chloramphenicol
                                             18

WO 2014/186670                                                                PCT/US2014/038341
  can also be beneficial. Additional carbon sources, for example glucose, xylose and other
  sugars. Antifoaming compounds such as Antifoam 204 can also be utilized.
  [00107]      In some embodiments the fermentation can take from about 8 hours to several
  days. For example, some batch fermentations can take from about I to about 20 days (e.g.,
  about 1-10 days, about 3-6 days, about 8 hours to 48 hours, about 8 hours to 24 hours).
  [00108]      In some embodiments the temperature during the fermentation is controlled.
  For example, the temperature can be controlled between about 20       0 C and 50 0 C (e.g.,
  between about 25 and 40    0 C, between about 30 and 40     0 C, between about 35 and 40   0 C
  ). In some case thermophilic organisms are utilized that operate efficiently above about 50
     C, for example, between about 50   0 C and 100   0 C (e.g., between about 50-90  0 C,
  between about 50 to 80   0 C, between about 50 to 70      C).
  [00109]      In some embodiments the pH is controlled, for example, by the addition of an
  acid or a base. The pH can be optionally controlled to be close to neutral (e.g., between
  about 4-8, between about 5-7, between about 5-6). Acids, for example, can be protic acids
  such as sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric, hydrochloride and acetic acids. Bases, for example,
  can include metal hydroxides (e.g., sodium and potassium hydroxide), ammonium
  hydroxide, and calcium carbonate. Phosphate and other buffers can also be utilized.
  [00110]      Several organisms can be utilized to ferment the biomass derived sugars to
  amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids. The organisms can be, for example,
  Corynebacterium,Corynebacteriumglutamicum, bacillus, Lactobacillusarabinosus e.
  coli, Rhizobium japonicum, BrevibacteriumfiavumAJ 3859, Brevibacterium
  lactofermentum AJ 3860, Corynebacteriumacetoacidophilum, Corynebacterium
  glutamicum (Micrococcus glutamicus), Serratiamarcescens , Pseudomonasfluorescens,
  Protens vulgaris, Pseudomonasaeruginosa, Bacterium succinium, Bacillus subtilis,
  Aerobacter aerogenes,Micrococcus sp., Escherichiacoli, Rhizobium lupini bacteroides,
  genetically modified organisms and the like. Blends of microorganisms may be needed so
  that the sugar is converted to a substrate that the amino, omega dicarboxylic acid
  producing microorganism may use.
  [00111]      The organism described above may also need a nitrogen source, which include
  ammonia, ammonium salts, urea and the like. Alternately, a fermentation microorganism
  (described below) can be combined with enzymes such as N-acetyl-glutamate synthase,
  transaminase, glutaminase, (an amidohydrolase enzyme), glutamate dehydrogenase,
  aldehyde dehydrogenase, formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase, glutamate
  carboxypeptidase II, and the like to produce amino, dicarboxylic acids.

WO 2014/186670                                                               PCT/US2014/038341
  [00112]      Fermentation methods include, for example, batch, fed batch, repeated batch or
  continuous reactors. Often batch methods can produce higher concentrations of amino
  alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid, while continuous methods can lead to higher
  productivities.
  [00113]      Fed batch methods can include adding media components and substrate (e.g.,
  sugars from biomass) as they are depleted. Optionally, products, intermediates, side
  products and/or waste products can be removed as they are produced. In addition, solvent
  (e.g., water) can be added or removed to maintain the optimal amount for the
  fermentation.
  [00114]      Options include cell-recycling. For example, using a hollow fiber membrane to
  separate cells from media components and products after fermentation is complete. The
  cells can then be re-utilized in repeated batches. In other optional methods the cells can be
  supported, for example, as described in US Application serial No. 13/293,971, filed on
  Nov. 10, 2011 and US patent No. 8,377,668, issued Feb 19, 2013 the entire disclosures of
  which are herein incorporated by reference.
  [00115]      The fermentation broth can be neutralized using calcium carbonate or calcium
  hydroxide which can form the calcium salts of the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
  acids. The mono or di calcium amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids broth can then be
  filtered to remove cells and other insoluble materials. In addition, the broth can be treated
  with a decolorizing agent. For example, the broth can be filtered through carbon. The
  broth is then concentrated, e.g., by evaporation of the water optionally under vacuum
  and/or mild heating, and can be crystallized or precipitated. Acidification, for example,
  with sulfuric acid, releases the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids acid back into
  solution which can be separated (e.g., filtered) from the insoluble calcium salts, e.g.,
  calcium sulfate. Addition of calcium carbonate during the fermentation can also serve as a
  way to reduce product inhibition since the calcium amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids
  is not inhibitory or causes less product inhibition.
  [00116]      Other metal salts can be used. When the amino group is substituted at the 2
  position the 2-amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids can form a metal chelate that can be
  isolated. Following isolation the 2-amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid chelate can be
  converted back to the 2-amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and the metal salt
  facilitating isolation of the 2-amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid.
  [00117]      Optionally, reactive distillation may be used to purify amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acids. For example, methylation of an amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid
                                              20

WO 2014/186670                                                                 PCT/US2014/038341
  provides the dimethyl and/or the methyl ester which can be distillated to pure ester which
  can then be hydrolyzed to the diacid and methanol that can be recycled. Esterification to
  other esters can also be used to facilitate the separation. For example, reactions with
   alcohols to the ethyl, propyl, butyl, hexyl, octyl or even esters with more than eight
  carbons can be formed and then extracted in a solvent or distilled.
   [00118]     Other alternative amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids separation
  technologies include adsorption, for example, on activated carbon, polyvinylpyridine,
  zeolite molecular sieves and ion exchange resins such as basic resins. Other methods
  include ultrafiltration, transition recrystallization, and electrodialysis(including using two
  compartment bipolar membranes).
   [00119]     Precipitation or crystallization of calcium amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
   acid by the addition of organic solvents is another method for purification. For example,
   alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, butanol, hexanol), ketones (e.g., acetone) can be utilized
  for this purpose. Other metal salts, especially those that form a chelate may be
  crystallization with these alternative solvent.
   [00120]     Glutamic acid: For example, several fermentation pathways are known that
  make glutamic acid. These pathways include hydrolysis of glutamine or N-acetyl
  glutamic acid; transamination of a-ketoglutarate; dehydrogenation of a-ketoglutarate;
  dehydrogenation of 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate by 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  dehydrogenase; and other known fermentation pathways.
   [00121]     Corynebacteriumglutamicum is especially useful for the production of
  glutamic acid. Genetically modified organisms can also be utilized to produce the amino
   alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid.
   [00122]     Aspartic acid: For example, several fermentation pathways are known that
  make aspartic acid. L- aspartic acid can be continuously produced from fumarate and
   ammonia with immobilized E. coli cells.
   [00123]     Similar methods can be utilized for the preparation of other amino-dicarboxylic
   acids. For example, the fermentative methods and procedures can be applicable for any of
  the amino-dicarboxylic acids described herein.
  PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM AMINO-ALPHA, OMEGA-DICARBOXYLIC ACID
   [00124]     Amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid produced as described herein can be
  used, for a variety of purposes. Its uses are derived from the structural aspects in that
  there is at least one amino group and two dicarboxylic acid groups. Each of these three
                                              21

WO 2014/186670                                                              PCT/US2014/038341
  groups has different chemistry associated with it. The amino group and either of the
  carboxylic acids can cyclize to form a four, five six or seven member lactam ring which
  can undergo further reaction. These cyclic compounds refer to the aspartic acid, glutamic
  acid, 2-aminoadipic acid and 2 amino pimelic acid respectively. The amino group and
  carboxylic acid can also form a chelate about a metal ion. The amphiphilic properties of
  these amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids provide a broad range of properties,
  especially in aqueous systems.
  [00125]      Many polymerization products can be made. One example, is the polyamide
  which results in a carboxylic acid being pendant to the polymer backbone. This polyamide
  is like a polyacrylate with a heteroatom backbone and as such may have more hydrophilic
  properties relative to the polyacrylates. Polyacrylates are not biodegradable, but these
  polyamides can be biodegradable. Another polymerization can result in a polyester or
  polyamide with polymerization utilizing the alpha and omega carboxylic acids and a diol
  or diamine respectively. These polymerizations may require using protecting groups for
  the unused reacting group. If the polymerization utilizes the carboxylic acid and the
  amine that is substituted on the same carbon as the amine it is described as an alpha
  product. If the carboxylic acid is the omega carboxylic acid polymer can be described by
  the carboxylic acid position of the chain. For aspartic acid the carboxylic acid is beta and
  for glutamic acid the carboxylic acid is gamma. The polymers may be homopolymers,
  copolymers with different amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and copolymers with
  other monomers.
  [00126]      Products from amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and their polymeric
  products include flavor enhancers, nutrients, plant growth additives, dispersants,
  adhesives, water softener chemicals, waste water treatment, water treatment, a component
  in food and cosmetics, as a superabsorbent (hydrogels), humectant, components in
  coatings, treatment of leather, drug delivery systems. In biological systems the amino
  alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids are useful in metabolism, as a gamma-amino butyric acid
  precursor, a neurotransmitter and a brain no synaptic glutamatergic signaling circuits.
  [00127]      The use of amino-alpha, omega dicarboxylic acids as dispersants offers
  interesting contrasts to dispersants such as poly (meth) acrylic dispersants. The dispersant
  use could be as an amide polymer or copolymer of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
  acids. The pendant carboxylic acid can act as the water compatible group in the
  dispersant. Since the polymer should be biodegradable it should offer different
  advantages relative to poly (meth) acrylic dispersants which are not biodegradable. The
                                            22

  polymer may be a random polymer or a structured polymer. Products from these amino
   alpha, omega dicarboxylic acids include flavor enhancers, coatings, dispersants,
   superabsorbent, drug delivery systems, plant growth, metal chelator, waste water
  treatment, water treatment, automotive additives.
   [00128]     The biomass derived amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids as described
  herein can be used in pharmaceutical applications, for example, for pH-regulation, metal
   sequestration, as a chiral intermediate and as a natural body constituent in pharmaceutical
  products.
   PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM ASPARTIC ACID
   [00129]     An important amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids is aspartic acid.       D-, L
   and D-, L- aspartic acids may be utilized in many products. There are two forms or
  enantiomers of aspartic acid. The name "aspartic acid" can refer to either enantiomer or a
  mixture of two. Of these two forms, only one, "L-aspartic acid", is directly incorporated
  into proteins. The biological roles of its counterpart, "D-aspartic acid" are more limited.
  Where enzymatic synthesis will produce one or the other, most chemical syntheses will
  produce both forms, "D-, L-aspartic acid," known as a racemic mixture.        Aspartic acid is
  non-essential in mammals, being produced from oxaloacetate by transamination. It can
   also be generated from ornithine and citrulline in the urea cycle. In plants and
  microorganisms, aspartate is the precursor to several amino acids, including four that are
  essential for humans: methionine, threonine, isoleucine, and lysine. The most prominent
  use of L-aspartic acid is its use in the sugar substitute aspartame. A dimer of aspartic acid
  D-, L-aspartic-N-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl) tetra sodium salt also known as sodium
  iminodisuccinate is used as a chelate for calcium to soften water and improve the cleaning
  function of the surfactant. Also, the chelating agent with metals can be used in agricultural
   applications to prevent, correct and minimize crop mineral deficiencies. Another simple
  derivative of aspartic acid is the reaction product of phosgene and similar reactants to
  produce the N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) derivatives. Many industrial uses are derived
  from polymers of aspartic acids which are described below.
  PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM GLUTAMIC ACID
   [00130]     D-, L- and D-, L- glutamic acids may be utilized in many products. There are
  two forms or enantiomers of glutamic acid. The name "glutamic acid" can refer to either
  enantiomer or a mixture of two. Of these two forms, only one, "L-glutamic acid", is
                                             23

WO 2014/186670                                                               PCT/US2014/038341
  directly incorporated into proteins. The biological roles of its counterpart, "D-glutamic
  acid" are more limited. Where enzymatic synthesis will produce one or the other, most
  chemical syntheses will produce both forms, "D-, L-glutamic acid," known as a racemic
  mixture.    Glutamic acid (abbreviated as Glu or E) is one of the 20-22 proteinogenic
  amino acids, and its codons are GAA and GAG. It is a non-essential amino acid. The
  carboxylate anions and salts of glutamic acid are known as glutamates.
  [00131]     The most prevalent industrial use of glutamic acid is as flavor additive in the
  mono sodium glutamate form, MSG. Another simple derivative of glutamic acid is the
  reaction product of phosgene and similar reactants to produce the N-carboxyanhydride
  (NCA) derivatives. Auxigro is a plant growth preparation that contains 30% glutamic
  acid. Emerging industrial uses are derived from polymers of glutamic acids which are
  described below.
  POLYMERIZATION OF AMINO-APLHA, OMEGA-DICARBOXYLIC ACIDS
  [00132]     Polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid are formed via many
  different polymerization schemes. Products include dimers, trimers, oligomers and
  polymers. One of these schemes results in a polyamide prepared as described herein can
  undergo an amide condensation to form polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
  acid is a polyamide with the amide linkage at the alpha and/or omega carboxylic acid. For
  polyaspartic acid the amide polymer is a mixture of amide being formed with the alpha or
  beta carboxylic acid. For polyglutamic acid the amide polymer is a mixture of amide
  being formed with the alpha or gamma carboxylic acid. Polymers can also be made by
  polymerizing the NCA derivative of the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid. The
  polymerization of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acids may be done with chemical
  means or via biochemical processes. The biochemical processes can lead to polymer
  products with stereo control, whereas the chemical processes will likely lead to racemized
  products.
  [00133]     Another example of a polymer product of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
  acids can be as a polyester via copolymerization with a diol. The amino group may need
  to be protected for this polymerization scheme to be viable. In a similar manner a
  different polyamide can be made if the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid (possibly
  with the amino group protected) is copolymerized with a diamine.
  [00134]     A low molecular weight polymer of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid can
  be produced can be made by controlling the reaction conditions. This method produces
                                           24

WO 2014/186670                                                                PCT/US2014/038341
  low molecular weight polymers. The condensation produces water which can prevent the
  production of high molecular weight polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid
  since the amide condensation reaction can be reversible. In addition, amide can be
  produced by backbiting from a chain end to form the lactam ring which reduces the
  molecular weight of the linear polymer.
  [00135]      One method for production of high molecular weight polymers of amino
  alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid is by coupling low Mw polymers of amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid, for example, made as described above, using chain coupling agents. For
  example, amine/ carboxylic acid terminated polymers of amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid can be synthesized by the condensation of carboxylic acid in the
  presence of small amounts of multifunctional hydroxyl compounds such as, ethylene
  glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-cyclohexanediol, 2-butene-1,4-diol,
  glycerol, 1.4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol. Alternatively, carboxyl-terminated polymers of
  amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid can be achieved by the condensation of amine
  functional group in the presence of small amounts of multifunctional carboxylic acids
  such as maleic, succinic, adipic, itaconic and malonic acid to form additional amide
  linkages. Other chain extending agents can have heterofunctional groups that couple either
  on the carboxylic acid end group of the PASA or the amino end group, for example, 6
  hydroxycapric acid, mandelic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-acetoxybenzoic acid. In a
  similar manner the amine end group may be reacted with diisocyanates which can form a
  urea linkage.
  [00136]      Esterification promotion agents can also be combined with aspartic acid to
  increase the molecular weight of polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid. For
  example, ester promotion agents include phosgene, diphosgene, triphosgene
  dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and carbonyldiimidazole. Some potentially undesirable side
  products can be produced by this method adding purification steps to the process. After
  final purification, the product can be very clean, free of catalysts and low molecular
  weight impurities.
  [00137]      The polymer molecular weights can also be increase by the addition of chain
  extending agents such as isocyanates, acid chlorides, anhydrides, epoxides, thiirande and
  oxazoline and orthoester.
  [00138]      Any of the polymerization schemes presented above can include small amounts
  of trisubsituted monomers such as a triamine, triol, a triisocyanate and the like to lead to
  some branching in the polymers. If too much trisubstituted monomer is included the
                                            25

  polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid may polymerize into a highly cross
  linked material.
  [00139]     The polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid may be polymerized
  with other monomers to form random or structured polymers. The structured polymers
  may include graft, block, star and other structured polymerization schemes.
  [00140]     Azeotropic condensation polymerization is another method to obtain high
  molecular weight polymer and does not require chain extenders or coupling agents. A
  general procedure for this route consists of reduced pressure (between 0.1-300 mm Hg)
  refluxing of polymerization of amino-alpha omega dicarboxylic acids for 1-10 hours
  between 1 10 C- 160 0 C to remove majority of the condensation water. Catalyst and/or
  solvents are added and heated further for 1-10 hours between 110 C-180 0 C under 0.1-300
  mm Hg. The polymer is then isolated or dissolved (methylene chloride, chloroform) and
  precipitated by the addition of a solvent (e.g., methyl ether, diethyl ether, methanol,
  ethanol, isopropanol, ethyl acetate, toluene) for further purification. Solvents used during
  to polymerization, catalyst, reaction time, temperature and level of impurities effect the
  rate of polymerization and hence the final molecular weight.
  [00141]     Additives, catalysts and promoters that can optionally be used include Protonic
  acids such as H 3 PO 4 , H 2 SO 4 , methane sulfonic acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid, supported
  sulfonic acid, NAFION@ NR 50 H+ form From DuPont, Wilmington DE, Acids
  supported on polymers, Metal catalysts, for example, include Mg, Al, Ti, Zn, Sn. Some
  metal oxides that can optionally catalyze the reaction include TiO2 , ZnO, GeO2, ZrO2,
  SnO, Sn02, Sb 20 3 . Metal halides, for example, that can be beneficial include ZnCl 2 ,
  SnCl 2 , SnCl 4 . Other metal containing catalysts that can optionally be used include
  Mn(AcO) 2, Fe 2(LA) 3, Co(AcO) 2 , Ni(AcO) 2, Cu(OA) 2, Zn(LA) 2, Y(OA) 3 , Al(i-PrO) 3,
  Ti(BuO) 4 , TiO(acac)2, (Bu)2SnO, tin octoate. Combinations and mixtures of the above
  catalysts can also be used. For example, two or more catalysts can be added at one time or
  sequentially as the polymerization progresses. The catalysts can also be removed,
  replenished and or regenerated during the course of the polymerization are for repeated
  polymerizations. Some preferred combinations include protonic acids and one of the metal
  continuing catalysts, for example, SnCl2/p-toluenesulfonic acid.
  [00142]     The azeotropic condensation can be done partially or entirely using a solvent.
  For example, a high boiling and aprotic solvent such as diphenyl ether, p-xylene, o
  chlorotoluene, o-dichlorobenzene and/or isomers of these. The polymerization can also be
  done entirely or partially using melt polycondensation. Melt polycondensations are done
                                               26

WO 2014/186670                                                               PCT/US2014/038341
   above the melting point of the polymers/oligomers without organic solvents. For example,
   at the beginning of the polymerization when there is a high concentration of low
  molecular weight species (e.g.,     acid amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and
  oligomers) there can be less need for a solvent, while as the molecular weight of the
  polymers increases, the addition of a high boiling solvent can improve the reaction rates.
   [00143]     During the polymerization, for example, especially at the beginning of the
  polymerization when the concentration of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid is high
   and water is being formed at a high rate, the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid,
   acid/water azeotropic mixture can be condensed and made to pass through molecular
   sieves to dehydrate the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid which is then returned to
  the reaction vessel.
   [00144]     Since removal of water is essential for polymerization to the polyamide, a thin
  film polymerization/devolatilization device may be used to facility the polymerization
  while removing the water. In one embodiment, the method of making a high molecular
  weight polymer or copolymer from oligomer, the method comprising evaporating water as
  it is formed during condensation of an amino alpha, omega dicarboxylic acid oligomer e.g.
   an aliphatic amino alpha, omega dicarboxylic acid, as it traverses a surface of a thin film
  evaporator. Water, as a coproduct of the condensation, needs to be removed from the high
  molecular weight polymer or copolymer, to maximize the conversion to higher molecular
  weight materials and minimize the undesirable reverse reaction where the water adds back
   and releases a monomer unit, dimer unit or oligomer of the amino alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid.
   [00145]     In another embodiment, the thin film evaporator unit operation is described in
  more detail and the polymerization process is denoted in three steps or stages for the
  conversion to high molecular weight polymers. FIG. 1 shows a schematic of the
  polymerization process with the three polymerization steps indicated. A recycle loop
  which takes the product of the thin film evaporator/thin film
  polymerization/devolatilization device and recycle to the input of the thin film
  evaporator/thin film polymerization/devolatilization device. The thin film evaporator/thin
  film polymerization/devolatilization device product stream may be split between recycle
   and sending a portion of the product stream to product collection.
   [00146]     First, excess water is removed from the amino alpha, omega dicarboxylic acid.
  As the acid is derived from biomass processing, it is likely in an aqueous solvent. The
  condensation process to make the polyamide produces water and thus, the excess water
                                             27

WO 2014/186670                                                               PCT/US2014/038341
  must be removed. The removal may be done in a batch or continuous process, with or
  without vacuum and at temperatures to achieve effective water removal rates. Some
  condensation to form amide bonds can occur during step 1 and low molecular weight
  oligomers may be formed.
  [00147]     After excess water is removed, further heating and, optional processing with
  vacuum to remove more water. At this stage in the process, the conversion of the amino
  alpha, omega dicarboxylic acid results in an increased degree of oligomerization based on
  the number average molecular weight of the oligomer/polymer.
  [00148]     A polymerization catalyst is added to the oligomer/polymer system. The
  candidate polymer catalyst(s) is described above and further described below. The
  catalyst may be added by any convenient means. For instance, the catalyst components
  can be dissolved/dispersed into the amino alpha, omega dicarboxylic acid and added to the
  oligomer/polymer.
  [00149]     With the catalyst present more conversion of the oligomer/polymer mixture
  occurs to obtain a higher degree of polymerization. This is achieved by the catalytic
  action of the catalysts added and a combination of more heating and higher vacuums.
  [00150]     Next the thin film polymerization/devolatilization device can be utilized to
  obtain polymers with even higher a degree of polymerization. The thin film has a
  thickness of less than lcm, optionally less than 0.5 cm, or further less than 0.25 cm,
  additional less than 0.1 cm.
  [00151]      The thin film polymerization/devolatilization device is configured such that
  fluid polymer is conveyed to the device such that the film of the fluid polymer is less than
  1 cm thick and the device provides a means for volatilizing the water formed in the
  reaction and other volatile components. The polymerization type is characterized as
  polymerization in the melt phase. The thin/film polymerization/devolatilization device
  and the thin film evaporator describe herein are similar in that they accomplish the same
  function.
  [00152]     The hydroxylic medium can be water; mixtures of water and compatible
  solvents such as methanol, ethanol; and low molecular weight alcohols such as methanol,
  ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, iso-butanol, and similar alcohols.
  [00153]     The temperature of the thin film polymerization/ devolatilization device is
  from 100 to 2600 C. Optionally, the temperature of the thin film polymerization/
  devolatilization device is from 120 to 2400 C. Additionally, the temperature is between
  140 and 220 'C.

WO 2014/186670                                                                  PCT/US2014/038341
   [00154]      The thin film polymerization/devolatilization device can operate at high
  vacuum with pressures of 0.0001 torr and lower. The thin film polymerization/
  devolatilization device can operate e.g. at 0.001 torr or lower; or 0.01 torr or lower.
  During some stages of operation the operating pressures can be considered low and
  medium vacuum; 760 to 25 torr and 25 to 0.001 torr, respectively. The device may operate
   at a pressure of 100 to 0.0001 torr, or alternatively, 50 to 0.001 torr, or optionally, 25 to
  0.001 torr.
   [00155]      The thin film polymerization/devolatilization device can optionally include a
  recycle loop in which the melt polymerization product is recycled to the entrance point of
  the thin film polymerization/ devolatilization device. It can also be coupled to an
  extrusion device. The melt polymerization product can be processed from the thin film
  polymerization/devolatilization device to an extruder which can pass the product to
  finished product area. Alternately, the flow of the output of the extruder may be directed
  back to the thin film polymerization/devolatilization device. The flow may be split
  between the product and the recycle. The extruder system is a convenient location to
  incorporate additives into the melt polymerization product for recycle and subsequent
  reaction or for blending into the polymer stream prior to transferring to the product
  finishing area. The additives were described above and below. The additive addition
  includes compounds that react into the polymer, react on the polymer or physically mix
  with the polymer.
   [00156]      Optionally, the catalyst may be removed from the molten polymer. Removing
  catalyst may be accomplished just prior to, during, or after the thin film evaporator/thin
  film polymerization/devolatilization device. The catalyst may be filtered from the molten
  polymer by using a filtration system similar to a screen pack. Since the molten polymer is
  flowing around the thin film evaporator/thin film polymerization/devolatilization device, a
  filtration system can be added.
   [00157]      To facilitate the catalyst removal a neutralization or chelation chemical may be
   added. Candidate compounds include phosphites, anhydrides, poly carboxylic acids,
  polyamines, hydrazides, EDTA( and similar compounds) and the like. These
  neutralization and/or chelation compounds can be insoluble in the molten polymer leading
  to facile filtration. Polycarboxylic acids include polyacrylic acids and polymethacrylic
   acids. The latter can be in a both a random, block, and graft polymer configuration. The
   amines include ethylene diamine, oligomers of ethylene diamine and other similar
  polyamines such as methyl bis -3-amino, propane.

   [00158]      Another option to remove the catalyst includes adding solid materials to the
  polymer melt. Examples of added materials include silica, alumina, aluminosilicates,
  clays, diatomaceous earth, polymers and like solid materials . Each of these can be
  optionally functionalized to react/bind with the catalyst. When the catalyst binds/bonds to
  these structures it can be filtered from the polymer.
   [00159]      Copolymers can be produced by adding monomers other than amino-alpha,
  omega-dicarboxylic acid during the azeotropic condensation reaction. For example, any of
  the multifunctional hydroxyl, carboxylic compounds or the heterofunctional compounds
  that can be used as coupling agents for low molecular weight polymers of amino-alpha,
  omega-dicarboxylic acid can also be used as co-monomers in the azeotropic condensation
  reaction.
   [00160]      Optionally, ring opening polymerization of the 5 member ring of amino-alpha,
  omega-dicarboxylic acid can provide polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid.
  Methods to form the polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid include
  condensing the amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid, with or without catalysts at 110
   180 0 C and removing the water of condensation under vacuum, for example, 1mm Hg- 100
  mm Hg, to produce 1000-5000 molecular weight polymer or prepolymer.
   [00161]      Catalysts can be used for polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid
  formation. For example, catalysts that can be used include, tin oxide (SnO), Sn(II) octoate,
  Li carbonate, Zn diacetate dehydrate, Ti(tetraisopropoxide), potassium carbonate, tin
  powder, combinations thereof and mixtures of these. Catalysts can be used in combination
   and/or sequentially.
   [00162]      The cyclic monomer can be ring open polymerized (ROP) by solution, bulk,
  melt and suspension polymerization and is catalyzed by cationic, anionic, coordination or
  free radical polymerization. Some catalysts used, for example, include protonic acids,
  HBr, HCl, triflic acid, Lewis acids, ZnCl 2 , AlCl 3 , anions, potassium benzoate, potassium
  phenoxide, potassium t-butoxide, and zinc stearate, metals, Tin, zinc, aluminum,

   [00164]      FIG. 2 shows a schematic view of a reaction system for polymerizing amino
   alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid. The reaction system (510) includes a stainless steel
  jacked reaction tank (520), a vented screw extruder (528), a pelletizer (530), a heat
  exchanger (534) and a condensation tank (540). An outlet (521) of the reaction tank is
  connected to a tube (e.g., stainless steel) which is connected to an inlet (545) to a heat
  exchanger. An outlet (546) to the heat exchanger is connected to another tube (e.g.,
   stainless steel) and is connected to an inlet (548) to the condensation tank (540). The tubes
   and connections from the reaction tank and condensation tank provide a fluid pathway
   (e.g., water vapor/air) between the two tanks. A vacuum can be applied to the fluid
  pathway between the tanks (520) and (540) by utilizing a vacuum pump (550) that is
  connected to port (549).
   [00165]      The reaction tank (520) includes an outlet (524) that can be connected to a tube
   (e.g., stainless steel) that is connected to an inlet to a screw extruder (560). An outlet to
  the extruder (562) is connected to a tube which is connected optionally through a valve
   (560) to the reaction tank (520) through inlet (527). Optionally the outlet to the extruder
   (562) is connected through valve (560) to the pelletizer (530) through inlet (532). Tubes

  and connections from the reaction tank and extruder provide a circular fluid pathway (e.g.,
  reactants and products) between the reaction tank and extruder when the valve (560) is set
  in recirculating position. The tubes and connections from the reaction tank to the pelletizer
  provide a fluid pathway between the reaction tank and pelletizer when the valve (560) is
  set in pelletizing position.
  [00166]       When in operation, the tank can be charged with amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid. The amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid is heated in the tank
  utilizing the stainless steel heating jacket (522). In addition, a vacuum is applied to the
  condensation tank (540) and therefore to the reaction tank (520) through the stainless steel
  tubing and connections using the vacuum pump (550). The heating of the amino-alpha,
  omega-dicarboxylic acid accelerates the condensation reactions (e.g., esterification
  reactions) to form oligomers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid while the applied
  vacuum helps volatilize the water that is produced. Water vapor travels out of the
  reactants and out of the reaction tank (520) and towards the heat exchanger (534) as
  indicated by the arrow. The heat exchanger cools the water vapor and the condensed water
  drops into the condensation tank (540) through the tubes and connections previously
  described. Multiple heat exchangers can be utilized. Since the amino-dicarboxylic acids
  can be corrosive the reactor equipment and other associated equipment may be clad or
  coated with corrosive resistant metals such as tantalum, alloys such as HASTELLOYTM, a
  trademarked alloy from Haynes International, and the like. It can also be coated with inert
  high temperature polymeric coatings such as TEFLONTM from DuPont, Wilmington De.
  Also, water undoubtedly hydrates the acid and the acid end of the polymer. When those
  waters of hydration are removed the acidity can be much higher, since it is not leveled by
  the waters of hydration.
  [00167]      In addition, during operation, extruder (528) can be engaged and operated to
  draw the reactants (e.g., amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid, oligomers and polymers)
  out of the tank. When the valve (560) is set in recirculating position the reactants are
  circulated back to the reaction tank in the direction shown by the arrows. In addition to the
  extruder, the flow can be controlled by valve (525), for example, the valve can be set to
  closed for no flow, open for maximal flow or an intermediate position for lower or high
  flow rates (e.g., between about 0 and 100% open, e.g., about 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%,
  50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or about 100% open).
  [00168]      The reaction can be continued with reactants following a circular pathway
  (e.g., with valve in recirculating position) until a desired polymerization is achieved. This
                                             32

WO 2014/186670                                                                  PCT/US2014/038341
  circulating pathway provides mixing and shearing that can help the polymerization (e.g.,
  increase molecular weight, control polydispersity, improve the kinetics of the
  polymerization, improve temperature distribution and diffusion of reacting species).The
  products (e.g. polymer) can then be directed to the pelletizer by setting valve (560) to the
  pelletizing position. The pelletizer then can produce pellets which can be collected. Pellets
  can be of various shapes and sizes. For example, spherical or approximately spherical,
  hollow tube shaped, filled tube shape with, for example, approximate volumes, between
   about 1mm3 to about lcm3 . The pelletizer can also be replaced with other equipment, for
  example, extruders, mixers, reactors, and filament makers.
   [00169]      The extruder (528) can be a vented screw extruder so that water or other
  volatile compounds can be removed from further processing. The extruder can be a single
   screw extruder or a multiple screw extruder. For example, the extruder can be a double
   screw extruder with co-rotating or counter rotating screws. The screw extruder can also be
   a hollow flight extruder and can be heated or cooled. The screw extruder can be fitted with
  ports to its interior. The ports can be utilized, for example, for the addition of additives,
   addition of co-monomers, addition of cross-linking agents, addition of catalysts,
  irradiation treatments and addition of solvents. The ports can also be utilized for sampling
   (e.g., to test the progress of the reaction or troubleshoot). In addition to sampling, the
  torque applied to the extruder can be used to monitor the progress of the polymerization
   (e.g., as the viscosity increases). An inline mixer such as a static mixer can also be
  disposed in the pathway of the circulating reactants, for example, before or after the screw
  extruder, providing a tortuous path for the reactants which can improve the mixing
   supplied to the reactants.
   [00170]      The position of the return port (527) allows the reactants to flow down the side
  of the tank, increasing the surface area of the reactants facilitating the removal of water.
  The return port can include multiple (e.g. a plurality of ports) disposed at various positions
  in the tanks. For example, the plurality of return ports can be placed circumferentially
   around the tank.
   [00171]      The tank can include a reciprocating scraper (529) which can help push the
  formed polymer/oligomers down the reaction tank, for example, during or after
  completion of the reaction. Once the reciprocating scraper moves down, the scraper can
  then be moved back up, for example, to a resting position. The scraper can be moved up
   and down the tank by engaging with and axel (640) that is attached to the hub (650). In
   another possible embodiment, the hub can be tapped for mechanical coupling to a screw,

  for example, wherein the axel is a screw-axel that extends to the bottom of the tank. The
  screw-axel can then turn to drive the scraper down or up.
  [00172]      A top view of one embodiment of a reciprocating scraper is shown in FIG. 3A
  while a front cut out view is shown in FIG. 3B. The reciprocating scraper includes pistons
  (620) attached to a hub (650) and scraping ends (630). The scraping end is in the form of a
  compression ring with a gap (660). The pistons apply pressure against the inside surfaces
  of the tank (615) through the scraping ends (630) while the scraper can be moved down
  the tank as shown by the arrow in FIG. 3B. The gap (660) allows the expansion and
  contraction of the scraper. The scraper can be made of any flexible material, for example,
  steel such as stainless steel. The gap is preferably as small as possible (e.g., less than about
  1", less than about 0.1", less than about 0.01" or even less than about 0.001").
  [00173]      Another embodiment of a reciprocating scraper is shown in FIG. 3C and FIG.
  3D. In this second embodiment the scraping ends include a lip-seal. The lip seal can be
  made of a flexible material, for example, rubber. The movement of the lip-seal as the
  scraper moves up and down acts as a squeegee against the inside of the reaction tank.
  [00174]      The tank (520) can be 100 gal in size, although larger and smaller sizes can be
  utilized (e.g., between about 20 to 10, 000 gal, e.g., at least 50 gal, at least 200 gal, at least
  500 gal, at least 1000 gal). The tank, for example, can be shaped with a conical bottom or
  rounded bottom.
  [00175]      In addition to the inlets and outlets discussed, the tank can also include other
  openings, for example, to allow the addition of reagents or for access to the interior of the
  tank for repairs.
  [00176]      During the reaction the temperature in the tank can be controlled from between
  about 100 and 220     0 C. The polymerization can preferably started at about 100    0 C and the
  temperature increased to about 200 'C over several hours ( e.g., between 1 and 48 hours, 1
  and 24 hours, 1 and 16 hours, 1 and 8 hours). A vacuum can be applied between about 0.1
  and 2 mmHg). For example, at the beginning of the reaction about 0.1mmHg and at the
  end of the reaction about 2 mmHg.
  [00177]      Water from the condenser tank (540) can be drained trough an opening (542)
  utilizing control valve (544).
  [00178]       The heat exchanger can be a fluid cooled heat exchanger. For example, cooled
  with water, air or oil. Several heat exchangers can be used, for example, as needed to
  condense as much of the water as possible. For example, a second heat exchanger can be
  located between the vacuum pump and the condensation tank (540).

   [00179]     The equipment and reactions described herein (e.g., FIG. 2 can also be used for
  polymerization of other monomers. In addition, the equipment can be utilized after or

   1210 a fluid transfer unit 1212 (e.g., including a pump) to remove condensed water and
  volatile components and a product isolation device 1214. The effluent from 1212 can
  optionally be taken to a another unit operation to recover the useful volatile components
  for recycle back to polymerization steps, for example, the first step discussed above. The
  thin film evaporator or thin film polymerization/devolatilization device is preferably
  utilized in the third step describe above. The fluid transfer unit is shown as a pump.

   an ellipse 1258 of flowing polymer flowing to the exit of the device at 1254. The volatiles
   are removed through pipe 1256.
   [00182]      The internals of the thin film evaporator or thin film polymerization/
  devolatilization device can be in different configurations, but can be configured to assure
  that the polymer fluid flows in a thin film through the device. This is to facilitate
  volatilization of the water that is in the polymer fluid or is formed by a condensation
  reaction. For instance, the surface may be slanted at an angle relative to the straight sides
  of the device. The surface may be separately heated such that the surface is 0 to 40 'C
  hotter than the polymer fluid. With this heated surface it can be heated to up to 300 'C, as
  much as 40 'C higher than the overall temperature of the device.
   [00183]     The thickness of the polymer fluid flowing along the thin film part of the
  device is less than 1 cm, optionally less than 0.5 cm or alternately less than 0.25 cm.
   [00184]     The thin film evaporator and thin film polymerization/ devolatilization device
   are similar in function. Other similar devices similar in function should be considered to
  have the same function as these. Descriptively, these include wiped film evaporators (e.g.,
   as previously described), short path evaporator, a shell and tube heat exchanger and the

  not shown for clarity. The output of the pump 1916 is connected to inlet 1910, the device
  output 1912 is connected to the inlet of the pump 1914. The product isolation section is
  not shown. Internal in the thin film polymerization/ devolatilization device is a slanted
  surface. The polymer fluid is flowed to the inlet with the configured such that the
  polymer fluid flows onto the slanted surface. This slanted surface may be separately
  heated as described above.

  [00187]     The thin film polymerization/devolatilization device is configured such that
  fluid polymer is conveyed to the device such that the film of the fluid polymer is less than
  1 cm thick and provides a means for volatilizing the water formed in the reaction and
  other volatile components. The temperature of the thin film evaporator and
  polymerization/devolatilization device are from 100 to 2400 C and the pressure of the
  device is from 0.000014 to 50 kPa. A full vacuum may be used in the evaporator device.

  less than 0.0001 torr.
  STEREOCHEMISTRY POLYMERS OF AMINO-ALPHA, OMEGA-DICRBOXYLIC
  ACID
  [00188]     Mechanical and thermal properties of polymers of amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid are influenced by the molecular weight and stereochemical composition
  of the backbone. The stereochemical composition of the backbone can be controlled by
  the choice and ratios of monomers; D- amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid, L
                                             36

WO 2014/186670                                                                PCT/US2014/038341
  polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and whether the alpha or the omega
  carboxylic acid is part of the backbone.
  [00189]      The molecular weight of the polymers can be controlled, for example, as
  discussed above. FIG. 4 shows the polymer products of the polyamide as shown for
  aspartic acid. Other polyamides will have similar configurations with amide linkages
  being to the alpha carboxylate and omega carboxylate. For instance, for aspartic acid the
  omega carboxylate is at the beta position and for glutamic acid the omega carboxylate is at
  the gamma position.
  [00190]      The thermal treatment of samples, for example, rates of melting,
  recrystallization, and annealing history, can in part determine the amount of
  crystallization. Therefore, comparisons of the thermal, chemical and mechanical
  properties of polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid should generally be most
  meaningful for polymers with a similar thermal history.
  COPOLYMERS, CROSSLINKING AND GRAFTING OF POLYMERS OF AMINO
  ALPHA, OMEGA DICARBOXYLIC ACIDS
  [00191]      Variation of polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid by the
  formation of copolymers as discussed above also has a very large influence on the
  properties, for example, by disrupting and decreasing the crystallinity and modulating the
  glass transition temperatures. For example, polymers with increased flexibility, improved
  hydrophilicity, better degradability, better biocompatibility, better tensile strengths, and
  improved elongations properties can be produced.
  [00192]      Some additional useful monomers that have been copolymerized with amino
  alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid include 1,4-benzodioxepin-2,3(H)-dione glycosalicylide;
  1.3-benzodioxepin-2,5-(3H, 3-methyl)-dione lactosalicylide; dibenzo-1,5-dioxacin-6,12
  dione disalicylide; morpholine-2,5-dione, 1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione, glycolide; oxepane-2
  one trimethylene carbonate; 2,2-dimethyltrimethylene carbonate; 1,5-dioxepane-2-one;
  1,4-dioxane-2-one p-dioxanone; gamma-butyrolactone; beta-butyrolactone; beta-methyl
  delta-valerolactone; beta-methyl-gamma-valerolactone; 1,4-dioxane-2,3-dione ethylene
  oxalate; 3[(benzyloxyacarbonyl)methyl]-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione;       ethylene oxide; propylene
  oxide, 5,5'-(oxepane-2-one) and 2,4,7,9-tetraoxa-spiro[5,5] undecane-3,8-dione Spiro-bis
  dimethylene carbonate.
  [00193]      The amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid polymers and co-polymers can be
  modified by cross linking. Cross linking can affect the thermal and rheological properties
                                            37

WO 2014/186670                                                               PCT/US2014/038341
  without necessarily deteriorating the mechanical properties. For example, 0.2 mol % 5,5'
  bis(oxepane-2-one)(bis- c -caprolactone)) and 0.1-0.2 mol% spiro-bis-dimethylene
  carbonate cross linking. Free radical hydrogen abstraction reactions and subsequent
  polymer radical recombination is an effective way of inducing crosslinks into a polymer.
  Radicals can be generated, for example, by high energy electron beam and other
  irradiation (e.g., between about 0.01 Mrad and 15 Mrad, e.g. between about 0.01-5 Mrad,
  between about 0.1-5 Mrad, between about 1-5 Mrad). For example, irradiation methods
  and equipment are described in detail below.     Crosslinking can also be achieved with the
  inclusion of tri-substituted monomers in modest amounts. The amounts of tri-substituted
  monomers can be less than 5 wt. % based on the aspartic acid, alternately less than 3 wt.
  [00194]     Alternatively or in addition, peroxides, such as organic peroxides are effective
  radical producing and cross linking agents. For example, peroxides that can be used
  include hydrogen peroxide, dicumyl peroxide; a,a'-bis(tert- butylperoxy)
  diisopropylbenzene; benzoyl peroxide; 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)hexane; tert
  butylperoxy 2-ethylhexyl carbonate; tert-Amyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate; 1,1 -di(tert
  amylperoxy)cyclohexane; tert-amyl peroxyneodecanoate; tert-amyl peroxybenzoate; tert
  amylperoxy 2-ethylhexyl carbonate; tert-amyl peroxyacetate; 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(2
  ethylhexanoylperoxy)hexane; tert-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate; 1,1 -di(tert
  butylperoxy)cyclohexane; tert-butyl peroxyneodecanoate; tert-butyl peroxyneoheptanoate;
  tert-Butyl peroxydiethylacetate; 1,1 -di(tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane;
  3,6,9-triethyl-3,6,9-trimethyl-1,4,7-triperoxonane; di(3,5,5-trimethylhexanoyl) peroxide;
  tert-butyl peroxyisobutyrate; tert-butyl peroxy-3,5,5-trimethylhexanoate; di-tert-butyl
  peroxide; tert-butylperoxy isopropyl carbonate; tert-butyl peroxybenzoate; 2,2-di(tert
  butylperoxy)butane; di(2-ethylhexyl) peroxydicarbonate; di(2-ethylhexyl)
  peroxydicarbonate; tert-butyl peroxyacetate; tert-butyl cumyl peroxide; tert
  amylhydroperoxide; 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl hydroperoxide, and mixtures of these. The
  effective amounts can vary, for example, depending on the peroxide, cross-linking
  reaction conditions and the desired properties (e.g., amount of cross linking). For example,
  cross-linking agents can be added from between about 0.01- 10 wt.% ( e.g., about 0.1-10
  wt.%, about 0.01-5 wt.%, about 0.1-1 wt.%, about 1-8 wt.%, about 4-6 wt.%). For
  example, peroxides such as 5.25 wt.% dicumyl peroxide and 0.1% benzoyl peroxide are
  effective radical producing and cross linking agents for amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
  acid and amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid derivatives. The peroxide cross-linking

WO 2014/186670                                                                PCT/US2014/038341
  agents can be added to polymers as solids, liquids or solutions, for example, in water or
  organic solvents such as mineral spirits. In addition radical stabilizers can be utilized.
  [00195]     Cross linking can also be effectively accomplished by the incorporation of
  unsaturation in the polymer chain either by: initiation with unsaturated alcohols such as
  hydroxyethyl methacrylate or 2-butene-1,4-diol; the post reaction with unsaturated
  anhydrides such as maleic anhydride; or copolymerization with unsaturated epoxides such
  as glycidyl methacrylate.
  [00196]     In addition to cross linking, grafting of functional groups and polymers to
  amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid polymer or co-polymer is an effective method of
  modifying the polymer properties. For example, radicals can be formed as described
  above and a monomer, functionalizing polymer or small molecule. For example,
  irradiation or treatment with a peroxide and then quenching with a functional group
  containing an unsaturated bond can effectively functionalize the amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid backbone.
  BLENDING POLYMERS OF AMINO-ALPHA, OMEGA-DICARBOXYLIC ACID
  [00197]     Amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid can be blended with other polymers as
  miscible or immiscible compositions. For immiscible blends the composition can be one
  with the minor component (e.g., below about 30 wt. %) as small (e.g., micron or sub
  micron) domains in the major component. When one component is about 30 to 70 wt. %
  the blend can form a co-continuous morphology (e.g., lamellar, hexagon phases or
  amorphous continuous phases). For instance, addition of polyaspartic acid to poly lactic
  acid can accelerate degradation and improvement of thermal stability.
  [00198]     Blending can be accomplished by melt mixing above the glass transition
  temperature of the amorphous polymer components. Screw extruders (e.g., single screw
  extruders, co-rotating twin screw extruders, counter rotating twin screw extruders) can be
  useful for this.
  [00199]     Polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polypropylene oxide (PPO) can be blended with
  amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid. Lower molecular weight glycols (300-1000 Mw)
  are miscible with amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid while PPO becomes immiscible
  at higher molecular weight. These polymers, especially PEO, can be used to increase the
  water transmission and bio-degradation rate of polymers of amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid. They can also be used as polymeric plasticizers to lower the modulus
  and increase flexibility of polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid.

  [00200]      Blends of polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and polyolefins
  (polypropylene and polyethylene) can result in incompatible systems with poor physical
  properties due to the poor interfacial compatibility and high interfacial energy. However,
  the interfacial energy can be lowered, for example, by the addition of third component
  compatibilizers, such as glycidyl methacrylate grafted polyethylene. Polystyrene and high
  impact polystyrene resins are also non-polar and blends with polymers of amino-alpha,
  omega-dicarboxylic acid are generally not very compatible.
  [00201]      Polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and acetals can be blended
  making compositions with useful properties.
  [00202]      Polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid may be miscible with
  polymethyl methacrylate and many other acrylates and copolymers of (meth)acrylates.
  Drawn films of PMMA/ polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid blends can be
  transparent and have high elongation.
  [00203]      Polycarbonate can be combined with polymers of amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid. The compositions may have high heat resistance, flam resistance and
  toughness and have applications, for example, in consumer electronics such as laptops.
  [00204]      Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) can be blended with polymers of amino
  alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid although the polymers may not miscible.
  [00205]      Poly(propylene carbonate) can be blended with polymers of amino-alpha,
  omega-dicarboxylic acid providing a biodegradable composite since both polymers are
  biodegradable.
  [00206]      PASA can also be blended with poly(butylene succinate). Blends can impart
  thermal stability and impact strength to the polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
  acid.
  [00207]      PEG, poly propylene glycol, poly (vinyl acetate), anhydrides (e.g., maleic
  anhydride) and fatty acid esters have been added as plasticizers and/or compatibilizers.
  [00208]      Blending can also be accomplished with the application of irradiation,
  including irradiation and quenching. For example, irradiation or irradiation and quenching
  as described herein applied to biomass can be applied to the irradiation of polymers of
  amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
  acid copolymers for any purpose, for example, before, after and/or during blending. This
  treatment can aid in the processing, for example, making the polymers more compatible
  and/or making/breaking bonds within the polymer and/or blended additive (e.g., polymer,
  plasticizer). For example, between about 0.1 Mrad and 150 Mrad followed by quenching

  COMPOSITES OF POLYMERS OF AMINO-ALPHA, OMEGA-DICARBOXYLIC
  ACIDS
  [00209]       Polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid polymers, co-polymers and
  blends can be combined with synthetic and/or natural materials. For example, polymers of
  amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and any polymers of amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid derivative (e.g., polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid
  copolymers, polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid blends, grated polymers
  of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid, cross-linked polymers of amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid) can be combined with synthetic and natural fibers. For example,
  protein, starch, cellulose, plant fibers (e.g., abaca, leaf, skin, bark, kenaf fibers), inorganic
  fillers, flax, talc, glass, mica, saponite and carbon fibers. This can provide a material with,
  for example, improved mechanical properties (e.g., toughness, harness, strength) and
  improved barrier properties (e.g., lower permeability to water and/or gasses).
  [00210]       Nano composites can also be made by dispersing inorganic or organic
  nanoparticles into either a thermoplastic or thermoset polymer. Nanoparticles can be
  spherical, polyhedral, two dimensional nanofibers or disc-like nanoparticles. For example,
  colloidal or microcrystalline silica, alumina or metal oxides (e.g., TiO 2); carbon
  nanotubes; clay platelets.
  [00211]       Composites can be prepared similarly to polymer blends, for example, utilizing
  screw extrusion and/or injection molding. Irradiation as described herein can also be
  applied to the composites, during, after or before their formation. For example irradiation
  of the polymer and combination with the synthetic and/or natural materials, or irradiation
  of the synthetic and/or natural materials and combination with the polymer, or irradiation

  deposition.
  PLA WITH PLASTICIZERS AND ELASTOMERS
  [00212]      In addition to the blends previously discussed, polymers of amino-alpha,
  omega-dicarboxylic acid and polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid
  derivatives can be combined with plasticizers.
  [00213]      Polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid can be blended with
  monomeric and oligomeric plasticizers. Monomeric plasticizers, such as tributyl citrate,
  TbC, and diethyl bishydroxymethyl malonate, DBM, may decrease the T of PASA.
  Increasing the molecular weight of the plasticizers by synthesizing oligoesters and
  oligoesteramides can result in blends with T depressions slightly smaller than with the
  monomeric plasticizers. The compatibility with polymers of amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid can be dependent on the molecular weight of the oligomers and on the
  presence of polar groups (e.g., amide groups, hydroxyl groups, ketones, esters) that can
  interact with the polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid chains. The materials
  can retain a high flexibility and morphological stability over long periods of time, for
  example, when formed into films.
  [00214]      Some examples of elastomers that can be combined with PLA include:
  Elastomer NPEL001, Polyurethane elastomers (5-10%), Functionalized polyolefin
  elastomers, Blendex@ (e.g., 415, 360, 338), PARALOIDTM KM 334, BTA 753, EXL
  3691A, 2314, Ecoflex@ Supersoft Silicone Bionolle@ 3001, Pelleethane@ 2102-75A,
  Kraton@ FG 1901X, Hytrel@ 3078, and mixtures of these. Mixtures with any other
  elastomer, for example, as described herein can also be used.
  [00215]      Some examples of plasticizers that can be combined with polymers of amino
  alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid include: Triacetine, Glycerol triacetate, Tributyl citrate,
  Polyethylene glycol, GRINDSTED@ SOFT-N-SAFE (acetic acid ester of
  monoglycerides) made from fully hydrogenated castor oil and combinations of these.
  Mixtures with any other plasticizers, for example, as described herein can also be used.
  [00216]      The main characteristic of elastomer materials is the high elongation and
  flexibility or elasticity of these materials, against its breaking or cracking.

   [00217]     Depending on the distribution and degree of the chemical bonds of the
  polymers, elastomeric materials can have properties or characteristics similar to
  thermosets or thermoplastics, so elastomeric materials can be classified into: thermoset
  elastomers (e.g., do not melt when heated) and thermoplastic elastomers (e.g., melt when
  heated). Some properties of elastomer materials: cannot melt, before melting they pass
  into a gaseous state; swell in the presence of certain solvents; Are generally insoluble; are
  flexible and elastic; lower creep resistance than the thermoplastic materials.
   [00218]      Examples and applications of elastomer materials are:; polyurethanes are used
  in the textile industry for the manufacture of elastic clothing such as Lycra@, also used as
  foam, and for wheels; polybutadiene - elastomer material used on the wheels or tires of
  vehicles, given the extraordinary wear resistance; Neoprene - Material used primarily in
  the manufacture of wetsuits is also used as wire insulation, industrial belts; silicone
  material used in a wide range of materials and areas due their excellent thermal and
  chemical resistance, silicones are used in the manufacture of pacifiers, medical prostheses,
  lubricants.
   [00219]     Some examples of elastomers adhesives are: polyurethane adhesive 2
  components; polyurethane adhesive by curing 1 component moisture; adhesives based on
   silicones; adhesives based on modified silane.

   [00227]     For example, a fragrance, e.g., natural wood fragrance, can be compounded
  into the resin used to make the composite. In some implementations, the fragrance is
  compounded directly into the resin as an oil. For example,, the oil can be compounded
  into the resin using a roll mill, e.g., a Banburyo mixer or an extruder, e.g., a twin-screw
  extruder with counter-rotating screws. An example of a Banburyo mixer is the F-Series
  Banburyo mixer, manufactured by Farrel. An example of a twin-screw extruder is the WP
  ZSK 50 MEGACOMPOUNDERTM, manufactured by Coperion, Stuttgart, Germany. After
  compounding, the scented resin can be added to the fibrous material and extruded or
  molded. Alternatively, master batches of fragrance-filled resins are available
  commercially from International Flavors and Fragrances, under the trade name
  POLYIFFTM. In some embodiments, the amount of fragrance in the composite is between
   about 0.005 % by weight and about 10 % by weight, e.g., between about 0.1 % and about

  USES OF POLYMERS OF AMINO-ALPHA, OMEGA-DICARBOXYLIC ACIDS AND
  COPOLYMERS
  [00228]      Some uses of polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and polymers
  of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid containing materials include : personal care
  items (e.g., tissues, towels, diapers), green packaging, garden (compostable pots),
  consumer electronics (e.g., laptop and mobile phone casings), appliances, food packaging,
  disposable packaging (e.g., food containers and drink bottles), garbage bags (e.g., waste
  compostable bags), mulch films, controlled release matrices and containers (e.g., for
  fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, nutrients, pharmaceuticals, flavoring agents, foods),
  shopping bags, general purpose film, high heat film, heat seal layer, surface coating,
  disposable tableware (e.g., plates, cups, forks, knives, spoons, sporks, bowls), automotive
  parts (e.g., panels, fabrics, under hood covers), carpet fibers, clothing fibers (e.g., for
  garments, sportswear, footwear), biomedical applications (e.g., surgical sutures, implants,
  scaffolding, drug delivery systems, dialysis equipment) and engineering plastics.
  [00229]      Other uses/industrial sectors that can benefit from the use of polymers of
  amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
  acid derivatives (e.g., elastomers) include IT and software, Electronics, geoscience (e.g.,
  oil and gas), engineering, aerospace (e.g., arm rests, seats, panels), telecommunications
  (e.g., headsets), chemical manufacturing, transportation such as automotive (e.g.,
  dashboards, panels, tires, wheels), materials and steel, consumer packaged goods, wires
  and cables.

WO 2014/186670                                                               PCT/US2014/038341
   OTHER ADVANTAGES OF POLYMERS OF AMINO-ALPHA, OMEGA
  DICARBOXYLIC ACIDS
   [00230]    Polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid can undergo hydrolytic
  degradation. Hydrolytic degradation includes chain scission producing shorter polymers,
  oligomers and eventually the monomer aspartic acid can be released. Hydrolysis can be
   associated with thermal and biotic degradation. The process can be effected by various
  parameters such as the polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid structure, its
  molecular weight and distribution, its morphology (e.g., crystallinity), the shape of the
   sample (e.g., isolated thin samples or comminuted samples can degrade faster), the
  thermal and mechanical history (e.g., processing) and the hydrolysis conditions (e.g.,
  temperature, agitation, comminution). Polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid
  can also undergo biotic degradation. This degradation can occur for example, in a
  mammalian body, and has useful implications for degradable stitching and can have
  detrimental implications to other surgical implants. Enzymes, such as proteinase K and
  pronase can be utilized. Polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid can be bio
  based and can be composted, recycled, used as a fuel (incinerated). Some of the
  degradation reactions include thermal degradation, hydrolytic degradation and biotic
  degradations.
   [00231]    During composting, polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid can go
  through several degradation stages. For example, an initial stage can occur due to
  exposure to moisture wherein the degradation is abiotic and the polymers of amino-alpha,
  omega-dicarboxylic acid degrades by hydrolysis. This stage can be accelerated by the
  presence of acids and bases and elevated temperatures. The first stage can lead to
  embrittlement of the polymer which can facilitate the diffusion of polymers of amino
   alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid out of the bulk polymers. The oligomers can then be
   attacked by micro-organisms. Organisms can degrade the oligomers and aspartic acid,
  leading to CO 2 and water. Time for this degradation can be on the order of about one to a
  few years depending on the factors previously mentioned. The degradation time is several
  orders of magnitude faster than typical petroleum based plastic such as polyethylene (e.g.,
  on the order of hundreds of years).
   [00232]    Polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid can also be recycled. For
  example, the polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid can be hydrolyzed to the
  respective amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid, purified and re-polymerized. Unlike
  other recyclable plastics such as PET and HDPE, polymers of amino-alpha, omega
                                            52

WO 2014/186670                                                              PCT/US2014/038341
  dicarboxylic acid does not need to be down-graded to make a product of diminished value
  (e.g., from a bottle to decking or carpet). Polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic
  acid can be in theory recycled indefinitely. Optionally, polymers of amino-alpha, omega
  dicarboxylic acid can be re-used and downgraded for several generations and then
  converted to polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and re-polymerized.
  [00233]     Polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid can also be used as a fuel,
  for example, for energy production. Polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid
  can have high heat content e.g., up to about 8400 BTU. Incineration of pure polymers of
  amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid only releases carbon dioxide and water.
  Combinations with other ingredients typically amount to less than 1ppm of non-polymers
  of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid residuals (e.g., ash). Thus the combustion of
  polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid is cleaner than other renewable fuels,
  e.g. wood.
  [00234]     Processing as described herein can also include irradiation. For example,
  irradiation with between about 1 and 150 Mrad radiation (e.g., for example, any range as
  described herein) can improve the compostability and recyclability of polymers of amino
  alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid and polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid
  containing materials.
  POLYMERIZATION OF ASPARTIC ACID AND POLYMERIC PRODUCTS
  [00235]     Polymers of aspartic acid are formed via many different polymerization
  schemes including the ones described above. Products include dimers, trimers, oligomers
  and polymers. One of these polymerization schemes results in a polyamide by amine
  condensation with one of the two carboxylic acids. A polyaspartic acid (PASA) is a
  polyamide with the amide linkage at the alpha and/or beta carboxylic acid. For PASA
  made via dehydration schemes the sodium-DL-(a, )-poly(aspartate) with 30% a-linkages
  and 70% P-linkages randomly distributed along the polymer chain, and racemized chiral
  center of aspartic acid is produced. FIG 5 shows candidate pathways to PASA.
  [00236]     There are many uses of PASA. For instance, it is used as a component in low
  volatile organic compounds coatings. In this case the low viscosity polyaspartic acids are
  cured with polysiocyanates to form a coating especially coatings for cars. A commercial
  example of this polyaspartic acid is Desmophen@ NH 1420. Another example is an
  amphiphilic biodegradable copolymer based on a poly(aspartic acid-co-lactide).
  Polyaspartic acid may also be used as a non-toxic chelate composition in an aqueous
                                            53

WO 2014/186670                                                                 PCT/US2014/038341
  fracturing fluid through chelation of ions. A pH sensitive hydrogel may be made from
  poly(aspartic acid) which is cross-linked with 1.6 hexanediamine and reinforced with
  ethyl cellulose. A lightly cross-linked polyaspartate can have high water absorbency and
  can be used as a superabsorbent. This use of lightly cross-linked polyaspartate is
  compared to poly (acrylic acid) but with improved biodegradability. Aspartic acid and/or
  polyaspartic acid may be used with polyalkylene glycol to produce a lubricant
  composition for automobile engines.
  POLYMERIZATION OF GLUTAMIC ACID AND POLYMERIC PRODUCTS
  [00237]      Polymers of glutamic acid are formed via many different polymerization
  schemes including the ones described above. Products include dimers, trimers, oligomers
  and polymers. One of these polymerization schemes results in a polyamide by amine
  condensation with one of the two carboxylic acids. A polyglutamic acid is a polyamide
  with the amide linkage at the alpha and/or gamma carboxylic acid. Bacillus subtilis, can
  be used to produce polyglutamic acid from devitalized wheat gluten. The gamma
  polyglutamic acid is a water soluble and biodegradable polymer and biodegradable fibers
  and hydrogels. Gamma-polyglutamic acid also has use for skin care. It can be used as a
  replacement for hyaluronic acid.
  [00238]      There are many uses of polyglutamic acid. For instance, gamma-polyglutamic
  acid nanoparticles can be used for controlled anticancer drug release It has been reported
  that gamma-polyglutamic acid can be added to drinking water for chickens to improve
  calcium utilization.
  RADIATION TREATMENT
  [00239]      The feedstock (e.g., cellulosic, lignocellulosic polymers of amino-alpha,
  omega-dicarboxylic acid, polymers of amino-alpha, omega-dicarboxylic acid derivatives
  and combinations of these) can be treated with electron bombardment to modify its
  structure, for example, to reduce its recalcitrance or cross link the structures. Such
  treatment can, for example, reduce the average molecular weight of the feedstock, change
  the crystalline structure of the feedstock, and/or increase the surface area and/or porosity
  of the feedstock. Alternatively, this treatment can produce radicals that can be sites for
  cross-linking, grafting and/or functionalization.
  [00240]      Electron bombardment via an electron beam is generally preferred, because it
  provides very high throughput. Accelerators used to accelerate the particles can be
                                             54

  electrostatic DC, electrodynamic DC, RF linear, magnetic induction linear or continuous
  wave. For example, cyclotron type accelerators are available from IBA, Belgium, such as
  the RHODOTRONTM system, while DC type accelerators are available from RDI, now
  IBA Industrial, such as the DYNAMITRON@. Ions and ion accelerators are discussed in

  Therapy", Columbus-Ohio, ICRU-IAEA Meeting, 18-20 March 2006, , Iwata, Y. et al.,

  of EPAC 2006, Edinburgh, Scotland, and Leitner, C.M. et al., "Status of the
  Superconducting ECR Ion Source Venus", Proceedings of EPAC 2000, Vienna, Austria.
  [00241]      Electron bombardment may be performed using an electron beam device that
  has a nominal energy of less than 10 MeV, e.g., less than 7 MeV, less than 5 MeV, or less
  than 2 MeV, e.g., from about 0.5 to 1.5 MeV, from about 0.8 to 1.8 MeV, or from about
  0.7 to 1 MeV. In some implementations the nominal energy is about 500 to 800 keV.
  [00242]      The electron beam may have a relatively high total beam power (the combined
  beam power of all accelerating heads, or, if multiple accelerators are used, of all
  accelerators and all heads), e.g., at least 25 kW, e.g., at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 65, 70, 80,
  100, 125, or 150, 250, 300 kW. In some cases, the power is even as high as 500 kW, 750
  kW, or even 1000 kW or more. In some cases the electron beam has a beam power of
  1200 kW or more, e.g., 1400, 1600, 1800, or even 3000 kW. The electron beam may have
  a total beam power of 25 to 3000 kW. Alternatively, the electron beam may have a total
  beam power of 75 to 1500 kW. Optionally, the electron beam may have a total beam
  power of 100 to 1000 kW. Alternatively, the electron beam may have a total beam power
  of 100 to 400 kW.
  [00243]      This high total beam power is usually achieved by utilizing multiple
  accelerating heads. For example, the electron beam device may include two, four, or more
  accelerating heads. The use of multiple heads, each of which has a relatively low beam
  power, prevents excessive temperature rise in the material, thereby preventing burning of
  the material, and also increases the uniformity of the dose through the thickness of the
  layer of material.
  [00244]      It is generally preferred that the bed of feedstock material has a relatively
  uniform thickness. In some embodiments the thickness is less than about 1 inch (e.g., less
  than about 0.75 inches, less than about 0.5 inches, less than about 0.25 inches, less than
  about 0.1 inches, between about 0.1 and 1 inch, between about 0.2 and 0.3 inches).
                                              55

WO 2014/186670                                                                 PCT/US2014/038341
  [00245]      In some implementations, it is desirable to cool the material during and
  between dosing the material with electron bombardment. For example, the material can
  be cooled while it is conveyed, for example, by a screw extruder, vibratory conveyor or
  other conveying equipment. For example, cooling while conveying is described
  International App. No. PCT/US2014/021609 filed March 7, 2014 and International App.
  No. PCT/US2014/021632 filed March 7, 2014, the entire descriptions of which are herein
  incorporated by reference. To reduce the energy required by the recalcitrance-reducing
  process, it is desirable to treat the material as quickly as possible. In general, the
  treatment be performed at a dose rate of greater than about 0.25 Mrad per second, e.g.,
  greater than about 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, or even greater than about 20 Mrad
  per second, e.g., about 0.25 to 30 Mrad per second. Alternately, the treatment is
  performed at a dose rate of 0.5 to 20 Mrad per second. Optionally, the treatment is
  performed at a dose rate of 0.75 to 15 Mrad per second. Alternately, the treatment is
  performed at a dose rate of 1 to 5 Mrad per second. Optionally, the treatment is performed
  at a dose rate of 1-3 Mrad per second or alternatively 1-2 Mrad per second. Higher dose
  rates allow a higher throughput for a target (e.g., the desired) dose. Higher dose rates
  generally require higher line speeds, to avoid thermal decomposition of the material. In
  one implementation, the accelerator is set for 3 MeV, 50 mA beam current, and the line
  speed is 24 feet/minute, for a sample thickness of about 20 mm (e.g., comminuted corn
  cob material with a bulk density of 0.5 g/cm3 ).
  [00246]      In some embodiments, electron bombardment is performed until the material
  receives a total dose of at least 0.1 Mrad, 0.25 Mrad, 1 Mrad, 5 Mrad, e.g., at least 10, 20,
  30 or at least 40 Mrad. In some embodiments, the treatment is performed until the
  material receives a dose of from about 10 Mrad to about 50 Mrad, e.g., from about 20
  Mrad to about 40 Mrad, or from about 25 Mrad to about 30 Mrad. In some
  implementations, a total dose of 25 to 35 Mrad is preferred, applied ideally over a couple
  of seconds, e.g., at 5 Mrad/pass with each pass being applied for about one second.
  Applying a dose of greater than 7 to 8 Mrad/pass can in some cases cause thermal
  degradation of the feedstock material. Cooling can be applied before, after, or during
  irradiation. For example, the cooling methods, systems and equipment as described in the
  following applications can be utilized: International App. No. PCT/US2014/021609 filed
  March 7, 2014, and International App. No. PCT/US2013/064320 filed October 10, 2013,
  the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.

WO 2014/186670                                                                PCT/US2014/038341
   [00247]      Using multiple heads as discussed above, the material can be treated in
  multiple passes, for example, two passes at 10 to 20 Mrad/pass, e.g., 12 to 18 Mrad/pass,
   separated by a few seconds of cool-down, or three passes of 7 to 12 Mrad/pass, e.g., 5 to
  20 Mrad/pass, 10 to 40 Mrad/pass, 9 to 11 Mrad/pass. As discussed herein, treating the
  material with several relatively low doses, rather than one high dose, tends to prevent
  overheating of the material and also increases dose uniformity through the thickness of the
  material. In some implementations, the material is stirred or otherwise mixed during or
   after each pass and then smoothed into a uniform layer again before the next pass, to
  further enhance treatment uniformity.
   [00248]      In some embodiments, electrons are accelerated to, for example, a speed of
  greater than 75 percent of the speed of light, e.g., greater than 85, 90, 95, or 99 percent of
  the speed of light.
   [00249]      In some embodiments, any processing described herein occurs on feedstock
  material that remains dry as acquired or that has been dried, e.g., using heat and/or
  reduced pressure. For example, in some embodiments, the cellulosic and/or
  lignocellulosic material has less than about 25 wt. % retained water, measured at 250 C
   and at fifty percent relative humidity (e.g., less than about 20 wt.%, less than about 15
  wt.%, less than about 14 wt.%, less than about 13 wt.%, less than about 12 wt.%, less than
   about 10 wt.%, less than about 9 wt.%, less than about 8 wt.%, less than about 7 wt.%,
  less than about 6 wt.%, less than about 5 wt.%, less than about 4 wt.%, less than about 3
  wt.%, less than about 2 wt.%, less than about 1 wt.%, less than about 0.5 wt.%, less than
   about 15 wt.%.
   [00250]      In some embodiments, two or more electron sources are used, such as two or
  more ionizing sources. For example, samples can be treated, in any order, with a beam of
  electrons, followed by gamma radiation and UV light having wavelengths from about 100
  nm to about 280 nm. In some embodiments, samples are treated with three ionizing
  radiation sources, such as a beam of electrons, gamma radiation, and energetic UV light.
  The biomass is conveyed through the treatment zone where it can be bombarded with
  electrons.
   [00251]      It may be advantageous to repeat the treatment to more thoroughly reduce the
  recalcitrance of the biomass and/or further modify the biomass. In particular, the process
  parameters can be adjusted after a first (e.g., second, third, fourth or more) pass depending
  on the recalcitrance of the material. In some embodiments, a conveyor can be used which
  includes a circular system where the biomass is conveyed multiple times through the
                                             57

WO 2014/186670                                                                  PCT/US2014/038341
  various processes described above. In some other embodiments, multiple treatment
  devices (e.g., electron beam generators) are used to treat the biomass multiple (e.g., 2, 3, 4
  or more) times. In yet other embodiments, a single electron beam generator may be the
  source of multiple beams (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more beams) that can be used for treatment of the
  biomass.
  [00252]     The effectiveness in changing the molecular/supermolecular structure and/or
  reducing the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing biomass depends on the electron
  energy used and the dose applied, while exposure time depends on the power and dose. In
  some embodiments, the dose rate and total are adjusted so as not to destroy (e.g., char or
  burn) the biomass material. For example, the carbohydrates should not be damaged in the
  processing so that they can be released from the biomass intact, e.g. as monomeric sugars.
  [00253]     In some embodiments, the treatment (with any electron source or a
  combination of sources) is performed until the material receives a dose of at least about
  0.05 Mrad, e.g., at least about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 15, 20, 25, 30,
  40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 175, or 200 Mrad. In some embodiments, the
  treatment is performed until the material receives a dose of between 0.1-100 Mrad, 1-200,
  5-200, 10-200, 5-150, 50-150 Mrad, 5-100, 5-50, 5-40, 10-50, 10-75, 15-50, 20-35 Mrad.
  RADIATION OPAQUE MATERIALS
  [00254]     The invention can include processing the material in a vault and/or bunker that
  is constructed using radiation opaque materials. In some implementations, the radiation
  opaque materials are selected to be capable of shielding the components from X-rays with
  high energy (short wavelength), which can penetrate many materials. One important
  factor in designing a radiation shielding enclosure is the attenuation length of the materials
  used, which will determine the required thickness for a particular material, blend of
  materials, or layered structure. The attenuation length is the penetration distance at which
  the radiation is reduced to approximately l/e (e = Euler's number) times that of the
  incident radiation. Although virtually all materials are radiation opaque if thick enough,
  materials containing a high compositional percentage (e.g., density) of elements that have
  a high Z value (atomic number) have a shorter radiation attenuation length and thus, if
  such materials are used, a thinner, lighter shielding can be provided. Examples of high Z
  value materials that are used in radiation shielding are tantalum and lead. Another
  important parameter in radiation shielding is the halving distance, which is the thickness
  of a particular material that will reduce gamma ray intensity by 50%.        As an example for
                                             58

WO 2014/186670                                                                 PCT/US2014/038341
  X-ray radiation with an energy of 0.1 MeV the halving thickness is about 15.1 mm for
  concrete and about 0.27 mm for lead, while with an X-ray energy of 1 MeV the halving
  thickness for concrete is about 44.45 mm and for lead is about 7.9 mm. Radiation opaque
  materials can be materials that are thick or thin so long as they can reduce the radiation
  that passes through to the other side. Thus, if it is desired that a particular enclosure have
  a low wall thickness, e.g., for light weight or due to size constraints, the material chosen
  should have a sufficient Z value and/or attenuation length so that its halving length is less
  than or equal to the desired wall thickness of the enclosure.
  [00255]     In some cases, the radiation opaque material may be a layered material, for
  example, having a layer of a higher Z value material, to provide good shielding, and a
  layer of a lower Z value material to provide other properties (e.g., structural integrity,
  impact resistance, etc.). In some cases, the layered material may be a "graded-Z"
  laminate, e.g., including a laminate in which the layers provide a gradient from high-Z
  through successively lower-Z elements. In some cases the radiation opaque materials can
  be interlocking blocks, for example, lead and/or concrete blocks can be supplied by
  NELCO Worldwide (Burlington, MA), and reconfigurable vaults can be utilized as
  described in International App. No. PCT/US2014/021629 filed on March 7, 2014 the
  entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.
  [00256]     A radiation opaque material can reduce the radiation passing through a
  structure (e.g., a wall, door, ceiling, enclosure, a series of these or combinations of these)
  formed of the material by about at least about 10 %, (e.g., at least about 20%, at least
  about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%,
  at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least
  about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, at least about 99.9%, at least about
  99.99%, at least about 99.999%) as compared to the incident radiation. Therefore, an
  enclosure made of a radiation opaque material can reduce the exposure of
  equipment/system/components by the same amount. Radiation opaque materials can
  include stainless steel, metals with Z values above 25 (e.g., lead, iron), concrete, dirt, sand
  and combinations thereof. Radiation opaque materials can include a barrier in the
  direction of the incident radiation of at least about 1mm (e.g., 5 mm, 10mm, 5 cm, 10 cm,
  100cm, im, 10m).

  ELECTRON SOURCES
   [00257]     Electrons interact via Coulomb scattering and bremsstrahlung radiation
  produced by changes in the velocity of electrons. Electrons may be produced by
  radioactive nuclei that undergo beta decay, such as isotopes of iodine, cesium, technetium,
   and iridium. Alternatively, an electron gun can be used as an electron source via
  thermionic emission and accelerated through an accelerating potential. An electron gun
  generates electrons, accelerates them through a large potential (e.g., greater than about
   500 thousand, greater than about million, greater than about 2 million, greater than about
   5 million, greater than about 6 million, greater than about 7 million, greater than about 8
  million, greater than about 9 million, or even greater than 10 million volts) and then scans
  them magnetically in the x-y plane, where the electrons are initially accelerated in the z
  direction down the tube and extracted through a foil window. Scanning the electron beam
  is useful for increasing the irradiation surface when irradiating materials, e.g., a biomass,
  that is conveyed through the scanned beam. Scanning the electron beam also distributes
  the thermal load homogenously on the window and helps reduce the foil window rupture
  due to local heating by the electron beam. Window foil rupture is a cause of significant
  down-time due to subsequent necessary repairs and re-starting the electron gun.
   [00258]     Various other irradiating devices may be used in the methods disclosed herein,
  including field ionization sources, electrostatic ion separators, field ionization generators,
  thermionic emission sources, microwave discharge ion sources, recirculating or static
   accelerators, dynamic linear accelerators, van de Graaff accelerators, and folded tandem
   accelerators. Such devices are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,931,784 to
  Medoff, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
   [00259]     A beam of electrons can be used as the radiation source. A beam of electrons
  has the advantages of high dose rates (e.g., 1, 5, or even 10 Mrad per second), high
  throughput, less containment, and less confinement equipment. Electron beams can also
  have high electrical efficiency (e.g., 80%), allowing for lower energy usage relative to
  other radiation methods, which can translate into a lower cost of operation and lower
  greenhouse gas emissions corresponding to the smaller amount of energy used. Electron
  beams can be generated, e.g., by electrostatic generators, cascade generators, transformer
  generators, low energy accelerators with a scanning system, low energy accelerators with
   a linear cathode, linear accelerators, and pulsed accelerators.
   [00260]     Electrons can also be more efficient at causing changes in the molecular
   structure of carbohydrate-containing materials, for example, by the mechanism of chain
                                             60

  scission. In addition, electrons having energies of 0.5-10 MeV can penetrate low density
  materials, such as the biomass materials described herein, e.g., materials having a bulk
  density of less than 0.5 g/cm 3 , and a depth of 0.3-10 cm. Electrons as an ionizing
  radiation source can be useful, e.g., for relatively thin piles, layers or beds of materials,
  e.g., less than about 0.5 inch, e.g., less than about 0.4 inch, 0.3 inch, 0.25 inch, or less than
  about 0.1 inch. In some embodiments, the energy of each electron of the electron beam is
  from about 0.3 MeV to about 2.0 MeV (million electron volts), e.g., from about 0.5 MeV
  to about 1.5 MeV, or from about 0.7 MeV to about 1.25 MeV. Methods of irradiating
  materials are discussed in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2012/0100577 AL, filed October 18, 2011,
  the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.
  [00261]      Electron beam irradiation devices may be procured commercially from Ion
  Beam Applications, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium or the Titan Corporation, San Diego, CA.
  Typical electron energies can be 0.5 MeV, 1 MeV, 2 MeV, 4.5 MeV, 7.5 MeV, or 10
  MeV. Typical electron beam irradiation device power can be 1 KW, 5 KW, 10 KW, 20
  KW, 50 KW, 60 KW, 70 KW, 80 KW, 90 KW, 100 KW, 125 KW, 150 KW, 175 KW,
  200 KW, 250 KW, 300 KW, 350 KW, 400 KW, 450 KW, 500 KW, 600 KW, 700 KW,
  800 KW, 900 KW or even 1000 KW.
  [00262]      Tradeoffs in considering electron beam irradiation device power specifications
  include cost to operate, capital costs, depreciation, and device footprint. Tradeoffs in
  considering exposure dose levels of electron beam irradiation would be energy costs and
  environment, safety, and health (ESH) concerns. Typically, generators are housed in a
  vault, e.g., of lead or concrete, especially for production from X-rays that are generated in
  the process. Tradeoffs in considering electron energies include energy costs.
  [00263]      The electron beam irradiation device can produce either a fixed beam or a
  scanning beam. A scanning beam may be advantageous with large scan sweep length and
  high scan speeds, as this would effectively replace a large, fixed beam width. Further,
  available sweep widths of 0.5 m, 1 m, 2 m or more are available. The scanning beam is
  preferred in most embodiments describe herein because of the larger scan width and
  reduced possibility of local heating and failure of the windows.
  ELECTRON GUNS - WINDOWS
  [00264]      The extraction system for an electron accelerator can include two window
  foils. Window foils are described in International App. No. PCT/US2013/064332 filed
  October 10, 2013, the complete disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.
                                              61

WO 2014/186670                                                                PCT/US2014/038341
  The cooling gas in the two foil window extraction system can be a purge gas or a mixture,
  for example, air, or a pure gas. In one embodiment the gas is an inert gas such as
  nitrogen, argon, helium and or carbon dioxide. It is preferred to use a gas rather than a
  liquid since energy losses to the electron beam are minimized. Mixtures of pure gas can
   also be used, either pre-mixed or mixed in line prior to impinging on the windows or in
  the space between the windows. The cooling gas can be cooled, for example, by using a
  heat exchange system (e.g., a chiller) and/or by using boil off from a condensed gas (e.g.,
  liquid nitrogen, liquid helium).
   [00265]     When using an enclosure, the enclosed conveyor can also be purged with an
  inert gas so as to maintain an atmosphere at a reduced oxygen level. Keeping oxygen
  levels low avoids the formation of ozone which in some instances is undesirable due to its
  reactive and toxic nature. For example the oxygen can be less than about 20% (e.g., less
  than about 10%, less than about 1%, less than about 0.1%, less than about 0.01%, or even
  less than about 0.001% oxygen). Purging can be done with an inert gas including, but not
  limited to, nitrogen, argon, helium or carbon dioxide. This can be supplied, for example,
  from a boil off of a liquid source (e.g., liquid nitrogen or helium), generated or separated
  from air in situ, or supplied from tanks. The inert gas can be recirculated and any residual
  oxygen can be removed using a catalyst, such as a copper catalyst bed. Alternatively,
  combinations of purging, recirculating and oxygen removal can be done to keep the
  oxygen levels low.
   [00266]     The enclosure can also be purged with a reactive gas that can react with the
  biomass. This can be done before, during or after the irradiation process. The reactive
  gas can be, but is not limited to, nitrous oxide, ammonia, oxygen, ozone, hydrocarbons,
   aromatic compounds, amides, peroxides, azides, halides, oxyhalides, phosphides,
  phosphines, arsines, sulfides, thiols, boranes and/or hydrides. The reactive gas can be
   activated in the enclosure, e.g., by irradiation (e.g., electron beam, UV irradiation,
  microwave irradiation, heating, IR radiation), so that it reacts with the biomass. The
  biomass itself can be activated, for example by irradiation. Preferably the biomass is
   activated by the electron beam, to produce radicals which then react with the activated or
  unactivated reactive gas, e.g., by radical coupling or quenching.
   [00267]     Purging gases supplied to an enclosed conveyor can also be cooled, for
  example below about 250 C, below about 0 0 C, below about -40'C, below about -80 0 C,
  below about -120 0 C. For example, the gas can be boiled off from a compressed gas such
                                              62

  as liquid nitrogen or sublimed from solid carbon dioxide. As an alternative example, the
  gas can be cooled by a chiller or part of or the entire conveyor can be cooled.
  HEATING AND THROUGHPUT DURING RADIATION TREATMENT
  [00268]      Several processes can occur in biomass when electrons from an electron beam
  interact with matter in inelastic collisions. For example, ionization of the material, chain
  scission of polymers in the material, cross linking of polymers in the material, oxidation of
  the material, generation of X-rays ("Bremsstrahlung") and vibrational excitation of
  molecules (e.g. phonon generation). Without being bound to a particular mechanism, the
  reduction in recalcitrance can be due to several of these inelastic collision effects, for
  example, ionization, chain scission of polymers, oxidation and phonon generation. Some
  of the effects (e.g., especially X-ray generation), necessitate shielding and engineering
  barriers, for example, enclosing the irradiation processes in a concrete (or other radiation
  opaque material) vault. Another effect of irradiation, vibrational excitation, is equivalent
  to heating up the sample. Heating the sample by irradiation can help in recalcitrance
  reduction, but excessive heating can destroy the material, as will be explained below.
  [00269]      The adiabatic temperature rise (AT) from adsorption of ionizing radiation is
  given by the equation: AT = D/Cp : where D is the average dose in KGy, Cp is the heat
  capacity in J/g 'C, and AT is the change in temperature in 'C. A typical dry biomass
  material will have a heat capacity close to 2. Wet biomass will have a higher heat capacity
  dependent on the amount of water since the heat capacity of water is very high (4.19 J/g
  OC). Metals have much lower heat capacities, for example, 304 stainless steel has a heat
  capacity of 0.5 J/g 'C. The temperature change due to the instant adsorption of radiation in
  a biomass and stainless steel for various doses of radiation is shown in Table 1.

  [00270]      High temperatures can destroy and or modify the biopolymers in biomass so
  that the polymers (e.g., cellulose) are unsuitable for further processing. A biomass
  subjected to high temperatures can become dark, sticky and give off odors indicating
  decomposition. The stickiness can even make the material hard to convey. The odors can
  be unpleasant and be a safety issue. In fact, keeping the biomass below about 200'C has
  been found to be beneficial in the processes described herein (e.g., below about 190'C,
  below about 180'C, below about 170C, below about 160'C, below about 150'C, below
  about 140'C, below about 130'C, below about 120'C, below about 1 10 C, between about
  60'C and 180'C, between about 60'C and 160'C, between about 60'C and 150'C,
  between about 60'C and 140'C, between about 60'C and 130'C, between about 60'C and
  120'C, between about 80'C and 180'C, between about 100 0 C and 180'C, between about
  120'C and 180'C, between about 140'C and 180'C, between about 160C and 180'C,
  between about 1000 C and 140'C, between about 80'C and 120'C).
  [00271]      It has been found that irradiation above about 10 Mrad is desirable for the
  processes described herein (e.g., reduction of recalcitrance). A high throughput is also
  desirable so that the irradiation does not become a bottle neck in processing the biomass.
  The treatment is governed by a Dose rate equation: M = FP/D * time, where M is the mass
  of irradiated material (Kg), F is the fraction of power that is adsorbed (unit less), P is the
  emitted power (KW=Voltage in MeV * Current in mA), time is the treatment time (sec)
  and D is the adsorbed dose (KGy). In an exemplary process where the fraction of adsorbed
  power is fixed, the Power emitted is constant and a set dosage is desired, the throughput
  (e.g., M, the biomass processed) can be increased by increasing the irradiation time.
  However, increasing the irradiation time without allowing the material to cool, can
  excessively heat the material as exemplified by the calculations shown above. Since
  biomass has a low thermal conductivity (less than about 0.1 Wm-K-1 ), heat dissipation is
                                             64

  slow, unlike, for example metals (greater than about 10 Wm-1 K-1 ) which can dissipate
  energy quickly as long as there is a heat sink to transfer the energy to.
  ELECTRON GUNS - BEAM STOPS
  [00272]      In some embodiments the systems and methods include a beam stop (e.g., a
  shutter). For example, the beam stop can be used to quickly stop or reduce the irradiation
  of material without powering down the electron beam device. Alternatively the beam stop
  can be used while powering up the electron beam, e.g., the beam stop can stop the electron
  beam until a beam current of a desired level is achieved. The beam stop can be placed
  between the primary foil window and a secondary foil window. For example, the beam
  stop can be mounted so that it is movable, that is, so that it can be moved into and out of
  the beam path. Even partial coverage of the beam can be used, for example, to control the
  dose of irradiation. The beam stop can be mounted to the floor, to a conveyor for the
  biomass, to a wall, to the radiation device (e.g., at the scan horn), or to any structural
  support. Preferably the beam stop is fixed in relation to the scan horn so that the beam can
  be effectively controlled by the beam stop. The beam stop can incorporate a hinge, a rail,
  wheels, slots, or other means allowing for its operation in moving into and out of the
  beam. The beam stop can be made of any material that will stop at least 5% of the
  electrons, e.g., at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, at least 80%, 85%, 90%,
  91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or even about 100% of the electrons.
  [00273]      The beam stop can be made of a metal including, but not limited to, stainless
  steel, lead, iron, molybdenum, silver, gold, titanium, aluminum, tin, or alloys of these, or
  laminates (layered materials) made with such metals (e.g., metal-coated ceramic, metal
  coated polymer, metal-coated composite, multilayered metal materials).
  [00274]      The beam stop can be cooled, for example, with a cooling fluid such as an
  aqueous solution or a gas. The beam stop can be partially or completely hollow, for
  example, with cavities. Interior spaces of the beam stop can be used for cooling fluids and
  gases. The beam stop can be of any shape, including flat, curved, round, oval, square,
  rectangular, beveled and wedged shapes.
  [00275]      The beam stop can have perforations so as to allow some electrons through,
  thus controlling (e.g., reducing) the levels of radiation across the whole area of the
  window, or in specific regions of the window. The beam stop can be a mesh formed, for
  example, from fibers or wires. Multiple beam stops can be used, together or
                                            65

  independently, to control the irradiation. The beam stop can be remotely controlled, e.g.,
  by radio signal or hard wired to a motor for moving the beam into or out of position.
  BIOMASS MATERIALS
  [00276]      Lignocellulosic materials include, but are not limited to, wood (e.g., softwood,
  Pine softwood, Softwood, Softwood barks, Softwood stems, Spruce softwood, Hardwood,
  Willow Hardwood, aspen hardwood, Birch Hardwood, Hardwood barks, Hardwood stems,
  pine cones, pine needles), particle board, chemical pulps, mechanical pulps, paper, waste
  paper, forestry wastes (e.g., sawdust, aspen wood, wood chips, leaves), grasses including
  so-called energy grasses, (e.g., switchgrass, miscanthus, cord grass, reed canary grass,
  Coastal Bermuda grass), grain residues, (e.g., rice hulls, oat hulls, wheat chaff, barley
  hulls), agricultural waste (e.g., silage, canola straw, wheat straw, barley straw, oat straw,
  rice straw, jute, hemp, flax, bamboo, sisal, abaca, corn cobs, corn stover, soybean stover,
  corn fiber, alfalfa, hay, coconut hair, nut shells, palm fronds and hulls and other palm
  byproducts), cotton, Cotton seed hairs, flax, sugar processing residues (e.g., bagasse, beet
  pulp, agave bagasse), , algae, seaweed, manure ( e.g., Solid cattle manure, Swine waste),
  sewage, carrot processing waste, molasses spent wash, alfalfa biver and mixtures of any of
  these.
  [00277]      In some cases, the lignocellulosic material includes corncobs. Ground or
  hammer milled corncobs can be spread in a layer of relatively uniform thickness for
  irradiation, and after irradiation are easy to disperse in the medium for further processing.
  To facilitate harvest and collection, in some cases the entire corn plant is used, including
  the corn stalk, corn kernels, and in some cases even the root system of the plant.
  [00278]      Advantageously, no additional nutrients (other than a nitrogen source, e.g.,
  urea or ammonia) are required during fermentation of corncobs or cellulosic or
  lignocellulosic materials containing significant amounts of corncobs.
  [00279]      Corncobs, before and after comminution, are also easier to convey and
  disperse, and have a lesser tendency to form explosive mixtures in air than other cellulosic
  or lignocellulosic materials such as hay and grasses.
  [00280]      Cellulosic materials include, for example, paper, paper products, paper waste,
  paper pulp, pigmented papers, loaded papers, coated papers, filled papers, magazines,
  printed matter (e.g., books, catalogs, manuals, labels, calendars, greeting cards, brochures,
  prospectuses, newsprint), printer paper, polycoated paper, card stock, cardboard,
  paperboard, materials having a high a-cellulose content such as cotton, and mixtures of

  [00281]      Cellulosic materials can also include lignocellulosic materials which have been
  partially or fully de-lignified.
  [00282]      In some instances other biomass materials can be utilized, for example, starchy
  materials. Starchy materials include starch itself, e.g., corn starch, wheat starch, potato
  starch or rice starch, a derivative of starch, or a material that includes starch, such as an
  edible food product or a crop. For example, the starchy material can be arracacha,
  buckwheat, banana, barley, cassava, kudzu, oca, sago, sorghum, regular household
  potatoes, sweet potato, taro, yams, or one or more beans, such as favas, lentils or peas.
  Blends of any two or more starchy materials are also starchy materials. Mixtures of
  starchy, cellulosic and or lignocellulosic materials can also be used. For example, a
  biomass can be an entire plant, a part of a plant or different parts of a plant, e.g., a wheat
  plant, cotton plant, a corn plant, rice plant or a tree. The starchy materials can be treated
  by any of the methods described herein.
  [00283]      Microbial materials include, but are not limited to, any naturally occurring or
  genetically modified microorganism or organism that contains or is capable of providing a
  source of carbohydrates (e.g., cellulose), for example, protists, e.g., animal protists (e.g.,
  protozoa such as flagellates, amoeboids, ciliates, and sporozoa) and plant protists (e.g.,
  algae such alveolates, chlorarachniophytes, cryptomonads, euglenids, glaucophytes,
  haptophytes, red algae, stramenopiles, and viridaeplantae). Other examples include
  seaweed, plankton (e.g., macroplankton, mesoplankton, microplankton, nanoplankton,
  picoplankton, and femptoplankton), phytoplankton, bacteria (e.g., gram positive bacteria,
  gram negative bacteria, and extremophiles), yeast and/or mixtures of these. In some
  instances, microbial biomass can be obtained from natural sources, e.g., the ocean, lakes,
  bodies of water, e.g., salt water or fresh water, or on land. Alternatively or in addition,
  microbial biomass can be obtained from culture systems, e.g., large scale dry and wet
  culture and fermentation systems.
  [00284]      In other embodiments, the biomass materials, such as cellulosic, starchy and
  lignocellulosic feedstock materials, can be obtained from transgenic microorganisms and
  plants that have been modified with respect to a wild type variety. Such modifications
  may be, for example, through the iterative steps of selection and breeding to obtain desired
  traits in a plant. Furthermore, the plants can have had genetic material removed, modified,
                                             67

WO 2014/186670                                                                 PCT/US2014/038341
  silenced and/or added with respect to the wild type variety. For example, genetically
  modified plants can be produced by recombinant DNA methods, where genetic
  modifications include introducing or modifying specific genes from parental varieties, or,
  for example, by using transgenic breeding wherein a specific gene or genes are introduced
  to a plant from a different species of plant and/or bacteria. Another way to create genetic
  variation is through mutation breeding wherein new alleles are artificially created from
  endogenous genes. The artificial genes can be created by a variety of ways including
  treating the plant or seeds with, for example, chemical mutagens (e.g., using alkylating
  agents, epoxides, alkaloids, peroxides, formaldehyde), irradiation (e.g., X-rays, gamma
  rays, neutrons, beta particles, alpha particles, protons, deuterons, UV radiation) and
  temperature shocking or other external stressing and subsequent selection techniques.
  Other methods of providing modified genes is through error prone PCR and DNA
  shuffling followed by insertion of the desired modified DNA into the desired plant or
  seed. Methods of introducing the desired genetic variation in the seed or plant include, for
  example, the use of a bacterial carrier, biolistics, calcium phosphate precipitation,
  electroporation, gene splicing, gene silencing, lipofection, microinjection and viral
  carriers. Additional genetically modified materials have been described in U.S.

  [00285]      Any of the methods described herein can be practiced with mixtures of any
  biomass materials described herein.
  BIOMASS MATERIAL PREPARATION - MECHANICAL TREATMENTS
  [00286]      The biomass can be in a dry form, for example, with less than about 35%
  moisture content (e.g., less than about 20 %, less than about 15 %, less than about 10 %
  less than about 5 %, less than about 4%, less than about 3 %, less than about 2 % or even
  less than about 1 %).   The biomass can also be delivered in a wet state, for example, as a
  wet solid, a slurry or a suspension with at least about 10 wt.% solids (e.g., at least about
  20 wt.%, at least about 30 wt. %, at least about 40 wt.%, at least about 50 wt.%, at least
  about 60 wt.%, at least about 70 wt.%).
  [00287]      The processes disclosed herein can utilize low bulk density materials, for
  example, cellulosic or lignocellulosic feedstocks that have been physically pretreated to
  have a bulk density of less than about 0.75 g/cm 3 , e.g., less than about 0.7, 0.65, 0.60,
  0.50, 0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05 or less, e.g., less than about 0.025 g/cm 3 . Bulk
                                             68

WO 2014/186670                                                               PCT/US2014/038341
  density is determined using ASTM D1895B. Briefly, the method involves filling a
  measuring cylinder of known volume with a sample and obtaining a weight of the sample.
  The bulk density is calculated by dividing the weight of the sample in grams by the known
  volume of the cylinder in cubic centimeters. If desired, low bulk density materials can be
  densified, for example, by methods described in US. Pat. No. 7,971,809 to Medoff, the
  full disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
  [00288]      In some cases, the pre-treatment processing includes screening of the biomass
  material. Screening can be through a mesh or perforated plate with a desired opening size,
  for example, less than about 6.35 mm (1/4 inch, 0.25 inch), (e.g., less than about 3.18 mm
  (1/8 inch, 0.125 inch), less than about 1.59 mm (1/16 inch, 0.0625 inch), is less than about
  0.79 mm (1/32 inch, 0.03125 inch), e.g., less than about 0.51 mm (1/50 inch, 0.02000
  inch), less than about 0.40 mm (1/64 inch, 0.015625 inch), less than about 0.23 mm (0.009
  inch), less than about 0.20 mm (1/128 inch, 0.0078125 inch), less than about 0.18 mm
  (0.007 inch), less than about 0.13 mm (0.005 inch), or even less than about 0.10 mm
  (1/256 inch, 0.00390625 inch)). In one configuration the desired biomass falls through the
  perforations or screen and thus biomass larger than the perforations or screen are not
  irradiated. These larger materials can be re-processed, for example, by comminuting, or
  they can simply be removed from processing. In another configuration material that is
  larger than the perforations is irradiated and the smaller material is removed by the
  screening process or recycled. In this kind of a configuration, the conveyor itself (for
  example, a part of the conveyor) can be perforated or made with a mesh. For example, in
  one particular embodiment the biomass material may be wet and the perforations or mesh
  allow water to drain away from the biomass before irradiation.
  [00289]      Screening of material can also be by a manual method, for example by an
  operator or mechanoid (e.g., a robot equipped with a color, reflectivity or other sensor)
  that removes unwanted material. Screening can also be by magnetic screening wherein a
  magnet is disposed near the conveyed material and the magnetic material is removed
  magnetically.
  [00290]      Optional pre-treatment processing can include heating the material. For
  example, a portion of the conveyor can be sent through a heated zone. The heated zone
  can be created, for example, by IR radiation, microwaves, combustion (e.g., gas, coal, oil,
  biomass), resistive heating and/or inductive coils. The heat can be applied from at least
  one side or more than one side, can be continuous or periodic and can be for only a
  portion of the material or all the material. For example, a portion of the conveying trough
                                             69

WO 2014/186670                                                                 PCT/US2014/038341
  can be heated by use of a heating jacket. Heating can be, for example, for the purpose of
  drying the material. In the case of drying the material, this can also be facilitated, with or
  without heating, by the movement of a gas (e.g., air, oxygen, nitrogen, He, C0 2 , Argon)
  over and/or through the biomass as it is being conveyed.
  [00291]      Optionally, pre-treatment processing can include cooling the material. Cooling
  material is described in US Pat. No. 7,900,857 to Medoff, the disclosure of which in
  incorporated herein by reference. For example, cooling can be by supplying a cooling
  fluid, for example, water (e.g., with glycerol), or nitrogen (e.g., liquid nitrogen) to the
  bottom of the conveying trough. Alternatively, a cooling gas, for example, chilled
  nitrogen can be blown over the biomass materials or under the conveying system.
  [00292]      Another optional pre-treatment processing method can include adding a
  material to the biomass. The additional material can be added by, for example, by
  showering, sprinkling and or pouring the material onto the biomass as it is conveyed.
  Materials that can be added include, for example, metals, ceramics and/or ions as
  described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0105119 Al (filed October 26, 2009) and U.S. Pat.
  App. Pub. 2010/0159569 Al (filed December 16, 2009), the entire disclosures of which
  are incorporated herein by reference. Optional materials that can be added include acids
  and bases. Other materials that can be added are oxidants (e.g., peroxides, chlorates),
  polymers, polymerizable monomers (e.g., containing unsaturated bonds), water, catalysts,
  enzymes and/or organisms. Materials can be added, for example, in pure form, as a
  solution in a solvent (e.g., water or an organic solvent) and/or as a solution. In some cases
  the solvent is volatile and can be made to evaporate e.g., by heating and/or blowing gas as
  previously described. The added material may form a uniform coating on the biomass or
  be a homogeneous mixture of different components (e.g., biomass and additional
  material). The added material can modulate the subsequent irradiation step by increasing
  the efficiency of the irradiation, damping the irradiation or changing the effect of the
  irradiation (e.g., from electron beams to X-rays or heat). The method may have no impact
  on the irradiation but may be useful for further downstream processing. The added
  material may help in conveying the material, for example, by lowering dust levels.
  [00293]      Biomass can be delivered to the conveyor (e.g., the vibratory conveyors used
  in the vaults herein described) by a belt conveyor, a pneumatic conveyor, a screw
  conveyor, a hopper, a pipe, manually or by a combination of these. The biomass can, for
  example, be dropped, poured and/or placed onto the conveyor by any of these methods. In
  some embodiments the material is delivered to the conveyor using an enclosed material
                                            70

WO 2014/186670                                                                       PCT/US2014/038341
  distribution system to help maintain a low oxygen atmosphere and/or control dust and
  fines. Lofted or air suspended biomass fines and dust are undesirable because these can
  form an explosion hazard or damage the window foils of an electron gun (if such a device
  is used for treating the material).
  [00294]      The material can be leveled to form a uniform thickness between about 0.0312
  and 5 inches (e.g., between about 0.0625 and 2.000 inches, between about 0.125 and 1
  inches, between about 0.125 and 0.5 inches, between about 0.3 and 0.9 inches, between
  about 0.2 and 0.5 inches between about 0.25 and 1.0 inches, between about 0.25 and 0.5
  inches, 0.100 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.150 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.200 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.250 +/
  0.025 inches, 0.300 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.350 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.400 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.450
  +/- 0.025 inches, 0.500 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.550 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.600 +/- 0.025 inches,
  0.700 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.750 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.800 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.850 +/- 0.025
  inches, 0.900 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.900 +/- 0.025 inches.
  [00295]      Generally, it is preferred to convey the material as quickly as possible through
  the electron beam to maximize throughput. For example, the material can be conveyed at
  rates of at least 1 ft./min, e.g., at least 2 ft./min, at least 3 ft./min, at least 4 ft./min, at least
  5 ft./min, at least 10 ft./min, at least 15 ft./min, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 ft./min. The rate
  of conveying is related to the beam current, for example, for a           inch thick biomass and
  100 mA, the conveyor can move at about 20 ft./min to provide a useful irradiation dosage,
  at 50 mA the conveyor can move at about 10 ft./min to provide approximately the same
  irradiation dosage.
  [00296]      After the biomass material has been conveyed through the radiation zone,
  optional post-treatment processing can be done. The optional post-treatment processing
  can, for example, be a process described with respect to the pre-irradiation processing.
  For example, the biomass can be screened, heated, cooled, and/or combined with
  additives. Uniquely to post-irradiation, quenching of the radicals can occur, for example,
  quenching of radicals by the addition of fluids or gases (e.g., oxygen, nitrous oxide,
  ammonia, liquids), using pressure, heat, and/or the addition of radical scavengers. For
  example, the biomass can be conveyed out of the enclosed conveyor and exposed to a gas
  (e.g., oxygen) where it is quenched, forming carboxylated groups. In one embodiment the
  biomass is exposed during irradiation to the reactive gas or fluid. Quenching of biomass
  that has been irradiated is described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,083,906 to Medoff, the entire
  disclosure of which is incorporate herein by reference.
                                                71

WO 2014/186670                                                                   PCT/US2014/038341
   [00297]        If desired, one or more mechanical treatments can be used in addition to
  irradiation to further reduce the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing material.
  These processes can be applied before, during and or after irradiation.
   [00298]        In some cases, the mechanical treatment may include an initial preparation of
  the feedstock as received, e.g., size reduction of materials, such as by comminution, e.g.,
  cutting, grinding, shearing, pulverizing or chopping. For example, in some cases, loose
  feedstock (e.g., recycled paper, starchy materials, or switchgrass) is prepared by shearing
  or shredding. Mechanical treatment may reduce the bulk density of the carbohydrate
  containing material, increase the surface area of the carbohydrate-containing material
   and/or decrease one or more dimensions of the carbohydrate-containing material.
   [00299]        Alternatively, or in addition, the feedstock material can be treated with another
  treatment, for example, chemical treatments, such as with an acid (HCl, H 2 SO 4 , H 3 PO4), a
  base (e.g., KOH and NaOH), a chemical oxidant (e.g., peroxides, chlorates, ozone),
  irradiation, steam explosion, pyrolysis, sonication, oxidation, chemical treatment. The
  treatments can be in any order and in any sequence and combinations. For example, the
  feedstock material can first be physically treated by one or more treatment methods, e.g.,
  chemical treatment including and in combination with acid hydrolysis (e.g., utilizing HCl,
  H 2 SO 4 , H 3 PO4 ), radiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion, and then
  mechanically treated. This sequence can be advantageous since materials treated by one
  or more of the other treatments, e.g., irradiation or pyrolysis, tend to be more brittle and,
  therefore, it may be easier to further change the structure of the material by mechanical
  treatment. As another example, a feedstock material can be conveyed through ionizing
  radiation using a conveyor as described herein and then mechanically treated. Chemical
  treatment can remove some or all of the lignin (for example, chemical pulping) and can
  partially or completely hydrolyze the material. The methods also can be used with pre
  hydrolyzed material. The methods also can be used with material that has not been pre
  hydrolyzed The methods can be used with mixtures of hydrolyzed and non-hydrolyzed
  materials, for example, with about 50% or more non-hydrolyzed material, with about 60%
  or more non- hydrolyzed material, with about 70% or more non-hydrolyzed material, with
   about 80% or more non-hydrolyzed material or even with 90% or more non-hydrolyzed
  material.
   [00300]        In addition to size reduction, which can be performed initially and/or later in
  processing, mechanical treatment can also be advantageous for "opening up," "stressing,"
  breaking or shattering the carbohydrate-containing materials, making the cellulose of the
                                                 72

WO 2014/186670                                                                 PCT/US2014/038341
  materials more susceptible to chain scission and/or disruption of crystalline structure
  during the physical treatment.
   [00301]      Methods of mechanically treating the carbohydrate-containing material
  include, for example, milling or grinding. Milling may be performed using, for example,
   a hammer mill, ball mill, colloid mill, conical or cone mill, disk mill, edge mill, Wiley
  mill, grist mill or other mill. Grinding may be performed using, for example, a
  cutting/impact type grinder. Some exemplary grinders include stone grinders, pin
  grinders, coffee grinders, and burr grinders. Grinding or milling may be provided, for
  example, by a reciprocating pin or other element, as is the case in a pin mill. Other
  mechanical treatment methods include mechanical ripping or tearing, other methods that
   apply pressure to the fibers, and air attrition milling. Suitable mechanical treatments
  further include any other technique that continues the disruption of the internal structure
  of the material that was initiated by the previous processing steps.
   [00302]      The milling of the biomass may be done either in a wet or dry state. The
  optimum condition can depend on the milling equipment, the biomass, whether
   subsequent steps are more suited to processing a dry material. The preferred liquid for the
  wet milling is water, and this can be done without additives like sulfur dioxide. Dry
  milling of the biomass may be a preferred process especially if subsequent treatments are
  better done is a dry state where the water content is less than about 15 weight percent,
  optionally less than 10 weight percent, or alternatively less than 5 weight percent. For
  example, the material can be wet and/or dry milled by the methods and equipment
  disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,900,857, U.S. Pat. No. 8,420,356, and U. S. Pat. Application
  2012/0315675 the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
   [00303]      Mechanical feed preparation systems can be configured to produce streams
  with specific characteristics such as, for example, specific maximum sizes, specific
  length-to-width, or specific surface areas ratios. Physical preparation can increase the rate
  of reactions, improve the movement of material on a conveyor, improve the irradiation
  profile of the material, improve the radiation uniformity of the material, or reduce the
  processing time required by opening up the materials and making them more accessible to
  processes and/or reagents, such as reagents in a solution.
   [00304]      The bulk density of feedstocks can be controlled (e.g., increased). In some
   situations, it can be desirable to prepare a low bulk density material, e.g., by densifying
  the material (e.g., densification can make it easier and less costly to transport to another
                                              73

WO 2014/186670                                                                   PCT/US2014/038341
  site) and then reverting the material to a lower bulk density state (e.g., after transport).
  The material can be densified, for example, from less than about 0.2 g/cc to more than
  about 0.9 g/cc (e.g., less than about 0.3 to more than about 0.5 g/cc, less than about 0.3 to
  more than about 0.9 g/cc, less than about 0.5 to more than about 0.9 g/cc, less than about
  0.3 to more than about 0.8 g/cc, less than about 0.2 to more than about 0.5 g/cc). For
  example, the material can be densified by the methods and equipment disclosed in U.S.
  Pat. No. 7,932,065 to Medoff and International Publication No. WO 2008/073186 (which
  was filed October 26, 2007, was published in English, and which designated the United
  States), the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Densified
  materials can be processed by any of the methods described herein, or any material
  processed by any of the methods described herein can be subsequently densified.
  [00305]      In some embodiments, the material to be processed is in the form of a fibrous
  material that includes fibers provided by shearing a fiber source. For example, the
  shearing can be performed with a rotary knife cutter.
  [00306]      For example, a fiber source, e.g., that is recalcitrant or that has had its
  recalcitrance level reduced, can be sheared, e.g., in a rotary knife cutter, to provide a first
  fibrous material. The first fibrous material is passed through a first screen, e.g., having an
  average opening size of 1.59 mm or less (1/16 inch, 0.0625 inch), provide a second
  fibrous material. If desired, the fiber source can be cut prior to the shearing, e.g., with a
  shredder. For example, when a paper is used as the fiber source, the paper can be first cut
  into strips that are, e.g., 1/4- to 1/2-inch wide, using a shredder, e.g., a counter-rotating
  screw shredder, such as those manufactured by Munson (Utica, N.Y.). As an alternative
  to shredding, the paper can be reduced in size by cutting to a desired size using a
  guillotine cutter. For example, the guillotine cutter can be used to cut the paper into sheets
  that are, e.g., 10 inches wide by 12 inches long.
  [00307]      In some embodiments, the shearing of the fiber source and the passing of the
  resulting first fibrous material through a first screen are performed concurrently. The
  shearing and the passing can also be performed in a batch-type process.
  [00308]      For example, a rotary knife cutter can be used to concurrently shear the fiber
  source and screen the first fibrous material. A rotary knife cutter includes a hopper that
  can be loaded with a shredded fiber source prepared by shredding a fiber source.
  [00309]      In some implementations, the feedstock is physically treated prior to
  saccharification and/or fermentation. Physical treatment processes can include one or
  more of any of those described herein, such as mechanical treatment, chemical treatment,

  irradiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis, heat treatment, or steam explosion. Treatment
  methods can be used in combinations of two, three, four, or even all of these technologies
  (in any order). When more than one treatment method is used, the methods can be applied
  at the same time or at different times. Other processes that change a molecular structure
  of a biomass feedstock may also be used, alone or in combination with the processes
  disclosed herein.
  [00310]      Mechanical treatments that may be used, and the characteristics of the
  mechanically treated carbohydrate-containing materials, are described in further detail in
  U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2012/0100577 Al, filed October 18, 2011, the full disclosure of which
  is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
  [00311]      The mechanical treatments described herein can also be applied to processing
  of PASA and PASA based materials.
  SONICATION, PYROLYSIS, OXIDATION, STEAM EXPLOSION
  [00312]      If desired, one or more sonication, pyrolysis, oxidative, or steam explosion
  processes can be used instead of or in addition to irradiation to reduce or further reduce
  the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing material or process PASA and/or PASA
  based materials. For example, these processes can be applied before, during and or after
  irradiation. These processes are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,932,065 to Medoff,
  the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
  HEAT TREATMENT OF BIOMASS
  [00313]      Alternately, or in addition to the biomass may be heat treated for up to twelve
  hours at temperatures ranging from about 90'C to about 160'C. Optionally, this heat
  treatment step is performed after biomass has been irradiated with an electron beam. The
  amount of time for the heat treatment is up to 9 hours, alternately up to 6 hours, optionally
  up to 4 hours and further up to about 2 hours. The treatment time can be up to as little as
  30 minutes when the mass may be effectively heated.
  [00314]      The heat treatment can be performed 90'C to about 160'C or, optionally, at
  100 to 150 or, alternatively, at 120 to 140 'C. The biomass is suspended in water such
  that the biomass content is 10 to 75 wt. % in water. In the case of the biomass being the
  irradiated biomass water is added and the heat treatment performed.
  [00315]      The heat treatment is performed in an aqueous suspension or mixture of the
  biomass. The amount of biomass is 10 to 90 wt. % of the total mixture, alternatively 20 to
                                             75

WO 2014/186670                                                                PCT/US2014/038341
  70 wt. % or optionally 25 to 50 wt. %. The irradiated biomass may have minimal water
  content so water must be added prior to the heat treatment.
  [00316]      Since at temperatures above 100 'C there will be pressure due at least in part to
  the vaporization of water, a pressure vessel can be utilized to accommodate and/or
  maintain the pressure. The process for the heat treatment may be batch, continuous, semi
  continuous or other reactor configurations. The continuous reactor configuration may be a
  tubular reactor and may include device(s) within the tube which will facilitate heat
  transfer and mixing/suspension of the biomass. These tubular devices may include a one
  or more static mixers. The heat may also be put into the system by direct injection of
  steam.
  CONVEYING SYSTEMS
  [00317]      Various conveying systems can be used to convey the feedstock materials, for
  example, to a vault and under an electron beam in a vault. Exemplary conveyors are belt
  conveyors, pneumatic conveyors, screw conveyors, carts, trains, trains or carts on rails,
  elevators, front loaders, backhoes, cranes, various scrapers and shovels, trucks, and
  throwing devices can be used. For example, vibratory conveyors can be used in various
  processes described herein, for example, as disclosed in International App. No.
  PCT/US2013/064332 filed October 10, 2013 the entire disclosure of which is herein
  incorporated by reference.
  USE OF TREATED BIOMASS MATERIAL
  [00318]      Using the methods described herein, a starting biomass material (e.g., plant
  biomass, animal biomass, paper, and municipal waste biomass) can be used as feedstock
  to produce useful intermediates and products such as organic acids, salts of organic acids,
  hydroxyl acids, PASA, acid anhydrides, esters of organic acids and fuels, e.g., fuels for
  internal combustion engines or feedstocks for fuel cells. Systems and processes are
  described herein that can use as feedstock cellulosic and/or lignocellulosic materials that
  are readily available, but often can be difficult to process, e.g., municipal waste streams
  and waste paper streams, such as streams that include newspaper, Kraft paper, corrugated
  paper or mixtures of these.
  [00319]      In order to convert the feedstock to a form that can be readily processed, the
  glucan- or xylan-containing cellulose in the feedstock can be hydrolyzed to low molecular
  weight carbohydrates, such as sugars, by a saccharifying agent, e.g., an enzyme or acid, a
                                            76

WO 2014/186670                                                                 PCT/US2014/038341
  process referred to as saccharification. The low molecular weight carbohydrates can then
  be used, for example, in an existing manufacturing plant, such as a single cell protein
  plant, an enzyme manufacturing plant, or a fuel plant, e.g., an ethanol manufacturing
  facility.
  [00320]      The feedstock can be hydrolyzed using an enzyme, e.g., by combining the
  materials and the enzyme in a solvent, e.g., in an aqueous solution.
  [00321]      Alternatively, the enzymes can be supplied by organisms that break down
  biomass, such as the cellulose and/or the lignin portions of the biomass, contain or
  manufacture various cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases), ligninases or various small
  molecule biomass-degrading metabolites. These enzymes may be a complex of enzymes
  that act synergistically to degrade crystalline cellulose or the lignin portions of biomass.
  Examples of cellulolytic enzymes include: endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and
  cellobiases (beta-glucosidases).
  [00322]      During saccharification a cellulosic substrate can be initially hydrolyzed by
  endoglucanases at random locations producing oligomeric intermediates. These
  intermediates are then substrates for exo-splitting glucanases such as cellobiohydrolase to
  produce cellobiose from the ends of the cellulose polymer. Cellobiose is a water-soluble
  1,4-linked dimer of glucose. Finally, cellobiase cleaves cellobiose to yield glucose. The
  efficiency (e.g., time to hydrolyze and/or completeness of hydrolysis) of this process
  depends on the recalcitrance of the cellulosic material.
  INTERMEDIATES AND PRODUCTS
  [00323]      Using the processes described herein, the biomass material can be converted to
  one or more products, such as energy, fuels, foods and materials. Specific examples of
  products include, but are not limited to, hydrogen, sugars (e.g., glucose, xylose, arabinose,
  mannose, galactose, fructose, disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides),
  alcohols (e.g., monohydric alcohols or dihydric alcohols, such as ethanol, n-propanol,
  isobutanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol or n-butanol), hydrated or hydrous alcohols (e.g.,
  containing greater than 10%, 20%, 30% or even greater than 40% water), biodiesel,
  organic acids, hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, isobutene, pentane, n
  hexane, biodiesel, bio-gasoline and mixtures thereof), co-products (e.g., proteins, such as
  cellulolytic proteins (enzymes) or single cell proteins), and mixtures of any of these in any
  combination or relative concentration, and optionally in combination with any additives
  (e.g., fuel additives). Other examples include carboxylic acids, salts of a carboxylic acid,
                                            77

WO 2014/186670                                                                     PCT/US2014/038341
  a mixture of carboxylic acids and salts of carboxylic acids and esters of carboxylic acids
  (e.g., methyl, ethyl and n-propyl esters), ketones (e.g., acetone), aldehydes (e.g.,
  acetaldehyde), alpha and beta unsaturated acids (e.g., acrylic acid) and olefins (e.g.,
  ethylene). Other alcohols and alcohol derivatives include propanol, propylene glycol, 1,4
  butanediol, 1,3-propanediol, sugar alcohols (e.g., erythritol, glycol, glycerol, sorbitol
  threitol, arabitol, ribitol, mannitol, dulcitol, fucitol, iditol, isomalt, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol
  and other polyols), and methyl or ethyl esters of any of these alcohols. Other products
  include methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, lactic acid,, citric acid, formic acid, acetic
  acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, succinic acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, 3
  hydroxypropionic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, glutaric acid,
  oleic acid, linoleic acid, glycolic acid, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, and mixtures thereof,
  salts of any of these acids, mixtures of any of the acids and their respective salts.
  [00324]      Any combination of the above products with each other, and/or of the above
  products with other products, which other products may be made by the processes
  described herein or otherwise, may be packaged together and sold as products. The
  products may be combined, e.g., mixed, blended or co-dissolved, or may simply be
  packaged or sold together.
  [00325]      Any of the products or combinations of products described herein may be
  sanitized or sterilized prior to selling the products, e.g., after purification or isolation or
  even after packaging, to neutralize one or more potentially undesirable contaminants that
  could be present in the product(s). Such sanitation can be done with electron
  bombardment, for example, be at a dosage of less than about 20 Mrad, e.g., from about 0.1
  to 15 Mrad, from about 0.5 to 7 Mrad, or from about 1 to 3 Mrad.
  [00326]      The processes described herein can produce various by-product streams useful
  for generating steam and electricity to be used in other parts of the plant (co-generation) or
  sold on the open market. For example, steam generated from burning by-product streams
  can be used in a distillation process. As another example, electricity generated from
  burning by-product streams can be used to power electron beam generators used in
  pretreatment.
  [00327]      The by-products used to generate steam and electricity are derived from a
  number of sources throughout the process. For example, anaerobic digestion of
  wastewater can produce a biogas high in methane and a small amount of waste biomass
  (sludge). As another example, post-saccharification and/or post-distillate solids (e.g.,
                                              78

WO 2014/186670                                                                PCT/US2014/038341
  unconverted lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose remaining from the pretreatment and
  primary processes) can be used, e.g., burned, as a fuel.
  [00328]     Other intermediates and products, including food and pharmaceutical products,
  are described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0124583 Al, published May 20, 2010, to
  Medoff, the full disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.
  LIGNIN DERIVED PRODUCTS
  [00329]     The spent biomass (e.g., spent lignocellulosic material) from lignocellulosic
  processing by the methods described are expected to have a high lignin content and in
  addition to being useful for producing energy through combustion in a Co-Generation
  plant, may have uses as other valuable products. For example, the lignin can be used as
  captured as a plastic, or it can be synthetically upgraded to other plastics. In some
  instances, it can also be converted to lignosulfonates, which can be utilized as binders,
  dispersants, emulsifiers or as sequestrants.
  [00330]     When used as a binder, the lignin or a lignosulfonate can, e.g., be utilized in
  coal briquettes, in ceramics, for binding carbon black, for binding fertilizers and
  herbicides, as a dust suppressant, in the making of plywood and particle board, for binding
  animal feeds, as a binder for fiberglass, as a binder in linoleum paste and as a soil
  stabilizer.
  [00331]     As a dispersant, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g., concrete mixes,
  clay and ceramics, dyes and pigments, leather tanning and in gypsum board.
  [00332]     As an emulsifier, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g., in asphalt,
  pigments and dyes, pesticides and wax emulsions.
  [00333]     As a sequestrant, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g., in micro
  nutrient systems, cleaning compounds and water treatment systems, e.g., for boiler and
  cooling systems.
  [00334]     For energy production lignin generally has a higher energy content than
  holocellulose (cellulose and hemicellulose) since it contains more carbon than
  homocellulose. For example, dry lignin can have an energy content of between about
  11,000 and 12,500 BTU per pound, compared to 7,000 an 8,000 BTU per pound of
  holocellulose. As such, lignin can be densified and converted into briquettes and pellets
  for burning. For example, the lignin can be converted into pellets by any method
  described herein. For a slower burning pellet or briquette, the lignin can be cross-linked,
  such as applying a radiation dose of between about 0.5 Mrad and 5 Mrad. Crosslinking
                                            79

WO 2014/186670                                                                PCT/US2014/038341
  can make a slower burning form factor. The form factor, such as a pellet or briquette, can
  be converted to a "synthetic coal" or charcoal by pyrolyzing in the absence of air, e.g., at
  between 400 and 950 'C. Prior to pyrolyzing, it can be desirable to crosslink the lignin to
  maintain structural integrity.
  [00335]      Co-generation using spent biomass is described in International App. No.
  PCT/US2014/021634 filed March 7, 2014,, the entire disclosure therein is herein
  incorporated by reference.
  [00336]      Lignin derived products can also be combined with PASA and PASA derived
  products. (e.g., PASA that has been produced as described herein). For example, lignin
  and lignin derived products can be blended, grafted to or otherwise combined and/or
  mixed with PASA. The lignin can, for example, be useful for strengthening, plasticizing
  or otherwise modifying the PASA.
  SACCHARIFICATION
  [00337]      The treated biomass materials can be saccharified, generally by combining the
  material and a cellulase enzyme in a fluid medium, e.g., an aqueous solution. In some
  cases, the material is boiled, steeped, or cooked in hot water prior to saccharification, as
  described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2012/0100577 Al by Medoff and Masterman, published
  on April 26, 2012, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein.
  [00338]      The saccharification process can be partially or completely performed in a tank
  (e.g., a tank having a volume of at least 4000, 40,000, or 500,000 L) in a manufacturing
  plant, and/or can be partially or completely performed in transit, e.g., in a rail car, tanker
  truck, or in a supertanker or the hold of a ship. The time required for complete
  saccharification will depend on the process conditions and the carbohydrate-containing
  material and enzyme used. If saccharification is performed in a manufacturing plant under
  controlled conditions, the cellulose may be substantially entirely converted to sugar, e.g.,
  glucose in about 12-96 hours. If saccharification is performed partially or completely in
  transit, saccharification may take longer.
  [00339]      It is generally preferred that the tank contents be mixed during saccharification,
  e.g., using jet mixing as described in International App. No. PCT/US2010/035331, filed
  May 18, 2010, which was published in English as WO 2010/135380 and designated the
  United States, the full disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.
                                              80

WO 2014/186670                                                                PCT/US2014/038341
  [00340]     The addition of surfactants can enhance the rate of saccharification. Examples
  of surfactants include non-ionic surfactants, such as a Tween@ 20 or Tween@ 80
  polyethylene glycol surfactants, ionic surfactants, or amphoteric surfactants.
  [00341]     It is generally preferred that the concentration of the sugar solution resulting
  from saccharification be relatively high, e.g., greater than 40%, or greater than 50, 60, 70,
  80, 90 or even greater than 95% by weight. Water may be removed, e.g., by evaporation,
  to increase the concentration of the sugar solution. This reduces the volume to be shipped,
  and also inhibits microbial growth in the solution.
  [00342]     Alternatively, sugar solutions of lower concentrations may be used, in which
  case it may be desirable to add an antimicrobial additive, e.g., a broad spectrum antibiotic,
  in a low concentration, e.g., 50 to 150 ppm. Other suitable antibiotics include
  amphotericin B, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, hygromycin B,
  kanamycin, neomycin, penicillin, puromycin, streptomycin. Antibiotics will inhibit
  growth of microorganisms during transport and storage, and can be used at appropriate
  concentrations, e.g., between 15 and 1000 ppm by weight, e.g., between 25 and 500 ppm,
  or between 50 and 150 ppm. If desired, an antibiotic can be included even if the sugar
  concentration is relatively high. Alternatively, other additives with anti-microbial of
  preservative properties may be used. Preferably the antimicrobial additive(s) are food
  grade.
  [00343]     A relatively high concentration solution can be obtained by limiting the
  amount of water added to the carbohydrate-containing material with the enzyme. The
  concentration can be controlled, e.g., by controlling how much saccharification takes
  place. For example, concentration can be increased by adding more carbohydrate
  containing material to the solution. In order to keep the sugar that is being produced in
  solution, a surfactant can be added, e.g., one of those discussed above. Solubility can also
  be increased by increasing the temperature of the solution. For example, the solution can
  be maintained at a temperature of 40-50'C, 60-80'C, or even higher.
  SACCHARIFYING AGENTS
  [00344]     Suitable cellulolytic enzymes include cellulases from species in the genera
  Bacillus, Coprinus, Myceliophthora, Cephalosporium,Scytalidium, Penicillium,
  Aspergillus, Pseudomonas,Humicola, Fusarium, Thielavia, Acremonium, Chrysosporium
  and Trichoderma,especially those produced by a strain selected from the species
  Aspergillus (see, e.g., EP Pub. No. 0 458 162), Humicola insolens (reclassified as
                                             81

  pinkertoniae CBS 157.70, Acremonium roseogriseumCBS 134.56, Acremonium
  incoloratumCBS 146.62, and Acremoniumfuratum CBS 299.70H. Cellulolytic enzymes
  may also be obtained from Chrysosporium,preferably a strain of Chrysosporium
  lucknowense. Additional strains that can be used include, but are not limited to,
  Trichoderma (particularlyT. viride, T. reesei, and T. koningii), alkalophilicBacillus (see,
  for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,844,890 and EP Pub. No. 0 458 162), and Streptomyces (see,
  e.g., EP Pub. No. 0 458 162).
  [00345]     In addition to or in combination to enzymes, acids, bases and other chemicals
  (e.g., oxidants) can be utilized to saccharify lignocellulosic and cellulosic materials. These
  can be used in any combination or sequence (e.g., before, after and/or during addition of
  an enzyme). For example strong mineral acids can be utilized (e.g. HCl, H 2 SO 4 , H 3 PO 4)
  and strong bases (e.g., NaOH, KOH).
  SUGARS
  [00346]     In the processes described herein, for example, after saccharification, sugars
  (e.g., glucose and xylose) can be isolated. For example, sugars can be isolated by
  precipitation, crystallization, chromatography (e.g., simulated moving bed
  chromatography, high pressure chromatography), centrifugation, extraction, any other
  isolation method known in the art, and combinations thereof.
  FERMENTATION
  [00347]     Yeast and Zymomonas bacteria, for example, can be used for fermentation or
  conversion of sugar(s) to alcohol(s). Other microorganisms are discussed below. The
  optimum pH for fermentations is about pH 4 to 7. For example, the optimum pH for yeast
                                            82

WO 2014/186670                                                               PCT/US2014/038341
  is from about pH 4 to 5, while the optimum pH for Zymomonas is from about pH 5 to 6.
  Typical fermentation times are about 24 to 168 hours (e.g., 24 to 96 hrs.) with
  temperatures in the range of 20'C to 40'C (e.g., 260 C to 40'C), however thermophilic
  microorganisms prefer higher temperatures.
  [00348]     In some embodiments, e.g., when anaerobic organisms are used, at least a
  portion of the fermentation is conducted in the absence of oxygen, e.g., under a blanket of
  an inert gas such as N 2 , Ar, He, CO 2 or mixtures thereof. Additionally, the mixture may
  have a constant purge of an inert gas flowing through the tank during part of or all of the
  fermentation. In some cases, anaerobic condition, can be achieved or maintained by
  carbon dioxide production during the fermentation and no additional inert gas is needed.
  [00349]     In some embodiments, all or a portion of the fermentation process can be
  interrupted before the low molecular weight sugar is completely converted to a product
  (e.g., ethanol). The intermediate fermentation products include sugar and carbohydrates
  in high concentrations. The sugars and carbohydrates can be isolated via any means
  known in the art. These intermediate fermentation products can be used in preparation of
  food for human or animal consumption. Additionally or alternatively, the intermediate
  fermentation products can be ground to a fine particle size in a stainless-steel laboratory
  mill to produce a flour-like substance. Jet mixing may be used during fermentation, and in
  some cases saccharification and fermentation are performed in the same tank.
  [00350]     Nutrients for the microorganisms may be added during saccharification and/or
  fermentation, for example, the food-based nutrient packages described in U.S. Pat. App.
  Pub. 2012/0052536, filed July 15, 2011, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated
  herein by reference.

   FERMENTATION AGENTS
   [00353]     The microorganism(s) used in fermentation can be naturally-occurring
   microorganisms and/or engineered microorganisms. For example, the microorganism can
   be a bacterium (including, but not limited to, e.g., a cellulolytic bacterium), a fungus,
   (including, but not limited to, e.g., a yeast), a plant, a protist, e.g., a protozoa or a fungus
   like protest (including, but not limited to, e.g., a slime mold), or an alga. When the
   organisms are compatible, mixtures of organisms can be utilized.
  [00354]     Suitable fermenting microorganisms have the ability to convert carbohydrates,
  such as glucose, fructose, xylose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, oligosaccharides or
  polysaccharides into fermentation products. Fermenting microorganisms include strains of
  the genus Saccharomyces spp. (including, but not limited to, S. cerevisiae (baker's yeast),
  S. distaticus, S. uvarum), the genus Kluyveromyces, (including, but not limited to, K.
  marxianus, K. fragilis), the genus Candida(including, but not limited to, C.
 pseudotropicalis,and C. brassicae),Pichia stipitis (a relative of Candida shehatae), the
  genus Clavispora(including, but not limited to, C. lusitaniaeand C. opuntiae), the genus
  Pachysolen (including, but not limited to, P. tannophilus), the genus Bretannomyces
  (including, but not limited to, e.g., B. clausenii (Philippidis, G. P., 1996, Cellulose
  bioconversion technology, in Handbook on Bioethanol: Production and Utilization,
  Wyman, C.E., ed., Taylor & Francis, Washington, DC, 179-212)). Other suitable
  microorganisms include, for example, Zymomonas mobilis, Clostridium spp. (including,
  but not limited to, C. thermocellum (Philippidis, 1996, supra), C.
  saccharobutylacetonicum,C. tyrobutyricum C. saccharobutylicum, C. Puniceum, C.
  beijernckii, and C. acetobutylicum), Moniliella spp. (including but not limited to M.
 pollinis,M. tomentosa, M. madida, M. nigrescens,M. oedocephali, M. megachiliensis),
  Yarrowia lipolytica, Aureobasidium sp., Trichosporonoidessp., Trigonopsisvariabilis,

  Ustilaginomycetessp., Pseudozyma tsukubaensis, yeast species of genera
  Zygosaccharomyces, Debaryomyces, Hansenula and Pichia,and fungi of the dematioid
  genus Torula (e.g., T.corallina).
   [00355]     Many such microbial strains are publicly available, either commercially or
   through depositories such as the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas,
   Virginia, USA), the NRRL (Agricultural Research Service Culture Collection, Peoria,

  AB, Sweden) and FERMOL (available from DSM Specialties).
  DISTILLATION
   [00357]      After fermentation, the resulting fluids can be distilled using, for example, a
   "beer column" to separate ethanol and other alcohols from the majority of water and
  residual solids. The vapor exiting the beer column can be, e.g., 35% by weight ethanol
   and can be fed to a rectification column. A mixture of nearly azeotropic (92.5%) ethanol
   and water from the rectification column can be purified to pure (99.5%) ethanol using
  vapor-phase molecular sieves. The beer column bottoms can be sent to the first effect of a
  three-effect evaporator. The rectification column reflux condenser can provide heat for
  this first effect. After the first effect, solids can be separated using a centrifuge and dried
  in a rotary dryer. A portion (25%) of the centrifuge effluent can be recycled to
  fermentation and the rest sent to the second and third evaporator effects. Most of the
  evaporator condensate can be returned to the process as fairly clean condensate with a
   small portion split off to waste water treatment to prevent build-up of low-boiling
  compounds.
  HYDROGENATION AND OTHER CHEMICAL TRANSFORMATIONS
   [00358]      The processes described herein can include hydrogenation. For example,
  glucose and xylose can be hydrogenated to sorbitol and xylitol respectively. Esters, for
  example, produced as described herein, can also be hydrogenated. Hydrogenation can be
   accomplished by use of a catalyst (e.g., Pt/gamma-A1203, Ru/C, Raney Nickel, copper
  chromite, or other catalysts know in the art) in combination with H2 under high pressure
   (e.g., 10 to 12000 psi). Other types of chemical transformation of the products from the
  processes described herein can be used, for example, production of organic sugar derived
  products such (e.g., furfural and furfural-derived products). Chemical transformations of
   sugar derived products are described in US Prov. App. No. 61/667,481, filed July 3, 2012,

   [00359]     In other embodiments utilizing the methods and systems described herein,
  hydrocarbon-containing materials can be processed. Any process described herein can be
  used to treat any hydrocarbon-containing material herein described. "Hydrocarbon
  containing materials," as used herein, is meant to include oil sands, oil shale, tar sands,
  coal dust, coal slurry, bitumen, various types of coal, and other naturally-occurring and
   synthetic materials that include both hydrocarbon components and solid matter. The solid
  matter can include rock, sand, clay, stone, silt, drilling slurry, or other solid organic and/or
  inorganic matter. The term can also include waste products such as drilling waste and by
  products, refining waste and by-products, or other waste products containing hydrocarbon
  components, such as asphalt shingling and covering, asphalt pavement, etc.
   OTHER EMBODIMENTS
   [00360]     Any material, processes or processed materials described herein can be used to
  make products and/or intermediates such as composites, fillers, binders, plastic additives,
   adsorbents and controlled release agents. The methods can include densification, for
  example, by applying pressure and heat to the materials. For example, composites can be
  made by combining fibrous materials with a resin or polymer (e.g., PASA). For example,
  radiation cross-linkable resin (e.g., a thermoplastic resin, PASA, and/or PASA
  derivatives) can be combined with a fibrous material to provide a fibrous material/cross
  linkable resin combination. Such materials can be, for example, useful as building
  materials, protective sheets, containers and other structural materials (e.g., molded and/or
  extruded products). Absorbents can be, for example, in the form of pellets, chips, fibers
   and/or sheets. Adsorbents can be used, for example, as pet bedding, packaging material or
  in pollution control systems. Controlled release matrices can also be the form of, for
  example, pellets, chips, fibers and or sheets. The controlled release matrices can, for
  example, be used to release drugs, biocides, fragrances. For example, composites,
   absorbents and control release agents and their uses are described in U.S. Serial No.

  November 22, 2011, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.
   [00361]     In some instances the biomass material is treated at a first level to reduce
  recalcitrance, e.g., utilizing accelerated electrons, to selectively release one or more sugars
   (e.g., xylose). The biomass can then be treated to a second level to release one or more
  other sugars (e.g., glucose). Optionally the biomass can be dried between treatments. The
  treatments can include applying chemical and biochemical treatments to release the
                                             86

  sugars. For example, a biomass material can be treated to a level of less than about 20
  Mrad (e.g., less than about 15 Mrad, less than about 10 Mrad, less than about 5 Mrad, less
  than about 2 Mrad) and then treated with a solution of sulfuric acid, containing less than
  10% sulfuric acid (e.g., less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about 7%, less
  than about 6%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about
  2%, less than about 1%, less than about 0.75%, less than about 0.50 %, less than about
  0.25%) to release xylose. Xylose, for example, that is released into solution, can be
  separated from solids and optionally the solids washed with a solvent/solution (e.g., with
  water and/or acidified water). Optionally, the Solids can be dried, for example, in air
  and/or under vacuum optionally with heating (e.g., below about 150      0 C, below about 120
   SC)  to a water content below about 25 wt. % (below about 20 wt. %, below about 15
  wt.%, below about 10 wt.%, below about 5 wt.%). The solids can then be treated with a
  level of less than about 30 Mrad (e.g., less than about 25 Mrad, less than about 20 Mrad,
  less than about 15 Mrad, less than about 10 Mrad, less than about 5 Mrad, less than about
  1 Mrad or even not at all) and then treated with an enzyme (e.g., a cellulase) to release
  glucose. The glucose (e.g., glucose in solution) can be separated from the remaining
  solids. The solids can then be further processed, for example, utilized to make energy or
  other products (e.g., lignin derived products).
