                                              BACKGROUND
           This invention relates to adhering systems. More particularly, this invention relates to
   using such adhering systems in connecting materials.
           In the past, manufacturers and users of flexible magnetizable sheets have experienced
15 problems relating to delamination when exposed to heat (like in direct sunlight); yet it is often
   desirable to utilize flexible magnetized laminate sheets in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
           Additionally, manufacturers and users of flexible magnetizable sheets have experienced
   problems relating to adhesive buildup on blades used to cut flexible magnetizable sheets. Often
   the cutting blades become warm during the cutting process and the adhesive begins to foul the
20 cutting blades. Once the blades are fouled, the cutting process must be stopped and the blades
   cleaned; or the adhesive residue will begin to hinder cutting and transfer to the surface of the
   flexible magnetic sheets.
                            OBJECTS AND FEATURES OF THE INVENTION
           A primary object and feature of the present invention is to provide systems overcoming
25 the above-mentioned problems.
           It is a further object and feature of the present invention to provide such systems utilizing
   preferred adhesives and adhering systems.
           Another primary object and feature of the present invention is to provide such systems
   having resistance to heat-induced delamination.
30         A further object and feature of the present invention is to provide such systems having an
   adhesive left non-tacky after curing.
            It is yet another object and feature of the present invention to provide such systems
    which, when undergoing cutting procedures, prevent buildup of adhesive materials on cutting
   blades.

25 Upon reading the teachings of this specification, those of ordinary skill in the art will now
   appreciate that, under appropriate circumstances, considering such issues as cost, future
   technologies, etc., other materials providing additional functionality, such as, for example, cork,
   fabric, sandpaper, another magnetizable layer, paramagnetic materials, etc., may suffice
           Magnetizable sheet 101 (at least embodying herein at least one flexible magnetizable
30 laminate comprising at least two layers) is preferably formed into a roll or alternately preferably
   cut into specific sizes based on customer desire.

   for example, sandpaper layer connected to magnetizable layer; cork layer connected to
                                                     6

   magnetizable layer; wood layer connected to magnetizable layer; decorative print layer
   connected to magnetizable layer; wallpaper connected to magnetizable layer; two magnetizable
   layers connected to one another with magnetic poles in a "repulsive" orientation; two
   magnetizable layers connected to one another with magnetic poles in an "attractive" orientation;
 5 two magnetizable layers connected to one another with "opposite" indicia on opposing sides
   (e.g., On/Off; Open/Closed, Stop/Go, etc.), etc., may suffice.
            Adhesive layer 115 (at least embodying herein at least one adhesive structured and
   arranged to adhere said at least two layers together) preferably comprises adhesive 117 bonding
   magnetizable layer 110 with writeable layer 120. Adhesive 117 preferably comprises at least

20 peeling, delamination, etc.) without mechanical destruction. Further, applying normal heat of
   about 110 degrees Fahrenheit (about 43 degrees Celsius) preferably does not interfere with the
   bonding qualities of adhesive 117. Further, adhesive layer 115 preferably is non-tacky once
   bonded to magnetizable layer 110 and writeable layer 120. Adhesive 117 preferably is smoothly
   applied which provides for a quality print processing. Flexible magnetic sheet 101 preferably
25 has no observable bumps, ridges, or streaks in adhesive layer 115; so writeable layer 120 is

            Adhesive 117, when comprising polyurethane, is preferably durable, cross-link reacted,
   and cannot be reactivated after curing. The cross-linking is preferably non-reversible as occurs
   with a thennoset polymer. Additionally, adhesive 117 is preferably heat resistant to resist
30 delamination in high temperatures, while also preferably remaining flexible at low temperatures.

            An alternately preferred polyurethane adhesive is PURMELT@ R-246CLV made
   available by Henkel Corporation of Elgin, IL. PURMELT@ R-246CLV has a viscosity of about
25  18,000 centipoise at about 180 degrees Fahrenheit (about 82 degrees Celsius) and a humidity
   curing mechanism. PURMELT@ R-246CLV is a one-component polyurethane reactive hot melt
   adhesive. PURMELT@ R-246CLV cures through moisture to form a tough, strong, and virtually
   thennoset polymer. Unlike many thermoset polymers, a virtual thermoset polymer retains
   flexibility and has a melting point lower than the decomposition temperature, though higher that
30 before curing. Thus, Adhesive 117, comprising a virtual thermoset polymer, preferably bonds
   using cross-linking, preferably increasing the melting point, but preferably maintains flexibility
   and recyclability. Further, another alternately preferable adhesive is Supergrip 2000TM H0005
   03A by BostikTM companies, a solvent-free, one component, moisture curing urethane adhesive
   which, once dispensed will react with ambient moisture to yield a cross-linked virtual thermoset
35 adhesive.

   process 200 begins with the step of Obtaining Magnetizable Layer and Writeable Layer 310 (at
   least embodying herein obtaining at least two layers of flexible material), in which magnetizable
   layer 110 and writeable layer 120 are obtained preferably as rolls of material (magnetizable-layer
   roll 230 and writeable-layer roll 210). Upon reading the teachings of this specification, those
 5 skilled in the art will now appreciate that, under appropriate circumstances, considering such

   example, sandpaper layer connected to magnetizable layer; cork layer connected to magnetizable
   layer; wood layer connected to magnetizable layer; decorative print layer connected to
   magnetizable layer; wallpaper connected to magnetizable layer; two magnetizable layers
10 connected to one another with magnetic poles in a "repulsive" orientation; two magnetizable
   layers connected to one another with magnetic poles in an "attractive" orientation; two
   magnetizable layers connected to one another with "opposite" indicia on opposing sides (e.g.,

   technologies, etc., other coating devices, such as, for example, Meyer rod coaters, blade-gap
   coaters, reverse-roll coaters, air-knife coaters, etc., may suffice.
            Engraved roller-226, of coating machine 220, preferably collects adhesive from coating
   bath 222 and preferably applies adhesive 117 to writeable layer 120. Preferably, at least one
25 doctor blade 224 wipes off excess adhesive from engraved roller 226 prior to application to
   writeable 120. At least one pressure roller 228 applies pressure to assist adhesion of adhesive
    117 to writeable layer 120 from engraved roller 226. Coating machine 220 preferably coats
   adhesive 117 in a thin layer (adhesive layer 115) so that magnetizable layer 110 and writeable
   layer 120 will sandwich adhesive layer 115. Adhesive layer 115 preferably comprises a
30 thickness of about 0.6 mil to about 1.5 mil (about 1.5 micrometers to about 4 micrometers).

            Preferably the viscosity of adhesive 117 is kept at a pre-selected level, preferably to apply
   an even layer. PURMELT@ R-246C has a viscosity of about 13,000 centipoise at about 250
   degrees Fahrenheit (about 121 degrees Celsius). Under appropriate.circumstances, such as to
   achieve a thinner coat weight, the temperature applied to the adhesive may be increased to "thin"
 5 the coat weight. Preferably, coating machine 220 comprises a Gravure coater, as shown in FIG.
   2, alternately preferably a reverse Gravure coater, so that a consistent coat weight may be

   about 0.6 mil to about 1.5 mil (about 1.5 micrometers to about 4 micrometers).
15          After applying adhesive 117 forming adhesive layer 115, magnetizable layer 110 is
   preferably joined to writeable layer 120 with adhesive layer 115 between to form an adhesive
   bond, in step Join Layers 330. Adhesive layer 115 preferably is still viscous to promote
   complete bonding, during step Join Layers 330. The resulting bound and layered material
   (magnetizable sheet 101) preferably forms as all three layers (magnetizable layer 110, adhesive
20 layer 115 and writeable layer 120) are pressed together through pressure rollers 210.
   Magnetizable sheet 101 preferably is rolled into magnetizable sheet roll 240 ready for final
   curing. The steps of Apply Adhesive 320 and Join Layers 330 at least embody herein laminating
   such at least two layers of flexible material with at least one adhesive to form at least one flexible
   magnetizable laminate.
25          After joining the layers, magnetizable sheet 101 is preferably cured, in step Cure
   Adhesive 340 (at least embodying herein curing such at least one adhesive to form a virtual
   thennoset). Curing of adhesive preferably uses humidity. Curing time is preferably dependent
   on humidity. Preferably, a cure time of 24 hours is preferred in most ambient humidity
   conditions (about 28 percent to about 70 percent relative humidity). Increasing the humidity
30  level preferably decreases the time needed to cure the adhesive depending on the coat weight
    applied to the layers. Preferably, additional humidity may be preferably introduced by running
   the curing product though a humidified chamber, alternately preferably by misting the curing
   product, or alternately preferably curing the product in a humidity controlled room. Upon
    reading the teachings of this specification, those skilled in the art will now appreciate that, under
                                                      10

   appropriate circumstances, considering such issues as available materials, future technologies,
   costs, etc., other curing methods, such as, for example, electromagnetic radiation, temperature
   flux, vacuum, atmospheric adjustments, etc., may suffice.
            As PURMELT@ R-246C cures, it forns a virtually thermoset polymer. Applicant's
 5 testing has shown that the PURMELT@ R-246C does not lose its thermoset polymer qualities at
   about 110 degrees Fahrenheit, yet remains flexible.
            Applicant's subjected a sample of magnetizable sheet 101 with PURMELT@ R-246C
   and Exxon Mobile Indigo Printable BOPP 970 LT-447 to a "peel test", more specifically a 90
   degree peel at 12 inches/minute test (about 38 millimeter/minute). The peel test was performed
10 with a CHEMINSTRUMENTS Adhesion Release Tester Model No. AR-1 500. The adhesive
   coat weight was 0.001 inches. An inability to peel the magnetizable sheet from the Exxon
   Mobile Indigo Printable BOPP 970 LT-447 was observed.
             Further, Applicant subjected a sample of magnetizable sheet with Acucote P2000
   pressure sensitive adhesive made available by Acucote Inc. of Graham, North Carolina and
15 Exxon Mobile Indigo printable BOPP (70 LT-447) to the same above peel test. Adhesive failure
   (i.e., the adhesive was removed from the substrate cleanly) and adhesive transfer (i.e., the
   adhesive transferred from the face stock to the substrate) were both observed.
             In testing, Applicant has documented the lack of "build up" of adhesive 117 on a
   guillotine cutter blade. A blade test procedure was performed by cutting sheets having a
20 magnetizable layer, a layer of PURMELT@ R-246C, and a laminate layer into sheets sized about
    12 inches by about 18 inches. One hundred sheets were heated to about 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
   The 100 heated sheets were cut 110 times with a guillotine paper cutter (such as manufactured by
   POLAR). Photographs of the cutting blades were taken every 20 cuts. The photographs show
   no observable adhesive residue on the blade after making 110 cuts. On the other hand, Applicant
25 has observed that a pressure sensitive adhesive utilized in place of PURMELT@ R-246C
    subjected to the above test will typically observably gather on the knife blade and be transferred
   to the material being cut after 20 cuts. This property of magnetizable sheets 101 is important in
   that die cut blades become warm during use and pressure sensitive adhesives "gum"up or foul
   the blades. This arrangement at least herein embodies wherein said at least one adhesive is
30 resistant to transfer from said at least one flexible magnetizable laminate to the cutting blades
    during cutting of said at least one flexible magnetizable laminate; and this arrangement at least
    herein embodies wherein said at least one laminator is resistant to transfer from said at least one
    flexible magnetizable laminate to the cutting blades during cutting of said at least one flexible
    magnetizable laminate; and this arrangement at least herein embodies wherein said laminator
                                                      11

   means is resistant to transfer from said at least one flexible magnetizable laminate to the cutting
   blades during cutting of said at least one flexible magnetizable laminate.
            In summary, Applicant prefers utilization of adhesive 117, preferably comprising at least
   one hot-melt adhesive, preferably at least one reactive hot-melt adhesive, preferably at least one
 5 virtually-thermosetable hot-melt adhesive, preferably primarily polyurethane, preferably at least
   about 90% polyurethane, preferably at least about 95% polyurethane, preferably PURMELT@
   R-246C. Applicant further prefers adhesive 117 comprising polyurethane curable by humidity,
   preferably raising the overall melting point while preferably remaining flexible at room
   temperature. In addition, Applicant prefers adhesive 117 that, after being cured, will not
10 delaminate while exposed to direct sunlight or high temperature environments (above about 100
   degrees Fahrenheit or above about 38 degrees Celsius), during use (this arrangement at least
   herein embodying wherein said at least one flexible magnetizable laminate is resistant to
   delamination during use in direct sunlight). Further Applicant prefers adhesive 117 that, after
   being cured, is not tacky when exposed to normal cutting-machine operational temperatures
15 (about 110 degrees Fahrenheit or about 43 degrees Celsius), so as to transfer essentially no
   residue to cutting blades.
            Upon further testing, Applicant more preferably utilizes reverse Gravure coating having a
   96 by 96 quad pattern. Applicant found that bonds were considerably better with this pattern and
   technique. All tested substrates showed complete destructive bonding within 72 hours of
20 application.

   alternately preferred manufacturing process 201 of the preferred embodiment of FIG. 1. FIG. 5
   shows a diagrammatic view illustrating a preferred adhering stage 207 of alternately preferred
   manufacturing process 201 of the preferred embodiment of FIG. 1. FIG. 6 shows a flowchart
25 illustrating alternately preferred manufacturing process 201 of FIG. 4 and FIG. 5. An alternately
   preferred adhesive 117, comprising ethylene vinyl acetate, preferably comprises HOT MELT
   NO. C53-133 PLW by Cattie Adhesive Solutions of Quakertown, PA. HOT MELT NO. C53
    133 PLW is a synthetic resin, having a white amber color, viscosity of about 1400-1900
   centipoise at about 225 degrees Fahrenheit (about 107 degrees Celsius), viscosity of about 1100
30  1600 centipoise at about 250 degrees Fahrenheit (about 121 degrees Celsius), viscosity of about
   400-600 at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (about 150 degrees Celsius), a softening point (ring and ball)
   at 160 degrees Fahrenheit (about 71 degrees Celsius), a speed of set of medium/fast, and no
   noticeable adverse effects after 100 hours at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (about 177 degrees Celsius).
   HOT MELT NO. C53-133 PLW is a thermoplastic.
                                                      12

            In applying the HOT MELT NO. C53-133 PLW, manufacturing process 201was
   preferred. Manufacturing process 201 preferably comprises step Obtaining Magnetizable Layer
   and Writeable Layer 310 like manufacturing process 200. Manufacturing process 201 further
   comprises 2 stages, first, coating stage 205, as shown in FIG. 4, and second, adhering stage 207,
 5 as shown in FIG. 5.
            In coating stage 205, first, adhesive 117, comprising HOT MELT NO. C53-133 PLW, is
   applied to writeable layer 120, in step Apply Adhesive 320 (detailed above in manufacturing
   process 200). After applying adhesive 117 to form adhesive layer 115, adhesive layer 115 is
   allowed to cool, in step Cool Adhesive 325. Upon cooling, and thus inactivation of adhesive
10 properties of adhesive layer 115, the combined material of writeable layer 120 and adhesive
   layer 115 is then wound onto a core to fonn coated-material roll 250, as shown in FIG. 4,
   completing coating stage 205 of manufacturing process 201.
            A typical application temperature of HOT MELT NO. C53-133 PLW ranges between
   about 220 to about 300 degrees Fahrenheit (about 104 degrees Celsius to about 150 degrees
15 Celsius). Preferably, HOT MELT NO. C53-133 PLW is applied at about 250 degrees Fahrenheit
   preferably using a slot die coating technique, alternately preferably using a Gravure coater, as
   shown in FIG. 4. Upon reading the teachings of this specification, those skilled in the art will
   now appreciate that, under appropriate circumstances, considering such issues as cost, available
   materials, future technologies, etc., other coating devices, such as, for example, Meyer rod
20 coaters, blade-gap coaters, reverse-roll coaters, air-knife coaters, etc., may suffice.
            In adhering stage 207, coated material from coated-material roll 250 and magnetizable
   layer 110 are then subsequently run together over at least one heated roller 215 (to reactivate
   adhesive 117) to bond the writeable layer 120 (at least embodying herein at least one indicia
   accepter structured and arranged to accept indicia; and at least embodying herein indicia accepter
25 means for accepting indicia) to magnetizable layer 110 (at least embodying herein at least one
   magnetization accepter structured and arranged to accept magnetization; and at least embodying
   herein magnetization accepter means for accepting magnetization) with adhesive layer 115
   sandwiched between, in step Join Layers Adding Heat 335. After being thus joined,
   magnetizable sheet 101 forms. Magnetizable sheet 101 is preferably allowed to cool in step Cool
30 Adhesive 345. In manufacturing process 201, magnetizable sheet 101 is not cured further and
   adhesive 117 (at least embodying herein at least one laminator structured and arranged to
    laminate said at least one magnetization accepter and said at least one indicia accepter to form at
    least one flexible magnetizable laminate; and at least embodying herein laminator means for
    laminating said magnetization accepter means and said indicia accepter means to form at least
                                                       13

   one flexible magnetizable laminate) preferably stays as a thermoplastic, however adhesive 117,
   comprising HOT MELT NO. C53-133 PLW, has a high melting point so preferably prevents
   delamination except in temperatures unlikely to occur in normal use (above 220 degrees .
   Fahrenheit or about 104 degrees Celsius). After cooling, magnetizable sheet 101 is preferably
 5 rolled into magnetizable sheet roll 240.
            In summary, Applicant alternately prefers utilization of adhesive 117, preferably
   comprising at least one hot-melt adhesive, preferably at least one thermoplastic hot-melt
   adhesive, preferably primarily ethylene vinyl acetate, preferably HOT MELT NO. C53-133
   PLW. In this alternate preference, Applicant further prefers adhesive 117 comprising ethylene
10 vinyl acetate with a melting point of greater than 150 degrees Fahrenheit (about 65 degrees
   Celsius), while preferably remaining flexible at room temperature. In addition, in this alternate
   preference, Applicant prefers adhesive 117 that will not delaminate in direct sunlight or high
   temperature environments (above about 100 degrees Fahrenheit or about 38 degrees Celsius),
   during use. Further, in this alternate preference, Applicant prefers adhesive 117 that is not tacky
15 when exposed to normal cutting-machine operational temperatures (about 110 degrees
   Fahrenheit or about 43 degrees Celsius), so as to transfer essentially no residue to cutting blades.
