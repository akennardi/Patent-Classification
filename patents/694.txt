[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No.
61/362,635, filed July 8, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference
in its entirety for all purposes.
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002] The recombinant expression of therapeutic proteins in cell culture (particularly large
scale cell cultures), including eukaryotic cell culture, and more specifically mammalian cell
culture, requires the use of special culture media providing nutrient substances for efficient
growth of cells. Cell culture media formulations are often supplemented with a range of
additives, including fetal calf serum (FCS), animal derived proteins and/or protein hydrolysates
of bovine origin as well as protein hydrolysates derived from plants or yeast. One challenge with
such cultures is that the amount of protein and the total and specific activity of the protein
produced are often variable across different cell cultures, even when the formulation for the cell
culture media is not changed. This variability is especially apparent in the case of large-scale
manufacturing processes utilizing cell culture volumes of 10 liters to over 20,000 liters. Cell
culture media containing hydrolysates are particularly prone to variability from one cell culture
to the next, leading to decreased production of total protein as well as decreased total and
specific activity.
[0003] One potential reason for the variability seen across different cell cultures is that
contaminants in additives such as hydrolysates vary from one batch to the next. In general,
serum or serum-derived substances, such as, e.g., albumin, transferrin or insulin, may comprise
unwanted agents that can contaminate the cell cultures and the biological products obtained
thereof. Furthermore, human serum derived additives have to be tested for all known viruses,
                                                   1

    WO 2012/006594                                                            PCT/US2011/043459
including hepatitis viruses and HIV which can be transmitted via serum. Moreover, bovine
serum and products derived thereof bear the risk of BSE contamination. In addition, all serum
derived products can be contaminated by unknown substances. When using serum or protein
additives derived from human or animal sources in cell culture, there are numerous problems
(e.g., the varying quality in composition of different batches and the risk of contamination with
mycoplasma, viruses or BSE), particularly if the cells are used in the manufacture of drugs or
vaccines for human administration. Therefore, many attempts have been made to provide
efficient host systems and cultivation conditions, which do not require serum or other animal
protein compounds.
[0004] Such serum-free media have been developed on the basis of protein extracts derived from
plants or yeast. For example, soy hydrolysates are known to be useful for fermentation processes
and can enhance the growth of many fastidious organisms, yeasts and fungi. WO 96/26266
describes that papaic digests of soy meal are a source of carbohydrate and nitrogen and many of
the components can be used in tissue culture. Franek et al. (Biotechnology Progress (2000) 16,
688-692) describe growth and productivity promoting effects of defined soy and wheat
hydrolysate peptide fractions.
[0005] WO 96/15231 discloses a serum-free medium composed of a synthetic minimal essential
medium and a yeast extract for the propagation of vertebrate cells and a virus production process.
A medium formulation composed of a basal cell culture medium comprising a rice peptide and
an extract of yeast and an enzymatic digest thereof, and/or a plant lipid for growth of animal cells
is disclosed in WO 98/15614. A medium comprising purified soy hydrolysate for the cultivation
of recombinant cells is disclosed in WO 01/23527. WO 00/03000 discloses a medium that
comprises a soy hydrolysate and a yeast extract, but also requires the presence of recombinant
forms of animal proteins, such as growth factors.
[0006] EP-A-0 481 791 describes a biochemically defined culture medium for culturing
engineered CHO cells, which is free from protein, lipid and carbohydrate isolated from an animal
source, further comprising a recombinant insulin or insulin analogue, 1% to 0.025% w/v papain
digested soy peptone and putrescine. WO 98/08934 describes a serum-free eukaryotic cell
culture comprising hydrolyzed soy peptides (1-1000 mg/L), 0.01 to 1 mg/L putrescine and a
variety of animal-derived components, including albumin, fetuin, various hormones and other
                                                  2

    WO 2012/006594                                                             PCT/US2011/043459
proteins. In this context, it should be noted that putrescine is also known to be comprised in
standard media like DMEM/Ham's F12 in a concentration of 0.08 mg/L.
[0007] The plant and/or yeast hydrolysates, however, are undefined mixtures of oligopeptides
and other unknown components and contaminants. Moreover, the quality of commercially
available lots of hydrolysates varies extremely. As a result, there are large variations in the
production of recombinant proteins or viral products (a variation of up to a factor of three) as a
function of the lots of hydrolysates used ("lot-to-lot variation"). This drawback affects the
proliferation of the cells as well as the protein expression of each cell. US 2007/0212770
describes various animal protein-free and oligopeptide-free, chemically defined culture mediums
that are useful for the large-scale production of recombinant protein biopharmaceuticals.
[0008] Hemostasis involves the interaction of various hemostatic reaction routes finally leading
to thrombus formation. Thrombi are deposits of blood components on the surface of the vascular
wall that mainly consist of aggregated blood platelets and insoluble cross-linked fibrin. Fibrin
formation is the result of the restricted proteolysis of fibrinogen by thrombin, a coagulation
enzyme. Thrombin is the end product of the coagulation cascade, a succession of zymogen
activations occurring on the surfaces of activated blood platelets and leucocytes, and a variety of
vascular cells (for a survey, cf. K. G. Mann et al., Blood, 1990, Vol. 76, pp. 1-16).
[0009] An important function in the coagulation cascade resides in the activation of Factor X by
the complex of activated Factor IX (Factor IXa) and activated Factor VIII (Factor VIIIa). A
deficiency or a dysfunction of the components of this complex is associated with the blood
disease known as hemophilia (J. E. Sadler & E. W. Davie: Hemophilia A, Hemophilia B, and
von Willebrand's Disease, in G. Stamatoyannopoulos et al., (Eds.): The molecular basis of blood
diseases. W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, 1987, pp. 576-602). Hemophilia A is related to a
deficiency of Factor VIII activity, whereas Hemophilia B is related to a Factor IX deficiency.
Current treatment consists of a replacement therapy using pharmaceutical preparations
comprised of the normal coagulation factor. Of these thrombopathies, Hemophilia A occurs
more frequently, affecting approximately one out of 10,000 men. Replacement therapy in
Hemophilia A patients involves the repeated administration of preparations containing normal
Factor VIII by intravenous infusion. The interval between the infusions is a function of the
degradation of the Factor VIII activity in blood circulation. The half-life of the Factor VIII
                                                    3

    WO 2012/006594                                                             PCT/US2011/043459
activity after an infusion differs from one individual to another, ranging from 10 to 30 hours.
Thus, a prophylactic therapy requires an infusion every two to three days. This constitutes a
heavy load on the life of hemophilic patients, in particular, if the venous access has become
difficult due to local citratization following frequent needle punctures for intravenous infusions.
[0010] It would be particularly advantageous if the frequency of infusions could be lowered by
using Factor VIII having extended half-lives. It is well known in the art that the half-life of the
non-activated Factor VIII heterodimer strongly depends on the presence of von Willebrand
Factor, which exhibits a strong affinity to Factor VIII (yet not to Factor VIIIa) and serves as a
carrier protein (J. E. Sadler and E. W. Davie: Hemophilia A, Hemophilia B and von Willebrand's
disease, in G. Stamatoynnopoulos et al. (Eds.): The molecular basis of blood diseases. W.B.
Saunders Co., Philadelphia, 1987, pp. 576-602). It is known that patients suffering from von
Willebrand's disease type 3, who do not have a detectable von Willebrand Factor in their blood
circulation, also suffer from a secondary Factor VIII deficiency. In addition, the half-life of
intravenously administered Factor VIII in those patients is 2 to 4 hours, which is considerably
shorter than the 10 to 30 hours observed in Hemophilia A patients. From these findings results
that Factor VIII tends to a rapid clearance from the blood circulation and that this process is to
some extent inhibited by complexation with its natural carrier, von Willebrand Factor.
[0011] Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a glycoprotein circulating in plasma as a series of
multimers typically ranging in size from about 500 to 20,000 kD (or 2 to 40 dimers of vWF).
Dimers and multimeric forms of vWF are composed of 250 kD polypeptide subunits linked
together by disulfide bonds. vWF mediates the initial platelet adhesion to the sub-endothelium
of the damaged vessel wall; only the larger multimers also exhibiting hemostatic activity.
Multimerized VWF binds to the platelet surface glycoprotein Gplba, through an interaction in
the Al domain of VWF, in order to facilitate platelet adhesion. It is assumed that endothelial
cells secret large polymeric forms of vWF and that those forms of vWF which have a low
molecular weight (low molecular weight vWF) have arisen from proteolytic cleavage. The
multimers having large molecular masses are stored in the Weibel-Palade bodies of the
endothelial cells and liberated upon stimulation.
[0012] Reduction of FVIII binding activity, due to either reduced vWF protein levels or lowered
FVIII binding affinity, results in one of three types of von Willebrand's Disease. In addition to,
                                                   4

    WO 2012/006594                                                              PCT/US2011/043459
or alternatively, certain types of von Willebrand's disease are characterized by an increase or
decrease in the level of Gplba-mediated platelet association, namely in Types 2A, 2B, and 2M
(summarized in Castaman et al., Disorders of Hemostasis 88(1):94-108 (2003)). As such, the
modulation of vWF interactions with both FVIII and Gplba is a viable strategy for the treatment
of both Haemophilia and von Willebrand's Disease.
[0013] Given the biological importance of vWF, there is a constant need in the art to improve
ways for producing vWF for therapeutic applications. It is well known that vWF can be isolated
from endogenous sources, such as human blood plasma. The isolated vWF is advantageous in
that it has a high specific activity for carrying out its biological function and can, therefore, be
used effectively as a therapeutic protein for treating related diseases, such as von Willebrand's
disease. Typically, plasma vWF has a specific Ristocetin activity of about 100 mU/pg, but
isolation from human blood plasma has disadvantages because, for example, the plasma can
contain a variety of viruses, such as HIV and/or hepatitis viruses, which can be transferred to the
patient. Furthermore, plasma is a limited resource and, thus, shortages of plasma can be
problematic in providing enough vWF for treatment. As such, recombinant methods for
producing vWF are advantageous in addressing some of the problems associated with relying on
plasma as a source for vWF. For recombinant production, the full length of cDNA of vWF was
cloned; the propolypeptide corresponds to amino acid residues 23 to 764 of the full length
prepro-vWF (Eikenboom et al (1995) Haemophilia 1, 77 90).
[0014] Unfortunately, vWF is a molecule with complex post-translational modifications. Also,
the multimerization of the vWF dimers to large and ultralarge multimers in the Golgi apparatus
is a challenge for expression in mammalian cells. For example, high molecular weight vWF
expressed in cell culture of, e.g., human (primary) endothelial cells depends on the specific
storage of ultralarge vWF molecules in Weibel-Palade bodies. Such cell cultures are not suitable
for the production of therapeutic proteins. Other cell culture methods have been reported, and it
is known that cell culture conditions can affect the production of vWF in a variety of ways. For
instance, high concentrations of ammonium (NH 4 ) have been shown to disturb posttranslational
modifications. Mayadas et al. (J. Biol. Chem., 264(23):13497-13503, 1989) demonstrated that
levels of 25 mM ammonium resulted in reduced vWF multimerization in endothethial cells,
which also negatively affects the specific Ristocetin activity of recombinant vWF. Reduction of
                                                    5

    WO 2012/006594                                                            PCT/US2011/043459
multimerization is generally associated in reduction of activity, particularly specific Ristocetin
activity, of recombinant vWF.
[0015] It still remains difficult to predict which parameters can positively or negatively affect
production of a particular protein, especially complex glycoproteins like Factor VIII and vWF.
For example, certain components of a cell culture medium have been shown to affect production
of Factor VIII. As disclosed in US Patent No. 5,804,420, the addition of polyol, copper, and
other trace metals can positively affect production yield of Factor VIII. As also described in WO
2009/086309, cell culture processes using copper in have been shown to improve production of
Factor VIII. Expression of vWF in recombinant CHO cells has also been reported by Mignot et
al. (1989). However, none of these examples provide information regarding the specific activity
of vWF or its multimeric distribution.
[0016] The ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type I motifs)
proteins are a family of metalloproteinases containing a number of conserved domains, including
a zinc-dependant catalytic domain, a cystein-rich domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and at least
one, and in most cases multiple, thrombospondin type I repeats (for review, see Nicholson et al.,
BMC Evol Biol. 2005 Feb 4;5(1): 11). These proteins, which are evolutionarily related to the
ADAM and MMP families of metalloproteinases (Jones GC, Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2006
Feb;7(1):25-3 1), are secreted enzymes that have been linked to a number of diseases and
conditions including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (Moake JL, Semin Hematol.
2004 Jan;41(1):4-14), connective tissue disorders, cancers, inflammation (Nicholson et al.), and
severe plasmodium falciparum malaria (Larkin et al., PLoS Pathog. 2009 Mar;5(3):e1000349).
Because of these associations, the ADAMTS enzymes have been recognized as potential
therapeutic targets for a number of pathologies (Jones GC, Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2006
Feb;7(1):25-3 1). Accordingly, methods of producing large yields of ADAMTS proteins having
high specific activities, which are free of contaminants such as viruses, BSE, and pathogens like
Mycoplasma bacteria, are needed.
[0017] One ADAMTS family member, ADAMTS 13, cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF)
between residues Tyr 1605 and Met 1606, a function responsible for the degradation of large
vWF multimers in vivo. Loss of ADAMTS 13 activity has been linked to a number of conditions,
such as TTP (Moake JL, Semin Hematol. 2004 Jan;41(1):4-14), acute and chronic inflammation
                                                   6

    WO 2012/006594                                                            PCT/US2011/043459
(Chauhan et al., J Exp Med. 2008 Sep 1;205(9):2065-74), and most recently, severe plasmodium
falciparum malaria (Larkin et al., PLoS Pathog. 2009 Mar;5(3):e1000349).
[0018] The ADAMTS13 protease is a 190 kDa glycosylated protein produced predominantly by
the liver (Levy et al., Nature. 2001; 413:488-494; Fujikawa et al., Blood. 2001; 98:1662-1666;
Zheng et al., J Biol Chem. 2001; 276:41059-41063; Soejima et al., J Biochem (Tokyo). 2001;
130:475-480; and Gerritsen et al., Blood. 2001; 98:1654-1661). Much like the higher order
rVWF multimers, recombinant expression of the large ADAMTS 13 in mammalian cell culture
presents many challenges.
[0019] Therefore, there is a need to provide cell culture conditions, particularly large-scale
manufacturing culture conditions, that provide consistent total protein yield and/or consistent
total and specific activity of the proteins produced between different cell cultures. Consistency
among cultures in large-scale manufacturing processes is of importance in the manufacture of
therapeutic proteins. There is also a need for cell culture conditions for large-scale production
of rVWF with a multimeric distribution and specific Ristocetin activity comparable or higher
than VWF as it is present in normal human plasma. Similarly, as ADAMTS proteins have been
implicated in a number of diseases and conditions, there is a need in the art for methods of large
scale production of recombinant ADAMTS proteins having high specific activities, which are
suitable for pharmaceutical formulation and administration. The present invention satisfies these
and other needs in the art for the production of recombinant Von Willebrand Factor and
recombinant ADAMTS 13.

                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION
        I.       Introduction
[0093] Recombinant vWF (rVWF) and recombinant ADAMTS13 (rA13) can be produced by
expression in large-scale mammalian cell cultures. However, the activity of these proteins when
produced using standard cell culture conditions often varies across cell cultures, even when the
general formulations of the media are not changed, and the specific activities of the recombinant
proteins are often not equal to that of vWF and rA13 derived from blood plasma. In addition,
rVWF expressed in mammalian cell cultures tends to produce protein compositions with low
(under 10%) percentages of higher order multimers (higher order multimers include molecules
containing more than 10 VWF dimers). These drawbacks in standard production methods of
rVWF and rA13 are particularly problematic when developing cultures for large scale production
(i.e., from 10 to over 20,000 liter cultures).
                                                 16

    WO 2012/006594                                                             PCT/US2011/043459
[0094] One potential source of the variability often seen in different cell culture batches is the
presence of contaminants in components of the cell culture media. These contaminants may be
present in different amounts in different batches, leading to variable results in the production of
rVWF and rA13. After investigating the different contaminants found in various cell culture
media additives, the present inventors found that the presence of hydrolysates leads to variation
in copper concentrations in the cell media. Further investigation provided the surprising result
that supplementing copper concentrations in cell media to produce a total copper concentration
of at least about 1 gg/L to about 20 gg/L consistently increased the total and specific activity of
rVWF and rAl3 and/or could also lead to increased total protein yield. Thus, the present
invention provides methods and compositions for high yield production of rVWF and rA13
proteins with high specific activity.
[0095] In one aspect, the present invention provides cell culture methods and compositions for
producing large quantities of rVWF and rAl 3 with activity that is comparable to or higher than
that seen with plasma derived vWF (pdVWF) or plasma derived ADAMTS13 (pdA13). In
further aspects, the rVWF and rA13 proteins produced in accordance with the present invention
show consistently higher activity than proteins produced using standard cell culture methods in
media that has not been supplemented with copper or other supplements described in further
detail herein. Advantageously, in certain embodiments of the methods and compositions
provided herein, the rVWF and rA13 proteins produced in accordance with the present invention
show consistently higher specific activity (i.e., U/mg protein) than proteins produced using
standard cell culture methods in media that has not been supplemented with copper or other
supplements described in further detail herein. Likewise, the methods provided herein for the
production of rVWF and rA13 provide higher yields of activity per volume culture (i.e., U/L/D),
as compared to standard cell culture methods utilizing media that has not been supplemented
with copper or other supplements described in further detail herein.
[0096] In a further aspect, the present invention provides cell culture methods in which a basal
cell culture medium is supplemented with copper to result in a total concentration of at least
about 1 gg/L. In other embodiments, the basal cell culture medium is supplemented with copper
to result in a total concentration of at least about 2 gg/L. In yet other embodiments, the basal cell
culture medium is supplemented with copper to result in a total concentration of at least about 1

     WO 2012/006594                                                                  PCT/US2011/043459
pg/L to about 20 pg/L. In some embodiments, the total concentration of copper is from about
1.5 - 4.5 pg/L. In certain embodiments, the cell culture medium is supplemented to result in
about 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 3, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6, 3.8, 4, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5.0, 5.5,
6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 pg/L copper, or
more. Basal cell culture media generally have a trace copper concentration of under 1 pg/L.
[0097] In some embodiments, the present invention provides cell culture methods in which a
basal cell culture medium is supplemented with from about 1.0 to about 20 pg/L copper for
production of rVWF. In further embodiments, the basal cell culture medium is supplemented
with from about 1.5-15, 2.0-10, 2.5-8, 3.0-6, 4.0 -5.0 pg/L copper for production of rVWF. In
still further embodiments, the basal cell culture medium may, in addition to the supplemented
copper, also include one or more hydrolysates.
[0098] In other embodiments, the present invention provides cell culture methods in which a
basal cell culture medium is supplemented with from about 1.5 to about 4 pg/L copper for
production of rA13. In further embodiments, the basal cell culture medium is supplemented with
from about 1.6 - 3.8, 1.7 - 3.6, 1.8 - 3.4, 1.9 - 3.2, 2.0 - 3.0, 2.1 - 2.8, 2.2 - 2.6, 2.3 - 2.4 pg/L
copper for production of rA13. In still further embodiments, the basal cell culture medium may,
in addition to the supplemented copper, also include one or more hydrolysates. In yet further
embodiments, the basal cell culture medium includes, in addition to copper and/or one or more
hydrolysates, about 1.0 to about 30 pM zinc. In still further embodiments, the basal cell culture
medium further includes, in addition to copper and/or one or more hydrolysates and/or zinc,
between about 0.5 to about 5.0 mM calcium.
[0099] In a still further aspect and in accordance with any of the above, the present invention
provides cell culture methods in which the ammonium levels of the cell culture solution are low
(under 10 mM). In certain embodiments, cell culture methods of the present invention utilize
cell culture media having over 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 pg/L copper in combination with low levels of
ammonium.
[0100] One of the advantages of the methods and compositions of the present invention is that
they are amenable to large scale cell culture production. These large scale cell cultures are at
least 10 L, 50 L, 100 L, 150 L, 200 L, 250 L, 500 L, 750 L, 1,000 L, 1,500 L, 2,000 L, 5,000 L,
10,000 L, or 20,000 liter cultures.

    WO 2012/006594                                                                PCT/US2011/043459
[0101] In certain aspects, the methods of the invention do not necessarily result in a higher
amount of recombinant protein overall, but the recombinant protein (either rVWF or rAl 3) that
is produced shows higher total and specific activity than is seen in proteins produced using
standard cell cultures, particularly as compared to proteins produced in cell cultures in which the
cell culture medium has not been supplemented with additional copper. In further aspects, the
rVWF and rA13 proteins produced in cells cultured in copper supplemented media show
consistently increased activity per liter of cell culture as compared to cells cultured in basal cell
culture media that has not been supplemented with copper. In still further aspects, the copper
supplemented media of the present invention result in increased protein yield, increased number
of cells in the culture, and/or increased total activity per liter of culture as compared to media
that has not been supplemented with copper.
[0102] Still further advantages of methods and compositions of the invention is that they result a
population of proteins containing a high percentage (over 10%) of highly multimerized rVWF.
[0103] Although much of the discussion herein regarding ADAMTS proteins is in terms of
ADAMTS13 (A13), it will be appreciated that because all ADAMTS proteins share a common
core domain architecture and common structure-function relationships, the methods and
compositions described herein are applicable for production of any ADAMTS proteins, not only
rA13.
      II.        Definitions
[0104] As used herein, "recombinant vWF" includes vWF obtained via recombinant DNA
technology. In certain embodiments, vWF proteins of the invention can comprise a construct,
for example, prepared as in WO 1986/06096 published on Oct. 23, 1986 and U.S. patent
application Ser. No. 07/559,509, filed on Jul. 23, 1990, in the name of Ginsburg et al., which is
incorporated herein by reference with respect to the methods of producing recombinant vWF.
The vWF in the present invention can include all potential forms, including the monomeric and
multimeric forms. It should also be understood that the present invention encompasses different
forms of vWF to be used in combination. For example, the vWF of the present invention may
include different multimers, different derivatives and both biologically active derivatives and
derivatives not biologically active.

[0105] The term "recombinant" when used with reference, e.g., to a cell, or nucleic acid, protein,
or vector, indicates that the cell, nucleic acid, protein or vector, has been modified by the
introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or protein or the alteration of a native nucleic acid or
protein, or that the cell is derived from a cell so modified. Thus, for example, recombinant cells
express genes that are not found within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or express
native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed, under expressed or not expressed at all.
[0106] In the context of the present invention, the recombinant vWF embraces any member of
the vWF family from, for example, a mammal such as a primate, human, monkey, rabbit, pig,
rodent, mouse, rat, hamster, gerbil, canine, feline, and biologically active derivatives thereof. In
a preferred embodiment, the recombinant VWF is human VWF. Mutant and variant vWF
proteins having activity are also embraced, as are functional fragments and fusion proteins of the
vWF proteins. Furthermore, the vWF of the invention may further comprise tags that facilitate
purification, detection, or both. The vWF described herein may further be modified with a
therapeutic moiety or a moiety suitable imaging in vitro or in vivo.
[0107] The terms "highly multimeric vWF," "high molecular weight vWF," and "HMW VWF"
may be used interchangeably and refer to covalently attached vWF multimers containing more
than 10 VWF dimers. In certain embodiments, HMW VWF contains at least 11 VWF dimers, or
at least 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, or more VWF dimers.
[0108] As used herein, an "ADAMTS protein" refers to a polypeptide of the disintegrin and
metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type I motifs family of metalloproteinases. Members of
this family include the human proteins ADAMTS1 (NM_006988), ADAMTS2 (NM_014244;
NM_021599), ADAMTS3 (NM_014243), ADAMTS4 (NM_005099), ADAMTS5

70%, 80%, 90%, or more of the activity demonstrated by the full-length protein, in particular the
protease activity demonstrated by the full length protein. In certain instances, an ADAMTS
protein will be post-translationally modified either in vivo or in vitro, for example, by enzymatic
or chemical means. It is understood that the ADAMTS proteins of the present invention include
alternatively spliced isoforms, conservatively modified proteins, substantially identical proteins,
homologues, and the like.
[0109] In the context of the present invention, an ADAMTS protein embraces any member of
the ADAMTS family from, for example, a mammal such as a primate, human, monkey, rabbit,
pig, rodent, mouse, rat, hamster, gerbil, canine, feline, and biologically active derivatives thereof.
Mutant and variant ADAMTS proteins having activity are also embraced, as are functional
fragments and fusion proteins of the ADAMTS proteins. Furthermore, the ADAMTS proteins of
the invention may further comprise tags that facilitate purification, detection, or both. The
ADAMTS proteins described herein may further be modified with a therapeutic moiety or a
moiety suitable imaging in vitro or in vivo.
[0110] As used herein, an "ADAMTS13 protein" refers to any protein or polypeptide with
ADAMTS 13 activity, particularly the ability to cleave the peptide bond between residues Tyr
842 and Met-843 of VWF. In an exemplary embodiment, an ADAMTS13 protein refers to a
polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that is highly similar to that of NP_620594
(ADAMTS13 isoform 1, preproprotein) or amino acids 75 to 1427 of NP_620594 (ADAMTS13
isoform 1, mature polypeptide). In another embodiment, an ADAMTS 13 protein refers to a
polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that is highly similar to that of NP_620596
(ADAMTS13 isoform 2, preproprotein) or amino acids 75 to 1371 of NP_620594 (ADAMTS13
isoform 2, mature polypeptide). In yet another embodiment, ADAMTS13 proteins include
polypeptides comprising an amino acid sequence highly similar to that of NP_620595
(ADAMTS13 isoform 3, preproprotein) or amino acids 75 to 1340 of NP_620595 (ADAMTS13
isoform 1, mature polypeptide). As used herein, an ADAMTS 13 protein includes natural
variants with vWF cleaving activity and artificial constructs with vWF cleaving activity. As
used in the present invention, ADAMTS 13 encompasses any natural variants, alternative
sequences, isoforms or mutant proteins that retain some basal activity. Examples of
ADAMTS13 mutations found in the human population include, without limitation, R7W, V88M,

which have been found associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).
ADAMTS 13 proteins also includes polypeptides containing post-translational modifications.
For example, ADAMTS 13 has been shown to be modified by N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) at
residues 614, 667, and 1354, and it has been predicted that residues 142, 146, 552, 579, 707, 828,
and 1235 may also be modified in this fashion.
[0111] Proteolytically active recombinant ADAMTS13 may be prepared by expression in
mammalian cell cultures, as described in Plaimauer et al., (2002, Blood. 15;100(10):3626-32)
and US 2005/0266528, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their
entireties for all purposes. Methods for the expression of recombinant ADAMTS 13 in cell
culture are disclosed in Plaimauer B, Scheiflinger F. (Semin Hematol. 2004 Jan;41(1):24-33 and
US 2011/0086413, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their
entireties for all purposes.
[0112] As used herein, the term "biologically active derivative", when used in the context of an
ADAMTS protein, also embraces polypeptides obtained via recombinant DNA technology. This
may include any method known in the art for (i) the production of recombinant DNA by genetic
engineering, e.g., via reverse transcription of RNA and/or amplification of DNA, (ii) introducing
recombinant DNA into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells by transfection, i.e., via electroporation or
microinjection, (iii) cultivating said transformed cells, e.g., in a continuous or batch-wise
manner, (iv) expressing an ADAMTS protein, e.g., constitutively or upon induction, and (v)
isolating said ADAMTS protein, e.g., from the culture medium or by harvesting the transformed
cells, in order to (vi) obtain substantially purified recombinant ADAMTS protein, e.g., via ion
exchange chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, affinity chromatography,
hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and the like. The term "biologically active derivative"
includes also chimeric molecules such as e.g. an ADAMTS protein, or functional fragment
thereof, in combination with a second polypeptide, e.g., an immunoglobulin Fc domain or an
albumin domain, in order to improve the biological/pharmacological properties such as e.g., half
life of the ADAMTS protein in the circulation system of a mammal, particularly a human.
                                                    22

    WO 2012/006594                                                             PCT/US2011/043459
[0113] The terms "isolated," "purified," or "biologically pure" refer to material that is
substantially or essentially free from components that normally accompany it as found in its
native state. Purity and homogeneity are typically determined using analytical chemistry
techniques such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high performance liquid
chromatography. In one embodiment, rVWF is the predominant species present in a preparation
is substantially purified. In another embodiment, rA13 is the predominant species present in a
preparation is substantially purified. The term "purified" in some embodiments denotes that a
nucleic acid or protein gives rise to essentially one band in an electrophoretic gel. In other
embodiments, it means that the nucleic acid or protein is at least 50% pure, more preferably at
least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more pure.
"Purify" or "purification" in other embodiments means removing at least one contaminant from
the composition to be purified. In this sense, purification does not require that the purified
compound be homogenous, e.g., 100% pure.
[0114] The biological activity of vWF can be measured by known in vitro assays. For example,
the Ristocetin Cofactor assay is based on the agglutination of fresh or formalin-fixed platelets
induced by the antibiotic ristocetin in the presence of vWF. The degree of platelet agglutination
depends on the vWF concentration and can be measured by the turbidimetric method, e.g. by use
of an aggregometer (Weiss et al., J. Clin. Invest. 52: 2708-2716, 1973; Macfarlane et al.,
Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 34: 306-308, 1975). As provided herein, the specific Ristocetin
Cofactor activity of the vWF of the present invention is described in terms of mU/pig of vWF, as
measured using in vitro assays.
[0115] As used herein, "one unit of ADAMTS activity" is defined as the amount of activity in 1
mL of pooled normal human plasma, regardless of the assay being used. For example, when the
ADAMTS protein is ADAMTS 13, one unit of ADAMTS13 FRETS-VWF73 activity is the
amount of activity needed to cleave the same amount of FRETS-VWF73 substrate (Kokame et
al., Br J Haematol. 2005 Apr; 129(1):93-100) as is cleaved by one mL of pooled normal human
plasma. Conveniently, ADAMTS 13 activity may be determined by functional assays, such as
functional assays employing modified von Willebrand factor peptides as substrate for
ADAMTS13 (Tripodi et al. J Thromb Haemost. 2008 Sep;6(9): 1534-41). A preferred method
of determining recombinant human ADAMTS 13 activity is disclosed in Gerritsen et al. (Assay
                                                   23

of von Willebrand factor (vWF)-cleaving protease based on decreased collagen binding affinity
of degraded vWF: a tool for the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).
Thromb Haemost 1999; 82: 1386- 1389). In one embodiment, to be considered as a
ADAMTS 13 protein as defined above, a polypeptide or protein must have at least 1% of the
vWF cleaving activity of native ADAMTS 13. In other embodiments, an ADAMTS 13 protein
will contain at least 10% of the activity of native ADAMTS13. In yet other embodiments, an
                                                               3 0 %, 40%,
ADAMTS13 protein will contain at least 5%, 10%, 20%,                       50%, 60%, 7 0%, 80%,
90%, or 100% of the activity of native ADAMTS13. The quantity of an ADAMTS13 protein
may also be determined by measurement of an ADAMTS 13 antigen, for example using the
ELISA method disclosed in Rieger et al., (2006, Thromb Haemost. 2006 95(2):212- 20). A well
established convention in the art is that 1 mL of pooled normal human plasma contains 1 pag of
ADAMTS13. Thus, the convention in the art is that 1 ptg of plasma-derived ADAMTS13 has
one unit of ADAMTS13 activity.
[0116] The terms "cell culture solution," "cell culture medium or media," and "cell culture
supernatant" refer to aspects of cell culture processes generally well known in the art. In the
context of the present invention, a cell culture solution can include cell culture media and cell
culture supernatant. The cell culture media are externally added to the cell culture solution,
optionally together with supplements, to provide nutrients and other components for culturing
cells expressing rVWF or rA13. The cell culture supernatant refers to a cell culture solution
comprising the nutrients and other components from the cell culture medium as well as products
released, metabolized, and/or excreted from the cells during culture, but not the cells themselves.
Thus in one context, a cell culture supernatant can refer to the liquid phase of a cell culture
solution (i.e., the cell culture solution excluding the cells). For example, the ammonium
concentration of a culture supernatant generally refers to the ammonium concentration present in
the cell culture solution. In other contexts, a cell culture supernatant refers to a cell culture
solution from which the cells have been removed (i.e., a recovered cell culture supernatant).
[0117] As used herein, the terms "vitamin B3," "nicotinamide," "niacinamide," "niacin," and
"nicotinic acid" may be used interchangeably to refer to any member of the B3 family of
vitamins. Accordingly, any member of this family may be used to supplement medium used in
the methods of the present invention.

[0118] As used herein, the term "chemically defined medium" or "chemically defined media"
refers to a synthetic growth medium in which the identity and concentration of all the
components are known. Chemically defined mediums do not contain bacterial, yeast, animal, or
plant extracts, although they may or may not include individual plant or animal-derived
components (e.g., proteins, polypeptides, etc.). Non-limiting examples of commercially
available chemically defined mediums include, various Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's (DME)
mediums (Sigma-Aldrich Co; SAFC Biosciences, Inc), Ham's Nutrient Mixture (Sigma-Aldrich
Co; SAFC Biosciences, Inc), combinations thereof, and the like. Methods of preparing
chemically defined culture mediums are known in the art, for example in U.S. Patent Numbers
6,171,825 and 6,936,441, WO 2007/077217, and U.S. Patent Application Publication Numbers
2008/0009040 and 2007/0212770, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference
in their entireties for all purposes.
[0119] As used herein, the term "oligopeptide-free culture medium" or "oligopeptide-free
culture media" refers to a protein-free medium that does not comprise oligopeptides, such as,
e.g., oligopeptides derived from a protein hydrolysate. In one embodiment, the medium does not
comprise oligopeptides having twenty or more amino acids. In one embodiment of the present
invention, the medium does not comprise oligopeptides having fifteen or more amino acids. In
another embodiment of the invention, the medium does not comprise oligopeptides having ten or
more amino acids. In one embodiment the medium does not comprise oligopeptides having
seven or more amino acids. In another embodiment the medium does not comprise oligopeptides
having five or more amino acids. In still another embodiment the medium does not comprise
oligopeptides having three or more amino acids. According to a further embodiment of the
present invention, the medium does not comprise oligopeptides having two or more amino acids.
Methods of preparing oligopeptide-free culture medium are known in the art, for example in U.S.
Patent Numbers 6,171,825 and 6,936,441, WO 2007/077217, and U.S. Patent Application

incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for all purposes.
[0120] As used herein, the term "serum-free culture medium" or "serum-free culture media"
refers to a culture medium that is not supplemented with an animal serum. Although oftentimes
serum-free mediums are chemically defined mediums, serum-free mediums may be

2008/0009040 and 2007/0212770, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference
in their entireties for all purposes.
[0121] As used herein, the term "animal protein-free culture medium" or "animal protein-free
culture media" refers to a culture medium that is not supplemented with an animal serum,
protein, or protein fraction. Although oftentimes animal protein-free culture mediums are
chemically defined mediums, animal protein-free culture mediums may contain plant or yeast
hydrolysates. Methods of preparing animal protein-free culture medium are known in the art, for
example in U.S. Patent Numbers 6,171,825 and 6,936,441, WO 2007/077217, and U.S. Patent

to a chemically defined culture medium, an oligopeptide-free culture medium, a serum-free
culture medium, or an animal protein-free culture medium that has not been supplemented with a
hydrolysate, e.g., a plant or yeast hydrolysate. basal mediums are well known in the art, e.g.,
DMEM, Ham's F12, DMEM/Ham's F12, Medium 199, McCoy, or RPMI. The basal medium
can include a number of ingredients, including amino acids, vitamins, organic and inorganic
salts, and sources of carbohydrate. Each ingredient can be present in an amount that supports the
cultivation of a cell, such amounts being generally known to a person skilled in the art. The
medium can include auxiliary substances, such as buffer substances, e.g., sodium bicarbonate,
antioxidants, stabilizers to counteract mechanical stress, or protease inhibitors. If necessary, a
non-ionic surfactant such as copolymers and/or mixtures of polyethylene glycols and
polypropylene glycols can be added.
     III.        Cell Culture Media and Cell Culture Supernatant
[0123] One aspect of the present invention relates to cell culture media for producing rVWF
and/or rA13 that have increased activity as compared to rVWF and rA13 produced with basal
cell culture media. In one aspect, the present invention relates to cell culture media for
producing rVWF and/or rA13 in which basal cell culture media is supplemented with one or
                                                  26

    WO 2012/006594                                                            PCT/US2011/043459
more additional substances. In specific embodiments and as is discussed in further detail below,
cell culture conditions of the present invention include basal cell culture media supplemented to
have at least 1.0 gg/L copper. In further embodiments, cell culture media of use and
supernatants derived from the processes in the present invention also comprise low levels (under
10 mM) of ammonium. In a particular embodiment, the cell culture conditions used for
expressing rVWF and/or rA13 are controlled such that the cell culture supernatant maintains a
low level of ammonium, i.e., less than 10 mM and preferably less than 5 mM.
[0124] The culture media of the present invention can be based on a suitable basal medium well
known in the art, e.g., DMEM, Ham's F12, DMEM/Ham's F12, Medium 199, McCoy, or RPMI.
The basal medium can include a number of ingredients, including amino acids, vitamins, organic
and inorganic salts, and sources of carbohydrate. Each ingredient can be present in an amount
that supports the cultivation of a cell, such amounts being generally known to a person skilled in
the art. The medium can include auxiliary substances, such as buffer substances, e.g., sodium
bicarbonate, antioxidants, stabilizers to counteract mechanical stress, or protease inhibitors. If
necessary, a non-ionic surfactant such as copolymers and/or mixtures of polyethylene glycols
and polypropylene glycols can be added.
[0125] Generally, basal media contain less than 1 gg/L of copper -- for example, DMEM/Ham's
F12 has a copper concentration of about 0.3 pg/L. Such concentrations of copper do not provide
enough copper ions to support production of rVWF and rA13 proteins of the present invention,
which show high specific activity.
[0126] Copper can be provided to cell culture media of the present invention through a variety of
ways, such as through addition of a medium supplement. In some embodiments, the medium
supplement can contain hydrolysate, which can be provided to increase the copper concentration
in the media. Hydrolysates can include any hydrolysate well known in the art, such as plant
hydrolysates, soy hydrolysates, and wheat gluten hydrolysate. In certain embodiments, addition
of hydrolysate can contribute an increased copper concentration of about 0.2 to about 10 pg/L of
Cu2. In some embodiments, the amount of copper provided by the hydrolysate can depend on
the amount of copper in the hydrolysate as well as the amount of hydrolysate added. The copper
content of a hydrolysate can be determined by elemental analysis, e.g., atom adsorption
                                                  27

spectroscopy (GFAA: graphite furnace atomic adsorption), or mass spectroscopy methods (e.g.,
ICP-MS).
[0127] In certain embodiments, copper can be provided to the culture media alone or in addition
to hydrolysate by providing a medium supplement including a suitable copper salt or copper
chelate. Suitable copper salts can include but are not limited to copper sulfate, copper acetate,
copper carbonate, copper chloride, copper hydroxide, copper nitrate, and copper oxide. Suitable
copper chelators can include but are not limited to albumin, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA), polyamine chelating agents, ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine,
triethylenediamine, tetraethylenepentamine, aminoethylethanolamine, aminoethylpiperazine,

[0128] In certain embodiments, basal cell culture media is supplemented with copper to result in
a total copper concentration of about 1.0 to about 20 gg/L. In a specific embodiment, the basal
cell media is supplemented with copper to a final concentration of between about 1.0 to about 10
gg/L. In further embodiments, the basal cell culture media is supplemented to result in a final
copper concentration of about 1.0 - 5.0, 1.2 - 4.0, 1.3 - 3.0, 1.4 - 2.9, 1.5 - 2.8, 1.6 - 2.7, 1.7 - 2.6,
1.8 - 2.5, 1.9 - 2.4, 2.0 - 2.3, 2.1 - 2.2 gg/L copper. In further embodiments, the basal cell culture

and 2 - 4 gg/L copper. In yet other embodiments, the basal cell culture media used in methods of
the present invention are supplemented to result in about 1-6, 2-5, 3-4 gg/L copper. In one
embodiment, the basal cell culture media is supplemented with copper to result in a total copper
concentration of at least 1 gg/L. In another embodiment, the basal cell culture media is
supplemented with copper to result in a total copper concentration of at least 2 gg/L. In yet
another embodiment, the basal cell culture media is supplemented with copper to result in a total
copper concentration of at least 4 gg/L. In certain embodiments, the basal cell culture media is

copper, e.g., a copper chelator, is used, the amount of derivative or chelator is added such that
the final concentration of the copper is in the ranges described herein. For example, 2 pg/L of
CuSO 4-5H 2 0 is equivalent to a copper concentration of about 0.51 pg/L (without sulfate and
5H 20).
[0130] Advantageously, it has been found that the use of cell culture medium in cell culture
processes resulting in low ammonium (NH4m ) concentrations in the cell culture solution (i.e., in
the culture supernatant) results in the expression of recombinant VWF and/or rA13 with higher
specific activities. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the NH 4 concentration of the
supernatant is no higher than 10 mM. In a preferred embodiment, the NH 4 concentration of the
supernatant is no higher than 5 mM. In a preferred embodiment, the NH 4 concentration of the
supernatant is no higher than 4 mM. In yet other embodiments, the NH 4 concentration of the
supernatant is no higher than 10 mM, 9 mM, 8 mM, 7 mM, 6 mM, 5 mM, 4 mM, 3 mM, 2 mM,
1 mM, or less.
[0131] Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the methods and compositions provided herein rely
on the use of basal cell culture media supplemented with copper (e.g., to a final concentration of
at least 2 gg/L) used in a process that results in an NH m  4 concentration of no higher than 10 mM
in the supernatant. In yet other embodiments, the basal cell culture medium is supplemented to
provide a final copper and ammonium concentration according to any one of variations 1 to 440,
as provided in Table 1.

[0132] In some embodiments, the copper supplemented media of the present invention are
produced by supplementing basal media that is animal protein-free and/or chemically defined.
Methods of preparing animal protein-free and chemically defined culture mediums are known in
the art, for example in U.S. Patent Numbers 6,171,825 and 6,936,441, WO 2007/077217, and
U.S. Patent Application Publication Numbers 2008/0009040 and 2007/0212770, the disclosures
of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for all purposes. In one
embodiment, the basal culture medium used in the methods described herein is animal protein
free or oligopeptide-free medium. In certain embodiments, the culture medium may be
chemically defined. In certain embodiments, the culture media may contain at least one
polyamine at a concentration of about 0.5 mg/L to about 10 mg/L.

     IV.         Methods for the Production of Blood Factors Having High Specific Activity
            A. Cell Cultivation Methods
[0160] The present invention provides methods for large-scale production of recombinant
proteins (such as rVWF and rA13). In certain embodiments, such large-scale production
methods utilize stirred/agitated tank reactors for manufacture of these therapeutic recombinant
proteins.
[0161] In certain embodiments, the methods of the present invention can comprise the use of a
cell culture system operated under a batch or continuous mode of operation. For example, when
batch cell cultures are utilized, they may be operated under single batch, fed-batch, or repeated
batch mode. Likewise, continuous cell cultures may be operated under, for example, perfusion,
turbidostat or chemostat mode. Batch and continuous cell cultivation may be performed under
either suspension or adherence conditions. When operated under suspension conditions, the cells
will be freely suspended and mixed within the culture medium. Alternatively, under adherence
                                                  47

    WO 2012/006594                                                               PCT/US2011/043459
conditions, the cells will be bound to a solid phase, for example, a microcarrier, a porous
microcarrier, disk carrier, ceramic cartridge, hollow fiber, flat sheet, gel matrix, and the like.
[0162] A batch culture is typically a large scale cell culture in which a cell inoculum is cultured
to a maximum density in a tank or fermenter, and harvested and processed as a single batch. A
fed-batch culture it typically a batch culture which is supplied with either fresh nutrients (e.g.,
growth-limiting substrates) or additives (e.g., precursors to products). The feed solution is
usually highly concentrated to avoid dilution of the bioreactor. In a repeated-batch culture, the
cells are placed in a culture medium and grown to a desired cell density. To avoid the onset of a
decline phase and cell death, the culture is then diluted with complete growth medium before the
cells reach their maximum concentration. The amount and frequency of dilution varies widely
and depends on the growth characteristics of the cell line and convenience of the culture process.
The process can be repeated as many times as required and, unless cells and medium are
discarded at subculture, the volume of culture will increase stepwise as each dilution is made.
The increasing volume may be handled by having a reactor of sufficient size to allow dilutions
within the vessel or by dividing the diluted culture into several vessels. The rationale of this type
of culture is to maintain the cells in an exponentially growing state. Serial subculture is
characterized in that the volume of culture is always increasing stepwise, there can be multiple
harvests, the cells continue to grow and the process can continue for as long as desired. In
certain embodiments, a recombinant ADAMTS protein (e.g., rADAMTS 13) may be recovered
after harvesting the supernatant of a batch culture. In other embodiments, a recombinant VWF
may be recovered after harvesting the supernatant of a batch culture.
[0163] A continuous culture can be a suspension culture that is continuously supplied with
nutrients by the inflow of fresh medium, wherein the culture volume is usually kept constant by
the concomitant removal of spent medium. In chemostat and turbidostat methods, the extracted
medium contains cells. Thus, the cells remaining in the cell culture vessel must grow to maintain
a steady state. In the chemostat method, the growth rate is typically controlled by controlling the
dilution rate, i.e., the rate at which fresh medium is added. The growth rate of the cells in the
culture may be controlled, for example, at a sub-maximal growth rate, by alteration of the
dilution rate. In contrast, in the turbidostat method, the dilution rate is set to permit the
maximum growth rate that the cells can achieve at the given operating conditions, such as pH
                                                   48

    WO 2012/006594                                                             PCT/US2011/043459
and temperature. In certain embodiments, the rVWF or rAl3 is recovered after harvesting the
supernatant of a continuous culture. An exemplary method for continuous cell cultivation is
described in WO/2011/012725 (Grillberger et al.), the content of which is hereby incorporated
by reference in its entirety for all purposes.
[0164] In a perfusion culture, the extracted medium is depleted of cells, which are retained in the
culture vessel, for example, by filtration or by centrifugal methods that lead to the reintroduction
of the cells into the culture. However, typically membranes used for filtration do not retain
100% of cells, and so a proportion is removed when the medium is extracted. It may not be
crucial to operate perfusion cultures at very high growth rates, as the majority of the cells are
retained in the culture vessel. In certain embodiments, the rVWF or rA13 is recovered after
harvesting the supernatant of a perfusion culture.
[0165] Stirred-tank reactor system can be used for batch and continuous cell cultures operated
under suspension or adherent modes. Generally, the stirred-tank reactor system can be operated
as any conventional stirred-tank reactor with any type of agitator such as a Rushton, hydrofoil,
pitched blade, or marine.
[0166] In certain embodiments, the cell-culture methods of the invention may comprise the use
of a microcarrier. In some embodiments, the cell-cultures of the embodiments can be performed
in large bioreactors under conditions suitable for providing high volume-specific culture surface
areas to achieve high cell densities and protein expression. One means for providing such
growth conditions is to use microcarriers for cell-culture in stirred tank bioreactors. The concept
of cell-growth on microcarriers was first described by van Wezel (van Wezel, A.L., Nature
216:64-5 (1967)) and allows for cell attachment on the surface of small solid particles suspended
in the growth medium. These methods provide for high surface-to-volume ratios and thus allow
for efficient nutrient utilization. Furthermore, for expression of secreted proteins in eukaryotic
cell lines, the increased surface-to-volume ratio allows for higher levels of secretion and thus
higher protein yields in the supernatant of the culture. Finally, these methods allow for the easy
scale-up of eukaryotic expression cultures.
[0167] The cells expressing vWF and/or rA13 can be bound to a spherical or a porous
microcarrier during cell culture growth. The microcarrier can be a microcarrier selected from the
group of microcarriers based on dextran, collagen, plastic, gelatine and cellulose and others as
                                                  49

    WO 2012/006594                                                                PCT/US2011/043459
described in Butler (1988. In: Spier & Griffiths, Animal Cell Biotechnology 3:283-303). It is
also possible to grow the cells to a biomass on spherical microcarriers and subculture the cells
when they have reached final fermenter biomass and prior to production of the expressed protein
on a porous microcarrier or vice versa. Suitable spherical microcarriers can include smooth
surface microcarriers, such as CytodexTM 1, CytodexTM 2, and CytodexTM 3 (GE Healthcare) and
macroporous microcarriers such as CytoporeTM 1, CytoporeTM 2, CytolineTM 1, and CytolineTM 2
(GE Healthcare).
[0168] As described above, the present invention includes cell culture media having an increased
copper concentration. It is understood that all of the embodiments and concentrations described
in the "Cell Culture Media" section above can be applied to the methods of the present invention
described herein.
[0169] In certain embodiments, the culture can be maintained for at least about 7 days, or at least
about 14 days, 21 days, 28 days, or at least about 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 9 weeks,
or at least about 2 months, or 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 months or
longer. The cell density at which a cell-culture is maintained at for production of a recombinant
vWF or recombinant rA13 protein will depend upon the culture-conditions and medium used for
protein expression. One of skill in the art will readily be able to determine the optimal cell
density for a cell-culture producing rVWF or rAl3. In one embodiment, the culture is
maintained at a cell density of between about 0.5x10 6 and 4x10 7 cells/mL for an extended period
of time. In other embodiments, the cell density is maintained at a concentration of between about
1.0x10 6 and about 1.0x10 7 cells/mL for an extended period of time. In other embodiments, the
cell density is maintained at a concentration of between about 1.0x10 6 and about 4.0x10 6
cells/mL for an extended period of time. In other embodiments, the cell density is maintained at
a concentration of between about 1.0x10 6 and about 4.0x10 6 cells/mL for an extended period of
time. In yet other embodiments, the cell density may be maintained at a concentration between
about 2.0x10 6 and about 4.0x10 6 cells/mL, or between about 1.0x10 6 and about 2.5x10 6
cells/mL, or between about 1.5x10 6 and about 3.5x 106 cells/mL, or any other similar range, for
an extended period of time.

[0200] Recombinant vWF can be produced by expression in a suitable eukaryotic host system.
Examples of eukaryotic cells include, without limitation, mammalian cells, such as CHO, COS,
HEK 293, BHK, SK-Hep, and HepG2; insect cells, e.g., SF9 cells, SF21 cells, S2 cells, and High
Five cells; and yeast cells, e.g., Saccharomyces or Schizosaccharomyces cells. In one
embodiment, the vWF can be expressed in yeast cells, insect cells, avian cells, mammalian cells,
and the like. For example, in a human cell line, a hamster cell line, or a murine cell line. In one
particular embodiment, the cell line is a CHO, BHK, or HEK cell line. Typically, mammalian
cells, e.g., CHO cells from a continuous cell line, can be used to express the vWF of the present
invention.
[0201] In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence comprising a sequence coding for
vWF can be a vector. The vector can be delivered by a virus or can be a plasmid. The nucleic
acid sequence coding for the protein can be a specific gene or a biologically functional part
thereof. In one embodiment, the protein is at least a biologically active part of vWF.
[0202] A wide variety of vectors can be used for the expression of the vWF and can be selected
from eukaryotic expression vectors. Examples of vectors for eukaryotic expression include: (i)
for expression in yeast, vectors such as pAO, pPIC, pYES, pMET, using promoters such as
AOX1, GAP, GALl, AUGI, etc; (ii) for expression in insect cells, vectors such as pMT, pAc5,
pIB, pMIB, pBAC, etc., using promoters such as PH, p10, MT, Ac5, OpIE2, gp64, polh, etc., and
(iii) for expression in mammalian cells, vectors such as pSVL, pCMV, pRc/RSV, pcDNA3,
pBPV, etc., and vectors derived from viral systems such as vaccinia virus, adeno-associated
viruses, herpes viruses, retroviruses, etc., using promoters such as CMV, SV40, EF-1, UbC,
RSV, ADV, BPV, and P-actin. An exemplary vector for expressing rVWF is described by
Kaufman et al. (Mol Cell Biol. 1989 Mar;9(3):1233-42), the content of which is hereby
incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

    WO 2012/006594                                                           PCT/US2011/043459
[0203] In some embodiments of the present invention, the nucleic acid sequence further
comprises other sequences suitable for a controlled expression of a protein such as promoter
sequences, enhancers, TATA boxes, transcription initiation sites, polylinkers, restriction sites,
poly-A-sequences, protein processing sequences, selection markers, and the like which are
generally known to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
[0204] In addition to cell culture media comprising an increased copper concentration, the cell
culture conditions of the present invention can include an ammonium concentration of less than
about 25 mM throughout an entire upstream process in culture systems. In one embodiment, the
cell culture conditions include an ammonium concentration of less than about 25 mM, in another
embodiment less than about 20 mM, in yet another embodiment less than about 15 mM, in yet
another embodiment less than about 10 mM, and in a further embodiment less than about 5 mM.
[0205] In some embodiments, the ammonium concentrations of the present invention are kept
constant throughout the entire upstream process of the cell culture system. The cells used
according to the present invention can be cultivated, e.g., by methods that are modified as
compared to conventional batch-cultivation and feed-batch-cultivation, each of which are
generally known in the field. However, such conventional techniques can produce high
concentrations of ammonium at the end of the culture. The methods of the present invention
overcome this problem by employing production systems that can provide a continuous supply
of culture media through techniques such as, e.g., perfusion or chemostat cultures. Following
culture of the host cells, the vWF can be recovered from the spent medium using standard
methodologies, such as ultrafiltration or centrifugation. If desired, the vWF can be purified by,
e.g., ion exchange and/or size exclusion chromatography and the like.
[0206] A continuous culture (e.g., a perfusion or chemostat culture) can be a suspension culture
that is continuously supplied with nutrients by the inflow of fresh medium, wherein the culture
volume is usually constant. Similarly, continuous fermentation can refer to a process in which
cells or micro-organisms are maintained in culture in the exponential growth phase by the
continuous addition of fresh medium that is exactly balanced by the removal of cell suspension
from the bioreactor. Furthermore, a stirred-tank reactor system can be used for suspension,
perfusion, chemostatic, and/or microcarrier cultures. Generally, the stirred-tank reactor system
                                                  65

can be operated as any conventional stirred-tank reactor with any type of agitator such as a
Rushton, hydrofoil, pitched blade, or marine.

[0221] Recombinant ADAMTS proteins can be produced by expression in any suitable
prokaryotic or eukaryotic host system. Examples of eukaryotic cells include, without limitation,
mammalian cells, such as CHO, COS, HEK 293, BHK, SK-Hep, and HepG2; insect cells, for
example SF9 cells, SF21 cells, S2 cells, and High Five cells; and yeast cells, for example
Saccharomyces or Schizosaccharomyces cells. In one embodiment, the ADAMTS proteins can
be expressed in bacterial cells, yeast cells, insect cells, avian cells, mammalian cells, and the like.
For example, in a human cell line, a hamster cell line, or a murine cell line. In one particular
embodiment, the cell line is a CHO, BHK, or HEK cell line. In a preferred embodiment, the cell
line is a CHO cell line. In a specific embodiment, CHO clones capable of stably expressing
rA13 are prepared by co-transfecting a CHO cell with coding sequences for rA13 and a
dihydrofolate reductase (e.g., a murine dhfr gene) and selecting for growth in the presence of
increasing levels of methotrexate.
[0222] In one embodiment, the cells may be any mammalian cell that can be cultured, preferably
in a manufacturing process (i.e., at least 10 liter, preferrably at least 100 liters), to produce a
desired ADAMTS protein such as ADAMTS 13. Examples include the monkey kidney CVI line
transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651 ); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293
cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., J. Gen Virol., 36:59 (1977));
baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR, such as

the DUKX-B1 1 subclone (CHO, Uriaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77:4216
(1980)); mouse Sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, Biol. Reprod, 23:243-251 (1980)); monkey kidney
cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587);
human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC
CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC
CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC
CCL51 ); TRI cells (Mather et al., Annals N. Y. Acad. Sci., 383:44-68 (1982)); MRC 5 cells; FS4
cells; and the human hepatoma line (Hep G2). Preferably, the cell line is a rodent cell line,
especially a hamster cell line such as CHO or BHK.
[0223] A wide variety of vectors can be used for the expression of an ADAMTS protein (e.g.,
ADAMTS 13) and can be selected from eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression vectors. In certain
embodiments, a plasmid vector is contemplated for use in expressing an ADAMTS protein (e.g.,
ADAMTS 13). In general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are
derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The
vector can carry a replication site, as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing
phenotypic selection in transformed cells. The plasmid will comprise a nucleotide sequence
encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) operable linked to one or more control
sequences, for example, a promoter.
[0224] A preferred method of preparing stable CHO cell clones expressing a recombinant
ADAMTS protein is as follows. A DHFR deficient CHO cell line DUKX-B1 1 is transfected
with a DHFR expression vector to allow for expression of the relevant recombinant protein. An
exemplary method is described by Plaimauer et al. (Blood. 2002 Nov 15;100(10):3626-32. Epub
2002 Jul 12), the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all
purposes. Selection is carried out by growth in Hypoxanthine/Thymidine (HT) free media and
amplification of the relevant region coding for expression of the recombinant ADAMTS protein
and DHFR gene is achieved by propagation of the cells in increasing concentrations of
methotrexate. Where appropriate, CHO cell lines may be adapted for growth in serum and/or
protein free medium, essentially as described in US 6,100,061 (Reiter et al., lmmuno
Aktiengesellschaft).

    WO 2012/006594                                                              PCT/US2011/043459
[0225] In another preferred embodiment, stable HEK293 cells are prepared by transfecting with
a construct containing a hygromycin selectable marker and selecting transformants by antibiotic
resistance.
[0226] The ability of certain viruses to infect cells or enter cells via receptor-mediated
endocytosis, and to integrate into host cell genome and express viral genes stably and efficiently
have made them attractive candidates for the transfer of foreign nucleic acids into cells (e.g.,
mammalian cells). Accordingly, in certain embodiments, a viral vector is used to introduce a
nucleotide sequence encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) into a host cell for
expression. The viral vector will comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding an ADAMTS protein
(e.g., ADAMTS 13) operable linked to one or more control sequences, for example, a promoter.
Alternatively, the viral vector may not contain a control sequence and will instead rely on a
control sequence within the host cell to drive expression of the ADAMTS protein. Non-limiting
examples of virus vectors that may be used to deliver a nucleic acid include Adenoviral vectors,
AAV vectors, and Retroviral vectors.
[0227] In one embodiment, an Adenovirus expression vector include those constructs containing
adenovirus sequences sufficient to support packaging of the construct and to ultimately express
an ADAMTS construct that has been cloned therein. Adenoviral vectors allow for the
introduction of foreign sequences up to 7 kb (Grunhaus et al., Seminar in Virology, 200(2):535
546, 1992)).
[0228] In another embodiment, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) can be used to introduce a
nucleotide sequence encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) into a host cell for
expression. AAV systems have been described previously and are generally well known in the
art (Kelleher and Vos, Biotechniques, 17(6):1110-7, 1994; Cotten et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA,
89(13):6094-6098, 1992; Curiel, Nat Immun, 13(2-3):141-64, 1994; Muzyczka, Curr Top
MicrobiolImmunol, 158:97-129, 1992). Details concerning the generation and use of rAAV
vectors are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,139,941 and 4,797,368, each
incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for all purposes.
[0229] In one embodiment, a retroviral expression vector can be used to introduce a nucleotide
sequence encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) into a host cell for expression.
These systems have been described previously and are generally well known in the art (Mann et
                                                  77

1988; Temin, In: Gene Transfer, Kucherlapati (ed.), New York: Plenum Press, pp. 149-188,
1986). In a specific embodiment, the retroviral vector is a lentiviral vector (see, for example,
Naldini et al., Science, 272(5259):263-267, 1996; Zufferey et al., Nat Biotechnol, 15(9):871-875,

[0230] Non-limiting examples of vectors for prokaryotic expression include plasmids such as
pRSET, pET, pBAD, etc., wherein the promoters used in prokaryotic expression vectors include
lac, trc, trp, recA, araBAD, etc. Examples of vectors for eukaryotic expression include: (i) for
expression in yeast, vectors such as pAO, pPIC, pYES, pMET, using promoters such as AOX1,
GAP, GALl, AUGI, etc; (ii) for expression in insect cells, vectors such as pMT, pAc5, pIB,
pMIB, pBAC, etc., using promoters such as PH, p10, MT, Ac5, OpIE2, gp64, polh, etc., and (iii)
for expression in mammalian cells, vectors such as pSVL, pCMV, pRc/RSV, pcDNA3, pBPV,
etc., and vectors derived form viral systems such as vaccinia virus, adeno-associated viruses,
herpes viruses, retroviruses, etc., using promoters such as CMV, SV40, EF-1, UbC, RSV, ADV,
BPV, and $-actin. An exemplary vector for expressing rAl 3 is described by Plaimauer et al.
(Blood. 2002 Nov 15;100(10):3626-32. Epub 2002 Jul 12), the content of which is hereby

[0231] In certain embodiments, the cell-culture methods of the invention may comprise the use
of a microcarrier. The present invention provides, among other aspect, methods of large-scale
ADAMTS protein expression. In some embodiments, the cell-cultures of the embodiments can
be performed in large bioreactors under conditions suitable for providing high volume-specific
culture surface areas to achieve high cell densities and protein expression. One means for
providing such growth conditions is to use microcarriers for cell-culture in stirred tank
bioreactors. In another embodiment, these growth requirements are met via the use of a
suspension cell culture.

[0232] Recombinant vWF can be expressed in mammalian cells, but the specific activity of the
vWF can vary widely depending on the cell culture conditions and has not been shown to be
comparable or equal to that of vWF isolated from blood plasma. The present invention is based
in-part on the surprising result that cell culture media having at least 2.4 pg/L of copper provides
an advantageous effect of promoting expression of high molecular weight vWF having a high
specific activity. In particular, the high molecular weight, recombinant vWF of the present
invention can include a highly multimeric form comprising about 14 to about 22 dimers and a
specific Ristocetin activity of at least about 30 mU/pg. The cell culture processes according to
the present invention also allow for maintaining low NH 4+ levels (e.g., less than 10 mM) during
the upstream process in cell culture systems, thereby reducing deleterious effects to post
translational modifications. It is believed that the present invention provides for the first time
cell culture conditions comprising a medium having a suitable copper concentration in

             B. Recombinant ADAMTS13 (rA13)
[0277] The ADAMTS proteins (i.e., ADAMTS-1 to ADAMTS-20) are a family of secreted zinc
metalloproteinases that share a common modular domain organization (for review, see, Flannery
C.R., Front Biosci. 2006 Jan 1; 11:544-69). All of the ADAMTS protein share a common core
domain architecture, consisting of a signal peptide, followed by a prodomain, a zinc-dependent
metalloproteinase catalytic domain, a disintegrin-like domain, a thrombospondin type I repeat, a
cysteine-rich domain, and a spacer domain (Apte S.S., J Biol Chem. 2009 Nov
13;284(46):31493-7). Additionally, all but ADAMTS-4 contain at least one more
thrombospondin type I repeat domain, and many of the ADAMTS protein contain one or more
additional ancillary domains. Notably, it has been reported that all ADAMTS protein appear to
contain at least one calcium binding site and at least one zinc binding site located within the
metalloproteinase catalytic domain (Andreini et al., J. ProteomeRes., 2005, 4 (3), pp 881-888).
[0278] Biological roles for ADAMTS proteins have been reported for various diseases and
conditions, including, Antiangiogenesis, Renal interstitial fibrosis, Bone remodeling, Ovarian
folliculogenesis, Atherosclerosis, Urogenital development, and Tumor growth/remodeling
(ADAMTS-1); Ehler-Danlos syndrome type 7C and Bovine dermatopraxis (ADAMTS-2);
Arthritis, Atherosclerosis, and Tendinopathy (ADAMTS-4); Arthritis and Glioblastoma
(ADAMTS-5); Arthritis (ADAMTS-7); Antiangiogenesis, Brain malignancy, Arthritis, and

     V.         Formulations
[0293] In one aspect, the formulations comprising the recombinant therapeutic proteins rVWF or
rA13 of the present invention are lyophilized prior to administration. Lyophilization is carried
out using techniques common in the art and should be optimized for the composition being
developed [Tang et al., Pharm Res. 21:191-200, (2004) and Chang et al., Pharm Res. 13:243-9
(1996)].
                                                   89

    WO 2012/006594                                                               PCT/US2011/043459
[0294] Methods of preparing pharmaceutical formulations can include one or more of the
following steps: adding a stabilizing agent as described herein to said mixture prior to
lyophilizing, adding at least one agent selected from a bulking agent, an osmolarity regulating
agent, and a surfactant, each of which as described herein, to said mixture prior to lyophilization.
A lyophilized formulation is, in one aspect, at least comprised of one or more of a buffer, a
bulking agent, and a stabilizer. In this aspect, the utility of a surfactant is evaluated and selected
in cases where aggregation during the lyophilization step or during reconstitution becomes an
issue. An appropriate buffering agent is included to maintain the formulation within stable zones
of pH during lyophilization.
[0295] The standard reconstitution practice for lyophilized material is to add back a volume of
pure water or sterile water for injection (WFI) (typically equivalent to the volume removed
during lyophilization), although dilute solutions of antibacterial agents are sometimes used in the
production of pharmaceuticals for parenteral administration [Chen, Drug Development and
Industrial Pharmacy, 18:1311-1354 (1992)]. Accordingly, methods are provided for preparation
of reconstituted recombinant VWF compositions comprising the step of adding a diluent to a
lyophilized recombinant VWF composition of the invention.
[0296] The lyophilized material may be reconstituted as an aqueous solution. A variety of
aqueous carriers, e.g., sterile water for injection, water with preservatives for multi dose use, or
water with appropriate amounts of surfactants (for example, an aqueous suspension that contains
the active compound in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous
suspensions). In various aspects, such excipients are suspending agents, for example and without
limitation, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,
sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting
agents are a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example and without limitation, lecithin, or
condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example and without limitation,
polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic
alcohols, for example and without limitation, heptadecaethyl-eneoxycetanol, or condensation
products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as
polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial
esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example and without limitation,

    WO 2012/006594                                                              PCT/US2011/043459
polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. In various aspects, the aqueous suspensions also contain one
or more preservatives, for example and without limitation, ethyl, or n-propyl, p
hydroxybenzoate.
[0297] To administer compositions to human or test animals, in one aspect, the compositions
comprises one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The phrases "pharmaceutically" or
"pharmacologically" acceptable refer to molecular entities and compositions that are stable,
inhibit protein degradation such as aggregation and cleavage products, and in addition do not
produce allergic, or other adverse reactions when administered using routes well-known in the
art, as described below. "Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers" include any and all clinically
useful solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and
absorption delaying agents and the like, including those agents disclosed above.
[0298] The pharmaceutical formulations are administered intravenously, orally, topically,
transdermally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, vaginally, rectally, or by intracranial injection.
The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular,
intracisternal injection, or infusion techniques. Administration by intravenous, intradermal,
intramusclar, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, retrobulbar, intrapulmonary injection
and or surgical implantation at a particular site is contemplated as well. Generally, compositions
are essentially free of pyrogens, as well as other impurities that could be harmful to the recipient.
[0299] Single or multiple administrations of the compositions are carried out with the dose levels
and pattern being selected by the treating physician. For the prevention or treatment of disease,
the appropriate dosage depends on the type of disease to be treated, the severity and course of the
disease, whether drug is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy,
the patient's clinical history and response to the drug, and the discretion of the attending
physician.
[0300] In one aspect, formulations of the invention are administered by an initial bolus followed
by a continuous infusion to maintain therapeutic circulating levels of drug product. As another
example, the inventive compound is administered as a one-time dose. Those of ordinary skill in
the art will readily optimize effective dosages and administration regimens as determined by
good medical practice and the clinical condition of the individual patient. The frequency of
dosing depends on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the agents and the route of administration.

    WO 2012/006594                                                               PCT/US2011/043459
The optimal pharmaceutical formulation is determined by one skilled in the art depending upon
the route of administration and desired dosage. See for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical
Sciences, 18th Ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. 18042) pages 1435-1712, the
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Such formulations influence the
physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the administered
agents. Depending on the route of administration, a suitable dose is calculated according to body
weight, body surface area or organ size. Appropriate dosages may be ascertained through use of
established assays for determining blood level dosages in conjunction with appropriate dose
response data. The final dosage regimen is determined by the attending physician, considering
various factors which modify the action of drugs, e.g. the drug's specific activity, the severity of
the damage and the responsiveness of the patient, the age, condition, body weight, sex and diet of
the patient, the severity of any infection, time of administration and other clinical factors. By
way of example, a typical dose of a recombinant vWF of the present invention is approximately
50 U/kg, equal to 500 pg/kg. As studies are conducted, further information will emerge
regarding the appropriate dosage levels and duration of treatment for various diseases and
conditions.
    VII.         Methods of treatment
[0301] The present invention further contemplates methods of treating a patient in need of rVWF
or rA13 produced according to the methods described herein. Such methods of treatment can
include administration of pharmaceutical formulations comprising the recombinant rA13 or the
high molecular weight, recombinant vWF of the present invention.
[0302] In another aspect, the present invention provides methods for therapeutic or prophylactic
treatments comprising the administration of an rVWF or rAl 3 composition provided herein.
Generally, for therapeutic applications, formulations are administered to a subject with a disease
or condition associated with ADAMTS 13 or VWF dysfunction or otherwise in need thereof, in a
"therapeutically effective dose." Formulations and amounts effective for these uses will depend
upon the severity of the disease or condition and the general state of the patient's health. Single
or multiple administrations of the formulations may be administered depending on the dosage
and frequency as required and tolerated by the patient.

    WO 2012/006594                                                           PCT/US2011/043459
[0303] In one embodiment, the present invention provides methods of treating or preventing a
disease or condition associated with an ADAMTS 13 or VWF dysfunction. In a further
embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulations comprising recombinant vWF can be administered
to treat diseases related to vWF, such as von Willebrand's disease or hemophilia. In another
embodiment, the invention provides methods of treating or preventing a disease or condition
associated with the formation and/or presence of one or more thrombus, comprising the
administration of a rAl 3 composition provided herein. In another embodiment, the invention
provides methods of disintegrating one or more thrombus in a subject in need thereof. In yet
other embodiments, the invention provides methods of treating or preventing an infarction in
subject in need thereof. Generally, the methods provided by the invention comprise
administering an rADAMTS13 composition as provided herein to a subject in need thereof.
[0304] Non-limiting examples of disorders associated with the formation and/or the presence of
one or more thrombus are hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), acquired
TTP, arterial thrombosis, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, sepsis, and disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).
[0305] Non-limiting examples of disorders associated with an infarction, include without
limitation, myocardial infarction (heart attack), pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular events
such as stroke, peripheral artery occlusive disease (such as gangrene), antiphospholipid
syndrome, sepsis, giant-cell arteritis (GCA), hernia, and volvulus.
  VIII.         Examples
[0306] The present invention will now be further illustrated in the following examples, without
being limited thereto.
         Example 1
[0307] Continuous cell culture experiments were performed using cultures of a recombinant
CHO cell line expressing vWF. The basal medium was DMEM/F 12, which contained about 0.3
pg/L of Cu>. The medium was supplemented with soy hydrolysate and copper sulfate
                                                  93

    WO 2012/006594                                                           PCT/US2011/043459
(CuSO 4-5H 20) to bring the final copper concentration in the medium to greater than at least 2.4
ptg/L.
[0308] Recombinant CHO cells expressing vWF were cultivated by continuous cell cultures so
that the ammonium levels (NH 4+) were kept at a concentration less than about 10 mM. It was
found that production systems providing a continuous supply of medium (e.g., perfusion or
chemostat cultures) were preferable because conventional batch or fed batch techniques
produced high NH 4+ concentrations at the end of the culture. At the end of the culture, the highly
multimeric vWF was isolated and the specific Ristocetin Cofactor activity of the vWF was
measured.
         Example 2
[0309] Recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII) and Von Willebrand Factor (rVWF) were co-expressed
in batch cultures of GD8/6 cells to determine the effect of the composition of the culture medium
on VWF expression and activity. Briefly, GD8/6 cells were batch cultivated in BAV-SP medium
composed of a modified DMEM/F12 basal powder (Table 5) and additional supplements also
containing 4 g/L of soy hydrolysate, see Table 6, with and without additional copper
supplementation. To test the effect of low copper concentraions on rVWF expression and
activity, basal BAV-SP media was used. The basal media contained 0.3 pg/L copper and was
supplemented with soy hydrolysate, which contributed an additional 0.7 pg/L copper, as
determined experimentally, providing a final copper concentration of 1.0 pg/L. As a
comparision, the BAV-SP media used for the batch cultures was further supplemented with an
additional 3.3 pg/L of Cu2 +, providing a final copper concentration of 4.3 pg/L, to determine the
effect high copper concentrations on VWF expression and activity.

[0310] GD8/6 cells expressing rVWF were grown in either low copper media (Table 7) or high
copper media (Table 8) for 7 days. After 2 days the cultures were subcultured to perform a
batch culture for a period of 5 days. Samples of the culture supernatant were tested daily for
rVWF content (vWF ELISA), total (Ristocetin) and specific (Specific Activity) via a ristocetin
cofactor assay. Various culture parameters, including cell count, cell viability, and ammonium
concentration were also monitored daily (except for batch days 3 and 4).
[0311] Unexpectedly, cell cultures grown under high copper concentrations produced
supernatants containing significantly higher total and specific rVWF activity (compare results in
Table 7 and Table 8). For example, at batch day 4, the cell culture grown under high copper
concentration contained 1.52 IU rVWF activity/mL, as compared to 0.2 IU rVWF activity/mL
for the low copper culture. This is despite the fact that the low copper cell culture produced
nearly twice the amount of rVWF as the high copper cell culture. Furthermore, the specific
activity of the supernatant obtained from the high copper culture was more than 13 times greater
than that of the low copper culture supernatant (831 mU/1Opg rVWF v. 62 mU/1Opg rVWF).
[0312] As seen in Table 7 and Table 8, the total and specific ristocetin cofactor activity of the
high copper culture was twice that of the low copper culture at batch day 1. Furthermore, in
contrast to the subsequent increases in activity observed in the high copper culture, no increase in
the amount of ristocetin cofactor activity was seen after batch day 1 for the low copper cell
culture. Consistent with this result, agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of the rVWF multimer
state revealed that a low concentration of high molecular weight rVWF, relative to the
concentration of low molecular weight rVWF species, was present in the supernatant of the low
copper cell culture at batch day 1, and that the relative concentration further decreased over time
(Figure 1A and IB). In contrast, supplementation of the culture medium with Cu         resulted in a
consistent formation of ristocetin cofactor (RiCoF) active antigen through the fourth day.
Consistently, no loss in the amount of stable high molecular weight rVWF multimers occurred
through day 4 of the batch culture (Figure 1A and IB). The densitometric results of the agarose
electrophoresis gel shown in Figure lB revealed that under low copper conditions the culture
                                                  96

   WO 2012/006594                                                             PCT/US2011/043459
was only able to produce a rVWF population in which more than 10% (i.e., 16.3%) of the rVWF
was present in molecules having more than 10 dimers for one day of the batch culture (i.e.
"day3" sample in Lane 2 of the agarose gel of Figure 1A), and notably, this population fell to
only 4% at day 5 of the batch culture ("day 7" sample in Lane 6). In contrast under high copper
conditions the relative amount of vWF multimers with more than 10 dimers is consistently
around 30% through day 4 of the batch culture ("day 3" to "day 6" in Lanes 7-10; 28% to
31.4%).
[0313] Notably, beginning at batch day 5 of the high copper batch culture, when NH 4+ levels
exceeded 100 mg/L (greater than about 5.0 mM), the expression of additional antigen (18.3 to
35.4 pg/L; compare batch days 4 and 5 of Table 8) did not result in a concomitant increase in the
RiCoF activity present in the supernatant. Consistent with this result, the level of high molecular
weight rVWF multimers at batch day 5 (day 7 of the culture) decreased relative to the
concentration of low molecular weight rVWF multimers. Also only on batch day 5 ("day 7"
sample of the culture in Lane 11) the relative amount of the vWF with more than 10 dimers is
reduced to 21.4%.
[0314] Taken together, the data provided above demonstrate that the supplementation of copper
concentrations in cell cultures expressing rVWF dramatically increases the total and specific
rVWF ristocetin cofactor activity, as well the stable production of high molecular weight rVWF
multimers. Furthermore, the data show a correlation between the presence of high NH 4+
concentrations in the cell culture and the loss of rVWF ristocetin cofactor activity and high
molecular weight rVWF multimer production.

[0315] Recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII) and Von Willebrand Factor (rVWF) were co-expressed
in continuous cultures of GD8/6 cells operated under chemostatic conditions to determine the
effect of the composition of the culture medium on VWF expression and activity. Briefly,
GD8/6 cells were cultivated in BAV-SP medium containing 4 g/L of soy hydrolysate with and
without copper supplementation as described in Example 2. To test the effect of low copper
concentraions on rVWF expression and activity, basal BAV-SP media was used. The basal
media contained 0.3 pg/L copper and was supplemented with soy hydrolysate, which contributed
an additional 0.7 pg/L copper, providing a final copper concentration of 1.0 pg/L. As a
comparision, the BAV-SP media used for the batch cultures was further supplemented with an
additional 3.3 pg/L of Cu , providing a final copper concentration of 4.3 pg/L, to determine the
effect high copper concentrations on VWF expression and activity. Cultures grown in the
presence of high and low copper concentrations were cultivated under both high (2.8x10 6
cells/mL) and low (appr. 1.4x10E06 cells/mL) cell densities.
[0316] As before, samples of the culture supernatant were tested for rVWF content (vWF
ELISA), total (Ristocetin) and specific (Specific Activity) activity via a ristocetin cofactor assay.
Various culture parameters, including cell count, cell viability, and ammonium concentration
were also monitored. Data were generated from the steady state phase of weeks 2 and 3 of the
chemostat cultures (Table 9 to Table 13).

[0317] As shown in Figure 2A, supernatant harvested from continuous rVWF cell culture grown
at low cell densities and high copper concentrations contained high specific activity (average of
600 mU / 10 pg), while supernatants harvested from rVWF cell cultures grown at high cell
densities in the presence of high or low copper concentrations and rVWF cell cultures grown at
low cell density in the presence of low copper concentration contained low specific activities
(less than 100 mU / 10 pg). Consistent with the results observed for batch cultures, Figure 2B
shows that continuous mammalian cell cultures expressing rVWF with high specific activities
have lower NH 4+ concentrations than do cultures producing rVWF with low specific activities.
This data further strengthen the correlation between NH 4+ concentration in the cell culture and
the specific activity of rVWF produced by the culture. Notably, the combination of high copper
concentration and low ammonium concentration in the cell culture allowed for the production
significantly improved rVWF activity.
[0318] Consistent with this result, agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of the rVWF multimer
state of chemostat cultures (Figure 6) revealed that only supernatants from cultures operated at
                                                100

high copper and low cell density and thus low ammonium resulted in a consistent expression
high multuimeric vWF (about 23% to 27% on CST day 8, 17 and 24 in Lanes 4, 8, and 12,
respectively). All other conditions do not reach consistently high amounts of more than 10% of
vWF with more than 10 dimers over an extended cultivation period.
         Example 4
[0319] To determine the effect of culture media copper concentration on the expression and
specific activity of rAl3, mammalian cell cultures expression rAl3 were grown for 4 weeks
under chemostatic continuous culture conditions in ADAMTS 13 medium comprising a modified
DMEM/F12 basal media BESP845 and additional supplements (Table 14) containing copper
concentrations ranging from 0.66 pg/L (without additional copper supplementation) and with
additional copper supplementation to 4 pg/L. As shown in Table 15, increasing copper
concentration in the cell culture media resulted in a significant increase in volumetric (P) and
specific (q) productivity expressed as the total rA13 activity produced per liter culture and day
and the total rA13 activity produced per cell and day, respectively.

[0320] To determine if increased copper concentrations affected the integrity of the expressed
rA13, supernatant harvested from rA13 cell cultures grown in media containing 0.66 pg/L, 1
pg/L, and 4 pg/L copper was examined by SDS-PAGE analysis. As seen in Figure 3A (silver
stain) and Figure 3B (anti-A13 western blot), no obvious change in product quality by gel
electrophoresis was observed. Specifically, no increase in the level of truncated 170 kD or other
low MW rA13 variants and no other additional or increased HCP bands resulted from rA13
expression in the presence of increased copper concentrations.

[0321] To estimate an optimal concentration of copper on the activity of rA13, an extrapolation
of data from Table 15 of P Frets versus copper concentration (Figure 4) shows that optimum
effect is likely reached at about 2 gg/L, with a conservative estimation of a negative effect above
about 4 gg/L.

[0322] Based on the results obtained above, an additional experiment was performed, which
compared the expression of rA13 in cell culture media containing 0.66 gg/L copper with 2.0
gg/L copper. As shown in Table 16, supplementation of the basal cell media with copper, to a
final concentration of 2.0 gg/L copper, resulted in a significant increase in volumetric (P) and
specific (q) productivity expressed as the total rA13 activity produced per liter culture and day
and the total rA13 activity produced per cell and day, respectively, over a period of 8 weeks.
The specific data for each week of rA13 production in the two cultures is shown in Figure 5.
From these data, it is clear that copper supplementation has a measurable beneficial effect on cell
metabolism, specific growth rate and rA13 productivity.
