ABSTRACT
        Systems, devices, and methods are provided for securing soft tissue to bone. One
exemplary embodiment of a device includes an anchor, a repair filament, and a connecting
filament that is coupled to the repair filament, is in contact with the anchor's distal end,
and is effective to connect the repair filament to the anchor such that the repair filament
slides with respect to the anchor. The anchor can be rigid, and can include an axial bore
extending therethrough. At least one of the repair filament and the connecting filament can
extend through at least a portion of the axial bore, and the bore can be sized such that a
portion of the filament extending therethrough barely fits to help maintain the connection
between the anchor, repair filament, and connecting filament. Embodiments of the
systems and devices disclosed can be used in a number of methods for repairing soft tissue.

SYSTEMS, DEVICES, AND METHODS FOR SECURING TISSUE USING HARD
ANCHORS
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]           The present disclosure relates to systems, devices, and methods for securing
soft tissue to bone, and more particularly relates to securing soft tissue using rigid or hard
anchors in conjunction with a combination of surgical filaments to minimize trauma during
surgical procedures.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]           A common injury, especially among athletes and people of advancing age,
is the complete or partial detachment of tendons, ligaments, or other soft tissues from bone.
Tissue detachment may occur during a fall, by overexertion, or for a variety of other
reasons. Surgical intervention is often needed, particularly when tissue is completely
detached from its associated bone. Currently available devices for tissue attachment
include screws, staples, suture anchors, and tacks. Currently available devices for patients
of advancing age can be particularly insufficient due to soft and weak bones leading to
inadequate fixation between the anchor and bones and the anchors and filaments with
which the anchors are coupled.
[0003]           Anchors and repair filaments are typically used in soft tissue repair
procedures to secure the tissue in a desired location. Smaller anchors can be helpful in
minimizing trauma associated with creating surgical openings for accessing the location
for soft tissue repair, and for minimizing trauma associated with implanting the anchor in
bone as part of the tissue repair procedure. Because anchors are often disposed in holes
that are pre-formed in bone, the smaller an anchor is, the smaller a pre-formed hole can be.
The anchors can include repair filaments coupled thereto and the repair filaments can be
coupled to the soft tissue and operable to draw the soft tissue closer to the bone in which
the anchor is implanted. A number of challenges, however, present themselves when using
small anchors coupled with repair filaments for soft tissue repair. For example, despite
their size, small anchors and repair filaments are limited in their abilities to withstand both

                                                 2
high levels of load that result from tissue and bone movement after the procedure is
completed and high levels of load that can occur while the procedure is being performed.
Additionally, the small anchors and repair filaments can be susceptible to undesirably
sliding therebetween both during and after the procedure. Likewise, the repair filaments
can be susceptible to undesirably fraying or breaking, for instance at locations where the
repair filament is coupled to the anchor.
[0004]          It can also be desirable to minimize the number of knots used in conjunction
with the repair filament when performing soft tissue repair procedures. A variety of
different knots, such as sliding knots, can be used to help draw and secure soft tissue with
respect to bone. Although the tying of knots at a surgical site is common, in some
instances knots can have a tendency to slip, which in turn can cause a loss of tension
between the tissue and bone. This drawback is sometimes referred to as a loss of "loop
security." In addition to this "loop security" issue, conventional knots typically have an
overall size that can be obstructive or intrusive, especially in tight joints, which may
damage cartilage or other tissue by abrasion with the knot.
[0005]          It is therefore desirable to provide systems, devices, and methods that
reduce the amount of trauma associated with using hard or rigid anchors during soft tissue
repair procedures while maintaining or improving the holding strength such systems,
devices, and methods can provide. It is also desirable to provide systems, devices, and
methods for use in soft tissue repair that minimize or eliminate the number and size of
knots to be tied by a surgeon, particularly during arthroscopic repair procedures.
SUMMARY
[0006]          Systems, devices, and methods are generally provided for securing soft
tissue to bone. In one exemplary embodiment a surgical soft tissue repair device includes
an anchor, a repair filament, and a connecting filament in sliding engagement with the
repair filament. The anchor can be configured to be fixated in bone and can have at least
one bore extending therethrough. The connecting filament can have a folded configuration
in which the connecting filament is unable to pass through the bore and can be effective to
connect the repair filament to the anchor. In some embodiments the anchor can be a rigid

                                                3
anchor. Further, in some embodiments the repair filament can include a snare assembly
having a collapsible snare at one end and a terminal end opposite the collapsible snare.
The anchor can be positioned at an intermediate location on the repair filament between the
collapsible snare and the terminal end.
[0007]           The bore of the anchor can be an axial bore, or alternatively, it can be a
transverse bore. In an embodiment in which the bore is an axial bore, the bore can be
stepped such that there is a first, smaller diameter at a proximal end of the bore and a
second, greater diameter at a distal end of the bore. The connecting filament can include at
least one of a continuous loop and a knot. In some embodiments the repair filament can
slidably engage with the connecting filament by passing through the connecting filament.
In some other embodiments the connecting filament can be held by the anchor and/or an
insertion tool. In still other embodiments the connecting filament does not couple to the
anchor. The connecting filament can have a first configuration in which it is able to pass
through the bore of the anchor and a second configuration in which it is unable to pass
through the bore of the anchor, thereby being effective to secure the repair filament to the
anchor. An insertion tool can be removably coupled to the anchor. The insertion tool can
have at least one bore extending therethrough with its bore being substantially aligned with
the bore of the anchor.
[0008]           One exemplary embodiment of a surgical repair method includes inserting
an anchor into a hole in a bone at a location proximate to detached soft tissue. The anchor
can have a bore extending therethrough and the anchor can be coupled to a snare assembly
by a connecting filament that is disposed in or adjacent to the bore at a position distal to the
snare assembly. The snare assembly can have a collapsible snare at one end and at least
one elongate filament extending therefrom. The elongate filament can have a terminal end
opposite the collapsible snare. The method can also include passing at least one of the
snare and the terminal end of the elongate filament through at least a portion of the
detached tissue, inserting the terminal end of the elongate filament through the snare,
collapsing the snare around the elongate filament, and sliding the collapsed snare toward
the soft tissue to apply tension to the filament between the anchor and the tissue to bring
the tissue into proximity with the bone. The connecting filament can be slidably coupled
to the repair filament approximately at or adjacent to a distal end of the anchor. In some

                                                4
embodiments, the method can further include actuating the connecting filament to move
from a first configuration in which it is able to pass through the bore of the anchor to a
second configuration in which it is unable to pass through the bore of the anchor and is
effective to secure the repair filament to the anchor.
[0009]           In some embodiments at least a portion of the connecting filament can be
disposed within the bore. In some other embodiments at least a portion of the repair
filament can be disposed within the bore and the connecting filament can be disposed on a
side of the bore opposite to the snare assembly. The method can also include tensioning
the repair filament to configure the connecting filament in a connecting configuration in
which the connecting filament is unable to pass through the bore to fix tissue relative to the
bone.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0040]           Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described to provide an overall
understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the
devices and methods disclosed herein. One or more examples of these embodiments are
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Those skilled in the art will understand that the
devices and methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying
drawings are non-limiting exemplary embodiments and that the scope of the present
invention is defined solely by the claims. The features illustrated or described in
connection with one exemplary embodiment may be combined with the features of other
embodiments. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the
scope of the present invention. Further, in the present disclosure, like-numbered

                                                8
components of the embodiments generally have similar features. Additionally, to the
extent that linear or circular dimensions are used in the description of the disclosed
systems, devices, and methods, such dimensions are not intended to limit the types of
shapes that can be used in conjunction with such systems, devices, and methods. A person
skilled in the art will recognize that an equivalent to such linear and circular dimensions
can easily be determined for any geometric shape. Sizes and shapes of the systems and
devices, and the components thereof, can depend at least on the anatomy of the subject in
which the systems and devices will be used, the size and shape of components with which
the systems and devices will be used, and the methods and procedures in which the
systems and devices will be used.
[0041]           The figures provided herein are not necessarily to scale. Still further, to the
extent arrows are used to describe a direction of movement, these arrows are illustrative
and in no way limit the direction the respective component can or should be moved. A
person skilled in the art will recognize other ways and directions for creating the desired
result. Additionally, a number of terms may be used throughout the disclosure
interchangeably but will be understood by a person skilled in the art. By way of non
limiting example, the terms suture, filament, and flexible members may be used
interchangeably.
[0042]           Systems, devices, and methods for soft tissue repair are generally provided
and they generally involve the use of surgical filaments and/or flexible members in
conjunction with hard or rigid anchors. Surgical repair filaments, which are flexible
members that can come in a variety of configurations, are used in connection with anchors
to attach or reattach soft tissue to bone. The repair filaments can pass through soft tissue
so that the soft tissue can be positioned in a desired location. The repair filaments are
secured to anchors which, in turn, are fixed in bone. In one aspect of the invention, the
anchors have one or more lumens or bores extending therethrough for receiving all or part
of the repair filament. In a further aspect, the lumens or bores of the anchor have a
diameter that is slightly larger than a width formed by a repair filament such that the lumen
or bore is barely able to accommodate the repair filament. In some embodiments the width
formed by the repair filament can be the equivalent of a diameter of the repair filament,
while in some other embodiments the width formed by the repair filament can be the

                                                  9
equivalent of approximately two diameters of the repair filament, for instance when at least
a portion of a loop of repair filament is disposed in the lumen or bore of the anchor. A
configuration in which the lumen or bore of the anchor is barely able to accommodate the
repair filament can allow the repair filament to slide with respect to the anchor while still
preventing the repair filament from easily falling out of the bore or lumen.
[0043]          The repair filament can interface with the anchor and connect thereto with
the aid of a connecting filament. In some embodiments, the repair filament and the
connecting filament can be in sliding engagement approximately at or adjacent to a distal
end of the anchor. The connecting filament is such that it has a diameter, either in a
normal configuration or an altered configuration, that is greater than the diameter of the
lumen or bore. When the connecting filament is in an altered configuration, such as a
folded configuration, the connecting filament can be unable to pass through the bore. The
connecting filament can render a rigid engagement member, such as a cross-bar or eyelet,
unnecessary. Further, the repair filament is able to couple to the connecting filament in
such a way that provides a secure connection between the repair filament, the anchor, and
soft tissue that is to be repaired or reattached. While in some embodiments at least a
portion of the repair filament can extend substantially through the bore, in other
embodiments a portion of the connecting filament extends proximally through the bore of
the anchor and couples with the repair filament at a proximal side of the anchor. In such
embodiments, the lumens or bores of the anchor have a diameter that is slightly larger than
a width formed by a connecting filament such that the lumen or bore is barely able to
accommodate the connecting filament. This configuration prevents the connecting
filament from easily falling out of the bore or lumen while still allowing the repair filament
to slide with respect to the anchor.
[0044]          One beneficial aspect of the devices and systems described herein is that the
use of relatively small anchor devices is possible, while maintaining the ability to use a
high strength repair filament and anchor system that can withstand high loads. The use of
a soft and flexible connecting filament is also advantageous in that it enables the use of
smaller anchors and provides for an interface between the anchor and repair filament that
reduces trauma to the patients as well as the risk of damage to the repair filament. Further,
the repair filament is able to slide relative to the connecting filament without damaging

                                               10
either component and while minimizing the risk of undesirable slippage between the repair
filament and the anchor, and in turn between the soft tissue and bone attached thereto. The
devices and systems provided herein allow for both improved and new procedures for soft
tissue repair, and can be used in a number of different types of surgical procedures,
including by way of non-limiting examples rotator cuff and instability repair procedures
and other types of tendon and tissue repair procedures.
SOFT TISSUE REPAIR DEVICES
[0045]          FIGS. 1, 2A, and 2B illustrate exemplary embodiments of surgical soft
tissue repair devices that can be used to perform soft tissue repairs. Each includes a hard
or rigid anchor for implantation into bone, a repair filament for coupling to soft tissue and
drawing the soft tissue toward the bone in which the anchor is implanted, and a connecting
filament for associating the repair filament with the anchor. Using soft and flexible
components like a connecting filament in conjunction with repair filaments and hard
anchors can be beneficial at least because it provides for a strong fixation in bone with
additional flexibility in the design while minimizing the risk of trauma to the patient and
damage to the repair filament.
[0046]          FIG. 1 illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a surgical soft tissue repair
device 310 that includes a hard or rigid anchor 312, a repair filament 320, and a connecting
filament 317 that couples the repair filament 320 to the anchor 312. As shown, the anchor
312 includes an axial bore 316 formed therethrough and the connecting filament 317 is
disposed through the bore 316 and is configured to couple to the repair filament 320 such
that the anchor 312 is at an intermediate location on the repair filament 320. While the
anchor and any associated bores and lumens can have a variety of configurations, in the
illustrated embodiment the bore 316 is stepped such that a distal end 316d of the bore 316
has a diameter that is greater than a more proximal portion 316p of the bore 316. In other
embodiments the bore 316 can have a constant diameter. In the illustrated embodiment the
diameter of the proximal portion 316p is sized such that it is slightly larger than a width
formed by the connecting filament 317 such that the bore 316 is barely able to
accommodate the connecting filament 317. As shown, the width formed by the connecting

                                               11
filament 317 is approximately two diameters of the filament 317 due to the filament 317
having a looped configuration within the bore 316.
[0047]           The repair filament can have a variety of configurations and constructions,
including as simple as being an elongate flexible member or suture filament. However, in
one embodiment the repair filament 320 can be a snare assembly having a collapsible snare
330 formed on a first end 322 and a terminal end 324 opposite the first end 322, with an
intermediate portion extending therebetween. In some embodiments a sleeve 350 can be
disposed around at least a portion of the repair filament 320. The terminal end 324 can be
configured to pass through an opening 332 in the snare 330 to create a tensionable
construct so that the snare assembly can draw two or more objects, such as tissue and bone,
closer together, as described in greater detail below with respect to FIGS. 14A-15G.
[0048]           The connecting filament 317 can be effective to connect the repair filament
320 and the anchor 312 in a way that minimizes the potential for damage to the repair
filaments. As shown, a distal end 317d of the connecting filament 317 can be configured
to have a diameter that is greater than the diameter of the bore 316, either in its natural
state or in certain anchoring configurations that can result, for instance, from actuation
initiated by a surgeon. In some embodiments the diameter of the distal end 317d of the
connecting filament 317 remains approximately constant and it has dimensions that
prevent its passage proximal of the distal end 316d of the bore 316. In other embodiments
the distal end 317d can be actuated (e.g., by tension) to transition from an unstressed
configuration in which the connecting filament 317 could fully pass through the bore 316
and an anchoring configuration in which the diameter of the connecting filament 317
increases to a size that prevents its passage through the bore 316. Accordingly, the
connecting filament 317 is configured or configurable to be unable to pass through the bore
316. A person skilled in the art will recognize configurations of a connecting filament that
can be used to allow a connecting filament to move from a first, unstressed configuration
to a second, anchoring configuration. Some non-limiting examples of filaments that can
move between these two configurations and which can be adapted for use as a connecting
filament in conjunction with the teachings herein are described in greater detail in U.S.
Patent Application Serial No. 13/465,376 filed May 7, 2012, and entitled "Systems,
Devices, and Methods for Securing Tissue Using Snare Assemblies and Soft Anchors," the

content of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. A proximal end      3 17p
of the connecting filament 317 can be configured to couple to the repair filament 320,
which in the illustrated embodiment is accomplished by looping the repair filament 320
through a loop in the proximal end 317p of the connecting filament 317. A person skilled
in the art will recognize a number of different ways by which the repair filament 320 can
be coupled to the connecting filament 317, including by passing one filament through the
other.
[0049]           FIG. 2A illustrates another exemplary embodiment of a surgical soft tissue
repair device 410 in which a repair filament 420 is a snare assembly similar to the snare
assembly of FIG. 1 in that it includes a collapsible snare 430 formed on a first end 422, a
terminal end 424 opposite the first end 422, the terminal end 424 being configured to pass
through an opening 432 in the snare 430 to create a tensionable construct, and an optional
sleeve 450 disposed around at least a portion of the repair filament 420. The repair
filament 420 is coupled to the hard anchor 412 by way of a flexible connecting filament
417 disposed on a distal side 412d of the anchor 412 such that the anchor 412 is at an
intermediate location on the repair filament 420. As shown, the connecting filament 417 is
in sliding engagement with the repair filament 420 approximately at or adjacent to the
distal end 412d of the anchor 412. FIG. 2B illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a
surgical soft tissue repair device 410' that is similar to the surgical repair device 410 of
FIG. 2A except the repair filament 420' is not a snare assembly but is instead an elongate
filament having proximal and distal ends. The repair filament 420' is coupled to a hard
anchor 412' having a flexible connecting filament 417' associated therewith at a distal end
412d' thereof such that the anchor 412' is at an intermediate location on the repair filament
420'. As shown, the connecting filament 417' is in sliding engagement with the repair
filament 420' approximately at or adjacent to the distal end 412d' of the anchor 412'. The
repair filament 420' can be slidably coupled to the flexible connecting filament 417' such
that it can move distally approximately in a direction K and proximally approximately in a
direction L as illustrated by the arrows in FIG. 2B. Although FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate
the engagement between the repair filament 420, 420' and the connecting filament 417,
417' to be approximately at or distal to the distal end 412d, 412d' of the anchor 412, 412', it
is understood that tension applied to the repair filament 420, 420' can cause the location of

                                                 13
the engagement between the two filaments to shift proximally to a position slightly
adjacent to the distal end 412d, 412d'.
[0050]          The anchor 412, 412' can include an axial bore 416, 416' formed
therethrough and the repair filament 420, 420' can be disposed through the bore 416, 416'
to couple to the connecting filament 417, 417'. The connecting filament 417, 417' can be
effective to connect the repair filament 420, 420' and the anchor 412, 412'. As shown, the
connecting filament 417, 417' can be configured such that in an approximately folded
configuration the connecting filament 417, 417' is unable to pass through the bore 416,
416' because a width formed when two portions of the connecting filament 417, 417' are
compressed together is greater than the diameter of the bore 416, 416', thus anchoring the
repair filament 420, 420' with respect to the anchor 412, 412'. The diameter of the bore
416, 416' is sized such that it is slightly larger than the width formed by the repair filament
420, 420' such that the bore 416, 416' is barely able to accommodate the repair filament
420, 420'. In the illustrated embodiments, the width formed by the repair filament 420,
420' is approximately two diameters of the filament 420, 420' due to two portions of the
filament 420, 420' being disposed in the bore 416, 416'. A person having skill in the art
will understand that a location of the connecting filament 417, 417' can also be maintained
by load applied by the repair filament 420, 420' and/or using one or more insertion tools, as
described below.
[0051]          The repair filament 420, 420' can couple to the connecting filament 417,
417' in a variety of manners. As shown, the connecting filament 417, 417' is disposed at
the distal side 412d, 412d' of the anchor 412, 412' and the repair filament 420, 420' passes
through and exits the axial bore 416, 416' and is coupled to the connecting filament 417,
417' by passing the repair filament 420, 420' around the connecting filament 417, 417'.
The relatively small diameter of the bore 416, 416', which is barely wide enough to
accommodate the repair filament 420, 420', contributes to the stability of the coupling
between the repair filament 420, 420' and the connecting filament 417, 417'. For example,
the system as shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B is able to remain intact due to the relative
dimensions of the bore 416, 416', the repair filament 420, 420', and the connecting filament
417, 417'. Other known filament connecting techniques can also be used, including tying
one or more knots to secure one filament to the other or passing one filament through the

                                                 14
other. In some embodiments the repair filament 420, 420' may be coupled to the
connecting filament 417, 417' before the device 410, 410' is packaged, while in other
embodiments the repair filament 420, 420' may be coupled to the connecting filament 417,
417' by a surgeon after the device 410, 410' is removed from a package and prior to
implantation.
[0052]          The connecting filaments 417, 417' of FIGS. 2A and 2B can also have a
variety of configurations to assist in coupling the repair filaments 420, 420' to the anchors
412, 412', respectively. Although in the illustrated embodiments the connecting filaments
417, 417' rely on an approximately folded configuration to prevent the connecting
filaments 417, 417' from passing through the bores 416, 416', they can have a diameter that
prevents them from passing through the bore 416, 416'. Further exemplary configurations
are also described in greater detail below with respect to FIGS. 6A-13B and 16.
ANCHORS
[0053]          Suture anchors for use in the repair devices provided herein can have a
variety of configurations. The embodiments of FIGS. 1 and 2A and 2B illustrate some
examples of anchors 312, 412, 412' that can be used in conjunction with the disclosures
herein. In each embodiment the anchor 312, 412, 412' is generally elongate, cylindrical,
and small, and is sized to fit in a pre-drilled bore formed in bone. The anchors 312, 412,
412' can include bone-engaging surface features, such as teeth, ridges, or, as shown, outer
threads, to assist in securing a location of the anchors 312, 412, 412' within the pre-drilled
bore, and the anchors 312, 412, 412' can each include their own bores 316, 416, 416'
extending therethrough. Commercially available hard anchors, such as anchors in the
Healix family and the Gryphon family from DePuy Mitek, Inc., can be used and/or
modified by a person skilled in the art for use in conjunction with the disclosures herein.
Further, soft anchors can also be used in conjunction with the repair filaments and
connecting filaments described herein, including but not limited to soft anchors described
in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 13/465,376 filed May 7, 2012, and entitled "Systems,
Devices, and Methods for Securing Tissue Using Snare Assemblies and Soft Anchors," the
content of which was already incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

                                              15
[0054]         A size and shape of the anchor, as well as the materials from which the
anchor is constructed, can depend, at least in part, on the sizes, shapes, and materials with
which the anchor is used, including the sizes, shapes, and materials of the repair and
connecting filaments, the obstructions through which it may pass, as well as on the type of
procedure being performed. In some embodiments the anchor can have a diameter in the
range of about 1 millimeter to about 12 millimeters, and in one embodiment the diameter
can be about 2 millimeters, and a length in the range of about 5 millimeters to about 24
millimeters, and in one embodiment the length can be about 10 millimeters. Examples of
exemplary materials that can be used to form the anchor include but are not limited to
bioabsorbable elastomers, copolymer combinations such as polylactic acid-polyglycolic
acid (PLA-PGA), and bioabsorbable polymers such as aliphatic polyesters, poly(amino
acids), copoly(ether-esters), polyalkylenes oxalates, polyamides, tyrosine derived
polycarbonates, poly(iminocarbonates), polyorthoesters, polyoxaesters, polyamidoesters,
polyoxaesters containing amine groups, poly(anhydrides), polyphosphazenes,
biomolecules (i.e., biopolymers such as collagen, elastin, bioabsorbable starches, etc.) and
blends thereof. In some embodiments, the suture anchors can be formed from polylactic
acid, or a composite blend of tricalcium phosphate and polylactic acid. The suture anchors
disclosed herein can also be formed from non-absorbable materials, such as polyether ether
ketone (PEEK) and polysulfone, or metals such as titanium.
[0055]         Likewise, the size of the bore can depend, at least in part, on the sizes,
shapes, and materials with which the anchor is used, including the sizes, shapes, and
materials of the repair and connecting filaments, as well as on the type of procedure being
performed. Generally, a diameter of the bore is slightly larger than a width formed by a
repair filament or a connecting filament passing therethrough such that the lumen or bore is
barely able to accommodate the respective filament. In some embodiments the width
formed by the repair or connecting filament that passes through the lumen or bore of the
anchor can be approximately the same as a diameter of the filament, while in some other
embodiments, such as those illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2A and 2B, the width formed by the
repair or connecting filament that passes through the lumen or bore of the anchor can be
about the size of two diameters of the filament. Such a configuration allows for the
filament passing through the lumen or bore of the anchor to remain substantially associated
with the anchor even when tension is not applied to the repair filament or connecting

                                               16
filament to keep the repair filament and connecting filament near the anchor. In some
exemplary embodiments a diameter of the bore is in the range of about 0.2 millimeters to
about 4 millimeters, and in one embodiment the diameter of the bore can be about 0.5
millimeters. Further, although in the illustrated embodiments the anchors include an axial
bore, in some embodiments the anchor can include a transverse bore in lieu of or in
addition to an axial bore. Other variations on the anchor configurations that are known to
those skilled in the art can also be accommodated.
REPAIR FILAMENTS
[0056]          As noted above, virtually any repair filament can be used with the repair
systems described herein. A person skilled in the art will be able to choose a repair
filament having an appropriate size and made of an appropriate material that is suitable for
use in any given procedure.
[0057]          FIG. 3 illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a repair filament for use in
conjunction with various anchors and connecting filaments. In the illustrated embodiment
of FIG. 3 the repair filament is a snare assembly 20. As shown in FIG. 3, the snare
assembly 20 can generally be flexible, can include a snare 30 formed on a first end 22, and
can have a terminal end 24 opposite the first end 22, with an intermediate portion
extending therebetween. The terminal end 24 can be configured to pass through an
opening 32 in the snare to create a tensionable construct so the snare assembly can draw
two or more objects, such as tissue and bone, closer together. Further, the snare assembly
20 can also be used as a tensioning member to help move a connecting filament against an
anchor to generally secure a location of the snare assembly 20 with respect to the anchor.
In some embodiments the snare assembly 20 can be used to help secure a location of an
anchor within bone, for instance by applying tension to the snare assembly 20 to set the
position of the anchor in bone, as known to those skilled in the art. Exemplary anchors for
such embodiments include, but are not limited to, toggle-type anchors.
[0058]          Optionally, a flexible sleeve 50 can be provided for encapsulating at least a
portion of the snare assembly 20. As shown in FIG. 3, the sleeve encapsulates a portion of
the assembly 20 starting at the terminal end 24 and extending toward the first end 22. In

                                               17
other embodiments the sleeve can extend more proximal than the terminal end 24. A
configuration of this nature can aid a surgeon in pulling the snare assembly 20 through a
portion of the body by providing extra length onto which he or she can grasp. Preferably,
once the assembly 20 is implanted, the sleeve 50 can extend outside of a body as well as
outside of a cannula placed in the body. This can allow the sleeve 50 to be used by a
surgeon during a surgical procedure, and it can also be easily removed once it is no longer
being used by the surgeon. The sleeve 50 can have a generally cylindrical configuration
and can be flexible to allow it to bend as shown in various embodiments provided herein.
The sleeve 50 can be useful when passing the assembly 20 through obstructions such as an
anchor and/or tissue for a number of reasons. The sleeve 50 can be configured to have a
smoother surface that is better configured to pass through tissue, thus reducing the
possibility of fraying the filament of the snare assembly 20 or causing trauma to the tissue.
Still further, because the sleeve 50 can encapsulate a plurality of filament limbs, the sleeve
50 can ease filament management by maintaining the filaments within the enclosed sleeve
50. The sleeve 50 can be removable, and thus it can be removed at any time during the
procedure, or at the conclusion of the procedure.
[0059]           FIGS. 4A-4C illustrate one exemplary method of forming a snare assembly.
As shown in FIG. 4A, the snare assembly 120 can be a filament having a noose 160 and
noose limbs 164, 166. The noose 160 defines a central opening 162 and secondary
openings 161 and 163 formed from a half hitch plus one additional throw of limb 166
through central opening 162. A flexible sleeve 150 is shown in phantom as it optionally
encapsulates a portion of limbs 164 and 166 in certain constructions, as described in more
detail below.
[0060]           FIGS. 4B and 4C more particularly illustrate the formation of a cinch noose
or snare 130 in an improved cinch noose construct or snare assembly 120, having an
opening 132. The ends of free filament limbs 134 and 136 of the filament are passed
through central opening 162, as represented by arrows 137 and 139 in FIG. 4B, which
draws noose limbs 134 and 136 therethrough. Noose 160 is then tightened, as shown in
FIG. 4C, to form a slidable knot for the snare 130. Alternatively, if a sleeve 150, as shown
in FIG. 4A, or a sleeve 150', as shown in FIG. 4C, is not utilized, or if such sleeve is

                                                18
removed after being passed through tissue to be tensioned, then one or both of free limbs
134, 136 can be passed through one or both of the openings 161, 163.
[0061]          Joining together at least the free filament limbs improves suture
management and reduces the possibility of suture entanglement or damage by instruments,
especially when passed through a cannula. For example, a surgeon or other user need only
grasp and pass one sleeve 150 through the noose 160 to thereby manipulate the free
filament limbs 134, 136 as a single unit.
[0062]          FIGS. 5A-5D illustrate another exemplary method of forming a snare
assembly 220 having a snare 230 and a coaxial sliding neck 235 for use in a surgical repair
construct. In this exemplary embodiment, the snare 230 is formed from a bifurcated suture
filament having a tubular portion 237 with a core removed therefrom to form a cannulated
portion 239 and first and second terminal limbs 234, 236. As shown in FIG. 5B, the
terminal limbs 234, 236 can be curled back toward the tubular portion 237 to form a loop
having an opening 232 that defines the snare 230. As shown in FIG. 5C, a bore 260 can be
formed on a side of the tubular portion 237 and the terminal limbs 234, 236 can be placed
into the cannulated tubular portion 239 through the bore 260. Ends of the terminal limbs
234, 236 can be fed through the cannulated portion 239, and as shown in FIG. 5D, the
terminal limbs 234, 236 can be pulled distally (direction A in FIG. 5D) through the tubular
portion 237 such that the tubular portion 237 is fed through itself. Accordingly, the snare
230 can be collapsed by tensioning the limbs 234, 236 and/or coaxial sliding neck 235 in
approximately a first direction A, and the snare 230 can be expanded by applying a force to
the snare 230 in approximately a second, opposite direction B, which pulls the limbs 234,
236 towards the snare 230. Passing the filament through itself to form a coaxial sliding
neck allows the filament to have a low profile that minimizes the amount of space the
construct consumes in the body and that minimizes and/or eliminates trauma associated
with passing the filament through tissue.
[0063]          A person skilled in the art will recognize a number of other ways that a
snare for use in snare assemblies can be created and used in conjunction with the teachings
herein. For example, a number of different sliding knots can be used to form snares,
including but not limited to a Buntline Hitch, a Tennessee Slider, a Duncan Loop, a

                                               19
Hangman's Noose, and a coaxial sliding neck. To the extent the sliding knot used to form
a snare affects the operation of the snare, for instance whether a limb is pulled through a
knot to change the position of the knot or a knot is slid along a limb to change the position
of the knot, a person skilled in the art would be able to adapt these types of knots for use
with the teachings of the present invention without departing from the spirit of the present
disclosure. As described herein, unless otherwise designated, a knot used to form a snare
is movable away from the terminal end of the snare assembly to collapse the snare and
towards the terminal end to increase a size of the snare.
[0064]          The snare assemblies 20, 120, 220 can be made of any suitable flexible
material, for instance a filament, including a cannulated filament, a braided filament, and a
mono filament. The type, size, and strength of the flexible material can depend, at least in
part, on the type of anchor with which it is used, any obstructions through which the snare
assembly may pass, and the type of procedure in which it is used. In one exemplary
embodiment the flexible material is an OrthocordTM filament that is commercially available
from DePuy Mitek, Inc or EthibondTM filament available from Ethicon, Inc. Generally the
filament is relatively thin to minimize any trauma to tissue through which it passes. In
some embodiments the filament can have a size between about a #5 filament (about 20
gauge to about 21 gauge) and about a #5-0 filament (about 35 gauge to about 38 gauge).
The OrthocordTM or EthibondTM filament can be useful because it has a braided
configuration, which allows other components, including the filament itself, to pass
through subcomponents of the braid without causing damage to the filament. Filaments
configured to allow for a cannulated configuration, such as by removing a core therefrom
or having a pre-formed cannulated configuration, can also be used. OrthocordTM suture is
approximately fifty-five to sixty-five percent PDSTM polydioxanone, which is
bioabsorbable, and the remaining thirty-five to forty-five percent ultra high molecular
weight polyethylene, while Ethibond TM suture is primarily high strength polyester. The
amount and type of bioabsorbable material, if any, utilized in the filaments of the present
disclosure is primarily a matter of surgeon preference for the particular surgical procedure
to be performed. Further, a length of filaments used to form the snare assemblies 20, 120,
220 can be in the range of about 15 centimeters to about 125 centimeters, and in one
embodiment it can be about 60 centimeters.

                                               20
[0065]          A person skilled in the art will recognize that the configurations of FIGS. 3
5D are just some options for forming repair filaments such as snare assemblies. In other
embodiments the repair filament can simply be a filament having proximal and distal ends
and configured to slide with respect to a rigid or hard anchor, such as the repair filament
420' of FIG. 2B. In one exemplary embodiment the repair filament 420' is a #3-0 filament
(about 29 gauge to about 32 gauge), such as an OrthocordTM filament that is commercially
available from DePuy Mitek, Inc or EthibondTM filament available from Ethicon, Inc.
Generally the filament is relatively thin to minimize any trauma to tissue through which it
passes. In some embodiments the filament can have a size between about a #5 filament
(about 20 gauge to about 21 gauge) and about a #5-0 filament (about 35 gauge to about 38
gauge). Other exemplary embodiments of repair filaments that can be used in conjunction
with the teachings herein are described at least in U.S. Patent Application Serial No.
13/465,288 filed May 7, 2012, and entitled "Systems, Devices, and Methods for Securing
Tissue," U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 13/218,8 10 filed August 2 6, 2011, and entitled
"Surgical Filament Snare Assemblies," and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 13/465,362
filed May 7, 2012, and entitled "Systems, Devices, and Methods for Securing Tissue Using
a Suture Having One or More Protrusions," the content of which are also incorporated by
reference herein in their entireties.
CONNECTING FILAMENTS
[0066]          One or more connecting filaments can be used to assist in coupling one or
more repair filaments to one or more anchors, thereby making rigid engagement members
such as cross-bars or eyelets, unnecessary. FIGS. 6A-13B illustrate a variety of
configurations of a connecting filament for such use. In each instance the connecting
filament is coupled to the repair filament approximately at or adjacent to a distal end of the
anchor and the connecting filament is configured in a manner that prevents the connecting
filament from passing through an axial bore of the anchor. This configuration can
generally be referred to as an altered configuration or a folded configuration. As a result,
the repair filament can remain coupled to the anchor and can then be used to repair soft
tissue by coupling the repair filament with the soft tissue and then using the repair filament
to draw the soft tissue toward the anchor and bone in which the anchor is disposed.
Further, the embodiments of FIGS. 6A-13B provide for configurations that help maintain a

                                               21
location of the connecting filament with respect to the anchor so that the connecting
filament does not move out of place accidentally.
[0067]           FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate one exemplary embodiment of a surgical soft
tissue repair device 510 that includes a hard anchor 512 having an axial bore 516 formed
therethrough, a repair filament 520, and a connecting filament 517. As shown, the
connecting filament 517 can be a continuous loop and the repair filament 520 can pass
through a center 518 of the continuous loop approximately at or adjacent to a distal end
512d of the anchor 512. The diameter of the connecting filament 517 can be large enough
such that even when the continuous loop is flexible and is compressed so that a left side of
the loop contacts a right side of the loop, the resulting folded width of the connecting
filament 517 can still be larger than the diameter of the axial bore 516 so that the
connecting filament 517 does not pass through the bore 516 when tension is applied to the
repair filament 520 approximately in a direction T, which can occur during and after a
surgical procedure. As shown in FIG. 6B, the device 510 can be implanted in a bore 1002
formed in bone 1001. Because a diameter of the bore 516 is generally the same size as or
only slightly larger than a width formed by the repair filament 520, the repair filament 520
does not generally fall out of the bore 516. The repair suture can also be kept in place by
an insertion tool assembly, as discussed in greater detail below. Further, as illustrated in
FIG. 6B, because there is generally a relatively small distance between the distal end 512d
of the anchor 512 and the bottom of the bore 1002 into which the anchor 512 is inserted,
e.g., in the range of about 1 millimeter to about 15 millimeters, the repair filament 520 can
remain near the anchor 512 for use in a procedure even if the repair filament 520 were to
fall distally away from the anchor 512.
[0068]           FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate another exemplary embodiment of a surgical soft
tissue repair device 610 that includes a hard anchor 612 having an axial bore 616 formed
therethrough, a repair filament 620, and a connecting filament 617. As shown, the
connecting filament 617 can be a knotted construction forming a continuous loop and the
repair filament 620 can pass through a loop 618 formed by the knotted construction
approximately at or adjacent to a distal end 612d of the anchor 612. One or more knots
619 can be formed in the connecting filament 617 using techniques known to those skilled
in the art, including techniques described in other patent applications incorporated by

                                                22
reference herein. The knots 619 can be pre-formed so that a surgeon does not need to tie
the knots during a surgical procedure, although a surgeon can choose to tie one or more
knots 619 on site. The resulting configuration from the knotted construction can result in
the connecting filament 617 having a folded width that is greater than the diameter of the
axial bore 616 even when compressed so that the connecting filament 617 does not pass
through the bore 616 when tension is applied to the repair filament 620 approximately in a
direction T. As shown in FIG. 7B, the device 610 can be implanted in a bore 1002 formed
in bone 1001, and the depth of the bore 1002 can be such that a distance between the distal
end 612d of the anchor 612 and the bottom of the bore 1002 is relatively small, in the
range of about 1 millimeter to about 15 millimeters.
[0069]          FIGS. 8A and 8B illustrate still another exemplary embodiment of a surgical
soft tissue repair device 710 that includes a hard anchor 712 having an axial bore 716
formed therethrough, a repair filament 720, and a connecting filament 717. As shown,
portions of the connecting filament 717 are glued together to form a loop and the repair
filament 720 can pass through a center 718 of the loop approximately at or adjacent to a
distal end 712d of the anchor 712. The resulting loop can be sized such that in this folded
configuration it cannot pass through the axial bore 716. As shown, the diameter of the
loop is greater than the diameter of the axial bore 716. Further, because the connecting
filament 717 can be flexible, even when the continuous loop is compressed such that a left
side of the loop contacts the right side of the loop, the resulting folded width of the
connecting filament 717 can still be larger than the diameter of the axial bore 716 so that
the connecting filament 717 does not pass through the bore 716 when tension is applied to
the repair filament 720 approximately in a direction T. In one embodiment a width of the
strand of filament in an unfolded configuration used to form the glued loop is less than a
diameter of the bore 716. This allows the strand in the unfolded configuration to be passed
through the bore 716 from a proximal end of the bore 716 to a distal end of the bore 716
when first constructing the device 710 and then subsequently glued to form the loop, i.e.,
the folded configuration, thereby preventing the strand from being passed back through the
bore 716 when tension is applied to the repair filament 720 approximately in the direction
T. As shown in FIG. 8B, the device 710 can be implanted in a bore 1002 formed in bone
1001, and the depth of the bore 1002 can be such that a distance between the distal end

                                                23
712d of the anchor 712 and the bottom of the bore 1002 is relatively small, in the range of
about 1 millimeter to about 15 millimeters.
[0070]          FIGS. 9A and 9B illustrate yet another exemplary embodiment of a surgical
soft tissue repair device 810 that includes a hard anchor 812 having an axial bore 816
formed therethrough, a repair filament 820, and a connecting filament 817. As shown, the
connecting filament 817 pierces through itself multiple times to form a continuous loop,
i.e., a folded configuration, and the repair filament 820 can pass through a center of the
loop approximately at or adjacent to a distal end 812d of the anchor 812. The resulting
configuration can result in the connecting filament 817 having a folded width that is
greater than the diameter of the axial bore 816 even when compressed so that the
connecting filament 817 does not pass through the bore 816 when tension is applied to the
repair filament 820 approximately in a direction T. As shown in FIG. 9B, the device 810
can be implanted in a bore 1002 formed in bone 1001, and the depth of the bore 1002 can
be such that a distance between the distal end 812d of the anchor 812 and the bottom of the
bore 1002 is relatively small, in the range of about 1 millimeter to about 15 millimeters.
[0071]          FIGS. 1OA and 1OB illustrate another exemplary embodiment of a surgical
soft tissue repair device 910 that includes a hard anchor 912 having an axial bore 916
formed therethrough, a repair filament 920, and a connecting filament 917. As shown, the
connecting filament 917 is of a nature similar to the connecting filament described above
with respect to FIGS. 2A and 2B except rather than having the repair filament 920
disposed around the connecting filament 917 the repair filament 920 is disposed through
the connecting filament 917 approximately at or adjacent to a distal end 912d of the anchor
912. A width formed by two portions of the connecting filament 917 being compressed
together is such that the folded width is greater than the diameter of the axial bore 916 so
that the connecting filament 917 does not pass through the bore 916 when tension is
applied to the repair filament 920 approximately in a direction T. Further, in some
embodiments a width of the connecting filament 917 in an uncompressed and unfolded
state can be less than a diameter of the bore 916 such that the connecting filament 917 can
be moved to the distal end 912d of the anchor 912 by passing the connecting filament 917
distally through the bore 916, for instance when first constructing the device 910. As
shown in FIG. 1OB, the device 910 can be implanted in a bore 1002 formed in bone 1001,

                                                24
and the depth of the bore 1002 can be such that a distance between the distal end 912d of
the anchor 912 and the bottom of the bore 1002 is relatively small, in the range of about 1
millimeter to about 15 millimeters.
[0072]           FIGS. 11 A and 11 B illustrate still another exemplary embodiment of a
surgical soft tissue repair device 1010 that includes a hard anchor 1012 having an axial
bore 1016 formed therethrough, a repair filament 1020, and a connecting filament 1017.
As shown, the connecting filament 1017 is disposed within a distal side 1012d of the
anchor 1012. By way of non-limiting example, the anchor 1012 can include bores or other
structures for receiving ends of the connecting filament 1017 to maintain a general location
of the connecting filament 1017, which in turn can maintain a general location of the repair
filament 1020 with respect to the anchor 1012 due to the repair filament 1020 being
coupled to the connecting filament 1017. The configuration of the device 1010 in general
can be such that the attachment of the connecting filament 1017 to the anchor 1012 by way
of bores or other structures for receiving ends of the connecting filament 1017 does not
carry the load resulting from tissue attachment. In the illustrated embodiment the repair
filament 1020 is passed around the connecting filament 1017, but in other embodiments the
repair filament 1020 can pass through the connecting filament 1017. Because the
connecting filament 1017 is generally held in place at the distal side 1012d of the anchor
1012, the connecting filament 1017 does not pass through the bore 1016 when tension is
applied to the repair filament 1020 approximately in a direction T. As shown in FIG. 1 IB,
the device can be implanted in a bore 1002 formed in bone 1001. While in some instances
the connecting filament 1017 can be secured to the anchor 1012 prior to implantation, in
other instances the fit of the anchor 1012 in the bore 1002 can generally maintain the
location of the connecting filament 1017 with respect to the anchor 1012 to prevent the
connecting filament 1017, and thus the repair filament 1020, from falling away from the
anchor 1012.
[0073]           FIGS. 12A and 12B illustrate yet another exemplary embodiment of a
surgical soft tissue repair device 1110 that includes a hard anchor 1112 having an axial
bore 1116 formed therethrough, a repair filament 1120, and a connecting filament 1117.
As shown, the connecting filament 1117 is located approximately at a distal end 11 12d of
the anchor 1112 with the repair filament 1120 being looped around it. In other

                                               25
embodiments the repair filament 1120 can pass through the connecting filament 1117. The
location of the connecting filament 1117 with respect to the anchor 1112 can be
maintained, for example, by a guide (not illustrated) disposed around the anchor 1112, as
described in greater detail below with respect to FIGS. 17-19E. Because the connecting
filament 1117 is generally held in place at the distal side 11 12d of the anchor 1112, the
connecting filament 1117 does not pass through the bore 1116 when tension is applied to
the repair filament 1120 approximately in a direction T. As shown in FIG. 12B, the device
can be implanted in a bore 1002 formed in bone 1001. As illustrated the connecting
filament 1117 can become impinged between the anchor 1112 and walls of the bore 1002
to generally maintain the location of the connecting filament 1117 with respect to the
anchor 1112 to prevent the connecting filament 1117, and thus the repair filament 1120,
from falling away from the anchor 1112. In some embodiments the connecting filament
1117 can generally conform to the shape of the anchor 1112, as shown.
[0074]          Although FIGS. 6-12B illustrate the engagement between the respective
repair filaments and connecting filaments to be approximately at or distal to the distal ends
of the respective anchors, it is understood that tension applied to the repair filaments can
cause the location of the engagement between the repair filaments and the connecting
filaments to shift proximally to a position slightly adjacent to the distal ends of the
respective anchors.
[0075]          FIGS. 13A and 13B illustrate another exemplary embodiment of a surgical
soft tissue repair device 1210 that includes a hard anchor 1212 having an axial bore 1216
formed therethrough, a repair filament 1220, and a connecting filament 1217. The axial
bore 1216 can be stepped such that a distal end 1216d of the bore 1216 has a diameter that
is greater than a remaining portion of the bore 1216. As shown, the connecting filament
1217 is of a nature similar to the filaments 417, 417', and 917 described above with respect
to FIGS. 6A, 6B, 10A, and 1OB, and in the illustrated embodiment the repair filament 1220
is disposed around the connecting filament 1217 approximately at or adjacent to a distal
end 1212d of the anchor 1212. Similar to FIGS. 6-12B, tension applied to the repair
filament 1220 can cause the location of the engagement between the repair filament 1220
and the connecting filament 1217 to shift slightly proximally. A width of the connecting
filament 1217 when two portions thereof are compressed together is such that the

                                               26
connecting filament 1217 can be disposed within the stepped portion at the distal end
1216d of the bore, but it is greater than the diameter of the remaining portion of the axial
bore 1216 so that the connecting filament 1217 does not pass through the bore 1216 when
tension is applied to the repair filament 1220 approximately in a direction T. As shown in
FIG. 13B, the device 1210 can be implanted in a bore 1002 formed in bone 1001, and the
depth of the bore 1002 can be such that a distance between the distal end 1212d of the
anchor 1212 and the bottom of the bore 1002 is relatively small, in the range of about 1
millimeter to about 15 millimeters.
[0076]          A person skilled in the art will recognize that the connecting filament
configurations described herein for maintaining a location of repair filament with respect to
an anchor are only a sample of a wide variety of configurations that can be used to achieve
the same results. The connecting filament can have any number of shapes and
configurations that assist in maintaining a location of the repair filament with respect to an
anchor for use in soft tissue repair without departing from the spirit of the present
disclosure. Likewise, the connecting filament can be formed using a variety of filament
types, including but not limited to a cannulated filament, a braided filament, and a mono
filament. The type, size, and strength of the filament can depend, at least in part, on the
other materials of the anchor and repair filament, the obstructions through which it may
pass, the type of configuration planned for the connecting filament, and the type of
procedure in which the connecting filament is used. Generally, the connecting filament
has a diameter that is larger than the diameter of the repair filament. Further, the diameter
of the connecting filament is such that in certain configurations, such as altered, folded
configurations, it is unable to pass through a bore of an anchor, for instance because the
width formed by the connecting filament is larger than the diameter of the bore of the
anchor. In one exemplary embodiment the connecting filament is formed from a #2
filament (about 23 gauge to about 24 gauge), such as an OrthocordTM filament that is
commercially available from DePuy Mitek, Inc. or EthibondTM filament available from
Ethicon Inc. In some embodiments the connecting filament can have a size between about
a #4 filament (about 21 gauge to about 22 gauge) and about a #4-0 filament (about 32
gauge to about 34 gauge). A length of the connecting filament can be in the range of about
2 millimeters to about 25 millimeters, and in one embodiment the length is about 10
millimeters.

[0077]           While the present disclosure provides a number of different constructions
and configurations for surgical soft tissue repair devices, including various configurations
of repair filaments, connecting filaments, and anchors, a person skilled in the art will
recognize a variety of other constructions the device, the anchor, the repair filament, and
the connecting filament can have without departing from the spirit of the present
disclosure.
USE OF SOFT TISSUE REPAIR DEVICES
[0078]           FIGS. 14A-14G illustrate one exemplary method for performing a tissue
repair using the repair construct illustrated in FIG. 1. A surgical opening can be formed
through skin 1000 and a cannula can be passed therethrough to access a surgical repair site
according to well known techniques. Although cannulas are often used to define a channel
through which the procedure can be performed, the cannula is not shown in FIGS. 14A
14G for clarity of illustration. Accordingly, to the extent the figures show components of
the systems and devices passing through skin 1000, these components would typically
extend through the cannula, which itself is passed through the skin 1000. Further, although
the devices and methods described herein are particularly useful for minimally invasive
surgery, such as arthroscopic surgery, they can also be used in open surgical procedures.
After a surgical opening is formed through skin 1000, a bore 1002 for inserting the device
310 can be formed in bone 1001 at the surgical repair site using techniques known to those
having skill in the art.
[0079]           As shown in FIG. 14A, the connecting filament 317 can be distal of the
snare assembly 320 (or other connecting filament), and more particularly can be placed in
the axial bore 316 with its distal end 317d in the distal end 316d of the bore 316. The
anchor 312 can be fixated into the bore 1002 using ordinary techniques, such as with a
driver that screws or taps the anchor 312 into place. The snare assembly 320 and the
connecting filament 317 can be coupled before, during, or after fixation of the anchor 312
into the bore 1002, and in one exemplary embodiment the snare assembly 320 is looped
through the connecting filament 317 prior to inserting the anchor 312 into the bore 1002.
In the illustrated embodiment the connecting filament 317 is not fixedly coupled to the
anchor 312, but because a diameter of the bore 316 is barely larger than a width formed by

                                                28
the loop of the connecting filament 317, generally the connecting filament 317 can remain
disposed within the bore 316. The distal end 317d of the connecting filament 317 can then
be brought into an anchored configuration in which it engages the distal end 316d of the
bore 316 by applying tension to the repair filament 320 approximately in a direction T.
The tension can be applied by the surgeon during the procedure and by the tissue during
and after the procedure is completed. In the anchored configuration, the connecting
filament 317 couples the repair filament 320 to the anchor 312. In alternative
embodiments, the anchor 312 can include one or more coupling features for receiving the
connecting filament 317 to maintain a location of the connecting filament 317 with respect
to the anchor 312.
[0080]          As shown in FIG. 14B, the terminal end 324 of the repair filament 320 can
be passed into and through at least a portion of tissue 1003 detached from the bone 1001.
Optionally, a needle or similar tool or device can be coupled to the terminal end 324 to
assist with threading the repair filament 320 through the tissue 1003. Likewise, other
shuttling techniques known to a person skilled in the art can also be used to pass the snare
assembly through the tissue.
[0081]          As shown in FIGS. 14C and 14D, a portion of the terminal end 324 can be
passed through the opening 332 of the snare 330 and the snare 330 can be collapsed or
dressed in a manner consistent with its snare type. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment the
snare 330 can be collapsed by moving the knot that forms the snare 330 away from the
terminal end 324.
[0082]          As shown in FIG. 14E, tension can be applied to the terminal end 324 by
pulling approximately in a direction D, thereby causing the collapsed snare 330 to slide
distally toward the tissue 1003 in a zip line-like manner until the snare 330 is adjacent to
the tissue 1003. This, in turn, can cause the tissue 1003 to move toward and into contact
with the bone 1001. Alternatively, tension can be applied to the terminal end 324 before
the snare 330 is dressed and after the snare 330 is adjacent to the tissue 1003, or some
combination of the two actions can be used, such as partially dressing the snare 330 before
zip-lining it toward the tissue 1003. As shown in FIG. 14E, in embodiments that include
the sleeve 350, as the snare 330 is slid distally toward the tissue 1003, the sleeve 350 can

                                                29
move proximally, out of the body. The sleeve 350, if included, can be removed at any
time, as shown in FIG. 14F for example. Final tensioning can be carried out by applying
tension to the terminal end 324, or the sleeve 350 if it remains associated with the snare
assembly.
[0083]          As shown in FIG. 14G, one or more half-hitches can be formed proximate to
the collapsed snare to allow for incremental or ratchet-like tensioning and/or to maintain a
location of the collapsed snare. After a first half-hitch is formed, the repair filament 320
can be further tensioned in an incremental or ratchet-like manner by applying tension to the
repair filament 320. The addition of a second or more half-hitches can lock the location of
the collapsed snare. Excess filament can then be trimmed and removed to complete the
procedure. Other techniques known to those skilled in the art can be used to maintain the
location of the collapsed snare, and thus the approximated tissue.
[0084]          FIGS. 15A-15G illustrate one exemplary method for performing a tissue
repair using the repair construct illustrated in FIG. 2A. A surgical opening can be formed
through skin 1000 and a cannula can be passed therethrough to create a surgical repair site
according to well known techniques. Similar to FIGS. 14A-14G, although cannulas are
often used to define a channel through which the procedure can be preformed, the cannula
is not shown in FIGS. 15A-15G for clarity of illustration. Accordingly, to the extent the
figures show components of the systems and devices passing through skin 1000, these
components would typically be extending through the cannula, which itself is passed
through the skin 1000. After a surgical opening is formed through skin 1000, a bore 1002
for inserting the device 410 can be formed in bone 1001 at the surgical repair site using
techniques known to those having skill in the art.
[0085]          In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 15A, the repair filament 420 is not
fixedly coupled to the anchor 412, but because a diameter of the bore 416 is barely larger
than a width formed by the two portions of the repair filament 420 disposed therein,
generally the repair filament 420 can remain disposed within the bore 416. Alternatively,
the repair filament 420 can be held in place by an insertion tool. Further, the connecting
filament 417 can be brought into an anchored configuration in which the connecting
filament 417 engages but does not pass through the bore 416 on the distal side 412d of the

                                               30
anchor 412 by applying tension to the repair filament 420 approximately in a direction T.
The tension can be applied by the surgeon during the procedure and by the tissue during
and after the procedure is completed. In the anchored configuration, the connecting
filament 417 couples the repair filament 412 to the anchor 420 approximately at or
adjacent to the distal end 412d of the anchor 412. In alternative embodiments, the anchor
412 can include one or more coupling features for receiving the connecting filament 417 to
maintain a location of the connecting filament 417 with respect to the anchor 412.
[0086]          Once the device 410 is disposed in the bore 1002, it can then be operated in
a manner similar to as described with respect to FIGS. 14B-14G. Thus, at least a portion
of the terminal end 424 of the repair filament 420 can be passed through at least a portion
of the tissue 1003 and through the opening 432 in the snare 430 and the snare 430 can be
collapsed or dressed, for instance by moving the knot that forms the snare 430 away from
the terminal end 424. The snare 430 can be slid distally toward the tissue 1003 by
applying tension to the terminal end 424 approximately in a direction F, which can result in
the snare 430 being adjacent to the tissue 1003 and the tissue 1003 moving towards the
bone 1001. Final tensioning and removal of the sleeve 450, if used, can occur, and one or
more half-hitches can be formed proximate to the collapsed snare 430 to allow for
incremental or ratchet-like tensioning and/or to maintain a location thereof. Excess
filament can then be trimmed and removed to complete the procedure.
[0087]          Procedures that use the devices and systems described herein can withstand
both high levels of load that result from tissue and bone movement after the procedure is
completed and high levels of load that can occur while the procedure is being performed.
For example, procedures that use devices such as the devices 310 and 410 can withstand
levels of load approximately in the range of about 2 kilograms and about 50 kilograms, and
in one embodiment can withstand levels of load of about 15 kilograms.
INSERTION ASSEMBLY AND USE THEREOF
[0088]          FIGS. 16-19E illustrate one exemplary way by which a surgical soft tissue
repair device can be implanted in bone. The surgical soft tissue repair device 1310
illustrated in FIG. 16 has a construction similar to the device 1110 described with respect

                                                31
to FIGS. 12A and 12B in that it includes a hard anchor 1312 having an axial bore 1316
formed therethrough, a repair filament 1320, and a connecting filament 1317, with the
connecting filament 1317 being located at a distal side 1312d of the anchor 1312 and the
repair filament 1320 being disposed around the connecting filament 1317. A diameter of
the axial bore 1316 can be barely larger than a width formed by the two portions of the
repair filament 1320 disposed in the bore 1316., and the repair filament 1320 can be
slidably coupled to the connecting filament 1317 such that it can move distally
approximately in a direction K and proximally approximately in a direction L as illustrated
by the arrows in FIG. 16 without falling away from the anchor 1312. Alternatively, the
repair filament 420 can be held in place by an insertion tool. In other embodiments the
repair filament 1320 can pass through the connecting filament 1317. The location of the
connecting filament 1317 with respect to the anchor 1312 can be maintained, for example,
by a guide (not illustrated) disposed around the anchor, as described in greater detail below
with respect to FIGS. 17-19E.
[0089]          The device 1310 can be removably coupled to an insertion tool 1370
configured to assist in placing the anchor 1312 in bone. As shown in FIG. 17, the insertion
tool 1370 can be in the form of an elongate tube that includes a proximal end 1370p having
a handle 1372, a distal end 1370d configured to mate with the anchor 1312, and a bore
1376 extending through the insertion tool 1370 to allow the repair filament 1320 to extend
therethrough. The handle 1372 can be manipulated by a surgeon to move the insertion tool
1370, and thus the anchor 1312 coupled thereto, in both a proximal direction and a distal
direction. While a number of different configurations can be used to couple the anchor
1312 to the insertion tool 1370, in the illustrated embodiment tension is applied to the
repair filament 1320 approximately in a direction T by tucking a proximal portion 132 0 p of
the repair filament 1320 into a receiving feature of the handle 1372. A proximal end
1312p of the anchor 1312 thus abuts the distal end 1370d of the insertion tool 1370,
rendering the anchor 1312 removably coupled to the insertion tool 1370. In alternative
configurations, any number of removable mating techniques and/or configurations can be
used to allow the anchor 1312 to be removably coupled to the insertion tool 1370. By way
of non-limiting example, the proximal end     13 12 p of the anchor 1312 can be removably
coupled to the distal end 1370d of the insertion tool 1370 by a male-female coupling

                                               32
feature that can be easily connected and disconnected by a surgeon from the proximal end
1370p of the insertion tool 1370.
[0090]          The insertion tool 1370 can have a variety of shapes and configurations, as
can the components thereof, depending at least in part on the size and shape of the device
1310 and other components with which the insertion tool 1370 is used. The insertion tool
1370 can generally be configured in a manner that is complementary to the design of the
device 1310. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the distal end 1370d of the
insertion tool 1370 is generally flat and has a diameter similar to the diameter of the anchor
1312, and the diameter of the insertion tool bore 1376 is similar to the diameter of the
anchor bore 1316 so that the two bores 1376, 1316 can be substantially aligned in use. Of
course, there is no requirement that these configurations be complementary provided the
two components can be adequately coupled for purposes of inserting the device 1310 into
bone. In some embodiments the insertion tool 1370 can have a diameter in the range of
about 1 millimeter to about 12 millimeters, and in one embodiment it has a diameter of
about 2 millimeters, and in some embodiments it can have a length in the range of about 5
centimeters to about 40 centimeters, and in one embodiment it has a length of about 25
centimeters. Any number of materials known to those skilled in the art for forming
insertion tools and handles can be used to form the insertion tool 1370 and handle 1372,
including but not limited to polymers and metals. In one exemplary embodiment the
insertion tool 1370 is formed from stainless steel and its handle 1372 is formed from
polycarbonate.
[0091]          As shown in FIG. 18, an insertion assembly 1300 can include the device
1310, the insertion tool 1370, a guide portion 1380, and a spacer element 1390, and can be
used to place the device 1310 in bone. The guide portion 1380 can be an elongate tube that
is disposed around at least a portion of the insertion tool 1370 and a portion of the anchor
1312. As a result, as shown in FIG. 18, a distal portion 1380d of the guide portion 1380
can hold the connecting filament 1317 against the anchor 1312 in embodiments of the
device 1312 in which the connecting filament 1317 would otherwise fall distally due to
gravity. The guide portion 1380 can also be used to align the device 1310 and the insertion
tool 1370 with the bore of the bone in which the device 1310 is to be disposed, as
described in further detail below with respect to FIGS. 19A-19E. A proximal end 1380p of

                                              33
the guide portion 1380 can include a handle 1382 that can be used by a surgeon to grip the
guide portion 1380 and can also provide additional support for the spacer 1390 to sit on as
shown.
[0092]          The spacer element 1390 can be any removable component configured to
maintain a space between the handle 1372 of the insertion tool 1370 and the handle 1382
of the guide portion 1380 when the spacer element 1390 is disposed between the insertion
tool 1370 and the guide portion 1380. The spacer element 1390 can prevent the insertion
tool 1370 from being moved distally. Such distal movement by the insertion tool would
cause the anchor 1312 to move distally into the bore 1002. Consequently, removal of the
spacer element 1390 can allow the insertion tool handle 1372 to be moved toward the
guide portion handle 1382 to insert the anchor 1312 into the bore, as described in greater
detail below with respect to FIGS. 19A-19E. In the illustrated embodiment the spacer
1390 is a tubular block adapted to sit primarily on one side of the insertion tool 1370,
although in other embodiments the spacer can sit primarily on the other side of the
insertion tool 1370 or substantially on both sides of the insertion tool 1370. A person
skilled in the art would recognize a number of other components and configurations that
can be used in place of the spacer element 1390 to allow for selective movement of the
insertion tool 1370 toward the guide portion 1380 to move the device 1310 distally into the
bore 1002.
[0093]          The guide portion 1380 and spacer element 1390 can have a variety of
shapes and configurations, depending at least in part on the shapes and dimensions of the
insertion tool 1370, the device 1310, and the components thereof. By way of non-limiting
example, a diameter of the guide portion 1380 can typically be just larger than a diameter
of the insertion tool 1370 so that a connecting filament 1317 disposed therebetween can be
held in place. In some embodiments the guide portion 1380 can have a diameter in the
range of about 1 millimeters to about 13 millimeters, and in one embodiment it has a
diameter of about 2.5 millimeters, and can have a length in the range of about 7
centimeters to about 50 centimeters, and in one embodiment it has a length of about 30
centimeters. A length of the spacer element 1390 can be configured based on the desired
insertion depth of the anchor 1312 into the bore 1002 because once the spacer element
1390 is removed, the insertion tool 1370 can slide distally until the insertion tool handle

                                               34
1372 abuts the guide portion handle 1382. The distance traveled by the insertion tool 1370
can also be the distance traveled by the anchor 1312 coupled thereto. Thus, if it is desired
that a proximal end 1312p of the anchor 1312 is substantially flush with a surface of the
bone, a length of the spacer element 1390 can be approximately equal to a length of the
anchor 1312 less any length of the anchor 1312 that extends distally beyond the guide
portion 1380 when the guide portion 1380 is disposed around the anchor 1312. In some
embodiments the spacer element 1390 can have a length in the range of about 3
millimeters to about 25 millimeters, and in one embodiment it has a length of about 10
millimeters. A person skilled in the art would recognize other configurations that can be
used with respect to the device 1310, insertion tool 1370, and guide portion 1380 to
achieve desired insertion depths without departing from the spirit of the present
disclosures. Further, any number of materials known to those skilled in the art for forming
guide portions and spacer elements can be used to form the guide portion 1380, its handle
1382, and the spacer element 1390, including but not limited to polymers and metals. In
one exemplary embodiment both the guide portion 1380 and the spacer element 1390 are
formed from stainless steel, while the guide portion handle 1382 is formed from
polycarbonate.
[0094]          FIGS. 19A-19E illustrate one exemplary method for performing a tissue
repair using the insertion assembly 1300 to insert the device 1310 into a bore 1002 formed
in bone 1001. A surgical opening can be formed through skin and a cannula can be passed
therethrough to access a surgical repair site according to well known techniques. Similar
to FIGS. 5A-5G, although cannulas are often used to define a channel through which the
procedure can be preformed, the cannula is not shown in FIGS. 19A-19E for clarity of
illustration. Accordingly, to the extent the figures show components of the systems and
devices passing through skin, these components would typically be extending through the
cannula, which itself is passed through the skin.
[0095]          The bore 1002 can be formed in the bone 1001 in which the device 1310 is
to be disposed using techniques known to those having skill in the art. As shown in FIG.
19A, once the insertion assembly 1300 is assembled by coupling the anchor 1312 to the
insertion tool 1370, disposing the guide portion 1380 around the insertion tool 1370, and
disposing the spacer element between the guide portion 1380 and the insertion tool 1370,

                                               35
the assembly 1300 can be moved to a location that is proximate to the bore 1002 for
insertion of the device 1310 therein. As shown in FIG. 19B, the distal end 1380d of the
guide portion 1380 can abut each side of the bone 1001 adjacent to the bore 1002, while
the distal side 1312d of the anchor 1312 can be inserted into the bore 1002. The
connecting filament 1317 can be disposed between the distal side 1312d of the anchor
1312 and the walls of the bore due to the guide portion 1380 maintaining the ends of the
connecting filament 1317 between the guide portion 1380 and the anchor 1312.
[0096]           As shown in FIG. 19C, the spacer element 1390 can be removed, and then
as shown in FIG. 19D, the insertion tool 1370 can be advanced distally to move the anchor
1312 into the bore 1002. Distal travel of the insertion tool 1370 stops when the insertion
tool handle 1372 abuts the guide portion 1382, resulting in the proximal end 1312p of the
anchor being substantially flush with the bone 1001. In the illustrated embodiment the
distance traveled by the anchor 1312 is the approximate length of the spacer element 1390.
Because the guide portion 1380 abuts the bore 1002 as the insertion tool 1370 travels
distally, as the anchor 1312 slides further out of the guide portion 1380 and into the bore
1002, the connecting filament 1317 can remain disposed adjacent to the anchor 1312,
between the anchor 1312 and the walls of the bore 1002. As shown in FIG. 19E, the guide
portion 1380 and insertion tool 1370 can be removed, leaving the device 1310 disposed in
the bone 1001 with a location of the repair filament 1320 with respect to the anchor 1312
being substantially maintained by the connecting filament 1317 trapped between the
anchor 1312 and the walls of the bore 1002. The repair filament 320 can subsequently be
used to repair soft tissue as described above, or using other procedures known to those
skilled in the art and/or described in other patent applications incorporated by reference
herein.
[0097]           The procedures discussed herein are just some examples of procedures that
can be performed in conjunction with systems, devices, and methods disclosed herein. A
person skilled in the art will recognize a number of other ways that the disclosed systems,
devices, and methods can be used in various other configurations and types of surgical
procedures.
