   BACKGROUND
   [0002       Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the major forms of chronic
   inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in humans. Intestinal bowel disease is an
   inappropriate immune response that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals as
   the result of a complex interaction among environmental factors, microbial factors
   and the intestinal immune system. It has been demonstrated that the excessive
   immune response to mucosal antigens inappropriately controlled by the normal
   counter-regulatory mechanisms leads to chronic intestinal inflammation.
   [0003]      Crohn's Disease is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disease of the
   gastrointestinal tract, characterized by segmental transmural inflammation and
   granulomatous changes. Typical presentations include the discontinuous involvement
   of various portions of the gastrointestinal tract and the development of complications
   including strictures, abscesses or fistulas. Because its cause is unknown, medical
   management of Crohn's disease is largely empirical and is designed to reduce
   inflammation. Medical therapy includes corticosteroids, antibiotics,
   immunosuppressant drugs, and anti-TNFi agents. Due to the therapeutic failures and
   serious side effects of present therapies, alternatives are needed.

                                               la
  [0004]      An important role in the pathogenesis of IBD is played by TGF-BI, a
  multifunctional cytokine capable of regulating the growth, differentiation, and
  function of immune and non-immune cells. A diminished ability to mount an
N
  efficient counter-regulatory TGF-BI response to inflammatory stimuli is believed to
  be relevant in the pathogenesis of disease such as 1BD. TGF-BI acts as a potent
  negative regulator of mucosal inflammation and that the inhibition of its activity

                                                2
   results in the development of colitis which shows immunomorphological similarities
   with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.
   [0005]       In the inflamed intestine of patients with IBD there is marked over
   expression of Smad7 (a protein that serves as substrates for TGF-31 receptors) and a
 5 reduction of Smad 3 phosphorylation, a crucial step in the TGF-31 mediated signal
   transduction. Thus, in IBD, high levels of Smad7 may lead to a defective TGF-131
   signaling resulting in an over-expression of pro-inflammatory molecules genes and
   TGF-Bl does not exert its anti-inflammatory role.
   [0006]       Antisense oligodeoxynucleotide drugs are short chains of DNA
10 nucleotides that inhibit protein translation by specifically binding to a small segment
   of messenger RNA (mRNA) responsible for driving the production of disease-causing
   proteins. The sequence of an antisense drug is designed to be complementary to its
   mRNA target such that, upon hybridization, the resulting double-stranded segment is
   recognized by the cell as abnormal and is destroyed, thereby preventing translation of
15 the message into the protein product.
   [0007]       Antisense therapeutics, however, are typically administered parenterally
   which can lead to adverse reactions due to systemic effects. Such administration may
   also be unable to localize at the site of needed treatment. Therefore, there is a need
   for a topical-like application of antisense treatments for the treatment of IBD and
20 related diseases using tablet based formulations.
   SUMMARY
   [0008]       This disclosure is directed, at least in part, to pharmaceutical formulations
   for oral administration of antisense oligonucleotides, such as antisense
   oligonucleotides against SMAD7.
25 [0009]       In an embodiment, a pharmaceutical tablet formulation for oral
   administration of an antisense oligonucleotide is provided that comprises an intra
   granular phase, wherein the intra-granular phase includes an antisense oligonucleotide
   such as that represented by SEQ ID NO 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
   thereof (such as a sodium salt), and a pharmaceutically acceptable filler, and which
30 may also include an extra-granular phase, that may include a pharmaceutically

                                                 3
     acceptable excipient such as a disintegrant. Contemplated oligonucleotides include
     those represented by SEQ ID NO 1, wherein at least one, or in certain embodiments,
     all, the internucleotide linkages are 0, 0- linked phosphorothioates.

 5   antisense oligonucleotide, and comprises an enteric coating. Such a tablet may, for
     example, include a filler, a disintegrant, and/or a lubricant. For example, provided
     herein is an oral dose form, such as a tablet, that comprises about 35mg to about
     500mg of an antisense oligonucleotide, e.g. 40 mg of an oligonucleotide represented
     by SEQ ID NO 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
10   [0011]        In an embodiment, provided herein is a tablet for oral use comprising:
     about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of an antisense oligonucleotide represented by
     SEQ ID NO I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; about 30% to about 50%
     by weight mannitol; and about 10% to about 30% by weight microcrystalline
     cellulose.
15    [0012]       For example, the disclosure provides a pharmaceutically acceptable tablet
     for oral use comprising an intra-granular phase and extra-granular phase, wherein for
     example, the intra-granular phase comprises about 5% to about 10%, by weight (for
     example about 8% by weight) of an antisense oligonucleotide represented by SEQ ID
      NO I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, about 40% by weight mannitol,
20    about 8% by weight microcrystalline cellulose, about 5% by weight
      hydropropylmethyl cellulose, and about 2% by weight sodium starch glycolate, and
      for example, the extra-granular phase comprises about 17% by weight
      microcrystalline cellulose, about 2% by weight sodium starch glycolate, and about
      0.4% by weight magnesium stearate, where the tablet may further comprise an enteric
25    coating.

      colitis, and chronic inflammatory bowel disease comprising administering to the
      patient in need thereof a tablet, oral dose or pharmaceutical formulation disclosed
      herein. For example, upon orally administering the pharmaceutical formulation, tablet
30    or oral dosage form to a patient, the pharmaceutical formulation, tablet or oral dosage

                                                4
   form may be substantially delivered to the terminal ileum and/or right colon of the
   patient.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    [0021]      The present disclosure is generally directed to pharmaceutical
20 compositions that include an antisense oligonucleotide, such as that depicted in
   FIGURE 1. Contemplated compositions include oligonucleotides that act against
   Smad7, and may be administered orally. Disclosed compositions may, when
    administered orally, deliver an effective amount of an antisense oligonucleotide to the
    intestinal system of a patient, e.g. deliver an effective amount of an antisense
25 oligonucleotide to the terminal ileum and/or right colon of a patient.
    [0022]      Contemplated antisense oligonucleotides include those comprising SEQ
   ID NO: 1 GTC* GCC CCT TCT CCC C*GC AGC, where C* represents 5-methyl-2'
   deoxycytidine. In some embodiments, at least one of the internucleotide linkages of a

   WO 2010/054826                                                          PCT/EP2009/008087
                                                  5
     contemplated antisense oligonucleotide is a 0,0-linked phosphorothioate, for
     example, each of the 20 internucleotide linkages of SEQ ID NO: I may be a 0,0
      linked phosphorothioate. In some embodiments, contemplated compositions
     disclosed herein may include a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, e.g. a sodium salt of
 5   the antisense oligonucleotide of SEQ ID NO :1, that optionally may include I to 20
     0,0-linked phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages. Contemplated salts of
     oligonucleotides include those that are fully neutralized, e.g., each phosphorothioate
     linkage is associated with an ion such as Na'. Oligonucleotides may include naturally
     occurring nucleobases, sugars, and covalent internucleoside (backbone) linkages as
10   well as non-naturally occurring portions. An exemplary antisense oligonucleotide,
     referred herein as AS1, is shown in FIGURE 1.
     [0023]       In some embodiments, contemplated herein are compositions suitable for
     oral delivery of an antisense oligonucleotide e.g., tablets, that include an enteric
     coating, e.g., a gastro-resistant coating, such that the compositions may deliver the
15   antisense compound to e.g. the terminal ileum and right colon of a patient. For
     example, such administration may result in a topical effect, substantially topically
     applying the antisense compound directly to an affected portion of the intestine of a
     patient. Such administration, may, in some embodiments, substantially avoid
     unwanted systemic absorption of the antisense compound.
20   [0024]       For example, a tablet for oral administration is provided that comprises
     granules (e.g., is at least partially formed from granules) that include a disclosed
     antisense compound, e.g., AS1, and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Such a
     tablet may be coated with an enteric coating. Contemplated tablets may include
     pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as fillers, binders, disintegrants, and/or
25   lubricants, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening,
     flavoring such as wintergreen, orange, xylitol, sorbitol, fructose, and maltodextrin,
     and perfuming agents, preservatives and/or antioxidants.
     [0025]       In some embodiments, contemplated pharmaceutical formulations include
     an intra-granular phase that includes a contemplated antisense compound, e.g. that
30   depicted in SEQ ID NO. 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, e.g. ASI, and a
     pharmaceutically acceptable filler. For example, ASI and a filler may be blended

                                              6
   together, with optionally other excipients, and formed into granules. In some
   embodiments, the intragranular phase may be formed using wet granulation, e.g. a
   liquid (e.g., water) is added to the blended antisense compound and filler, and then
   combination is dried, milled and/or sieved to produce granules. One of skill in the art
 5 would understand that other processes may be used to achieve an intragranular phase.
   [0026]       In some embodiments, contemplated formulations include an extra
   granular phase, which may include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable
   excipients, and which may be blended with the intragranular phase to form a disclosed
   formulation.
10 [0027]       A disclosed formulation may include a intragranular phase that includes
   a filler. Exemplary fillers include, but are not limited to, cellulose, gelatin,
   calcium phosphate, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, sorbitol, microcrystalline
   cellulose, pectin, polyacrylates, dextrose, cellulose acetate, hydroxypropylmethyl
   cellulose, partially pregelatinized starch, calcium carbonate, and others including
15 combinations thereof.
   [0028]       In some embodiments, a disclosed formulation may include a
   intragranular phase and/or a extragranular phase that includes a binder, which may
   generally function to hold the ingredients of the pharmaceutical formulation
   together. Exemplary binders include invention may be, but are not limited to, the
20 following: starches, sugars, cellulose or modified cellulose such as hydroxypropyl
   cellulose, lactose, pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,
   hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, low substituted
   hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl
   cellulose, sugar alcohols and others including combinations thereof.
25 [0029]       Contemplated formulations, e.g., that include an intragranular phase
   and/or an extragranular phase, may include a disintegrant such as but are not
   limited to, starch, cellulose, crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sodium starch
   glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, alginates, corn starch, crosmellose
   sodium, crosslinked carboxymethyl cellulose, low substituted hydroxypropyl
30 cellulose, acacia, and others including combinations thereof. For example, an
   intragranular phase and/or an extragranular phase may include a disintegrant.

     [0030]      In some embodiments, a contemplated formulation includes an intra
     granular phase comprising a disclosed antisense compound and excipients chosen
     from: mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, and
     sodium starch glycolate or combinations thereof, and an extra-granular phase
  5 comprising one or more of: microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate,
     and magnesium stearate or mixtures thereof.
     [0031]      In some embodiments, a contemplated formulation may include a
     lubricant, e.g. an extra-granular phase may contain a lubricant. Lubricants include
    but are not limited to talc, silica, fats, stearin, magnesium stearate, calcium
 10 phosphate, silicone dioxide, calcium silicate, calcium phosphate, colloidal silicon
    dioxide, metallic stearates, hydrogenated vegetable oil, corn starch, sodium
     benzoate, polyethylene glycols, sodium acetate, calcium stearate, sodium lauryl
     sulfate, sodium chloride, magnesium lauryl sulfate, talc, and stearic acid.
     [0032]      In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation comprises an
 15 enteric coating. Generally, enteric coatings create a barrier for the oral medication
    that controls the location at which the drug is absorbed along the digestive track.
    Enteric coatings may include a polymer that disintegrates a different rates
    according to pH. Enteric coatings may include for example, cellulose acetate
    phthalate, methyl acrylate-methacrylic acid copolymers, cellulose acetate

    methacrylic acid copolymers, ethylacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymers,
    methacrylic acid copolymer type C, polyvinyl acetate-phthalate, and cellulose
    acetate phthalate.
    [0033]      Exemplary enteric coatings include Opadry* AMB, Acryl-EZE®,
25  Eudragit® grades. In some embodiments, an enteric coating may comprise about 5%
    to about 10%, about 5% to about 20%, 8 to about 15%, about 8% to about 18%, about
     10% to about 12%, or about 12 to about 16%, of a contemplated tablet by weight. For
    example, enteric coatings may include an ethylacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymer.
    [0034]      For example, a tablet is provided that comprises or consists essentially
30  of about 0.5% to about 70%, e.g. about 0.5% to about 10%, or about 1% to about
    '')%, by weight of an antisense oligonucleotide or a pharmaceutically acceptable

    WO 2010/054826                                                     PCT/EP2009/008087
                                                8
       salt thereof (e.g. AS 1). Such a tablet may include for example, about 0.5% to
       about 60% by weight of mannitol, e.g. about 30% to about 50% by weight
       mannitol, e.g. about 40% by weight mannitol; and/or about 20% to about 40% by
       weight of microcrystalline cellulose, or about 10% to about 30% by weight of
  5    microcrystalline cellulose. For example, a disclosed tablet may comprise a intra
       granular phase that includes about 30% to about 60%, e.g. about 45% to about
       65% by weight, or alternatively, about 5 to about 10% by weight ASI, about 30%

       5% to about 15% microcrystalline cellulose, about 0% to about 4%, or about 1% to
 10    about 7% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and about 0% to about 4%, e.g. about
       2% to about 4% sodium starch glycolate by weight.
       [0035]      Exemplary formulations include dosage forms that include or consist
       essentially of about 35mg to about 500mg of AS1, for example, tablets that
       include about 35 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, 70 mg, 80 mg, 90 mg, 100 mg, 150
 15    mg, 200 mg, or 250 mg of ASI are contemplated herein.
       [0036]      In an exemplary embodiment, a pharmaceutically acceptable tablet for
      oral administration is provided that includes a intra-granular phase that may

25    [0037]       In another exemplary embodiment, a pharmaceutically acceptable tablet
      for oral administration is provided that includes or consists essentially of: a intra
      granular phase that may comprise or consist essentially of about 5% to about 10%,
      e.g., about 8% by weight ASI (e.g. wherein the internucleotide linkages are each
      0,0-linked phophorothioates, and/or salt thereof, e.g. a sodium salt), about 40%
30    by weight mannitol, about 8% by weight microcrystalline cellulose, about 5% by
      weight hydropropylmethylcellulose, and about 2.% by weight sodium starch

   WO 2010/054826                                                      PCT/EP2009/008087

     [0038]       Disclosed tablets may also include an enteric coating, e.g., a disclosed
 5   tablet may include about 13%, about 15%, 16%, 17% by weight of an enteric
     coating, e.g. AcyrIEZE@.
     [0039]       The rate at which point the coating dissolves and the active ingredient
     is released is its dissolution rate. In an embodiment, a contemplated tablet may
     have a dissolution profile, e.g. when tested in a USP/EP Type 2 apparatus (paddle)
10   at 100 rpm and 37 'C in a phosphate buffer with a pH of 7.2, of about 50% to
     about 100% of the oligonucleotide releasing after about 120 minutes to about 240
     minutes, for example after 180 minutes. In another embodiment, a contemplated
     tablet may have a dissolution profile, e.g. when tested in a USP/EP Type 2
     apparatus (paddle) at 100 rpm and 37"C in diluted HCI with a pH of 1.0, where
15   substantially none of the oligonucleotide is released after 120 minutes. A
     contemplated tablet, in another embodiment, may have a dissolution profile, e.g.
     when tested in USP/EP Type 2 apparatus (paddle) at 100 rpm and 37'C in a
     phosphate buffer with a pH of 6.6, of about 10% to about 30%, or not more than
     about 50%, of the oligonucleotide releasing after 30 minutes.
20   [0040]       Disclosed formulations, e.g. tablets, in some embodiments, when orally
     administered to the patient may result in minimal plasma concentration of the
     oligonucleotide in the patient. In another embodiment, disclosed formulations,
     when orally administered to a patient, topically deliver to the terminal ileum
     and/or right colon of a patient, e.g. to an affected or diseased intestinal site of a
25   patient.
     [0041]       Also provided herein are methods of treating Crohn's disease,
     ulcerative colitis, and/or chronic inflammatory bowel disease in a patient in need
     thereof administering a disclosed formulation.

     EXAMPLES
      [0042]      The examples that follow are intended in no way to limit the scope of this
      invention but are provided to illustrate the methods of the present invention. Many
     other embodiments of this invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art.
 5   Example I -Tablets
      [0043]      Wet granules were prepared by dispensing each intra-granular component
     into an appropriate container. All of the intra-granular materials were screened
     through a 710tm sieve and blended in a food processor bowl for around 5 minutes.
10   Water granulating fluid was added slowly using a syringe. The wet mass was passed
     through 2.00mm hand screen and dried in an oven at 40*C for up to 90 minutes. After
     drying, the granules were screened through 1.00mm hand screen. A mortar and pestle
     was employed to reduce the size of the coarse granules. The granules were blended
     with the extra-granular excipients except magnesium stearate using a Turbula blender
15   for 10 minutes at 42rpm. Magnesium stearate was added to the blend and further
     mixed for 2 minutes at 42rpm. Formulations were compressed on a Manesty F3
     single punch compression machine. An overall manufacturing process flow diagram
     for the AS I tablets may be seen in FIGURE 2.
      [0044]      The mannitol based 250mg dose strength formulation made at a 50g batch
20   size had a moisture content of the dry mix of 5.21% and a moisture content of the

   facilitate administration via the oral route. On Day 12, all animals received the
   intravenous control dose (phosphate-buffered saline) by slow push injection, followed
20 by intravenous doses of ASI on Days 14 and 19.

                                               18
   [0065]       Cardiovascular data and body temperature data were recorded via
   telemetry at frequent intervals prior to and for 24 hours following each dose
   administration. Respiratory function was assessed by measurement of blood gas
   parameters in arterial samples collected prior to dosing and 1, 6, and 24 hours
 5 following each dose, as well as by determining respiration rate (visually) at those
   same time points. Neurologic function was assessed by performing a comprehensive
   neurologic examination of all animals prior to the study within approximately 24
   hours after the end of the telemetry recording period following the last oral dose of
   test article and again within approximately 24 hours after the end of the telemetry
10 recording period following the last intravenous dose. Animals were also observed for
   clinical signs (mortality/morbidity, cage side observations, food consumption, and
   body weight).
   [0066]       Despite a very low LLOQ for the assay (0.5 ng/ml), ASI was not detected
   in any plasma samples following oral doses up to nearly 100 mg/kg. In contrast,
15 mean maximum plasma concentrations following IV injections were 28,309 and
    180,352 ng/ml for the 3 and 10 mg/kg doses, respectively. Clearance of ASI from the
   plasma following IC dosing exhibited kinetics similar to what has been reported for
   structurally related oligonucleotides (i.e., an approximate 0.5-hour half-life).
   Example 8 - 28 Day In-Vivo Study of ASI Administered Orally
20 [0067]       The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential toxicity and
   toxicokinetics of ASI when administered once daily orally to mice for 28 days
   followed by a 28 day recovery period. The AS1 formulation was prepared as a
   formulation containing a gastro-protective coating in the form of small coated beads
   ASI was layered onto inert beads which were then coated with Eudragit* S 100 to
25 mimic the oral formulations suitable for human use. Three groups administered
   different dose levels were used (30 mg/kg/day (low); 100 mg/kg/day; 300 mg/kg/day).
   [0068]       There were no gender-related differences in plasma or tissue levels.
   Despite a very low LLOQ for the assay, ASI was detected in only two plasma
   samples from very low dose (30 mg/kg/day) animals collected on Day I and not in
30 any samples collected on Day 28. At the higher dose levels of 100 and 300
   mg/kg/day,    ASI was quantifiable in most plasma samples, and the levels were

    WO 2010/054826                                                       PCT/EP2009/008087
                                                 19
      generally dose related. However, even at the highest dose level, the plasma levels did
      not exceed 21 ng/ml in any animal (in samples collected at various times between 0.5
      and 24 hours post-dose). ASI concentrations were very high in gastrointestinal (GI)
      tissues, with mean maximal concentrations at the highest dose level (following the
  5   first dose) of approximately 536, 857, 825, 538, 137 and 127 pg/gram of tissue for
      large intestine, small intestine, forestomach, glandular stomach, esophagus and
      rectum, respectively.
      [0069]       Extensive clearance from the GI tract tissues was evident by 24 hours after
      the first dose. There was no apparent accumulation of ASI with daily dosing.
 10   [0070]       Maximal mean concentrations in the two major organs of systemic uptake,
      kidney and liver, following the first dose of 300 mg/kg were only 4.0 and 2.3
      pg/gram, which is over 100 times lower than the range of concentrations measured in
      GI tissues.
      [0071]       Following the lowest dose of 30 mg/kg, the highest kidney and liver mean
15    concentrations were only 0.4 and 0.3 pg/gram. There was no evidence for
      accumulation of ASI in internal organs over the 28 day dosing period.
      [0072]       Systemic exposure to ASI in mice was very low following oral
      administration of high doses (up to 300 mg/kg/day) of ASI, delivered in gastro
      protected formulation and there was no accumulation in GI tissues or internal tissues
20    when administered daily for 28 consecutive days.
      Example 9 - Therapeutic effect of AS I on Colitis
      [0073]       To examine the therapeutic effect of AS 1 on the course of the intestinal
      inflammation in the TNBS-induced colitis model, mice were treated with a single
      dose of ASI or Smad7 sense oligonucleotide one day following intra-rectal
25    administration of TNBS. Single doses of 125 or 250 tg/mouse ameliorated weight
      loss and markedly reduced the severity histological manifestations of colitis.
      [0074]       ASI (given as a single 125 pAg dose one day after TNBS-colitis induction)
      significantly reduced the colonic production of the monomeric p40 subunit, a
      component of IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines, demonstrating inhibition of colonic
'4    n-oduction   of these pro-inflammatory cytokines.
