                      INSERT AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSPLANTING PLANTS
                 This application is a divisional application derived from Australian Patent
   Application No. 2014231773, the entire contents of which, as originally filed, are
   incorporated herein by reference.
 5 Field of the Invention
                 The invention relates to an insert for growing young plants in gel, and to an
   apparatus for transplanting young plants.                   More particularly, but not exclusively, the
   invention relates to an insert for facilitating automated transplanting of plants from the
   insert into soil.
10 Background of the Invention
                 It is known to provide very large numbers of plants for certain types of jobs such
   as, for example, planting alongside long stretches of roads and freeways. For such jobs,
   the plants may be provided in a number of ways such as by way of cuttings, by seeds, by
   tissue culture, or by division/splitting. However, the applicant has identified that the use of
15 cuttings is not possible for many plants and may be expensive; the use of seeds may
   provide too great variation in plant type/appearance; division/splitting may require a
   significant amount of labour, and tissue culture may be prohibitively expensive. However,
   the applicant has identified that while tissue culture may be an expensive method for
   growing young embryonic plants, it is beneficial in that it guarantees the most uniformity
20 in the plants grown which is advantageous in large jobs where uniformity of appearance is
   desired, such as in planting alongside long stretches of freeway roads. Also, the applicant
   has identified that the growing of plants by using tissue culture enables the plants to be
   grown in a sterile environment such that the plants can be taken between countries without
   being quarantine being required, whereas growing plants in soil may be prohibited or result
25 in quarantine for an extended period.
                 The ability to transport plants between countries when sterile enables the plants to
   be originated in a different country from the end market, for example in a laboratory where
   labour is cheaper. However the applicant has identified that there exists a problem in that

   H:\txb\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\TXB\16224936_.doc-22/12/2017
                                                               -2
   the sterile plants need to be transplanted in the destination country, that with existing
   methods this transplanting needs to be done manually, and that this is expensive in view of
   the manual labour required in the destination country which is typically a country of high
   labour cost.
 5               Examples of the invention seek to provide an improved apparatus and method for
   growing and transplanting young plants which overcomes                  or at least alleviates
   disadvantages associated with existing apparatus and methods.

   Detailed Description
 5               With reference to Figures 1 to 8, there is shown an insert 10 for growing embryonic
   plants, in accordance with an example of the present invention.               Advantageously, the
   insert 10 arranges the embryonic plants in such a way that a transplanting apparatus, such
   as an automated transplanting machine, is able to know where there plants are so that
   gripping fingers (or the like) of the transplanting apparatus are able to automatically
10 transplant the plants from the insert 10, thereby dramatically cutting down on the amount
   of labour and the associated costs in producing a large number of mature plants. As the
   insert 10 ensures that the plants are planted in an orderly array, the transplanting apparatus
   is able to be programmed to remove the plants with attached agar plugs from the insert 10
   for transplanting into soil.
15               The applicant has also identified that with completely independent cells/receptacles
   in the insert, the plants would not be able to share the agar food source.            However, in
   preferred examples of the present invention, the insert 10 may provide for continuity of the
   agar volume in the different cells/receptacles so that the plants are able to share food,
   thereby reducing the mortality rate as some plants may grow more quickly than others and
20 run out of food in an isolated cell.
                 More specifically, with reference to Figures 1 to 5, there is shown an insert 10 for
   growing plants 12, including a plurality of receptacles 14. The insert 10 is adapted for
   insertion into a container 16, and each of the receptacles 14 is arranged for receiving a
   separate one of the plants 12 with a portion of gel 18 for feeding the plant 12.              The
25 receptacles            14 may allow communication between the portions of gel 18 in the
   receptacles 14 to allow the plants 12 to share a common feed reservoir 20 of the gel. The
   receptacles 14 may be arranged such that all of the receptacles 14 are continuous with the
   common feed reservoir 20. For example, although the receptacles 14 are shown as being
   separate in the top view of Figure 1, Figure 2 shows several receptacles 14 through a side

   H:\txb\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\TXB\16224936_.doc-22/12/2017
                                                               -7
   of the container 16, wherein the receptacles 14 share the common feed reservoir 20. The
   common feed reservoir 20 may be shared by all of the receptacles 14 by allowing the
   receptacles 14 to be in fluid communication with all of the other receptacles 14, by
   providing an aperture in each of the receptacles               14.   Accordingly, each of the
 5 receptacles 14 may have a respective aperture 22 such that the portions of gel 18 are
   continuous with a common volume of gel 24 via each respective aperture 22.                   The
   aperture 22 may be located in a base 26 of the respective receptacle 14, as shown in the
   embodiment of Figures 6 to 8. The insert 10 shown in Figures 1 to 5 may be formed in a
   similar configuration to the insert of Figures 6 to 8, and may comprise a circular section
10 cut from the large rectangular insert of Figures 6 to 8.
                 In this way, by virtue of the apertures 22, when the insert 10 is in situ in the
   container 16, the container contains the gel and the insert 10 is immersed in the gel such
   that the gel rises to a common level in each of the receptacles 14. As shown in Figures 1
   to 3, the amount of gel may be controlled such that this level of the gel is at or just below
15 an upper surface of the insert 10.
                 The insert 10 may have one or more feet (not shown) to support the insert 10 above
   a floor 28 of the container 16 to provide space beneath the receptacles 14 for the common
   feed reservoir 20. The feet may be configured to support the receptacles 14 at least 3mm
   above the floor 28 of the container 16 so as to allow the common feed reservoir 20 to be of
20 a sufficiently large size to provide enough food for the entire number of plants in the
   container 16.
                 With reference to Figure 3, the walls 30 of each receptacle 14 are smooth to allow
   upward removal of the respective gel portion 18 as a plug together with the respective
   plant 12 for transplanting. The removed gel plug 32 intact with the respective plant 12 is
25 shown removed from the insert 10 in Figures 4 and 5.
                 The receptacles 14 may be arranged in a grid of rows and columns so as to
   facilitate automated removal of the plants 12. The plants 12 with the attached plugs 22
   may be removed from the insert 10 simultaneously, one row at a time, or individually,
   however an important common aspect is that the insert 10 enables a machine to know
30 where to locate each of the plants 12 in the container 16, which would not be possible

   H:\txb\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\TXB\16224936_.doc-22/12/2017
                                                                    -8
   without the insert 10, as the plants 12, without the structure provided by the insert 10, may
   be randomly distributed throughout the container 16.
                 Each of the receptacles 14 may be tapered inwardly (see Figure 8) toward a lower
   end 26 of the receptacle 14 so as to facilitate removal of the plugs 32 from the
 5 receptacles 14. As can be seen in Figure 4 and Figure 5, the plugs 32 are also tapered
   inwardly toward the bottom of the plugs 32.
                 The receptacles 14 may be sized with a top of each receptacle being square with
   12mm sides, and with a bottom being square with 9mm sides.                              The insert 10 may be
   circular with a diameter of approximately 95mm, as shown in Figures 1 to 3. This size
10 enables the insert 10 to be placed inside a container 16 of the type typically used for take
   away food. The insert 10 may have 37 receptacles 14 in total, being arranged in rows from
   one side to an opposite side with the following number of receptacles 14 in consecutive
   rows: 3, 5, 7, 7, 5 and 3.
                 The insert 10 may be formed of plastic material, and may be formed by plastic
15 injection moulding. The container 16 may be circular, as per a typical take away food
   container, and may have a lid for maintaining sterility within the container 16. Because the
   food source is provided in the form of the gel 18, the container 16 may be closed from the
   time of planting the plants 12 in the gel 18 until the container 16 is exported to the
   destination country at which time the lid can be removed as sterility is no longer required
20 once the container 16 has been brought into the destination country in its sterile form so as
   to avoid quarantine.
                 The gel 18 may be agar, supplemented with a nutrient and vitamin mixture that
   allows for seedling germination under sterile conditions. The seeds must be sterilised as
   well.
25               In another form, there may be provided a suitable container which has an integrally
   formed equivalent of the insert 10.                         In this way, the receptacles 14 may be integrally
   formed within the container, each of the receptacles being arranged for receiving a separate
   plant with gel for providing nutrition to the plant, the receptacles allowing communication

   H:\txb\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\TXB\16224936_.doc-22/12/2017
                                                               -9
   between the portions of gel in the receptacles to allow the plants to share a common feed
   reservoir of the gel.
                 In yet another form of the invention, there is provided an apparatus for
   transplanting plants from a container having integrally formed receptacles, or an insert as
 5 shown in Figures 1 to 3 or 6 to 8. The apparatus may be adapted to remove each of the
   plants by gripping the plant by the respective plug so as to maintain the plug intact for
   transplanting.                The apparatus may be in the form of a machine which operates
   automatically by being aware (either by programming or detection) of the number of
   receptacles in the container, and the spacing between the receptacles.
10               With reference to Figures 9 to 13, there is shown an insert 10 in accordance with
   another example of the present invention. The insert 10 depicted in Figures 9 to 13 is
   generally similar to the insert of Figure 1 and like features are labelled with like reference
   numerals. The main difference lies in that the insert of Figures 9 to 13 includes a feature
   specifically provided to maintain proper location of the insert 10 in the container 16. More
15 specifically, the insert 10 includes at least one arm 34 adapted to bear against the container
   16 to maintain the insert 10 in position relative to the container 16. In the example shown
   in Figures 9 to 13, the arm 34 is adapted to abut a lid of the container 16 to maintain the
   insert 10 in position relative to the lid. This may be achieved by arranging the arm 34 so
   that it has a length whereby a distal tip of the arm 34 terminates level with a lower surface
20 of the lid when the insert 10 is in situ resting on the floor 28 of the container 16, as shown
   in Figure 13.
                 As shown in Figure 9, the insert 10 may have a pair of opposed arms 34 located on
   opposite sides of the insert 10 so as to hold the insert 10 securely in position. The insert 10
   may also have feet 36 which extend below the receptacles 14 of the insert 10 so as to
25 support the receptacles 14 above the floor 28, as shown in Figures 12 and 13. As shown in
   Figure 12, the feet 36 may be configured also to sit against a sidewall of the container 16 to
   hold the insert 10 laterally relative to the container 16.
                 In the example shown, each arm 34 is foldable between an initial condition (see
   Figures 9 to 11) wherein the arm 34 extends parallel to a plane of the insert 10 to a folded
30 condition (see Figures 12 and 13) which is substantially perpendicular to the initial

   H:\txb\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\TXB\16224936_.doc-22/12/2017
                                                               - 10
   condition. The insert 10 may be formed with the arms 34 in the initial condition (parallel
   to the plane of the insert 10) to facilitate neat volume-efficient stacking of like inserts (see
   Figure 10). The receptacles 14 may also be tapered to facilitate stacking of the inserts 10,
   and the feet 36 may also be angled outwardly for this reason. Figure 11 shows detail of
 5 one of the arms 34 which may be scored where the arm 34 meets the remainder of the
   insert 10 such that the arm 34 can be bent upwardly along the score line to the folded
   upright condition.
                 By virtue of the arms 34, even if the closed container 16 is inverted the insert 10
   will remain in its proper position relative to the container 16 by virtue of the tips of the
10 arms 34 abutting against the lid of the container 16, thereby holding the insert 10 to sit
   against the floor 28 of the container 16.
                 The insert 10 may be transparent. Alternatively, the insert 10 may be opaque. The
   insert 10 may be provided with locating points in the form of the feet 36 having locating
   holes. In this way, the insert 10 may be used as a carrier tray and the locating holes can be
15 used as reference points for a machine to locate/remove the plants. The use of the locating
   holes as reference points for this purpose may be performed by a computer software
   program which controls operation of the machine for locating/removing the plants. The
   locating holes on the insert 10 may be used for lifting the insert 10 from the container 16,
   as reference points for a robotic machine automatically locating the plants to remove the
