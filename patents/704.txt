                                  ABSTRACT
      A transform wrapper is stored on a memory device and the memory
device may be included in a printer cartridge. The transform wrapper may
dynamically build a transform map for a printer based on metadata stored at
the memory device. The metadata may indicate at least one of a type of
depositing material, transform map, print media and printer.

                                      BACKGROUND
   [0001]     Output devices such as printers may implement a subtractive color
   model, like a cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CYMK) color model, while input
   devices such as computer monitors, mobile phones, and other input devices
   may implement an additive color model, like an red, green and blue (RGB) color
   model.
   [0002]     To output data from an input device, such as a graphic, text or a
   combination thereof, output devices may convert the additive color model into a
   subtractive color model via a print color transform.        Manufacturers and/or
   vendors are challenged to provide print color transform such that graphics
   and/or text are outputted from output devices, like a printer, with more accurate
   color representation.

                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0008]     Specific details are given in the following description to provide a
   thorough understanding of examples.         However, it will be understood that
   examples may be practiced without these specific details.          For example,
   systems may be shown in block diagrams in order not to obscure examples in
   unnecessary detail.
   [0009]     Print color transforms may be dependent on a particular ink or toner
   formulation. Therefore, it may be desirable to provide color tables along with
   the printer inks or toners, rather than include them in printer firmware or a
   printer driver. However, compared to storing color tables in printer firmware,
   the management of color data in printer supplies may be more complicated.
   For instance, a customer may have installed a mix of supply versions in the
   printer, and different supplies may have changes in inks and color tables and
   may support different media. In addition, those supplies may be used by
   multiple printers, or be used in printers that have not yet been developed.
   [0010]     Accordingly, examples herein may include a system embedded in
   the print    cartridge memory,      which   allows for multiple    versions and
   permutations of inks, color tables, print media, and/or printers.         In one
   example, a printer cartridge may include a memory device.            A transform
   wrapper may be stored on the memory device. The transform wrapper may
   dynamically build a transform map for a printer based on metadata stored at
   the memory device.       The metadata may indicate at least one of a type of
   depositing material, transform map, print media and printer.
   [0011]     The transform wrapper may use the metadata for building transform
   data from more primitive data elements, or other existing transforms. This

                                             3
   data transform or encoding may provide flexibility to handle the different
   versions and permutations that may arise, such as changes in inks, media
   support, color tables, and printers. For example, including a color table map on
   a printer cartridge may offer improved ink/toner types to customers that didn't
   exist at a time the original product was manufactured. Also, examples may be
   able to correct color tables in printers in the field for errors discovered after the
   start of manufacturing.
   [0012]     Further, examples may correct color tables due to changes in media
   and add support for media types that didn't exist at the time the product was
   manufactured.     Moreover, examples may introduce inks/toners with different
   color characteristics as well as introduce different improved color tables for a
   single color, without requiring the customer to replace all ink/toner supplies to
   correct for errors. Examples may further reduce a required memory storage
   space on the printer cartridge for storing color tables.
   [0013]     Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 is an example block diagram of
   a printer cartridge 100 including a transform wrapper 120 to build a transform
   map 140. The printer cartridge 100 may be any type of cartridge to store a
   depositing material.     Example depositing materials may include ink, toner,
   plastic, polymer, powder metal, alloy and the like. In one example, the printer
   cartridge 100 may be an ink cartridge that contains liquid ink for use with an
   inkjet printer. In another example, the printer cartridge 100 may be a toner
   cartridge that contains dry toner powder for use with a laser printer.
   [0014]     The printer cartridge 100 is shown to include a memory device 110.
   The memory device 110 may be any electronic, magnetic, optical, or other
   physical storage device. For example, the memory device 110 may be a

WO 2016/028272                                                            PCT/US2014/051684
                                            4
   Random Access Memory (RAM), an Electrically Erasable Programmable
   Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), a Read-only memory (ROM), flash memory,
   a storage drive or the like.
   [0015]      The memory device 110 is shown to store a transform wrapper 120,
   where the transform wrapper 120 includes metadata 130.                The transform
   wrapper 120 may refer to any type of container or wrapper format, such as a
   metafile format that describes how different data elements and metadata coexist
   in a file. The term metafile may refer to a file format that can store multiple types
   of data.     The term metadata 130 may include structural metadata and/or
   descriptive metadata.       Structural metadata may refer to the design and
   specification of data structures, such as a container of data.           Descriptive
   metadata may refer to individual instances of application data, such as the data
   content.
   [0016]      The transform wrapper 120 may dynamically build a transform map
    140 for a printer (not shown), such as laser or inkjet printer, based on the
   metadata 130 stored at the memory device 110.              The metadata 130 may
   indicate a type of the depositing material, transform map, print media and
   printer.    The metadata 130 will be explained in greater detail below with
   respect to FIG. 2.
   [0017]      The transform map 140 may be a type of color table and/or map.
   As explained above, a color table may be used to convert between different
   color models. For example, before an input image can be printed as a physical
   output, the input additive color model, such as RGB, may be converted to an
   output subtractive color model, such as CMYK. This may be done using a color
   table that transforms or converts RGB color data into CMYK color data.

WO 2016/028272                                                           PCT/US2014/051684
                                            5
   Examples of RGB color models may include sRGB, Adobe@ RGB, scan RGB,
   and the like. However, examples are not limited to the RGB and CYMK color
   models, and may include any type of input and/or output color models, such as
   the Specifications for Web Offset Publications (SWOP) CMYK model and the
   International Commission on Illumination (CIE) L*a*b* color model.
   [0018]      In one example, the transform map 140 may correspond to a
   particular media type. For example, particular paper types, or particular paper
   colors may have corresponding transform maps 140.                For example, one
   transform map 140 may correspond to plain paper and another transform map
   140 may correspond to thicker paper, such as company letterhead, or bond
   paper. In another example, different degrees of output quality may have different
   transform maps 140.        For example, a "draft" quality may have one transform
   map 140, and a "best" quality may have a different transform map 140. In yet
   another example, different input devices may have different corresponding
   transform maps 140. For example, different models of printers may have
   different corresponding transform maps 140.
   [0019]      While FIG. 1 show a single transform map 140, examples of the
   printer cartridge 100 may include a plurality of transform maps 140, such as for
   different types and/or versions of printers, media, depositing materials, users
   and the like. Moreover, while FIG. 1 shows a single printer cartridge 100, a
   plurality of the print cartridges 100 may be interfacing with a single printer. Each
   of these printer cartridges 100 may correspond to a different color.
   [0020]      For example, one of the printer cartridges 100 may include black ink
   and another of the printer cartridges may include cyan, magenta and yellow ink.
   In another example, one of the printer cartridges 100 may include black ink,

WO 2016/028272                                                          PCT/US2014/051684
                                            6
   another of the printer cartridges 100 may include cyan ink, yet another of the
   printer cartridges 100 may include magenta ink, and yet another of the printer
   cartridges 100 may include yellow ink. Further, each of these printer cartridges
   100 may contain the transform map 140. Also, the transform map 140 of one of
   the printer cartridges 100 may be influenced by another of the printer cartridges
   100, such as if different versions of the printer cartridges 100 are used together
   for a single printer.
   [0021]      FIG. 2 is example block diagram of a memory device 210 of FIG. 1.
   The memory device 210 of FIG. 2 may respectively include at least the
   functionality and/or hardware of the memory device 110 of FIG. 1.              For
   instance, the memory device 210 is shown to include a transform wrapper 220,
   which further includes metadata 230. Here, the metadata 230 is further shown
   to include a property 232, tag 234, condition 236 and recipe 238. Further, the
   memory device 210 is shown to store primitive data 250. While FIG. 2 shows
   a single property 232, tag 234, condition 236 and recipe 238, examples may
   include a plurality of the properties 232, tags 234, conditions 236 and/or recipes
   238. For instance, there may be separate tags 224 for the type of media, color
   space, supply family and the like.
   [0022]      The property 232 may describe primitive data 250 stored and/or
   generated by the printer cartridge 100.      The primitive data 250 may include
   basic color information about the contents of the printer cartridge 100, such as
   a version, depositing material channel, and/or dimension of the printer
   cartridge 110. The dimension may include a channel and/or count of nodes of
   a color table. The channel may relate to a type of color. The node may
   indicate output colorant amount.

WO 2016/028272                                                           PCT/US2014/051684
                                           7
   [0023]     The tag 234 may provide an identification of the printer cartridge
   100. For example, the tag 234 may include a color space, media type, print
   quality, printer platform, supply family, and the like. The condition 236 may
   restrict when the transform map 140 is available for use. For example, the
   condition 236 may specify which of a plurality of types of transform maps to
   use based on the tag 234. In one example, the condition 236 may include a
   Boolean expression of properties 232 and tags 234.                For example, the
   condition 236 may be used to specify exception color tables that handle cases
   such as multiple printer platforms, or multiple ink color revisions.
   [0024]     The recipe 238 may include instructions for how to build the
   transform map 140 from at least one of an existing map and the primitive data
   250. In one example, the instructions of the recipe 238 may utilize a stack
   model with reverse Polish notation (RPN) operators. The recipe 238 may use
   tags 234, to identify components, such as the existing map 238 and/or
   primitive data 250. Without tags 234, the recipe 238 would only be able to
   identify other components using their properties 232.                This may be
   problematic as the same set of properties 232 may describe multiple
   components. For example, there may be multiple channel map components
   that have the same channel color (e.g. Cyan) and node count (e.g.17-cubed)
   properties 232.
   [0025]     The transform map 140 may be a channel map and/or a color map.
   The color map may include a mapping for a plurality of colors while the
   channel map may include a mapping for only one of the plurality of colors.
   The color map may, for example, convert between the CYMK and RGB color

WO 2016/028272                                                           PCT/US2014/051684
                                           8
   models. The color map may include a plurality of the channel maps and the
   channel map may include the primitive data.
   [0026]      In one example, the recipe 238 may include instructions to select a
   plurality of the channel maps by matching at least one of the property 232 and
   the tag 234 of the primitive data and to combine the plurality of channel maps
   to build the color map.    Moreover, the primitive data may not be selected if
   there is a mismatch with the tag 234 and/or property 232. For example, the tag
   234 may match the media type, such as plain paper, but there may be a
   mismatch with the property 232, such as different colors.         In this case, the
   primitive data may not be used because of the mismatch with the property 232,
   despite the matching tag 234.
   [0027]      Each of the channel maps may correspond to one of a plurality of
   depositing material colors of the printer. For instance, the recipe may 238
   may define the operation for building a CMYK color map for color matching an
   RGB source color to a specific printer's plain paper, normal quality mode. Here,
   the condition 236 may be set to default, such that this color table will normally be
   used when referenced by a set (or subset) of matching tags 234. The recipe
   238 may specify that color data tables for the individual inks, e.g. channel maps,
   are to be determined by referencing the properties 2232, tags 234 and
   conditions 236, pushed onto the stack, and then combined to build the CYMK
   color map.
   [0028]      In another example, the recipe 238 may include instructions to build
   the channel map based on a neutral axis, a set of seed nodes and a delta
   table included in the primitive data 250. The neutral axis may relate to a line
   extending from an origin of a three-dimensional color table to a node of the

WO 2016/028272                                                        PCT/US2014/051684
                                           9
   color table farthest from the origin. The set of seed nodes may correspond to
   nodes of a compressed color table. The delta table may indicate a difference
   between an interpolated color table node and a corresponding actual color
   table. For example, the recipe 238 may define the operation for building the
   cyan channel map by pushing elements onto a stack, such as the neutral axis,
   set of seed nodes, and the delta table.
   [0029]      The transform map 140 may be a base and/or modifier map. The
   base map may be used without any modification by the printer. The modifier
   map may be used to modify at least one of the base map and the primitive
   data. In one example, the recipe 238 may include instructions to build a new
   map based on the modifier map and the base map. The modifier map may be
   used to specify scale, specify offset and/or select replacement of data of the
   base map.       For example, a draft-mode color table may be specified as a
   normal-mode color table modified with a small set of scale factors. For instance,
   the modifier map could be referenced by the base map's recipe 238 to change
   the node values in the base map.
   [0030]      Here, the conditions 236 may specify a printer platform and specific
   color ink versions. These conditions 236 may then be tested. If true, this color
   table may be used instead of the default. The recipe 238 may use inheritance to
   allow re-use of existing color data.  For example, the channel map for a prior
   printer platform may be pushed onto the stack. Next, a scalar modifier table may
   be pushed onto the stack. Finally, an operator may apply the scalar table to the
   inherited channel map.
   [0031]      The above examples for specifying the creation and application of
   transform maps 140 as well as other color management data elements may

   exist on the supplies (e.g. printer cartridges), may be updated in the supplies,
   and may be resolved run-time when a customer changes inks or toners. The
   metadata 230 including tags 234, properties 232, and conditions 236 may allow
   for versioning and special casing for the permutation of potential changes in
   printers, inks, and color tables. The tags 234 may also provide references to
   allow inheritance, where a color data element may be defined as a derivation of
   a different element.     The recipe 238 may specify the construction of color
   transform data, and also provide a means of specifying the construction of color
   data that is compactly derived from other data. In one example, the metadata
   230 may be compiled into a compact binary symbolic representation prior to
   storage in the memory device 210.
   [0032]      FIG. 3 is an example block diagram 300 of a computing device
   including instructions for generating a transform map at a printer cartridge. In
   the example of FIG. 3, the device 300 includes a processor 310 and a machine
   readable storage medium 320. The machine-readable storage medium 320
   further includes instructions 322, 324 and 326 for generating a transform map
   at a printer cartridge.
   [0033]      The computing device 300 may be, for example, a printer cartridge, a
   printer, a mobile device, a fax machine, multimedia device, a secure
   microprocessor, a notebook computer, a desktop computer, an all-in-one
   system, a server, a network device, a controller, a wireless device, or any
   other type of device capable of executing the instructions 322, 324 and 326. In
   certain examples, the computing device 300 may include or be connected to
   additional components such as memories, controllers, etc.

WO 2016/028272                                                           PCT/US2014/051684

   [0034]     The processor 310 may be, at least one central processing unit
   (CPU), at least one semiconductor-based microprocessor, at least one graphics
   processing unit (GPU), a microcontroller, special purpose logic hardware
   controlled by microcode or other hardware devices suitable for retrieval and
   execution of instructions stored in the machine-readable storage medium 320,
   or combinations thereof. The processor 310 may fetch, decode, and execute
   instructions 322, 324 and 326 to implement generating the transform map at
   the printer cartridge. As an alternative or in addition to retrieving and executing
   instructions, the processor 310 may include at least one integrated circuit (IC),
   other control logic, other electronic circuits, or combinations thereof that include
   a number of electronic components for performing the instructions 322, 324 and
   326.
   [0035]     The machine-readable storage medium 320 may be any electronic,
   magnetic, optical, or other physical storage device that contains or stores
   executable instructions.     Thus, the machine-readable storage medium 320
   may be, for example, Random Access Memory (RAM), an Electrically
   Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), a storage drive, a
   Compact Disc Read Only Memory (CD-ROM), and the like.                 As such, the
   machine-readable storage medium 320 can be non-transitory. As described in
   detail below, machine-readable storage medium 320 may be encoded with a
   series of executable instructions for generating the transform map at the printer
   cartridge.
   [0036]     Moreover, the instructions 322, 324 and 326 when executed by a
   processor (e.g., via one processing element or multiple processing elements of
   the processor) can cause the processor to perform processes, such as, the

   process of FIG. 4.      For example, the generate instructions 322 may be
   executed by the processor 310 to generate a transform map based on a
   property and a tag included at the printer cartridge (not shown). The test
   instructions 324 may be executed by the processor 310 to test a condition
   associated with the transform map and included at the printer cartridge.
   [0037]     The allow instructions 326 may be executed by the processor 310
   to allow the transform map to be used by a printer (not shown) if the tested
