solenoid coil, bobbin, pole piece, and at least part of the armature are disposed in
the interior region of the two-piece can. The second can component is adjustably
threaded to the first can component such that a longitudinal dimension of the interior
region of the two-piece can may be adjusted to vary the size of a gap between the
pole piece and the armature.

    [0001]     This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.

                                         FIELD
    [0002]     The present disclosure relates to solenoid operated valves.
                                    BACKGROUND
    [0003]     Solenoid   operated valves provide control of a         fluid, such as
pressurized air, which may be used to operate equipment such as sorters,
packaging machines, food processors, and the like. These valves may be operated
for millions of cycles.
    [0004]     As exemplified by U.S. Patent No. 8,783,653, solenoid valves typically
comprise a pole piece and a concentric bobbin wound with a coil of inductor wire
that is assembled into a one-piece outer casing or can. When the coil is energized,
magnetic forces are produced that attract an armature, which is also disposed within
the can. The armature defines a valve member that opens (or closes, depending on
the valve configuration) to control the flow of fluid. Typically, the valve member or
armature operates against a biasing member or spring, serving to urge the valve
member to its state of rest when the coil is not energized.

                                       SUMMARY
    [0005]     The subject disclosure provides for a multi-port valve comprising a
valve body and a valve member slidingly disposed within the valve body along a
longitudinal axis. The multi-port valve includes a solenoid coil extending about a
bobbin and an armature. The armature is coaxially aligned with the longitudinal axis
and at least part of the armature is slidingly disposed within the bobbin for
movement along the longitudinal axis from a de-energized position to an energized
position. The armature is configured to move to the energized position when
electricity is supplied to the solenoid coil. The armature is coupled to the valve
member such that the valve member is disposed in a sealing relationship with the
valve body to close one or more ports in the valve body when the armature is in the
de-energized position or energized position depending on the configuration of the
multi-port valve. A pole piece is coaxially aligned with the longitudinal axis and
disposed within at least part of the bobbin. A first can component is attached to the
valve body. The first can component has a first threaded portion. The multi-port
valve further comprises a second can component that has a second threaded
portion. The second threaded portion of the second can component is adapted to
mate with the first threaded portion of the first can component and thereby
adjustably join the second can component to the first can component. The first and
second can components cooperate to define an interior region. The coil, the bobbin,
the pole piece, and at least part of the armature are disposed in the interior region of
the first and second can components. The interior region has a longitudinal
dimension     measured along the longitudinal axis. The first and second can
components are threadably adjustable to adjust the longitudinal dimension of the
                                            2

interior of the can.  In other words, the longitudinal dimension of the interior region
may be increased or decreased by rotating the first and second can components
relative to one another about the longitudinal axis. This changes a longitudinal
position of the pole piece relative to the armature and allows for the precise
adjustment of a gap between opposing end surfaces of the pole piece and the
armature.
    [0006]     The disclosed multi-port valve improves upon conventional valve
designs in several respects. The disclosed valve can be assembled using fewer
parts and can be assembled more quickly at a lower cost. In addition to eliminating
several parts and machining steps needed to manufacture conventional valves, the
disclosed multi-port valve exhibits better magnetic flux distribution, resulting in a
solenoid coil that produces greater force for a given size. As a result of the greater
force, the multi-port valve can operate more quickly.         Operating speed is an
extremely important factor in many applications, such as sorting machines,
packaging machines, food processors, and the like.

                DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
     [0023]    Example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference
to the accompanying drawings.
     [0024]    For purposes of explaining the adjustable two-piece can technology,
an exemplary three-way valve has been illustrated in the drawings.             It will be
understood that the principles are readily applicable to other solenoid operated valve
configurations, including two-way valves and four-way valves, for example.
     [0025]    Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, the multi-port valve 10 includes a two-piece
can 12 that serves as the outer housing around the electromagnetic components of
the solenoid valve operator. The multi-port valve 10 has a longitudinal axis A. The
first can component 14 is threaded into the second can component 16.                More
specifically, the first can component 14 has a first threaded portion 18 that
threadably engages a second threaded portion 19 of the second can component 16.
An end cap 20 of the first can component 14 is provided with an outwardly
protruding electrical connector 22.     The end cap 20 is secured to the first can
component 14 by a fastener 24, such as a hex bolt, the details of which can be
better seen in Figs. 8 and 9 discussed below.
     [0026]    The second can component 16 is provided with an annular shoulder
that serves as a seat 26 for mating the multi-port valve 10 to a manifold 46, as
illustrated in Fig. 10, described more fully below. The second can component 16 is
also provided with a waist 28 of reduced diameter that accommodates a hold-down
plate 30, as seen in Fig. 10.
     [0027]    Referring to Fig. 10, the exemplary multi-port valve 10 is a three-way
valve that has a valve body 32 provided with 0-ring sealing structures 34, 36 and 38,
                                            5

that are designed to provide seals between the inlet, outlet and exhaust ports 40, 42
and 44, respectively. The O-ring sealing structures 34, 36, and 38 may be integral
or separate from the valve body 32. In Fig. 10, the valve body 32 has been inserted
into manifold 46. The manifold 46 has threaded couplings 40', 42', and 44' that are
disposed in fluid communication with the respective inlet, outlet and exhaust ports
40, 42 and 44. Fig. 10 shows the valve member 54, which serves as the operative
valve sealing member, used to open and close the multi-port valve 10 to control fluid
flow.   By way of example and without limitation, the valve member 54 may be
geometrically shaped as a poppet or spool valve. The valve member 54 is slidingly
disposed within the valve body 32 between a resting position (Fig. 11 A) and an
actuated position (Fig. 11 B).  Fig. 10 also shows a biasing member 56, such as a
spring, which urges the valve member 54 to its resting position (the position
assumed when solenoid coil 60 is not energized). A further discussion of the valve
member 54 and biasing member 56 is provided below in connection with Figs. 11 A
and 11B.
     [0028]    Referring to Figs. 7A, 8 and 9, the two-piece can 12 houses the
electrical solenoid components including the bobbin 58 about which a solenoid coil
60 is wrapped.    The ends of the solenoid coil 60 are coupled to first and second
conductor prongs 22a and 22b of the electrical connector 22 (the first and second
conductor prongs 22a and 22b being visible in Fig. 7A). As illustrated in Fig. 9, the
first can component 14 comprises a cylindrical body portion 14b and a contiguous
closed end portion 14c. The second can component 16 also includes a cylindrical
body portion 16b.      Together, the first can component 14 and the second can
                                           6

component 16 define an interior region 13. A pole piece 62 is disposed within the
interior region 13. Optionally, the pole piece 62 is contiguous with the closed end
portion 14c of the first can component 14 and extends longitudinally into the interior
region 13. Alternatively, the pole piece 62 is a separate component that is attached
to the closed end portion 14c of the first can component 14.
     [0029]    As illustrated in Fig. 12, the pole piece 62 and the closed end portion
14c define a continuous and gapless magnetic flux path that will be explained more
fully below.
     [0030]    Referring to Figs. 9 and 12, the bobbin 58 and the solenoid coil 60 are
inserted, as an assembly, into the interior region 13. As illustrated, approximately
one half of the bobbin 58 encircles the pole piece 62. The remaining half of the
bobbin 58 encircles an armature 64, allowing for a small gap 66 between the pole
piece 62 and the armature 64.
     [0031]    The end cap 20, with electrical connector 22, as seen in Fig. 9,      is
secured by a fastener 24 to the closed end portion 14c of the first can component
14. Electrical continuity between the electrical connector 22 and the solenoid coil 60
is provided through the metal conductor structure 68 formed in or carried by the
bobbin 58, as shown in Fig. 9.
     [0032]    Referring to Fig. 9, the first threaded portion 18 of the first can
component 14 and the second threaded portion 19 of the second can component 16,
allow the two can components 14, 16 to be adjustably connected by threading the
two can components 14, 16 together.            The second can component 16 has a
longitudinally extending bore 70 through an annular flange portion 72 that is sized to
                                             7

receive the armature 64, with sufficient spacing to allow reciprocating movement of
the armature 64 between a de-energized position (Fig. 11A) and an energized
position (Fig. 11 B). The interior region 13 of the first and second can components
14, 16 has a longitudinal dimension L that extends parallel to the longitudinal axis A.
The longitudinal dimension L of the interior region 13 is measured between the
inward facing surface of the flange portion 72 of the second can component 16 and
the closed end portion 14c of the first can component 14.        As will be explained
below, the longitudinal dimension L is adjustable. The outwardly facing surface of
the annular flange portion 72 serves as a shoulder against which one end of the
biasing member 56 presses to return the armature 64 to the de-energized position.
The other end of biasing member 56 contacts an axially outwardly extending
shoulder portion 73 of the armature 64. This other end of the biasing member 56
applies a biasing force that urges the armature 64 to its de-energized position.
When electricity is supplied to the solenoid coil 60, a magnetic force is created that
pulls the armature 64 towards the pole piece 62 and to the energized position,
compressing biasing member 56.
    [0033]     A threaded coupler 74 mates with the valve body 32 to support the
armature 64 in the second can component 16. The threaded coupler 74 provides an
inner circumferential surface that defines a seal with an O-ring 78 disposed about an
enlarged diameter portion of the armature 64. The valve body 32 is threaded onto
the threaded coupler 80, and is further threaded at 82 into the open end of the
second can component 16.       An O-ring seal 84 is provided between the threaded
coupler 74 and the valve body 32.
                                           8

     [0034]    The valve member 54 slides with the armature 64. The valve member
54 may be integral with the armature 64 or may be a separate component that is
attached to the armature 64. The valve member 54 and its operation in opening and
closing the multi-port valve 10 can best be seen in Figs. 11A and 11B.         Fig. 11A
shows the armature 64 in the de-energized position. When the armature 64 is in the
de-energized position, the distal end 86 of the valve member 54 makes resting
contact with the valve body 32. Fig. 11 B shows the armature 64 in the energized
position. When the armature 64 is in the energized position, the proximal end 88 of
the valve member 54 makes sealing contact with valve seat 90. The valve member
54 can be provided with an elastomeric jacket or over-molding to aid in forming a
tight seal.
     [0035]    In comparing Figs. 11 A and 11 B, it is noted that the gap 66 is reduced
in size when the solenoid coil 60 is energized. The longitudinal dimension L of the
interior region 13 and therefore the precise spacing of the gap 66 can be adjusted
with great precision by turning the first and second threaded portions 18, 19 of the
first and second can components 14, 16 relative to one another.                In some
applications, physical contact between the pole piece 62 and the armature 64 may
be desired.     In such cases, this contact is facilitated by the threaded coupling
between the first and second can components 14, 16. In other applications, it may
be desirable to be able to precisely adjust the force with which the solenoid coil 60
pulls the armature 64 when energized. This too can be adjusted, by rotating the first
and second can components 14, 16 about the longitudinal axis A and relative to one
another to adjust the size of the gap 66. A greater pulling force is developed as the
                                           9

armature 64 is situated closer to the pole piece 62 (i.e., reducing the gap 66 and
thus concentrating the magnetic flux).         Conversely, a reduced pulling force is
developed as the armature 64 is moved further from the pole piece 62 (i.e.,
increasing the gap 66 and thus diminishing the magnetic flux). Thus by adjusting the
longitudinal dimension L of the interior region 13, the magnetic pulling force can be
quite accurately fine-tuned.
     [0036]    In contrast with conventional solenoid valve designs, the disclosed
two-piece can 12 with a pole piece 62 that is part of the first can component 14
produces stronger solenoid pulling forces, by creating a magnetic flux path having
minimal gaps or discontinuities. This will be more fully explained with referenced to
Fig. 12.
     [0037]    Fig. 12 shows how exemplary magnetic lines of flux 100 generated by
the solenoid coil 60 are concentrated through the pole piece 62 and the armature 64.
The magnetic lines of flux 100 define closed paths, here illustrated as elongated
ellipses. The first and second can components 14, 16 are fabricated from steel or
other ferromagnetic material. As such, the first and second can components 14, 16
provide a very good flux path that concentrates the magnetic flux where it will have
maximal influence on the armature 64.          Generally, speaking, while ferromagnetic
materials provide a good flux path, air gaps provide a much poorer flux path. Thus,
the unitary construction of the pole piece 62 and first can component 14, and the
tightly threaded physical coupling between the first and second can components 14,
16, results in a closed flux path circuit with air gaps being largely eliminated.
                                             10

    [0038]    This is illustrated by flux line 100 for example, tracing how the path
traverses from the pole piece 62 at point A, through the closed end portion 14c of
the first can component 14 at point B, through the outer shell of the first can
component 14 at point C, through the threaded coupling between the first and
second can components 14, 16 at point D, through the second can component at
point E and then finally across a small gap between the annual flange portion 72 of
the second can component 16 and the armature 64 at point F and into the armature
64 at point G.     Except for the small gap at point F, provided to allow sliding
movement of the armature 64, the flux path illustrated by flux line 100 is able to
traverse essentially two unitary steel structures that are themselves joined by a
closely threaded connection that provides practically no air gap.
    [0039]    This concentration of the magnetic flux lines 100 by the integral
construction of the first can component 14 and pole piece 62, and the concentration
by the closely threaded connection between the two can components 14, 16, gives a
measurable improvement in flux concentration when compared with conventional
constructions whose assemblies incorporate inner component spacing that effect air
gaps over large surface areas. This improvement translates into stronger attractive
forces acting on the armature 64 when the solenoid coil 60 is energized.
