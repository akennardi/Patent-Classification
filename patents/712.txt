                                            Technical Field
[0001a]      This description relates to a hearing protection device, in particular a push-to-fit type
earplug made entirely of a closed-cell, slow-recovery foam.
                                             Background
[0002]       The use of hearing protective and noise attenuating devices are well known, and
various types of devices have been considered. Such devices include earplugs and semi-aural
devices including foam or rubber materials that are inserted into, or placed over, the ear canal of
a user to physically obstruct the passage of sound waves into the inner ear.
[0003]       Compressible or "roll-down" type earplugs generally comprise a compressible,
resilient body portion and may be made of suitable slow recovery foam materials. The earplug
may be inserted into the ear canal of a user by first rolling it between fingers to compress the
body portion, then pushing the body portion into the ear canal, and subsequently allowing the
body portion to expand to fill the ear canal.
[0004]       Push-to-fit type earplugs have also been considered, and may include a compressible
attenuating portion and a stiff portion that extends from the attenuating portion. To insert a push
to-fit type earplug, the user grasps the stiff portion and pushes the attenuating portion into the ear
canal with an appropriate level of force. The attenuating portion compresses as it is
accommodated in the ear canal. Push-to-fit type earplugs may allow the earplug to be quickly
and easily inserted in an ear canal, and may promote hygiene by minimizing contact with the
attenuating portion of the earplug prior to insertion.
[0005]       Although push-to-fit type earplugs exhibit desirable characteristics in various
applications, they may be costly and may pose difficult manufacturing challenges.
[0005a]      Reference to any prior art in the specification is not, and should not be taken as, an
acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general
knowledge in Australia or any other jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably be
expected to be understood, regarded as relevant and/or combined with other pieced of prior art

                                             Summary
[0006]       According to one aspect, the present disclosure provides an earplug including a body
having a sound attenuating portion defining a cavity located between the sound attenuating
portion and a semi-rigid stem portion, wherein the semi-rigid stem portion has a relatively
greater stiffness than the sound attenuating portion. The body is made entirely of a closed-cell,
slow-recovery foam, wherein the sound attenuating portion comprises a first composition and the
stem portion comprises a second composition different from the first composition, the sound
attenuating portion having a first density pl and the stem portion having a second density p2 , and
p2 is greater than pl.

                                        Detailed Description
[0015]      An earplug that provides hearing protection for a user, and a method of making an
earplug, is provided in the present disclosure. An earplug according to the present disclosure
includes a body having a sound attenuating portion and a semi-rigid stem portion having a
relatively greater stiffness than the sound attenuating portion. The body is made of a closed cell,
slow-recovery foam. The density of the sound attenuating portion may be relatively lower than
the density of the stem portion, such that at least part of the sound attenuating portion may be
comfortably inserted into the ear canal of a user and the relatively stiffer stem portion may be
grasped by a user to handle the earplug.
[0016]      The present disclosure further provides a method of making an earplug that
minimizes difficult and expensive manufacturing techniques while providing a push-to-fit type
earplug that may be easily handled and comfortably worn. The method may include the steps of
dispensing a foamable material into a mold, the mold having a first unvented cavity in the form
                                                  -2-

    WO 2015/105774                                                            PCT/US2015/010265
of a stem and a second vented cavity in the form of a sound attenuating portion, and curing the
material to form a push-to-fit type earplug including a sound attenuating portion having a first
average density and the stem portion having a second average density that is greater than the first
average density.
[0017]       Figures 1 and 2 show an exemplary push-to-fit type earplug 100 according to the
present disclosure. In an exemplary embodiment, earplug 100 includes a body made entirely of
closed cell foam. The body has a first end 111 and a second end 112, and includes a sound
attenuating portion 113 and a semi-rigid stem portion 114. Stem portion 114 is partially
surrounded by sound attenuating portion 113, and is partially exposed to allow a user to grasp
stem portion 114 to handle earplug 100 and to facilitate insertion of earplug 100 into an ear canal
of a user. Stem portion 114 does not extend to first end 111 and only sound attenuating portion
113 is present at first end 111. Only stem portion 114, and not sound attenuating portion 113, is
present at second end 112. That is, earplug 100 includes a leading end section formed entirely of
less stiff and/or less dense foam, a rear section formed entirely of stiffer and/or denser foam, and
an intermediate section including stiffer and/or denser foam covered by the less stiff and/or less
dense foam.
[0018]       In an exemplary embodiment, sound attenuating portion 113 has a tapered or cone
shape, and has a diameter at its widest point that is greater than a diameter of stem portion 114.
In various other embodiments shown in Figures 3A through 3D, for example, sound attenuating
portions 125, 126, 127, 128, respectively, may be hemisphere-shaped, bullet-shaped, bell
shaped, mushroom-shaped, or otherwise shaped to provide a desired fit or to suit a particular
application.
[0019]       During insertion of earplug 100, stem portion 114 provides a handle which may be
gripped by a user. Earplug 100, and specifically sound attenuating portion 113, is brought
proximate to the user's ear and inserted into the ear canal. Sound attenuating portion 113
compresses as it is positioned, and stem portion 114 provides sufficient stiffness to facilitate
insertion. In use, sound attenuating portion 113 is positioned substantially within an ear canal to
block the passage of sound and stem portion 114 extends outwardly from the ear canal to provide
a handle to remove the earplug.
[0020]       In various exemplary embodiments, sound attenuating portions 113 may include a
flange 118 extending outwardly and defining a flange cavity 119. Flange 118 may collapse
inwardly into flange cavity 119 upon insertion into an ear canal of a user.
[0021]       In an exemplary embodiment, stem portion 114 exhibits relatively greater rigidity or
stiffness than sound attenuating portion 113, without introducing hard edges or surfaces that may
                                                  -3-

    WO 2015/105774                                                           PCT/US2015/010265
reduce comfort of a wearer of earplug 100. Stem portion 114 provides sufficient rigidity that
earplug 100 may be positioned for use at least partially in the ear of a user by pushing sound
attenuating portion 113 into the ear canal with an appropriate force. That is, earplug 100 having
a sufficiently stiff stem portion 114 combined with an appropriate sound attenuating portion 113
allows earplug 100 to be positioned for use at least partially in the ear of a user without the need
to first compress or "roll down" sound attenuating portion 113. Direct insertion without the need
to first compress or "roll down" sound attenuating portion 113, for example, promotes hygiene
by limiting contact with sound attenuating portion 113 prior to placement in the ear. Stem
portion 114 also exhibits an appropriate level of flexibility such that it may slightly deform to the
contours of the ear canal when positioned for use, as discussed in greater detail herein.
[0022]       In an exemplary embodiment, sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114 are
both made of a slow-recovery foam. Slow recovery foam does not immediately return to its
original shape after compression, but rather expands relatively slowly to its original shape. A
stem portion made of slow recovery foam, and not including an additional non-foam stiffener
element, provides a unique feel to a user handling the earplug. Further, a stem portion made of
slow recovery foam is able to flex, bend and compress, for example, when a portion of earplug
100 is inserted into an ear canal of a user. As a result, a stem portion made of a slow-recovery
foam, as opposed to a solid plastic, elastomeric, rubber or non-foam material, for example, may
provide a more comfortable fit as perceived by a user of earplug 100. Additionally, an earplug
100 including a sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114 made of a slow recovery
foam may provide the ability of both sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114 to
compress when inserted into an ear canal, thus better conforming to a user's ear canal. Such an
earplug is more likely to remain comfortable in a user's ear canal, even during prolonged periods
of use.
[0023]       Creep compliance measures the evolution of strain with time at a constant load.
Greater compliance suggests an increased propensity of material to conform under a load. A
slow recovery foam that is sufficiently stiff to be pushed into an ear canal while exhibiting creep
compliance within an appropriate range is able to at least slightly conform to an ear canal of a
user and may result in greater perceived comfort by a user, especially when used for longer
periods of time. In an exemplary embodiment, the combination of a stem portion 114 made
entirely of slow recovery foam and having such creep compliance values may provide a
particularly desirable fit.
[0024]       Stem portion 114 may be made of one or more materials and processes resulting in a
specified hardness. A desired hardness may depend on the dimensions of stem portion 114 such
                                                  -4-

    WO 2015/105774                                                         PCT/US2015/010265
that stem portion 114 exhibits a desired stiffness. In an exemplary embodiment, an earplug 100
exhibiting relatively high hardness values in combination with slow recovery foam properties,
for example, provides a unique feel to a user when handling the earplug and upon insertion into
an ear canal.
[0025]      Sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114 are made from one or more foam
materials that can suitably bond to, and are otherwise compatible with, one another. In an
exemplary embodiment, sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114 are joined by a
chemical bond. The terms "chemical bonding" or "chemically bonded" refer to physical
phenomena responsible for the attractive interactions between atoms and molecules. Such bonds
include covalent and ionic bonds, as well as hydrogen and Van der Waal's bonds and can depend
on the manufacturing process, chemical composition and available functional groups of the
foam of sound attenuating portion 113 and/or stem portion 114, as discussed in greater detail
herein. In an exemplary embodiment, chemical bonding between foam sound attenuating
portion 113 and foam stem portion 114 is facilitated by the use of identical or chemically similar
compositions, and the materials of sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114 are
selected such that the primary source of bonding between the foam sound attenuating portion
113 and foam stem portion 114 is chemical bonding. An additional adhesive is not required to
bond sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114, and such an adhesive is not present
between sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114 in an exemplary embodiment.
[0026]      In some exemplary embodiments, sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion
114 are formed from a composition including a blend of polyether polyurethane and an acrylic
polymer, such as Hypol 2000 available from The Dow Chemical Company and Encor 154S
available from Arkema, Inc. In other exemplary embodiments, sound attenuating portion 113
may include a blend of polyether polyurethane and an acrylic polymer and stem portion 114 may
be formed from a material composition including a diisocyanate and a polyol, such as Modur PF
available from Bayer, Corp. Other suitable materials for forming sound attenuating portion 113
may include foamed thermoplastic resins, and other soft, pliable foams that may be comfortably
positioned in an ear canal of a user. Other suitable materials for forming stem portion 114 may
include foamed thermoplastic resins, and other suitable materials that may be foamed to exhibit
an appropriate stiffness such that sound attenuating portion 113 of earplug 100 may be easily
inserted into the ear canal of a user while allowing a desired level of compliance to provide a
comfortable fit. In various exemplary embodiments, various additional materials may be
included, such as pigments, cell regulators, deionized water, and/or other suitable materials as
                                                 -5-

    WO 2015/105774                                                          PCT/US2015/010265
known in the art. The resulting material is a hydrophilic or hydrophobic, slow recovery, and
dynamically stiff foam.
[0027]      In an exemplary embodiment, stem portion 114 has a generally circular or rounded
cross-section such that stem portion 114 exhibits a generally cylindrical shape. A circular cross
section may minimize edges that may cause discomfort by contacting portions of a user's ear. In
various other exemplary embodiments, elongate core may have a triangular, square, or other
suitable cross-section, or may have a cross-section that varies along the length of earplug 100.
[0028]      In some exemplary embodiments, earplug 100 defines a channel. Earplug 100 having
a body defining a channel may be manufactured such that components of a receiver or of a
communication system, for example, may be attached to earplug 100. Alternatively or in
addition, a channel may accommodate one or more filters or other passive hearing elements to
provide an attenuation curve having a desired shape. For example, filters positioned in a channel
may cause nonlinear attenuation of high level impulses produced by explosions, gunfire, or the
like. A channel may also provide a recess that a cord may be attached to, such that first and
second earplugs may be joined, or that ends of a headband may be attached to in a semi-aural
hearing protector.
[0029]      Materials of sound attenuating portion 113 and/or stem portion 114 may be selected
to control the friability of the sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114 such that they
may not easily be broken or disintegrate during use. The friability of an earplug may be
controlled in part by selecting a material having an appropriate molecular weight, with higher
molecular weight generally resulting in a less friable earplug. In an exemplary embodiment,
sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114 includes a foam polymer having a molecular
weight between 100,000 Daltons and 200,000 Daltons, as measured by gel permeation
chromatography analysis as known in the art, such as according to ASTM D6474 - 99.
[0030]      The density of sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114 can be controlled
during manufacturing to provide a specified density as desired for a particular application and to
control the density of sound attenuating portion 113 as compared to stem portion 114. Sound
attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114 may exhibit densities that vary slightly at different
locations, for example, such that sound attenuating portion 113 has an integral outer skin that is
denser than the remainder of sound attenuating portion 113. Such a skin may be present on one
or both of sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114. Alternatively, sound attenuating
portion 113 and stem portion 114 may have substantially uniform densities. In an exemplary
embodiment, irrespective of the presence of an integral outer skin or varying densities within
sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114, sound attenuating portion 113 has a first
                                                  -6-

    WO 2015/105774                                                           PCT/US2015/010265
density p1 and the stem portion has a second density p2. First and second densities p1 and p2
can be found by averaging the densities at each location of sound attenuating portion 113 or stem
portion 114. In some embodiments, first and second densities can be approximated by
measuring mass and volume of sections or portions of sound attenuating portion 113 and stem
portion 114 to calculate first and second densities p1 and p2.
[0031]      The density provides an indication of the ability of sound attenuating portion 113 or
stem portion 114 to compress or otherwise conform when subjected to an external force. First
average density p1 of sound attenuating portion 113 is selected such that sound attenuating
portion may provide a comfortable fit by conforming to the ear canal of a user, while providing a
desired level of sound attenuation. In various exemplary embodiments, the first average density
p1 of a sound attenuating portion 113, comprising a polyurethane foam for example, is between
100 kg/m 3 and 250 kg/m 3, or 110 kg/m 3 and 160 kg/m 3, or may be about 125 kg/m 3. The second
average density p2 of stem portion 114 is greater than the first average density p 1, and in various
exemplary embodiments is between 100 kg/m 3 and 400 kg/m 3, 225 kg/m 3 and 275 kg/m 3, or may
be about 250 kg/m 3. Accordingly, in various exemplary embodiments, the second average
density p2 of stem portion 114 is greater than the first average density p1 or may be 1.5, 2, 3, 4
or more times the first average density p1 of sound attenuating portion 113.
[0032]      In an exemplary embodiment, sound attenuating portion 113 has a first relative
density p Ir and stem portion 114 has a second relative density p2r. Relative density refers to the
density of a foam (i.e., the bulk density) divided by the density of the solid material forming the
cell walls, etc., of the foam. Relative density is therefore generally greater in foams having
smaller cells and/or thicker cell walls and lower in foams having larger cells and/or thinner cell
walls. A relative density of foam provides an indication of the total cell volume and can provide
an indication of a stiffness of foam made of a particular material. That is, for a given material
and cell structure, a lower relative density suggests a lighter and/or more flexible foam, while a
greater relative density suggests a heavier and/or stiffer foam. A relative density of non-cellular
polymers, or other polymers not commonly referred to as foams, may exhibit a relative density
of 1 or nearly 1, because the density of the sample and the density of the material of which it is
made are equal or approximately equal due to limited, or completely absent, cell volume.
[0033]      Relative densities of sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114 may be
controlled to provide an earplug 100 having desired characteristics. In an exemplary
embodiment, sound attenuating portion 113 has a first relative density that is lower than a second
relative density of stem portion 114. In an exemplary embodiment, sound attenuating portion
113 has a first relative density p Ir of between approximately .03 and .75, .05 and .5, or of about
                                                  -7-

    WO 2015/105774                                                          PCT/US2015/010265
.15. Stem portion 114 has a second relative density p2r of between approximately .04 and 0.9,
0.5 and 0.8, or of about 0.3. Accordingly, second relative density p2r may be greater than plr, or
approximately 1.5, 2, 3, 4 or more times first relative density p Ir.
[0034]      The modulus and hardness of sound attenuating portion 113 and stem portion 114 can
be controlled during manufacturing to provide a specified modulus and/or hardness as desired
for a particular application and to control the modulus and/or hardness of sound attenuating
portion 113 as compared to stem portion 114. In various exemplary embodiments, a stem
portion 114 may have a hardness between approximately 100 kPa and 2500 kPa, 250 kPa and
2000 kPa, or between about 500 kPa and 900 kPa, and a modulus between approximately 1000
kPa and 10,000 kPa, 1500 kPa and 5000 kPa, 1800 kPa to 3000 kPa. In various exemplary
embodiments, sound attenuating portion 113 may have a hardness between approximately 50
kPa and 500 kPa, or between about 100 kPa and 200 kPa, and a modulus between approximately
100 kPa and 2000 kPa, 200 kPa and 1500 kPa, or between about 250 kPa and 1000 kPa.
Accordingly, an exemplary earplug may have a sound attenuating portion 113 having a first
modulus that is 1/10, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, or other fraction of a second modulus exhibited by a stem
portion 114, and may have a sound attenuating portion 113 having a first hardness that is 1/5,
1/4, 1/3, 1/2, or other fraction of a second hardness exhibited by a stem portion 114.
Accordingly, a stem portion 114 as described herein may be provided that exhibits a modulus
and/or hardness that is greater than a modulus and/or hardness of a sound attenuating portion
113, while both stem portion 114 and sound attenuating portion 113 are made from a closed-cell,
slow recovery foam, for example. The above modulus and hardness values have been found by
the present inventors to provide a desired level of stiffness such that stem portion 114 may be
used as a handle to facilitate insertion of sound attenuating portion 113 at least partially into an
ear canal, while providing compliance and conformability such that the earplug may be
comfortably worn by a user, particularly during extending periods of use.
[0035]      The present disclosure provides a method of making personal protective equipment,
such as earplug 100 described above. An exemplary method includes steps of dispensing a
foamable material into a mold, the mold having a first unvented cavity in the form of a stem and
a second vented cavity in the form of a sound attenuating portion, and curing the material to
form a push-to-fit type earplug including a sound attenuating portion having a first average
density and the stem portion having a second average density that is greater than the first average
density. Such a process allows an earplug comprising a body made entirely of foam, and in

stem to facilitate insertion and a soft, pliable sound attenuating portion that may be comfortably
worn by a user.
[0036]       In an exemplary embodiment, an earplug is formed in a dispensing molding process
in which a mold cavity forming the stem portion is unvented, for example is not vented or has
limited venting, to result in a relatively stiffer and/or denser stem portion, while a mold cavity
forming the sound attenuation portion is allowed to vent or provides relatively greater venting to
result in a relatively less stiff and/or less dense sound attenuating portion. Accordingly, a body
is formed having a sound attenuating portion with a stiffness and/or density that is lower than the
stiffness and/or density of a stem portion. Such a process allows an earplug made entirely of
foam, and in some exemplary embodiments made of a uniform chemical composition, that
provides a stiff stem to facilitate insertion and a soft, pliable sound attenuating portion that may
be comfortably worn by a user.
[0037]       An exemplary earplug as described herein may be made by a two-shot molding
process including the steps of dispensing foamable material into an unvented cavity of a mold, at
least partially curing the foamable material in the unvented cavity, dispensing foamable material
into a vented cavity of the mold, and at least partially curing the material in the vented cavity to
form a push-to-fit type earplug including a compliant sound attenuating portion and a relatively
stiffer and/or denser stem portion. In an exemplary embodiment, a mold 400 includes mold
inserts 401, 402, and 403. Mold inserts 402 and 403 may be interchangeable or used in
combination to provide a stem cavity 415 and a sound attenuating cavity 425, respectively. In a
first configuration shown in Figure 4A, a stem cavity 415 is defined by mold inserts 401 and
402. In a second configuration shown in Figure 4B, a sound attenuating portion cavity 425 is
defined by mold insert 401, mold insert 403, and/or a portion of a foamed material in stem cavity
415.
[0038]       In an exemplary embodiment, a foamable material is dispensed into a volume of stem
cavity 415 defined by mold insert 401 in a first shot. Mold insert 402 is then clamped to mold
insert 401 to form a substantially closed stem cavity 415 that provides limited or no venting.
The foamable material is allowed to at least partially expand, form, and/or cure before mold
inserts 401 and 402 are separated. In a second shot, a foamable material is dispensed into a
volume of a sound attenuating portion cavity 425 defined by mold insert 403, for example, and
mold insert 403 is clamped to mold insert 401 to form a vented sound attenuating portion cavity
425. Excess gas is allowed to escape from cavity 425, out of the mold and/or partially into stem
cavity 415, as the foamable material expands. In various exemplary embodiments, cavity 425
has a total vent area between 0.05 mm 2 to 3.25 mm 2, 0.45 mm2 to 1.25 mm 2 , or about 0.75 mm 2.

The foamable material is allowed to at least partially expand, form, and/or cure before mold
inserts are separated. As the foamable material cures, a chemical bond is formed between
material in sound attenuating portion cavity 425 and material in stem cavity 415.
[0039]       In other exemplary embodiments, a sound attenuating portion may be formed in a
first shot and the stem portion formed in a second shot. In some exemplary embodiments, stem
portion is formed and chemically bonded to a sound attenuating portion without being removed
or reinserted into a mold cavity, in contrast to traditional insert molding processes, for example.
[0040]       Mold 400 may be prepared as appropriate for a selected foamable material and as
desired to achieve an earplug having selected characteristics. In various exemplary
embodiments, mold 400 is warmed to a desired temperature, for example about 450 C, and an
interior surface contacted by foamable material may be coated with polypropylene, or other
suitable material that facilitates release of a formed earplug.
[0041]       Figure 5 shows a mold 500 of an exemplary method of making a push-to-fit type
earplug in a single-shot molding process. In an exemplary embodiment, the method includes
steps of dispensing foamable material into a mold, the mold having a first unvented cavity in the
form of a stem and a second vented cavity in the form of a sound attenuating portion, and curing
the material to form a push-to-fit type earplug including a compliant sound attenuating portion
and a relatively stiffer and/or denser stem portion. In an exemplary embodiment, a mold 500
includes mold inserts 501 and 502. Mold inserts 501 and 502 provide a stem cavity 515 and a
sound attenuating cavity 525, respectively. Stem cavity 515 is defined at least in part by mold
insert 501 and sound attenuating portion cavity 525 is defined by mold insert 501, mold insert
502, and/or a portion of a material in stem cavity 515.
[0042]       In an exemplary embodiment, a foamable material is dispensed into a volume of stem
cavity 515 and/or sound attenuating cavity 525 in a first shot. As the foamable material expands,
material will be present in both stem cavity 515 and sound attenuating cavity 525. Excess gas is
allowed to escape from sound attenuating cavity 525 while stem cavity 515 is unvented,
resulting in an elevated pressure relative to at least portions of sound attenuating cavity 525. The
foamable material is allowed to at least partially expand, form, and/or cure before mold inserts
501 and 502 are separated. As the foamable material cures, the material in stem cavity 515
forms a relatively stiffer and/or denser stem due to increased pressure while the material in
sound attenuating cavity 525 forms a relatively less stiff and/or less dense sound attenuating
portion.

[0043]       The operation of embodiments according to the present disclosure will be further
described with regard to the following detailed examples. These examples are offered to further
illustrate the various specific embodiments and techniques. It should be understood, however,
that many variations and modifications may be made while remaining within the scope of the
present description.
Procedure 1: Modulus and Hardness Test
[0044]       Modulus is the constant of proportionality describing a relationship between stress
and strain in the elastic regime. Hardness is the maximum contact pressure sustained by a
sample under stress. Modulus and hardness were measured according to the following
procedure.
[0045]       Samples were prepared by sectioning an earplug lengthwise and adhering the uncut
surface to a 1 inch diameter aluminum puck using HARDMAN DOUBLE/BUBBLE Extra-Fast
Setting Epoxy #04001, specified as having a mixed viscosity at 25 'C of 40,000 cps. Epoxy was
positioned around the edges of the sample at a thickness of the height of the sample, while
avoiding epoxy on the cut surface of the sample or otherwise infiltrating the body of the sample.
Tests were conducted using an AGLINET G200 Nanoindentor in XP mode using a 1 mm
spherical ruby probe with the aluminum puck mounted on the sample stage of the nanoindentor
such that the exposed cut surface of the sample was flat and normal to the nanoindentor axis.
Testing was conducted using an i.) approach distance of 30 um with approach velocity of 50
nm/s; ii.) surface find criteria of 100 N/m; iii.) strain rate of 0.5 ^s-1; iv.) depth setpoint of 100 to
250 um; and v.) dwell time after peak load of 10 seconds.
[0046]       The following equations were used to determine Modulus and Hardness, with E            =
Reduced Modulus (kPa); H       = Hardness (kPa); S    = Stiffness (N/m); Pmax    = Maximum Load (N);
hmax   =  Maximum Displacement (m); R      = Radius of Indenter (m); and A       = Contact Area (M 2).

Examples 1 - 3
[0050]      The earplugs of Examples 1 through 3 were prepared in a two-shot molding process
using a mold shown and described with respect to Figures 4A and 4B. A mixture including 86.5
parts Hypol 2000 polyether polyurethane prepolymer, available from The Dow Chemical Co.,
73.6 parts Encor 154S acrylic latex material, available from Arkema, Inc., 19.0 parts water based
pigment available from DayGlo Color Corporation, and 4.0 parts surfactant cell regulators was
prepared and dynamically mixed using a dynamic high shear mixer at an average rate of between
10 revolutions/grams of material pumped and 30 revolutions/grams of material pumped.
[0051]      Molds were prepared by applying an H-15-IN mold release available from
Releasagen Manufacturing Inc. and heating the molds to approximately 45      0 C. Mixed material
was dispensed into sound attenuating portion cavity and a mold top was placed on the mold to
provide a vented cavity in the form of a sound attenuating portion. After partially curing, the
mold top was removed and replaced with a mold insert to form an unvented stem cavity. A
second mixture including 99.5 parts Hypol 2000 polyether polyurethane prepolymer, available
from The Dow Chemical Co., 73.6 parts ENCOR 154S acrylic latex, available from Arkema,
Inc., 19.0 parts water based pigment available from DayGlo Color Corporation, and 4.0 parts
surfactant cell regulators, were dispensed into the stem cavity and allowed to blow, form and
cure. The cured earplug was extracted from the mold and dried. Modulus and hardness data was
collected according to Procedure 1 at a central stem location approximately at a middle of the cut
surface, and at a sound attenuating location on the cut surface. Results are reported in Table 1
below.
Examples 4 - 6
[0052]      The earplugs of Examples 4 through 6 were prepared in a two-shot molding process
