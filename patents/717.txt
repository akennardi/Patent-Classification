                                 FOOTBALL GAME-PLAY SIMULATION APPARATUS
                   This application is a divisional application derived from Australian Patent
   Application No. <removed-apn> (which was derived from Australian Patent Application No.
   2008229721) , the entire contents of which, as originally filed, are incorporated herein by
 5 reference.
   Field of the Invention
                   This invention relates to a football game-play simulation apparatus and, more
   particularly but not exclusively, to a simulation apparatus for simulating catching (or
   "marking") of a football in Australian Rules Football.
10 Background of the Invention
                   For many, one of the highlights of Australian Rules Football is when one of the
   players catches the football (known as "marking"), and particularly when a spectacular
   mark is taken by one player supporting himself on another player so as to reach the
   football. Such a mark is commonly referred to as a "specky" or a "screamer", and brings
15 players a great deal of publicity and respect from supporters.
                   The applicant has identified that it is difficult to practice the taking of specky
   marks, as players involved in taking specky marks are often injured in doing so,
   particularly the player(s) being used as a support.                        Moreover, non-professional football
   players, particularly children, may be prone to serious injury by attempting to emulate the
20 professional footballers seen taking specky marks.                           Accordingly, the applicant has
   determined that it would be beneficial for there to be provided an apparatus which enables
   safe training and recreation by simulating specky marks.
   Summary of the Invention
                   In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a football
25 game-play simulation apparatus including a figure representing a football player, the figure
   being adapted to receive a user who jumps/climbs onto the figure, wherein the figure is
   resiliently deformable to deform from an upright state in response to weight of the user
   being transferred to the figure and to support the user for simulating utilisation of a football

                                                                    -2
   player for support during contesting catching of a football, and wherein the figure is
   resiliently returned to the upright state after transfer of the weight from the figure.
                   Preferably, the apparatus has a user approach, the figure faces away from the
 5 approach, and the figure is resiliently deformable in a forward direction to facilitate
   approach of the user from behind the figure. More preferably, an upper portion of the
   figure is arranged to pivot forwardly relative to a base portion of the figure, about an axis
   located at or near a waist of the football player represented by the figure. Even more
   preferably, a resilient member is coupled between the upper portion and the base portion to
10 oppose pivoting of the upper portion relative to the base portion. In a preferred form, the
   resilient member is adjustable to vary a rate of resilience provided by the resilient member.
                   Preferably, the resilient member is a spring and/or a shock absorber.
15                 Preferably, a height of the figure is adjustable. More preferably, the figure includes
   a plurality of pivot locations which are selectable for raising/lowering the axis of the upper
   portion relative to the base portion so as to adjust the height of the figure.
                   In a preferred form, the figure includes a torso sleeve which is arranged for being
20 fitted over the upper portion.                          More preferably, the apparatus has a stowed condition
   wherein the torso sleeve is removed from the upper portion and the upper portion is
   collapsed to a compact configuration in which the upper portion lies substantially parallel
   to a ground support of the figure.
25                  In one form, the figure is inflatable.               Preferably, the figure has a plurality of
   sleeves, each for receiving a separate brace member, and resilience of the figure is able to
   be adjusted by installing and removing the brace members.
                    Preferably, arms of the figure are raised to simulate jumping to catch a ball
30 overhead.

                                                                 -3
                   Preferably, the apparatus includes a cushion mat forward of and to each lateral side
   of the figure. More preferably, the cushion mat rests on a ground support of the figure.
                   In one form, the cushion mat is inflatable. Preferably, the cushion mat has separate
 5 inflatable zones. In one example, the inflatable cushion mat is adapted to be sealed during
   use. In an alternative example, the inflatable cushion mat is vented during use, with a
   continuous supply of pressurised air.
                   Preferably, goal posts are received in post receiving apertures formed in the mat, at
10 a location forward of the figure.                       More preferably, the brace members are anchored in
   brace receiving apertures formed in the mat.
                   It is preferred that the football game-play simulation apparatus includes a ball
   support which suspends a ball in a space generally above the figure. More preferably, the
15 ball is releasably held by the ball support such that the user is able to remove the ball from
   the ball support. Even more preferably, the ball is releasably attached to the ball support
   by way of hook and loop fasteners.
                   Alternatively, the simulation apparatus includes a ball which is thrown into a space
20 generally above the figure.
                   In one particular form, the figure is depicted in team colours of an Australian Rules
   Football team.

   Detailed Description
                     With reference to Figures 1 to 9, there is shown a football game-play simulation
20 apparatus 10 in accordance with a first example of the invention, wherein a figure 12 of the
   apparatus 10 is formed of pivotally connected rigid parts. The apparatus 10 is arranged to
   enable a user 14 to safely mount the figure 12 to simulate taking a spectacular "specky"
   football mark riding on the back of the figure 12, and then to safely dismount the figure 12.
   The user 14 runs towards the figure 12 from behind, and jumps onto the back of the figure
25 12 to mark a ball, so as to simulate football game-play associated with "specky" football
   marks. Due to the figure 12 being formed of rigid parts, this version of the invention is
   considered as being suitable for older children (say between the ages of 6 and 14 years
   old).
30                   More particularly, the football game-play simulation apparatus 10 includes the
   figure 12 which represents a football player. The figure 12 is adapted to receive the user

   H:\txb\Introven\NRPortbl\DCC\TXB\1827302_ldoc-l 03/2016
                                                           -6
    14 who jumps/climbs onto the figure 12. The figure 12 is resiliently deformable to deform
   from an upright state in response to weight of the user 14 being transferred to the figure 12
   and to support the user 14 for simulating utilisation of a football player for support during
   contesting catching of a football. The figure 12 is resiliently returned to the upright state
 5 after transfer of the weight from the figure 12.
                    The apparatus 10 has a user approach 16 along which the user 14 runs to build
   momentum prior to jumping onto the back/shoulders of the figure 12, as shown in
   Figure 1. The figure 12 faces away from the approach 16 and is resiliently deformable in a
10 forward direction 18 to facilitate approach of the user 14 from behind the figure 12.
   Accordingly, when the user 14 jumps/climbs onto the figure 12, the figure 12 is able to
   resiliently deform so as to simulate the movement of a football player. Also, the resilient
   deformability of the figure 12 assists in softening the impact for the user 14, and facilitates
   supporting of the user 14 during contesting catching of the football.
15
                   A cushion mat 18 is provided forward of the figure 12 and also to lateral sides of
   the figure 12 to enable the user 14 to fall from taking the mark without injuring his or her
   self. The cushion mat 20 has a cutaway portion 22 in which the figure 12 is located, so as
   to provide good access to the figure 12 while providing cushioning to either side in case
20 the user 14 falls to one side of the figure 12.
                   With reference to Figures 2 to 4, the figure 12 is formed by a frame 24 which
   comprises an upper portion 26 and a base portion 28. The upper portion 26 is arranged to
   pivot forwardly relative to the base portion 28 about an axis 30 located at or near a waist of
25 the football player represented by the figure 12. The base portion 28 is held upright by a
   strut 32 which extends between the base portion 28 and a ground support 34. A resilient
   member 36 is coupled between the upper portion 26 and the base portion 28 to oppose
   pivoting of the upper portion 26 relative to the base portion 28. The resilient member 36
   may be in the form of a spring (as shown in Figure 3), or may be in an alternative form
30 such as, for example, a shock absorber. The resilient member 36 may be adjustable by
   way of a control knob 38 or the like so as to vary a rate of resilience provided by the

   H:\txb\Introven\NRPortbl\DCC\TXB\1827302_ldoc-l 03/2016
                                                           -7
   resilient member 36. In this way, the apparatus may be tuned according to the ability and
   body weight of the user 14.
                   Figure 4 shows the direction of pivoting of the upper portion 26 relative to the base
 5 portion 28 in response to weight of the user 14 being transferred to the figure 12. Figure 5
   shows a torso sleeve 40 which is fitted over the upper portion 26, as shown. The torso
   sleeve 40 may be formed of compressed rubber material which is itself resiliently
   deformable to assist in lifelike operation of the figure 12.            Figures 6 and 7 show front
   views of the figure 12, with the torso sleeve 40 in place over the upper portion 26. As can
10 be seen, arms 42 of the figure 12 are raised to simulate jumping to catch a ball overhead.
                   With reference to Figure 8, the height of the figure 12 may be height adjustable by
   providing a plurality of pivot locations which are selectable for raising/lowering the axis
   30 of the upper portion 26, by extending the base portion 28. The figure 12 may be raised
15 or lowered accordingly to suit the requirements of the user 14.
                   As shown in Figure 9, the apparatus 10 may be portable.           In particular, the
   apparatus 10 may be brought into a stowed condition by removing the torso sleeve 40 from
   the upper portion 26, and by collapsing the upper portion 26 to a compact configuration in
20 which the upper portion 26 lies substantially parallel to the ground support 34. This may
   be achieved by decoupling the strut 32 from between the base portion 28 and the ground
   support 34, so as to pivot the base portion 28 downwardly as shown in Figure 9. Where
   the cushion mat 20 is inflatable, the mat is simply deflated for stowing, and the entire
   apparatus 10 may be carried in a bag, as shown.
25
                   With reference to Figures 10 to 15, there are shown versions of the football game
   play simulation apparatus 10 in accordance with another example of the present invention
   in which the figure 12 is inflatable. The versions shown in these drawings are considered
   suitable for younger children (say, between the ages of 3 and 6 years old). Like features of
30 the football game-play simulation apparatus 10 shown in Figures 10 to 15 are shown with

   H:\txb\Intrwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TXB\1827302_ldoc-l 03/2016
                                                                      -8
   like reference numerals to the corresponding features in the apparatus shown in Figures 1
   to 9.
                    The figure 12 is provided with a figure inflation point 44 which is separate from the
 5 main inflation point 46 which is used for inflating the cushion mat 20. Accordingly, the
   cushion mat 20 and the figure 12 have separate inflatable zones, with the advantage that a
   puncture in one of the zones will not result in a complete collapse of the apparatus 10. The
   cushion mat 20 itself may also have its own separate inflatable zones internally.
10                 In contrast to the apparatus 10 shown in Figures 1 to 9, the figure 12 may extend
   only to a top surface of the cushion mat 20.                             This results in a simplification as to the
   structure of the apparatus 10, however the resilient deformability of the figure 12 is
   retained simply by virtue of the figure 12 being inflatable.
15                 As shown in Figures 11 and 12, the figure 12 may have a plurality of receptacle
   sleeves 48, each of which is adapted for receiving a separate brace member 50.                                 The
   resilience of the figure 12 is able to be adjusted by inserting and removing the brace
   members 50, as appropriate.                             As such, the feature of the removable brace members 50
   serves a similar function to the control knob 38 of the apparatus 10 shown in Figures 1 to
20 9. For example, a minimum amount of resilience may be achieved by removing all of the
   brace members 50; an increased level of resilience may be achieved by insertion of one
   brace member 50 in a central one of the receptacle sleeves 48; a further increased level of
   resilience may be achieved by insertion of two brace members 50 in the outer receptacle
   sleeves 48 and by removal of the brace member 50 from the central receptacle sleeve 48;
25 and a highest level of resilience may be achieved by insertion of a brace member 50 in
   each of the receptacle sleeves 48.                            The brace members 50 may be anchored in brace
   receiving apertures 52 formed in the cushion mat 20.
                    The cushion mat 20 may, in one form, be sealed during use, such that it is inflated
30 prior to use and does not allow air to be released from the inside of the cushion mat 20
   during use. Alternatively, the inflatable cushion mat 20 may be vented during use, with a

   H:\txb\Intrwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TXB\1827302_ldoc-l 03/2016
                                                           -9
   continuous supply of pressurised air, in a similar manner to systems used for inflatable
   castles, and the like, used at fairs.
                   Figures 13 and 14 show examples of football game-play simulation apparatuses 10
 5 wherein the figure 12 is depicted in team colours of an Australian Rules Football team.
   More particularly, in each case, the figure 12 is formed so as to appear to be wearing a
   guernsey similar to guernseys worn by football players from the respective Australian
   Rules Football teams. The cushion mat 20 may also be adomed in team colours.
10                 As shown in Figure 15, an example of a football game-play simulation apparatus
    10 having an inflatable figure 12 may be provided with a ball support 54 which suspends a
   ball 56 in a space generally above the figure 12. The ball support 54 may be anchored to
   the cushion mat 20 by inserting a base of the ball support 54 into a corresponding
   receptacle 58 formed in the cushion mat 20. The ball 56 may be releasable held by the ball
15 support 54 such that the user 14 is able to remove the ball 56 from the ball support 54.
   This may be achieved by way of attaching the ball 56 to the ball support 54 by hook and
   loop fasteners, for example of the kind sold under the trade mark Velcro. Alternatively, a
   ball may instead be thrown into a space generally above the figure 12, either manually by a
   supervisor/trainer or automatically by a ball machine.
20
                    Goal posts 60 may be received in post receiving apertures 62 formed in the cushion
   mat 20, at a location forward of the figure 12, to provide the user 14 with further features
   reminiscent of an actual football field.
25                 Figures 16 to 20 show a football game-play simulation apparatus 10 in accordance
   with a further example of the present invention. The apparatus 10 shown in these figures
   bears similarities to the apparatuses shown in Figures 1 to 15, and like features are shown
   with like reference numerals. The main differences between the apparatus 10 shown in
   Figures 16 to 20 over the versions described above reside in the ball support 54 being fixed
30 to a forward side of the figure 12, and in the resilient member 36 being in the form of a
   pair of shock absorbers 64, as can be seen in Figure 18. In particular, the shock absorbers

   H:\txb\Introven\NRPortbl\DCC\TXB\1827302_ldoc-l 03/2016
                                                           - 10
   64 are coupled between the upper portion 26 (mounted at either side of the upper portion
   26) and upright struts 65 which extend to a base frame 69 of the apparatus 10. As the
   upper portion 26 of the figure 12 pivots forward, the shock absorbers 64 retract
   accordingly. The resilience provided by the shock absorbers 64 causes the figure 12 to
 5 return to the upright state, as shown in Figure 19, once the user has dismounted and the
   user's weight is transferred from the figure 12. A cushion mat similar to the mats of the
   versions described above may be placed around the figure 12, and its associated structure
   66, so as to provide cushioning to prevent injury of the user 14.
10                  The components forming the apparatus 10 are shown in the exploded view in
   Figure 20. Advantageously, the base frame 69 of the apparatus 10 may be formed of steel,
   and may be provided with wheels for easy movement of the apparatus 10. The base frame
   69 may be covered by way of modular cover portions 66a, 66b, 66c and 66d to avoid
   injury to the user 14.
15
                   A football game-play simulation apparatus in accordance with another aspect of the
   present invention is shown in Figures 21 to 23. This apparatus 10 includes a plurality of
   figures 12 (eg. four or five) grouped to simulate a pack mark. In particular, there are five
   player figures 12 depicted in mid-action positions and arranged in a generally arcuate
20 configuration with an opening of the arcuate configuration facing rearward to facilitate
   entrance of the user 14 to mount the pack of figures 12, as shown in Figures 21 and 22.
                   A screen 68 may be provided at a rear end of the apparatus 10. The screen 68 may
