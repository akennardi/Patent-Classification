                                    Abstract
   A gaming system is disclosed that comprises a selector
   arranged to select a plurality of symbols from a set of
 5 symbols for display in a display position area in a
   plurality of display position groups. The gaming system is
   arranged to facilitate selection of at least one display
   position group, and so as to make symbols in the at least
   one selected display position group less visible than
10 symbols in other non-selected display position groups.
   The gaming system is also arranged so as to determine a
   first game outcome based on symbols displayed in the non
   selected display position groups when symbols of the at
   least one selected display position group are less visible
15 than symbols in the non-selected display position groups.
   After the first game outcome is determined, the symbols in
   at least one selected display position group are made as
   visible as symbols in the non-selected display position
   groups, and after making the symbols in the at least one
20 selected display position group as visible as symbols in
   the non-selected display position groups, the system
   determines a second game outcome based on symbols
   displayed in the non-selected display position groups and
   symbols displayed in the at least one selected display
25 position group that has been made as visible as symbols in
   the non-selected display position groups.

   Description of an Embodiment of the Invention
15
   The present gaming system implements a probabilistic type
   game wherein a plurality of symbols are selected and
   displayed in a plurality of display position groups.
   During the game, or during implementation of a feature
20 game, at least one of the display position groups is
   selected and obscured or the otherwise made less visible
   than the other display position groups.  A first game
   outcome is determined on the basis of symbols displayed
   when one or more of the display position groups is
25 obscured or otherwise made less visible.  At least one of
   the obscured/less visible display position groups is then
   revealed or otherwise made as visible as the other display
   position groups, and a second game outcome is determined
   on the basis of the symbols displayed.
30
   In this way, at least 2 game outcomes are determined, one
   when at least one symbol group obscured or otherwise made
   less visible, and the other when the at least one symbol
   group is revealed or otherwise made as visible as the
35 other display position groups.
   In one embodiment, a mechanical shutter is disposed over
   10051344_1 (GHMatters) P90529.AU.1

                                                     8
   each of the reels, and each                      shutter is controllable so as
   to      selectively move between a closed position wherein the
   shutter obscures a respective reel                       or an open position
   wherein the                    shutter does not obscure the    respective reel
 5 and the reel                     is revealed.
   In an alternative embodiment, at least                       one virtual shutter
   device is disposed over the reels, the virtual shutter
   device being controllable in response to an electronic
10 signal so as                     to be disposable,   at selected parts of the
   device, in a substantially transparent state wherein one
   or more reels are visible through the device or a
   substantially opaque state wherein one or more reels                       are
   not visible through the device.
15
   In a further alternative embodiment, instead of providing
   a mechanical                     or virtual  shutter to obscure one or more of
   the       reels, the gaming system may be arranged to modify the
   lighting at one of more reels                       so that the symbols on one
20 or more of the reel(s)                      are noticeably less visible than
   symbols              on the other reels.
   In one conventional type of gaming machine, a spinning
   reel type game comprises                      a display area including 15
25 display positions,                     with each display position including
   one symbol.                      The display positions   are arranged in five
   vertically disposed reels, with each reel corresponding to
   a display position group, and each reel having three
   visible display positions.                       After the reels  are spun and
30 subsequently stopped, the                      display positions show a random
   selection of symbols.
   Generally, with such games, a plurality                       of win patterns in
   the       form of win lines               are defined which extend across the
35 reels and include one display position from each reel.
   Typically the symbols that                      are disposed in a win line are
   compared with winning symbol combinations defined in a pay
   100513441 (GHMatters)P90529.AU.1

                                                  9
   table         so as to determine whether a player of the            game
   should receive an award.                    For example, if winning symbol
   combinations are based on poker hands,                   a particular prize
   would be awarded if the win line comprises                   four aces.
 5 Other winning symbol combinations and corresponding prizes
   may also be defined.
   Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, there                   is shown a
   schematic block diagram of components of a gaming system
10 10 arranged to implement                   a probabilistic game of the type
   wherein several                  symbols  from a set of symbols are  randomly
   displayed, and a game outcome is determined on the basis
   of the displayed symbols.                    The system is of the type
   including multiple game modes,                   such as normal game mode
15 wherein a base game is                   implemented and special game mode
   wherein a feature game is implemented.
   The components comprise a player interface 30 and a game
   controller 32.                   The player interface 30  is arranged to
20 enable interaction between a player and the                   gaming system
   and for this purpose includes input/output components
   required for the player to enter instructions and play the
   game.
25 Components of the player interface 30 may vary but will
   typically                 include a credit mechanism 34 to enable a player
   to input               credits and receive payouts, one or more displays
   36 which may comprise a touch screen, and a game play
   mechanism 38 arranged to enable a player to input game
30 play instructions.
   The game controller 32                   is in data communication with the
   player interface 30 and typically includes a processor 40
   arranged to process game play instructions and output game
35 player outcomes to the display 36.                    Typically, the game
   play instructions are stored as program code in a memory
   42 that can also be hardwired.                    It will be understood that
   100513441 (GHMatters)P90529.AU.1

                                                   10
   in      this         specification       the term "processor"    is  used to      refer
   generically to any device that can process game play
   instructions and may include a microprocessor,
   microcontroller, programmable                     logic device or other
 5 computational device such as a personal                        computer or a
   server.
   With the present embodiment, a mechanical                        spinning reel
   type         game is implemented during normal game mode.                      The    set
10 of symbols used include                    standard symbols and function
   symbols,               and the game outcome is determined on the basis
   of the displayed standard symbols                      and the function
   associated with any displayed function symbol.                             For
   example, standard symbols may resemble fruit                         such as
15 apples, pears and bananas with a win outcome being
   determined when a predetermined number of the same fruit
   appear on a display along a win line, or are displayed
   according to defined outcome patterns such as                          scattered,
   and so on.                     The function associated with a function symbol
20 may be for example a wild function wherein display of the
   function symbol is treated during consideration of the
   game outcome as any of the                    standard symbols.        A   function
   symbol may be represented                    as the  word "WILD",    a   star,    or by
   any other suitable word or symbol.                         Other functions are
25 also envisaged such as                    scatter functions, multiplier
   functions, repeat win functions,                      jackpot   functions and
   feature commencement functions.
   A     functional diagram illustrating operative components of
30 the       game controller 32              is shown in Figure 2.
   The memory                   42 is arranged to store     symbols   data 14
   indicative of selectable symbols,                      win outcome data        16
   indicative of win condition requirements games implemented
35 by the system, and game instruction data 18 indicative of
   game instructions usable by the gaming machine 10 to
   control operation of the games.

   The game controller 32                    includes a    symbol selector 20 which
   is arranged during normal game mode to select                        several
   symbols              for display to a player         in a plurality of display
 5 positions on a plurality of reels, and a reel controller
   21 arranged to control                    spinning and stopping of the reels
   so that the reels                    stop with the selected symbols
   displayed.                     In this example, the selection carried out by
   the       symbol             selector 20  is made using a random number
10 generator 22.
   It will be appreciated that the random number generator 22
   may be of a type which is arranged to generate pseudo
   random numbers based on a seed number, and that in this
15 specification                    the term "random" will   be understood
   accordingly to mean truly random or pseudo random.
   With this embodiment, the                     game controller 32 also
   comprises a trigger determiner 23 arranged to determine
20 whether a trigger condition exists,                       and a feature
   implementer 25 arranged to implement a feature game when a
   trigger condition is determined to exist.
   For use during the feature game, the gaming system 10 also
25 includes a shutter 27 for each of the reels, and a shutter
   controller 26 arranged to control the shutters in order to
   selectively dispose each of the shutters                       in an open
   configuration or a closed configuration.
30 In this example, the shutters                      27 are mechanical shutters
   selectively individually movable between a first position
   wherein the                    shutter conceals a reel and a second position
   wherein the                    shutter does not conceal the    reel.
35 However,               it will be understood that         other arrangements are
   possible.                   For example one    or more virtual shutters may be
   provided, each virtual shutter being electronically
   100513441 (GHMatters)P90529.AU.1

                                    12
   controllable so as to dispose the shutter or part of the
   shutter in a substantially transparent or substantially
   opaque state.
 5 During a feature game, the feature implementer 25
   instructs the shutter controller 26 to close one or more
   of the shutters 27 so that at least one selected reel is
   concealed and is therefore not visible to a player.
10 The reel that is concealed may be selected by the gaming
   system, for example randomly using the random number
   generator 22 or based on a defined process, or may be
   selected by a player using a reel selector 31.   The reel
   selector 31 may comprise a touch screen or one or more
15 buttons.
   The game controller 32 also comprises an outcome evaluator
   28 which, in accordance with game instructions 18,
   determines game outcomes based on the symbols selected for
20 display to the player by the symbol selector 20 during
   normal game mode when all reels are visible, and during
   special game mode when at least one selected reel is
   obscured by a shutter or otherwise made less visible and
   when the at least one selected reel is not obscured by a
25 shutter.
   The game controller 32 also comprises a prize allocator 29
   arranged to allocate a prize to a player when a winning
   outcome exists.
30
   In the present embodiment, the symbol selector 20,  the
   trigger determiner 23, the function allocator 24,  the
   feature implementer 25, the reel controller 21, the
   shutter controller 26, the outcome evaluator 28,  and the
35 prize allocator 29 are at least partly implemented using
   the processor 40 and associated software although it will
   be understood that other implementations are envisaged.

                                                            13
   The gaming system 10 can take a number of different forms.
   In a first                   form, a player operable gaming device in the
 5 form of a stand alone gaming machine is provided wherein
   all or most components required for implementing the                                                 game
   are present in the gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture                                           is provided
10 wherein some                     of the components required for implementing
   the       game are present in a player operable gaming device
   and some               of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming device.
   For       example,               a   "thick     client"   architecture           may be used
15 wherein part                     of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming terminal and part of the game is                                      executed remotely,
   such        as by a              gaming      server;    or   a   "thin    client"       architecture
   may be used wherein most of the game is                                      executed remotely
   such as by a gaming server and a player operable gaming
20 terminal               is used only to display audible and/or visible
   gaming information to the player and receive gaming inputs
   from the player.
   However,               it will be understood that                      other arrangements are
25 envisaged.                     For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming device is networked to a device server
   and the respective                          functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are                          selectively modifiable.                 For example,
   the       gaming system may operate in                            stand alone gaming
30 machine mode,                      "thick     client"   mode      or "thin      client"       mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
35 A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 50 is                      illustrated in Figure 3.                The gaming machine
   50 includes a console 52 having a display device 54 on
   100513441 (GHMatters)P90529.AU.1

                                               14
   which is displayed representations of a game 56 that can
   be played by a player.                 A mid-trim 60 of the gaming
   machine 50 houses a bank of buttons 62 for enabling a
   player to interact with the gaming machine, in particular
 5 during gameplay.                 The mid-trim 60 also houses a credit
   input mechanism 64 which in this example includes a coin
   input chute 64A and a bill collector 64B.                  Other credit
   input mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
10 card.
   A top box 66 may carry artwork 68,                 including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.                  Further
15 artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 69 of the console 52.                  A coin tray 70 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 69 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 50.
20 The top box 66 may also include a display, for example a
   video display unit, which may be of the same type as the
   video display unit, or of a different type.
   Typically, during operation of the game, the reels first
25 appear to rotate then stop with typically three symbols
   visible on each reel.                 Game outcomes are determined on the
   basis of the visible symbols together with any special
   functions associated with the symbols.
30 A player marketing module                 (PMM) 72 having a display 74 is
   connected to the gaming machine 50.                  The main purpose of
   the PMM 72 is to allow the player to interact with a
   player loyalty system.                 The PMM has a magnetic card reader
   for the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
35 example as part of a loyalty program.                  However other
   reading devices may be employed and the player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   100513441 (GHMatters)P90529.AU.1

                                                     15
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device.                       In this example, the PMM 62  is a Sentinel
   III        device produced by Aristocrat Technologies Pty Ltd.
 5 Figure 4 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a gaming device 100                      which may be the same as or different
   to the gaming machine shown in Figure 3.
   The gaming machine                      100 includes a game controller 101
10 having a processor 102.                       Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor                      102  in accordance with the
   present invention are stored in a memory                       103 which is   in
   data communication with the processor 102.
15 Typically, the gaming machine 100                       will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type         of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
20 Figure             6 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory                      103.  The memory  103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                         The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor                      102  and related data.   The
25 EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.                        The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
30 or elsewhere.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104                       for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output                       (I/O) interface 105  for
35 communicating with a player interface 120                       of the gaming
   machine 100,                      the player interface  120 having several
   peripheral devices.                       The input/output interface 105 and/or
   10051344_1 (GHMatters)P90529.AU.1

                                                     16
   the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for storing associated instructions and
   data for use with the                      input/output interface or the
   peripheral devices.                      A  random number generator module    113
 5 generates random numbers for use by the processor                        102.
   In the example shown in Figure 4,                       the peripheral  devices
   that        communicate with the               game controller 101 comprise one
   or more displays 106;                      a touch screen and/or bank of
10 buttons 107                    including at least    one input device,  such as
   at least               one button;       a card and/or ticket reader 108;     a
   printer 109;                     a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism
   110;        a coin output mechanism 111;                and a shutter 86.
   Additional hardware may be included as part                       of the gaming
15 machine 100,                     or hardware may be omitted as required for
   the       specific implementation.
   In addition, the gaming machine                       100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
20 The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the                      central controller,  server or
   database.
25
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine                     100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 may be
   provided remotely from the                      game controller 101.

   Figures              3 and 4,        or may have simplified functionality
   depending on the requirements for implementing game play.
   While banks 203 of two gaming machines are illustrated in
   Figure            6, banks of one, three or more gaming machines are
 5 also envisaged.
   One       or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.                     The  displays 204 may, for example, be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
10 The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations,                      for example
   promotional or informational material.
15 In a thick client                     embodiment, a game  server 205 implements
   part        of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202       and the gaming machine 202                implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the                      game server 205
   and the gaming machine                     202 implement part of the   game,
20 they collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management                   server 206 may manage    storage of game programs
   and associated data                     for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202                     in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
25 game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to monitor and
   carry out the Jackpot game.
   In a variation of the                     above thick client embodiment, the
   gaming machine 202 may implement the game, with the game
30 server 205                   functioning merely to serve data indicative of
   a game to the gaming machine 202                      for implementation.
   With this                 implementation, a data      signal containing a
   computer program usable by the                      client terminal to
35 implement the gaming system may be transferred from the
   game server to the client terminal,                      for example in
   response to a request by the client terminal.

                                                      18
   In a thin client embodiment, the game server                          205
   implements most or all of the game played by a player
   using a gaming machine                      202 and the   gaming machine     202
 5 essentially provides only the player interface.                             With this
   embodiment, the game server                       205 provides the game
   controller. The gaming machine will                        receive player
   instructions, and pass the                      instructions to the game server
   which will process them and return game play outcomes to
10 the       gaming machine                for display.    In a thin client
   embodiment, the gaming machines could be                          computer
   terminals,                  e.g. PCs running software that provides a
   player interface operable using standard computer input
   and output components.
15
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the                      gaming system 200,     including for
   example a gaming floor management                        server 208 and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use                          of licenses
20 relating to particular games.                         An administrator terminal
   210       is provided to allow an administrator to monitor the
   network 201                   and the devices     connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
25 systems,               other local        networks such as a corporate network,
   and/or a wide area network such as                        the Internet,     for
   example through a firewall                      211.
   A loyalty program server 212 may also be provided.
30
   Persons              skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques,                        functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.                         For example, elements
35 may be run as a                   single    "engine" on  one server   or  a  separate
   server may be provided.                       For example, the game server          205
   could run a random number generator engine.
   100513441 (GHMatters)P90529AU.1

                                                    19
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.
 5 Examples               of specific implementations of the        gaming system
   will now be described in relation to a stand alone gaming
   machine 50 although it will be understood that
   implementation may also be carried out using other gaming
   system architectures such as a network architecture of the
10 type        shown in Figure              6.
   The gaming system is operable in normal game mode and
   special              game mode and may be arranged to commence special
   game mode when a predetermined game outcome occurs.
15 Special game mode may comprise one or more free games.
   Special game mode may commence automatically on the basis
   of a game event occurring during a game such as                      display of
   a particular symbol,                     based on game outcomes determined by
20 the       gaming system, or may be prompted by a player pressing
   a button on the gaming system 10 after the player has
   identified that a game outcome                      corresponding to special
   game mode requirements has                     occurred.
25 The gaming system 10 may also be arranged so as to
   determine eligibility for special                      game mode, for example
   based on the                     amount or type of bet placed, based on
   particular time periods and so on.
30 Special game mode may also be arranged to commence when a
   special              game is purchased by a player.
   A     specific example will now be described in relation to
   flow diagram 250                     shown in Figure 7, which illustrates
35 steps 252 to 270                     of a method of gaming implemented by the
   gaming system according to the present embodiment, and
   representations of the display area shown in Figures                      8a to
   100513441 (GHMatters)P90529.AU.1

                                                   20
   8c.
   In this example, the gaming system comprises 5 reels 280
   arranged to display standard symbols and one or more
 5 function symbols during implementation of a base game.
   Win outcomes are determined on the basis of the symbols
   visible at the display positions when the reels stop.
   Typically, a player will purchase or otherwise obtain win
10 entitlements such as several win lines which are used in
   the game to determine win outcomes.                     If the displayed
   symbols on the reels have symbols associated with a
   winning combination such as a winning combination disposed
   on a win line, the player wins a prize.
15
   During normal game mode, all 5 reels 280 are visible.                      The
   reels spin and are subsequently controlled by the reel
   controller 21 to stop such that selected symbols are
   displayed.                     The displayed symbols are then evaluated by
20 the outcome evaluator 28 and if the displayed symbols
   correspond to a winning outcome, a prize is awarded by the
   prize allocator 29.
   If a trigger condition exists, for example if one or more
25 defined symbols are displayed, the trigger determiner 23
   identifies the trigger condition and instigates special
   game mode wherein at least one feature game is
   implemented.
30 As shown in Figure 8a, during a feature game at least one
   reel 280 is selected and the selected reel is obscured by
   a shutter 282.                     In this example, the shutter 282 is a
   mechanical shutter movable between a first position, as
   shown in Figure 8a, wherein a reel is obscured by the
35 shutter 282 and a second position wherein the reel is not
   obscured by the shutter 282 and the reel 280 is visible to
   a player.                   Also in this example, the reel to be obscured
   100513441 (GHMatters)P90529.AU.1

                                                   21
   by the shutter 282 is selected by the player, for example
   using a touch screen or a button on the gaming machine,
   although it will be understood that the reel may be
   selected by the gaming system, for example randomly using
 5 the random number generator 22.
   After the selected reel is obscured by the shutter 282,
   the 5 reels                    spin and are subsequently controlled by the
   reel controller 21 to stop such that selected symbols 284
10 in 4 of the reels are visible and selected symbols on one
   of the reels are obscured from view by the shutter 282, as
   shown in Figure 8b.                     The visible symbols 284 are then
   evaluated by the outcome evaluator 28 and if the visible
   symbols correspond to a winning outcome, a prize is
15 awarded by the prize allocator 29.
   In the example shown in Figure 8b, the visible symbols
   correspond to a winning outcome comprising 4 star symbols
   286, and a prize associated with 4 star symbols is
20 awarded.
   As shown in Figure 8c, the shutter 282 is then caused to
   open so as to make the previously concealed symbols of the
   concealed reel visible, and the visible symbols are
25 evaluated by the outcome evaluator 28.                     If the visible
   symbols correspond to a winning outcome, a prize is
   awarded by the prize allocator 29.
   In the example shown in Figure 8c, the visible symbols
30 correspond to a winning outcome comprising 5 star symbols
   286, and a prize associated with 5 star symbols is
   awarded.
   As an alternative, instead of obscuring one reel with a
35 shutter, the gaming system may be arranged to obscure more
   than one reel, with each reel being selected by a player
   or selected randomly by the gaming system.                     With this
   100513441 (GHMatters)P90529.AU.1

                                                    22
   implementation, the selected reels may be obscured and
   revealed at the same time, or the reels may be obscured
   together, each reel revealed individually and a game
   outcome evaluated after each reel is revealed.
 5
   With this alternative embodiment, each previously
   concealed reel that is to be revealed may be selected by a
   player or randomly by the gaming system, for example such
   that the order of reels that are revealed is determined by
10 the player or randomly by the gaming system.
   For implementations that are arranged to obscure more than
   one reel, subsequent reels may be revealed in response to
   a game condition, such as a random trigger or display of a
15 particular symbol or combination of symbols.
   As a further alternative, instead of obscuring one or more
   reel, the or each selected reel may be made less visible
   than the reels that have not been selected.                       This may be
20 achieved by modifying lighting associated with the gaming
   system such that selected reels are not illuminated or
   illuminated less than reels that have not been selected.
   While the present embodiment is described in relation to a
25 mechanical type base game, it will be understood that
   other arrangements are envisaged.                       For example, the reels
   may be virtual reels shown on a display device.
   In the claims which follow and in the preceding
30 description of the invention, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
   implication,                     the word "comprise" or variations such as
   "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
   i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but
35 not to preclude the presence or addition of further
   features in various embodiments of the invention.
