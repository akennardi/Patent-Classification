            ABSORPTION SUBCOOLER FOR A REFRIGERATION SYSTEM
   TECHNICAL FIELD
           This disclosure relates generally to a refrigeration system. More specifically,
 5 this disclosure relates to a refrigeration system including an absorption subcooler.
   BACKGROUND
           Refrigeration systems can be used to regulate the environment within an
10 enclosed space.     Various types of refrigeration systems, such as residential and
   commercial, may be used to maintain cold temperatures within an enclosed space
   such as a refrigerated case. An example of a refrigerated case includes a grocery case
   that stores fresh or frozen food products.       To maintain cold temperatures within
   refrigerated cases, refrigeration systems control the temperature and pressure of
15 refrigerant as it moves through the refrigeration system.         When controlling the
   temperature and pressure of the refrigerant, refrigeration systems consume power. It
   is generally desirable to operate refrigeration systems efficiently in order to avoid
   wasting power.
20 SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
           According to one embodiment, an absorption subcooler comprises a first heat
   exchanger operable to receive refrigerant from a compressor of a refrigeration system
   and apply a first cooling stage to the refrigerant. The absorption subcooler is further
   operable to discharge the refrigerant to a gas cooler operable to apply a second
25 cooling stage to the refrigerant.
           According to another embodiment, a refrigeration system is operable to
   circulate refrigerant through the refrigeration system in order to cool a refrigeration
   load.    The refrigeration system comprises a compressor operable to receive the
   refrigerant from the refrigeration load and compress the refrigerant; an absorption
30 subcooler comprising a first heat exchanger and a second heat exchanger, the first
   heat exchanger operable to receive the compressed refrigerant from the compressor
   and to apply a first cooling stage to the compressed refrigerant; and a third heat
   exchanger external from the absorption subcooler and operable to receive the
   refrigerant that has been cooled by the first heat exchanger and to apply a second
                                                 1

   cooling stage to the refrigerant.      The second heat exchanger of the absorption
   subcooler is operable to receive the cooled refrigerant from the third heat exchanger,
   apply a third cooling stage to the refrigerant, and discharge the refrigerant to an
   expansion valve operable to supply the refrigerant to the refrigeration load.
 5         In certain embodiments, the absorption subcooler is powered by heat absorbed
   by the first heat exchanger.      In certain embodiments, the refrigerant is a natural
   refrigerant such as a hydrocarbon (HC) including propane, isobutane, carbon dioxide,
   ammonia, water, and air.        In other embodiments, the refrigerant is a synthetic
   refrigerant (also referred to as a "man-made" refrigerant) such as chlorofluorocarbons
10 (CFCs), hydroclorofulorocarbons (HCFCs), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).               In
   certain embodiments, the absorption subcooler is configured to circulate an absorption
   subcooler refrigerant and the absorption subcooler refrigerant is one of: ammonia and
   lithium bromide. In certain embodiments, the absorption subcooler further comprises:
   a condenser operable to receive the absorption subcooler refrigerant in a gaseous state
15 and condense the absorption subcooler refrigerant into a liquid state; and an
   absorption chamber operable to receive the absorption subcooler refrigerant and mix
   the absorption subcooler refrigerant with water.
           Certain problems can be envisioned with respect to known refrigeration
   systems.    In general, refrigeration systems control the temperature and pressure of
20 refrigerant as it moves through the refrigeration system.            In certain known
   refrigeration   systems, refrigerant   is discharged from refrigeration     cases to a
   compressor.      The compressor compresses the refrigerant and discharges the
   refrigerant directly to a heat exchanger (e.g., gas cooler or condenser).      The heat
   exchanger cools the refrigerant and discharges the refrigerant to components that
25 supply the refrigerant to the refrigerated cases.         Unfortunately,   such known
   refrigeration systems may be characterized by certain inefficiencies.            Certain
   embodiments of the present disclosure may provide a solution to this and/or other
   problems.
           Certain embodiments may provide one or more technical advantages.            An
30 embodiment of the present disclosure may configure a refrigeration system with an
   absorption subcooler that provides cooling of refrigerant entering and/or exiting a gas
   cooler. Including the absorption subcooler may allow for more efficient operation of
   refrigeration system. As an example, the absorption subcooler may be powered by
                                                2

   waste heat, rather than a separate power source, which may allow the absorption
   subcooler to efficiently cool the refrigerant.
           In certain embodiments,        the refrigeration   system configured with the
   absorption subcooler may consume less power than would otherwise be required to
 5 cool the refrigerated cases if the absorption subcooler was not present.          As an
   example, the absorption subcooler may cool the refrigerant prior to sending the
   refrigerant to the heat exchanger so that the heat exchanger performs less cooling and
   therefore consumes less energy.
           As another example, the absorption subcooler may discharge refrigerant to
10 downstream components, such as an expansion valve and flash tank that feed the
   refrigerated cases. The refrigerant discharged from the absorption subcooler may be
   cooler than refrigerant that the gas cooler would have otherwise discharged to the
   downstream components if the absorption subcooler was not present.             Supplying
   cooler refrigerant to the downstream components may reduce the power required to
15 cool the refrigerated cases. For example, fans may be able to work at a lower speed
   and compressors may be able to work at a lower frequency when cooler refrigerant is
   supplied to the refrigerated cases.
           In certain embodiments, the mass flow rate of flash gas discharged from a
   flash tank may be less if the refrigeration system is configured with an absorption
20 subcooler, which may allow for improved energy efficiency.
           Certain embodiments may include none, some, or all of the above technical
   advantages. One or more other technical advantages may be readily apparent to one
   skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims included herein.

   components, including the absorption subcooler of FIGURE 2, of the refrigeration
   system of FIGURE 1.
 5 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
            Embodiments of the present disclosure and its advantages are best understood
   by referring to FIGURES 1 through 4 of the drawings, like numerals being used for
   like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.
            Generally, a refrigeration cycle includes circulating refrigerant through one or
10 more refrigeration components, including at least one compressor, a heat exchanger
   (e.g., a condenser or gas cooler), at least one valve, and one or more evaporators. To
   ensure the system operates as intended, each component requires sufficient power,
   which may vary depending on the refrigeration load.              The present disclosure
   contemplates a system and method for efficiently operating a refrigeration system.
15          During typical operation of a conventional refrigeration system, one or more
   components of the system will give off heat.            The heat emitted from system
   components will be referred to herein as "waste heat."            The present disclosure
   recognizes utilizing waste heat of refrigeration components to power an absorption
   subcooler operable to provide supplemental cooling to refrigerant. The addition of an
20 absorption subcooler to a refrigeration system may provide various efficiency benefits
   such as a reduction in flash gas flow and a reduction in overall power consumption
   relative to refrigeration systems that do not include an absorption subcooler.        The
   reduction in flash gas flow may be due to the reduction in refrigerant vapor moving
   through a flash tank and overall power consumption may be reduced due to the
25 reduction in power utilized by one or more components of the refrigeration system
   (e.g., the gas cooler and the compressors).
            Recently there has been an effort to make refrigeration systems more
   environmentally-friendly.      As part of this effort, manufacturers have developed
   refrigeration systems that circulate natural refrigerant such as carbon dioxide (C0 2 ),
30 propane (C 3H8 ), isobutane (C 4Hio), water (H 20), and air. Such natural refrigerants are
   circulated as a substitute for synthetic refrigerants such as CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs
   that are associated with contributing to ozone depletion and/or global warming
   effects.    Natural refrigerants are typically associated with higher compressor
   discharge temperatures than synthetic refrigerants. As a result, the natural refrigerant
                                                4

   vapor is typically too hot         to condense in a traditional condenser and thus,
   refrigeration systems circulating natural refrigerants include a gas cooler in lieu of a
   condenser. Just as a condenser in a traditional refrigeration system provides cooling
   to refrigerant, a gas cooler provides cooling to the natural refrigerant. However, in
 5 contrast to a condenser in a traditional refrigeration system, the refrigerant does not
   change states from a gas to a liquid in the gas cooler. Rather, the natural refrigerant
   undergoes a partial state change from gas to liquid as it is discharged from an
   expansion valve (e.g., expansion valve 140a of FIGURE 1).
           This disclosure makes reference         to several example temperatures        and
10 pressures throughout and one of ordinary skill will recognize that such referenced
   temperatures and pressures may be sufficient for refrigeration systems circulating a
   particular refrigerant and may not be sufficient for refrigeration systems circulating
   other refrigerants.     The example temperatures and pressures provided herein are
   tailored to a transcritical refrigeration system (i.e., a refrigeration system in which the
15 heat rejection process occurs above the critical point) comprising a gas cooler and
   circulating C02. An example is made of such system because the efficiency benefits
   are easily recognized in a refrigeration system circulating natural refrigerant.         In
   particular, more waste heat is generated (and therefore available for use by an
   absorption subcooler) in a system circulating natural refrigerant because natural
20 refrigerants are associated with higher compressor discharge temperatures than
   synthetic refrigerants.     Although this disclosure primarily describes a transcritical
   refrigeration system, this disclosure recognizes similar benefits may be recognized in
   other direct expansion (DX) refrigeration systems such as those refrigeration systems
   comprising a condenser and circulating synthetic refrigerant.
25         Turning now to FIGURE 1, refrigeration system 100 includes compressors
   110, an absorption subcooler 120, a gas cooler 130, one or more valves 140, a flash
   tank 150, and one or more evaporators 160. In some embodiments, refrigeration
   system 100 circulates a natural refrigerant and maintains a cooled environment for
   evaporators 160.      As further discussed below, evaporators 160 may represent a
30 refrigeration load, such as a low temperature refrigeration case for storing frozen food
   (e.g., evaporator 160a) and a medium temperature refrigeration case for storing fresh
   food (e.g., evaporator 160b). Components of refrigeration system (e.g., compressors
   110, an absorption subcooler 120, a gas cooler 130, one or more valves 140, a flash
   tank 150, and one or more evaporators 160) may be connected via any suitable
                                                 5

   conduit. As used herein, components of refrigeration system 100 are connected via
   tubing through which the refrigerant travels.     As described above, this disclosure
   recognizes efficiency benefits of including absorption subcooler 120 in refrigeration
   system 100.
 5         Refrigeration system 100 includes at least one compressor 110. As depicted in
   FIGURE      1, refrigeration   system 100 includes     compressors    110a and   110b.
   Compressor 110a may, in some embodiments, be a low temperature compressor
   configured to compress refrigerant from a low temperature evaporator (e.g.,
   evaporator 160a).     Compressor 110b may, in some embodiments, be a medium
10 temperature    compressor    configured  to compress    refrigerant  from a medium
   temperature evaporator (e.g., evaporator 160b).       Refrigeration system 100 may
   include any suitable number of compressors 110. Although this disclosure describes
   and depicts refrigeration system 100 including only two compressors 110, this
   disclosure recognizes that refrigeration system 100 may include any suitable number
15 of compressors 110. Compressors 110 may vary by design and/or by capacity.
           Refrigeration system 100 may also include an absorption subcooler 120.
   Absorption subcooler 120 is operable to cool refrigerant cycling through refrigeration
   system 100. In some embodiments, absorption subcooler 120 is powered by waste
   heat emitted from one or more components of refrigeration system 100. For example,
20 absorption subcooler 120 may be powered by the heat emitted from compressors 110
   and/or gas cooler 130.
           As depicted in FIGURE 1, absorption subcooler 120 may be connected to
   other components of system 100 by tubing through which the refrigerant runs. For
   example, absorption subcooler 120 may connect to one or more compressors 110 and
25 gas cooler 130. In some embodiments, absorption subcooler 120 receives compressed
   refrigerant from compressors 110 and applies a first cooling stage to the compressed
   refrigerant using a first heat exchanger (e.g., heat exchanger 230 of FIGURE 2).
   Refrigerant is cooled during the first cooling stage.    As used herein, "cooled" or
   "cooling" or "cool" refers to a lowering of the temperature of refrigerant. In some
30 embodiments, absorption subcooler 120 cools refrigerant during the first cooling stage
   by absorbing the heat of the compressed refrigerant.      The first cooling stage may
   permit refrigerant to be cooled by an amount in the range of 15'C - 24'C. After
   absorption subcooler 120 applies the first cooling stage to refrigerant, absorption
                                              6

   subcooler 120 may be configured to discharge the cooled refrigerant to gas cooler 130
   (discussed below).
           In some embodiments, absorption subcooler 120 may receive refrigerant from
   gas cooler 130 after gas cooler 130 has applied a second cooling stage to refrigerant.
 5 Absorption subcooler 120 may then, in some embodiments, apply a third cooling
   stage to refrigerant. Absorption subcooler 120 applies a third cooling stage using a
   second    heat exchanger    (e.g., heat exchanger 250     of FIGURE 2) in some
   embodiments.     The third cooling stage may permit refrigerant to be cooled by an
   amount in the range of 2'C - 4'C. After applying the third cooling stage to the
10 refrigerant,  absorption   subcooler   120  discharges  the refrigerant.     In some
   embodiments, absorption subcooler 120 discharges the refrigerant to an expansion
   valve 140a. More details of absorption subcooler 120 will be described below in
   reference to FIGURE 2.
           Although this disclosure describes and depicts absorption subcooler 120
15 applying two cooling stages to refrigerant circulating through refrigeration system
   100, this disclosure recognizes that absorption subcooler 120 may apply any suitable
   number of cooling stages.     For example, this disclosure recognizes that absorption
   subcooler may only apply only one of the two cooling stages described above. As
   another example, this disclosure recognizes that absorption subcooler 120 may apply
20 more than two cooling stages.
           Refrigeration system 100 may also include gas cooler 130. Gas cooler 130 is
   operable to apply a second cooling stage to refrigerant in some embodiments.      Gas
   cooler 130 may be a heat exchanger. In some embodiments, gas cooler 130 comprises
   an inlet connection 132 and an outlet connection 134 to absorption subcooler 120.
25 Inlet connection 132 may be configured to receive compressed refrigerant from
   absorption subcooler 120 and outlet connection 134 may be configured to provide
   cooled refrigerant from gas cooler 130 to absorption subcooler 120. Gas cooler 130
   may be configured to cool refrigerant by an amount in the range of 50'C - 90'C
   during the second cooling stage.     In some embodiments, after gas cooler 130 has
30 applied the second cooling stage, refrigerant is discharged from gas cooler 130 to
   absorption subcooler 120.
           Refrigeration system 100 includes valve 140a in some embodiments. Valve
   140a may be an expansion valve in some embodiments. Expansion valve 140a may
   be connected, via a tubing connection, to absorption subcooler 120 and flash tank 150.
                                              7

   In some embodiments, expansion valve 140a is configured to receive refrigerant from
   absorption subcooler 120 and control the flow of refrigerant to flash tank 150.
   Controlling the flow of the refrigerant may comprise reducing the pressure of the
   refrigerant, thereby producing a refrigerant mixture comprising both liquid and vapor
 5 refrigerant.   The refrigerant mixture produced by expansion valve 140a may be
   provided to flash tank 150 in some embodiments.
           Refrigeration system 100 includes a flash tank 150 in some embodiments.
   Flash tank 150 may be configured to separate the refrigerant mixture into liquid
   refrigerant and refrigerant vapor. In some embodiments, flash tank 150 separates the
10 refrigerant mixture using an inlet and collects refrigerant precipitates at the bottom of
   flash tank 150. Flash tank 150 may be connected via tubing to evaporators 160 and
   compressors 110 and may be configured to discharge the liquid refrigerant to
   evaporators 160 and the refrigerant vapor (also referred to herein as "flash gas") to
   compressors     110.    Before reaching compressors      110 and/or evaporators       160,
15 refrigerant may contact one or more valves (e.g., valve 140b-d).         For example, as
   depicted in FIGURE 1, flash gas flows through tubing to a flash gas valve 140b. In
   some embodiments, flash gas valve 140b controls the flow of flash gas to one or more
   compressors 110. As depicted, flash gas valve 140b controls the flow of flash gas to
   compressor 11 Ob.
20         Refrigeration system 100 may also include one or more evaporators 160 in
   some embodiments.        Evaporators 160 may represent a refrigeration load.      In some
   embodiments, evaporators 160 are refrigerated cases such as refrigerated cases in
   grocery stores.      Refrigeration system 100 may provide refrigerated cases with
   refrigerant of one temperature, or, with refrigerant of multiple temperatures.         For
25 example, as depicted in FIGURE 2, evaporator 160a may be a low-temperature
   refrigerated case (e.g., refrigeration system 100 provides evaporator 160a with
   refrigerant having a temperature of -30'C). As another example, evaporator 160b
   may be a medium-temperature           case (e.g., refrigeration system 100 provides
   evaporator    160b with refrigerant     having a temperature of -60 C).          In some
30 embodiments, the passing of refrigerant through valve 140c and/or 140d changes the
   temperature of the refrigerant relative to the temperature of the refrigerant leaving
   flash tank 150. As an example, the temperature of the refrigerant leaving flash tank
   150 may be 20 C and, after flowing through valve 140c, refrigerant may be -30'C. As
   another example, the temperature of the refrigerant leaving flash tank 150 may be 20 C
                                               8

   and, after flowing through valve 140d, refrigerant may be -6'C. In providing cooling
   to refrigerated cases 160, the refrigerant is heated and changes states from a liquid to a
   vapor. In some embodiments, the warm vapor flows back to compressors 110 and the
   cycle is repeated.
 5          Although this disclosure describes and depicts refrigeration system 100
   including certain components, this disclosure recognizes that refrigeration system 100
   may include any suitable components. As an example, refrigeration system 100 may
   include one or more sensors configured to detect temperature and/or pressure
   information. In some embodiments, each of compressors 110, absorption subcooler
10 120, gas cooler 130, flash tank 150, and evaporators 160 include one or more sensors.
   As another example, refrigeration system 100 may include a controller operable to
   communicate with one or more components of refrigeration system 100. An example
   of a controller of refrigeration system 100 will be explained in further detail below in
   reference to FIGURE 4.
15          In operation, refrigerant is compressed by compressors 110 and provided to
   absorption subcooler 120 for a first cooling stage before being discharged to gas
   cooler 130.     Upon being received at gas cooler 130, the refrigerant undergoes a
   second cooling stage and is discharged back to absorption subcooler 120 for a third
   cooling stage.    This disclosure recognizes that cooling refrigerant with absorption
20 subcooler 120 may be associated with various efficiencies and permits other
   components of refrigeration system 100 from operating more than necessary.
   FIGURE 2 illustrates absorption subcooler 120 in more detail and FIGURE 3
   illustrates one embodiment of a method performed by absorption subcooler 120.
   Finally, FIGURE 4 illustrates an example of a controller that is configured to operate
25 each component of refrigeration system 100, including absorption subcooler 120.
            As described above, FIGURE 2 illustrates absorption subcooler 120 of
   refrigeration system 100.       Absorption subcooler 120 may include one or more
   components and may be configured to circulate absorption subcooler refrigerant. In
   one embodiment, such as depicted in FIGURE 2, absorption subcooler 120 comprises
30 an absorption chamber 210, a pump 220, a first heat exchanger 230, a condenser 240,
   and a second heat exchanger 250.          In some embodiments, absorption subcooler
   refrigerant is a natural refrigerant such as ammonia (NH 3) or lithium bromide (LiBr).
            Absorption subcooler 120 may be configured to absorb waste heat and use the
   absorbed waste heat to power one or more components of absorption subcooler 120.
                                                 9

   As one example, absorption subcooler 120 may absorb heat emitted from one or more
   components of refrigeration system 100 (e.g., a compressor 110, gas cooler 130). As
   another example, absorption subcooler 120 may absorb heat from other sources such
   as heat from the sun (solar heat), heat rejection from other systems (e.g., Heating
 5 Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system), and compressor discharge from
   other systems (e.g., HVAC system). Thus, absorption subcooler 120 uses waste heat
   to power operations of one or more components of absorption subcooler 120. As one
   example, the absorbed waste heat may power heat exchangers 230, 250 such that they
   may apply a cooling stage to refrigerant. As another example, the absorbed waste
10 heat may power operations of absorption chamber 210, pump 220, and/or condenser
   240.    As illustrated in FIGURE 2, absorption subcooler 120 absorbs heat from
   compressors 110 and gas cooler 130 and uses the absorbed heat to power all
   operations of absorption subcooler 120.
           In some embodiments, absorption subcooler 120 includes an absorption
15 chamber 210.      Absorption chamber 210 may be configured to receive absorption
   subcooler refrigerant (e.g., NH 3 ) in vapor form and mix the absorption subcooler
   refrigerant with water to produce a solution of absorption subcooler refrigerant and
   water.   Absorption chamber 210 may be connected via tubing to one or more
   components of absorption subcooler 210. For example, as illustrated in FIGURE 2,
20 absorption chamber 210 is connected to pump 220, first heat exchanger 230, and
   second heat exchanger 250. As such, absorption chamber 210 may be configured to
   receive absorption subcooler refrigerant from first and second heat exchangers 230,
   250 and to discharge the absorption subcooler refrigerant-water solution to pump 220.
   In operation, absorption chamber 210 may receive absorption subcooler refrigerant in
25 vapor form from second heat exchanger 250 and receive water from first heat
   exchanger 230.      Absorption chamber 210 may then mix the absorption subcooler
   refrigerant and water to form a solution and discharge the solution to pump 220.
   Pump 220 may be configured to force the absorption subcooler refrigerant-water
   solution into first heat exchanger 230.
30         Absorption subcooler 120 includes heat exchanger 230 in some embodiments.
   Heat exchanger 230 may be configured to apply a first cooling stage to refrigerant
   being pushed through absorption subcooler 120.         Heat exchanger 230 may be
   connected to one or more components of refrigeration system 100, including one or
   more components of absorption subcooler 120. As illustrated in FIGURES 1 and 2,
                                              10

   heat exchanger 230 comprises an inlet connection 232 from compressors 110 and an
   outlet connection 234 to gas cooler 130.        Additionally, first heat exchanger 230
   comprises connections to pump 220, absorption chamber 210, and condenser 240. In
   some embodiments, first heat exchanger 230 receives the absorption subcooler
 5 refrigerant-water solution (produced in absorption chamber 210) from pump 220.
   Heat exchanger 230 may also be configured to circulate the solution through a coil
   system 236 within heat exchanger 230 and separate the absorption subcooler
   refrigerant from the water.     In some embodiments, separation of the solution is
   performed by forcing compressed refrigerant from compressors 110 through first heat
10 exchanger 230. In doing so, the solution circulating through coil system 236 absorbs
   heat from the hot, compressed refrigerant. In some embodiments, absorbing the heat
   from the compressed refrigerant        reduces the temperature of the compressed
   refrigerant by 120'C to 96'C. The absorption of heat may cause the solution to
   separate into water and subcooler refrigerant vapor.        In some embodiments, heat
15 exchanger 230 is further configured to discharge the water back to absorption
   chamber 210 and to discharge the subcooler refrigerant vapor to condenser 240.
           In some embodiments, absorption subcooler 120 includes a condenser 240.
   Condenser 240 may be configured condense absorption subcooler refrigerant from a
   vapor form to a liquid form. In some embodiments, condenser 240 is connected via
20 tubing to one or more components of absorption subcooler 120.           For example, as
   depicted in FIGURE 2, condenser 240 is connected to first heat exchanger 230 and
   second heat exchanger 250.      In such an embodiment, condenser 240 may receive
   absorption subcooler refrigerant in vapor form from first heat exchanger 230 and,
   after condensing     absorption subcooler refrigerant     into liquid form, discharge
25 absorption subcooler refrigerant to second heat exchanger 250.       Cooling absorption
   subcooler refrigerant from a vapor form to a liquid form may involve the use of a coil
   system 242. For example, as depicted in FIGURE 2, absorption subcooler refrigerant
   arrives at condenser 240 in vapor form and travels through coil system 242 of
   condenser 240. As absorption subcooler refrigerant travels through coil system 242,
30 coils of coil system 242 absorb the latent heat from the absorption subcooler
   refrigerant, thereby changing the state of the absorption subcooler refrigerant from gas
   to liquid.   After traveling through coil system 242 of condenser 240, liquid-state,
   absorption subcooler refrigerant is discharged at a high pressure-low temperature to
   an absorption subcooler expansion valve 260. Absorption subcooler expansion valve
                                                11

   260 may be configured to control the amount of flow of absorption subcooler
   refrigerant to second heat exchanger 250. In some embodiments, sending absorption
   subcooler refrigerant through absorption subcooler expansion valve 260 results in a
   low temperature-low pressure absorption subcooler refrigerant in the liquid state.
 5         Absorption subcooler 120 may also comprise heat exchanger 250 in some
   embodiments. As described above, heat exchanger 250 may be configured to receive
   refrigerant and apply a cooling stage to the received refrigerant. Accordingly, heat
   exchanger 250 is connected via tubing to one or more components of refrigeration
   system 100, including components of absorption subcooler 120.           For example, as
10 depicted in FIGURE 2, heat exchanger 250 may comprise an inlet connection 252
   from gas cooler 130 and an outlet connection 254 to expansion valve 140a.             As
   another example, absorption subcooler 120 may be connected via tubing to condenser
   240 and absorption chamber 210 in some embodiments. In some embodiments, heat
   exchanger     250   receives    low  temperature-low    pressure   absorption  subcooler
15 refrigerant in a liquid state from condenser 240 after it passes through valve 260.
           Heat exchanger 250 may comprise a coil system 256 in some embodiments.
   In such an embodiment, received absorption subcooler refrigerant is forced through
   coil system 256 of second heat exchanger 250.          While the low temperature-low
   pressure absorption subcooler refrigerant travels through coil system 256, coils of coil
20 system 256 absorb the latent heat of refrigerant passing through heat exchanger 250.
   As a result, the heat from the refrigerant is transferred to coils of coil system 256
   which further transfers the heat to absorptions subcooler refrigerant travelling through
   coil system 256.       Accordingly, refrigerant is cooled and absorption subcooler
   refrigerant is heated (increase in temperature of absorption subcooler refrigerant).
25 Heating of absorption subcooler refrigerant causes absorption subcooler refrigerant to
   evaporate, thereby changing from a liquid state to a vapor state. As described above,
   after heat exchanger 250 applies a cooling stage to the refrigerant, heat exchanger 250
   discharges the refrigerant to expansion valve 140a through outlet connection 254. As
   for absorption subcooler refrigerant, after traveling through coil system 256,
30 absorption subcooler refrigerant is discharged in vapor form to absorption chamber
   210 where it will be mixed with water to produce a solution of absorption subcooler
   refrigerant and water.      The cycle may then repeat starting with the operation of
   absorption chamber 210.
                                               12

           FIGURE 3 illustrates a method 300 that may be performed by one or more
   components of refrigeration system 100. As an example, the steps of method 300
   may be performed by absorption subcooler 120. The method 300 begins in a step 305
   and continues to step 310.        At step 310, absorption subcooler 120 receives
 5 compressed refrigerant. In some embodiments, absorption subcooler 120 may receive
   compressed refrigerant from one or more compressors 110. In some embodiments,
   such as that depicted in FIGURE 2, heat exchanger 230 receives compressed
   refrigerant through inlet connection 232.     As depicted in FIGURE 1, absorption
   subcooler 120 receives compressed refrigerant directly from compressor 1 10b,
10 however compressor 110b also receives compressed refrigerant from compressor
   1 10a. In some embodiments, method 300 continues to step 320.
           At step 320, absorption subcooler 120 applies a cooling stage to the
   compressed refrigerant. In some embodiments, the cooling stage is applied by a heat
   exchanger. As depicted in FIGURE 2, the cooling stage is applied by heat exchanger
15 230. In some embodiments, the cooling stage comprises absorbing sensible heat from
   refrigerant passing over coil system 236. Stated differently, coils of coil system 236
   may absorb heat from compressed refrigerant passing over coil system 236. In some
   embodiments, the cooling stage applied by heat exchanger 230 may reduce the
   temperature of the refrigerant between 5oC - 30'C.        As one example, the heat
20 exchanger may receive refrigerant from compressor 110 at a temperature in the range
   of 1 10 C to 130'C, such as approximately 120'C, and may discharge refrigerant to
   gas cooler 130 at a temperature in the range of 85'C to 105'C, such as approximately
   96'C. The heat absorbed by the coils may be transferred to the solution of absorption
   subcooler refrigerant and water that is traveling through coil system 236. In some
25 embodiments, heating the solution causes the solution to separate into water and
   absorption subcooler refrigerant vapor. In some embodiments, method 300 continues
   to a step 330.
           At step 330, absorption subcooler 120/heat exchanger 230 discharges the
   compressed refrigerant. In some embodiments, such as that depicted in FIGURE 2,
30 heat exchanger 120 discharges the compressed refrigerant to gas cooler 130 via outlet
   connection 234. In some embodiments, gas cooler 130 applies a cooling stage to the
   refrigerant received from absorption subcooler 120.   The cooling stage applied by gas
   cooler 130 may reduce the temperature of the refrigerant between 30'C - 70'C. As
   one example, the gas cooler may receive refrigerant from absorption subcooler 120 at
                                              13

   a temperature in the range of 90'C to 1 10 C, such as approximately 96'C, and may
   discharge refrigerant to absorption subcooler at a temperature in the range of 25 0 C to
   45 0 C. In some embodiments, the method 300 continues to a step 340.
            At step 340, absorption subcooler 120 receives cooled refrigerant. In some
 5 embodiments, absorption subcooler 120 receives cooled refrigerant from gas cooler
   130.    For example, as depicted in FIGURE 2, heat exchanger 250 of absorption
   subcooler receives cooled refrigerant from gas cooler 130 via inlet connection 252. In
   some embodiments, the method 300 continues to step 350.
            At step 350, absorption subcooler 120 applies a cooling stage to the cooled
10 refrigerant. In some embodiments, the cooling stage is applied by a heat exchanger.
   For example, as depicted in FIGURE 2, the cooling stage is applied by heat exchanger
   250. In some embodiments, the cooling stage comprises absorbing latent heat from
   refrigerant passing over coil system 256. Stated differently, coils of coil system 256
   may absorb heat from cooled refrigerant passing over coil system 256.           In some
15 embodiments, the cooling stage applied by heat exchanger 250 may reduce the
   temperature of the refrigerant between 2 0 C - 4 0 C.    As an example, the absorption
   subcooler may receive refrigerant from gas cooler 130 at a temperature in the range of
   32 0 C to 42 0 C, such as approximately 37 0 C, and may discharge refrigerant to
   expansion valve 140a at a temperature in the range of 25 0 C to 38 0 C.        The heat
20 absorbed by the coils of coil system 256 may be transferred to the absorption
   subcooler refrigerant traveling through coil system 236.          In some embodiments,
   heating the absorption subcooler refrigerant          causes the absorption subcooler
   refrigerant to change states from a liquid state to a vapor state. In some embodiments,
   method 300 continues to a step 360.
25          At step 360, heat exchanger 120 discharges the compressed refrigerant. In
   some embodiments, such as that depicted in FIGURE 2, heat exchanger 250
   discharges the cooled refrigerant to expansion valve 140a via outlet connection 254.
   Expansion valve 140a may control the flow of refrigerant to one or more evaporators
   160 and each evaporator 160 may be associated with a particular load. For example,
30 as depicted in FIGURE 1, evaporator 160a may be a low temperature load and
   evaporator 160b may be a medium temperature load. Accordingly, expansion valve
   140 may supply the discharged refrigerant to a refrigeration load.             In some
   embodiments, the method 300 continues to an end step 365.
                                               14

           The method 300 may include one or more additional steps. For example, the
   method 300 may also include a step comprising condensing the absorption subcooler
   refrigerant from a gaseous state into a liquid state using a condenser and/or mixing the
   absorption subcooler refrigerant with water. As described above, condenser 240 of
 5 absorption subcooler 120 may perform the condensing step and absorption chamber
   210 may perform the mixing step.
           In another method (not depicted), two or more components of refrigeration
   system 100 perform one or more steps. For example, refrigeration system 100 may
   perform a method comprising steps 305-360 above, and also comprise other steps
10 performed by other components of refrigeration system 100.          As an example, the
   method may also comprise one or more of: compressing refrigerant using one or more
   compressors (e.g., compressors 110), applying a cooling stage to refrigerant using a
   gas cooler (e.g., gas cooler 130), separating refrigerant into liquid refrigerant and
   refrigerant vapor using a flash tank (e.g., flash tank 150), and evaporating refrigerant
15 using one or more evaporators 160.
           Finally, FIGURE 4 illustrates an example of a controller 400 that may be
   operable to control one or more components of refrigeration system 100. Controller
   400 may comprise one or more components. For example, as depicted in FIGURE 4,
   controller 400 includes an interface 410, a memory 420, and a processor 430. In some
20 embodiments, each component of controller 400 is communicably coupled and the
   components permit instructions to be sent from controller 400 to other components of
   refrigeration system 100.      In some embodiments, controller 400 may provide
   instructions   to components     of refrigeration     system   100  via an appropriate
   communications link (e.g., wired or wireless) or analog control signal.
25         In some embodiments, controller 400 includes an interface 410. Interface 410
   may be configured to receive information.         In some embodiments, interface 410
   receives information continuously.      In other embodiments, interface 410 receives
   information periodically. As an example and not by way of limitation, interface 410
   may receive information from one or more sensors of refrigeration system 100. For
30 example, interface 410 may receive temperature and pressure information from one or
   more compressors 110, absorption subcooler 120, gas cooler 130, flash tank 150 and
   evaporators 160.     In some embodiments, interface 410 may store the received
   information in memory 420 and/or send the received information to processor 430 for
   processing. As another example, interface 410 may receive other control information
                                               15

   such as information about one or more setpoints.         Setpoint information may be
   received from one or more operators of controller 400 (e.g., manufacturer or user of
   refrigeration system 100).    The one or more setpoints may comprise information
   about a threshold for discharging refrigerant.    As an example and not by way of
 5 limitation, interface 410 may receive three different setpoints: (1) a setpoint
   associated with a temperature of compressed refrigerant discharged from absorption
   subcooler 120; (2) a setpoint associated with a temperature of cooled refrigerant
   discharged from gas cooler 130; and (3) a setpoint associated with a temperature of
   cooled refrigerant discharged from absorption subcooler 120.         Although certain
10 setpoints have been described, this disclosure recognizes that interface 410 may
   receive information about any other setpoints (e.g., temperature of refrigerant being
   compressed by compressors 110, temperature of refrigerant being evaporated by
   evaporators 160, temperature of refrigerant within flash tank 150). Interface 410 may
   also receive any other suitable information.
15         Additionally, interface 410 may be configured to send instructions to one or
   more components of refrigeration system 100.       For example, processor 430 may
   generate instructions for one or more components of refrigeration system 100 (e.g.,
   compressors    110, absorption subcooler 120, gas cooler 130, flash tank            150,
   evaporators 160) and interface 410 may relay those instructions to the intended
20 component of refrigeration system 100.       As an example, in response to receiving
   instructions for absorption subcooler 120, interface 410 sends the instructions to
   absorption subcooler 120.
           In some embodiments, controller 400 includes memory 420. Memory 420 of
   controller 400 may be configured to store information. The information stored by
25 memory 420 may comprise data detected by one or more sensors of refrigeration
   system 100, setpoint information received from one or more operators, and/or any
   other suitable information. In some embodiments, suitable information may include
   operating instructions of refrigeration system 100.       Operating instructions may
   comprise instructions about the temperature and/or pressure of refrigerant as it leaves,
30 or is received by, a component of refrigeration system 100 (e.g., refrigerant is
   discharged from gas cooler 130 when it is cooled to at least 37'C, cooled refrigerant is
   discharged from absorption subcooler 120 when it is cooled to at least 34'C).
           Controller 400 also includes a processor 430 in some embodiments. Processor
   430 may be configured to receive information from interface 410 and/or memory 420
                                              16

   and process the received information. In some embodiments, processor 430 may also
   be configured to generate instructions for one or more components of refrigeration
   system 100 after processing the received information.         For example, operating
   instructions stored in memory 420 may recite that refrigerant is to be discharged from
 5 gas cooler 130 after it cools refrigerant 60'C. Interface 410 may receive temperature
   information from one or more sensors of gas cooler 130. Specifically, interface 410
   may receive information from gas cooler 410 that refrigerant was 96'C when the
   refrigerant entered gas cooler 410 and may receive, and relay to processor 430,
   temperature updates as gas cooler 130 applies a cooling stage to the refrigerant. Upon
10 receiving information from interface 410 that the temperature of the refrigerant in gas
   cooler 130 has reached 36'C, processor 430 may generate an instruction for gas
   cooler 130 to discharge the refrigerant. In some embodiments, this instruction is sent
   directly from processor 430 to interface 410, and interface 410 sends the instruction to
   gas cooler 130.     It will be understood that processor 430 may controls various
15 operations of components of refrigeration system 100 in a similar manner.
           Although this disclosure describes and depicts using an absorption subcooler
   to supplement cooling of refrigerant in a transcritical refrigeration system, this
   disclosure recognizes other applications as well.        For example, this disclosure
   recognizes using an absorption subcooler to supplement cooling in DX refrigeration
20 systems comprising condensers and circulating synthetic refrigerants.           In such
   systems, the condenser receives refrigerant that has been cooled by the first heat
   exchanger of the absorption subcooler and applies a cooling stage to the refrigerant
   before discharging the refrigerant back to the absorption subcooler for further cooling.
            Similarly, this disclosure recognizes using an absorption subcooler to
25 supplement cooling in an HVAC system. For example, absorption subcooler may
   provide supplemental cooling to refrigerant circulating through an HVAC system. In
   such an embodiment, absorption subcooler may be configured to receive compressed
   refrigerant from one or more compressors and apply a cooling stage to the refrigerant
   before discharging the compressed refrigeration to a condenser of an HVAC system.
30 The condenser of the HVAC system may apply a cooling stage to the refrigerant
   received from the absorption subcooler before discharging the refrigerant back to the
   absorption subcooler for another cooling stage.
           Embodiments of the present disclosure may have one or more technical
   advantages. In certain embodiments, refrigeration system 100 includes an absorption
                                               17

   subcooler 120. The inclusion of absorption subcooler 120 may allow for reducing
   power consumption that would otherwise be consumed by refrigeration system 100 if
   absorption subcooler 120 was not present.        As an example, one embodiment of
   refrigeration system 100 having a C02 transcritical booster configuration (300 kW)
 5 and a 0.68 Coefficient of Performance (COP) may achieve a 2.9'C reduction in the
   temperature of refrigerant supplied to expansion valve 140a and a 35.2% reduction in
   system power consumption based on the addition of absorption subcooler 120.
           First consider a refrigeration system 100 similar to that shown in FIGURE 1,
   however, without the addition of absorption subcooler 120 (e.g., such that compressor
10 110 would discharge refrigerant directly to gas cooler 130, and gas cooler 130 would
   discharge refrigerant directly to expansion valve 140a). Such a refrigeration system
   may have a flash gas mass flow rate of 1757 Kg/hr which requires 39.46 KW of
   power to operate compressors 110.        In such a refrigeration system, one or more
   compressors 110 discharge refrigerant to gas cooler 130 at a high pressure and a high
15 temperature (e.g., 1300 PSI and 120'C, respectively). Gas cooler 130 may apply a
   cooling stage to the refrigerant thereby reducing the temperature by about 80'C. For
   example, gas cooler may cool the refrigerant from 120'C to 37'C. After applying the
   cooling stage, gas cooler 130 may then discharge the refrigerant to expansion valve
   140a at a high pressure and a low temperature (e.g., 1300 PSI and 37'C, respectively).
20 Expansion valve 140a may receive the refrigerant from gas cooler 130 and reduce the
   pressure of the refrigerant by adjusting the openness of expansion valve 140a. As an
   example, expansion valve 140a may reduce the pressure of the refrigerant from 1300
   PSI to 532 PSI, thereby forming a mixture of refrigerant vapor and liquid refrigerant.
   As an example, at 2'C and 532 PSI, the refrigerant mixture is about 46% refrigerant
25 vapor and 54% liquid refrigerant.      The refrigerant mixture flows from expansion
   valve 140a and enters flash tank 150 for separation.
           In flash tank 150, the refrigerant mixture is separated into refrigerant vapor
   (flash gas) and liquid refrigerant.   The flash gas is supplied to compressor 11 Ob by
   flowing first through valve 140b. Valve 140b may further reduce the pressure of the
30 flash gas to a pressure similar to that of the pressure of refrigerant vapor discharged
   from compressor 1 10a.      For example, valve 140b may receive flash gas with a
   pressure of 532 and reduce the pressure of the flash gas to a pressure of 430 PSI, the
   same pressure as the pressure of refrigerant discharged from compressor 110a. As for
   the remaining refrigerant in flash tank 150, liquid refrigerant precipitates at the
                                               18

   bottom of flash tank 150 and is discharged to valves 140c and 140d to provide cooling
   for evaporators 160a and 160b. The openness of valves 140c and 140d may control
   the temperature and pressure of the liquid refrigerant reaching evaporators 160a and
   160b. For example, the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant supplied to case
 5 160a may be -30'C and 207 PSI, respectively, and the temperature and pressure of the
   refrigerant supplied to case 160b may be -6'C and 430 PSI, respectively. Evaporation
   occurs in evaporators 160, thereby causing the liquid refrigerant supplied to cases 160
   to change to vapor. Vapor from case 160a may be discharged to compressor 110a at a
   first temperature and pressure and vapor from case 160b may be discharged to
10 compressor 1 Ob at a second temperature and pressure. After the vapor from case
   160a is compressed by compressor 110a, the vapor is discharged at a particular
   temperature and pressure.       This temperature and pressure may be the same
   temperature and pressure as the temperature and pressure of the flash gas discharged
   from flash tank 150 and the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant vapor
15 discharged from evaporator 160b. For example, the flash gas discharged from valve
   140b, the refrigerant vapor discharged from evaporator 160b, and the refrigerant
   vapor discharged from compressor 1 Oa may be at 430 PSI. At this juncture, the
   refrigerant of the same pressure mixes together and continues to flow to compressor
   11 Ob for compression.
20         Next, consider refrigeration system 100 with absorption subcooler 120
   included, as shown in FIGURE 1. As described above, absorption subcooler 120 is
   powered by waste heat and provides supplemental cooling to refrigeration system
   100. The net refrigeration effect of using an absorption subcooler may be significant.
   For example, the net refrigeration effect produced by using absorption cooler 120 is
25 46.7 KW assuming that a 0.68 coefficient of performance and recovering 68.84 KW
   of heat from compressor discharge lines.      The supplemental cooling provided by
   absorption subcooler may permit more refrigerant flowing through expansion valve
   140a to change to a liquid state and be provided to cases 160. By increasing the
   amount of refrigerant vapor that becomes liquid refrigerant, the amount of refrigerant
30 vapor that becomes flash gas (requiring compression) is decreased. Accordingly, by
   incorporating absorption subcooler 120, there is a reduction in both flash gas flow and
   power consumption relative to a refrigeration system 100 without absorption
   subcooler 120. For example, a refrigeration system 100 with absorption subcooler
   120 may have a flash gas mass flow rate of 1139 Kg/hr (compared to the 1757 Kg/hr
                                              19

   in a refrigeration system 100 without an absorption subcooler) which requires only
   25.58 KW of power to compress (compared to the 39.46 KW of power needed to
   compress flash gas in a refrigeration system 100 without an absorption subcooler). In
   such example, a refrigeration system 100 with absorption subcooler 120 reduces flash
 5 gas flow and power consumption by 35.2%.
           In a refrigeration system 100 with an absorption subcooler 120, one or more
   compressors 110 discharge refrigerant to absorption subcooler 120 at a high pressure
   and a high temperature (e.g., 1300 PSI and 120'C, respectively).             Absorption
   subcooler 120 may apply a first cooling stage to the refrigerant thereby reducing the
10 temperature by about 20'C. For example, absorption subcooler 120 may cool the
   refrigerant from 120'C to 96'C. After applying the first cooling stage, absorption
   subcooler 120 may discharge the refrigerant to gas cooler 130. Gas cooler 130 may
   receive the refrigerant at about 96'C and 1300 PSI and apply a second cooling stage
   to the refrigerant.   The second cooling stage may reduce the temperature of the
15 refrigerant by about 60'C. For example, gas cooler 130 may cool the refrigerant from
   96'C to 37 0 C. After applying the second cooling stage, gas cooler 130 may discharge
   the refrigerant to the absorption subcooler 120 for additional cooling.      Absorption
   subcooler 120 may then apply a third cooling stage to the refrigerant.        The third
   cooling stage may reduce the temperature of the refrigerant by about 3C.             For
20 example, absorption subcooler 120 may cool the refrigerant from 37'C to 34'C during
   the third cooling stage. After applying the third cooling stage, absorption subcooler
   120 may discharge the refrigerant to expansion valve 140a at a high pressure and a
   low temperature (e.g., 1330 PSI and 34.1'C, respectively).       Expansion valve 140a
   may then reduce the pressure of the refrigerant by adjusting the openness of
25 expansion valve 140a. As an example, expansion valve 140a may reduce the pressure
   of the refrigerant from 1330 PSI to 532 PSI, thereby forming a mixture of refrigerant
   vapor and liquid refrigerant. As an example, at 34. 1C and 1330 PSI, the refrigerant
   mixture is about 39% refrigerant vapor and 61% liquid refrigerant.       The refrigerant
   mixture flows from expansion valve 140a and enters flash tank 150 for separation.
30         In flash tank 150, the refrigerant mixture is separated into refrigerant vapor
   (flash gas) and liquid refrigerant. The flash gas is supplied to compressor 11 Ob by
   flowing first through valve 140b. Valve 140b may further reduce the pressure of the
   flash gas to a pressure similar to that of the pressure of refrigerant vapor discharged
   from compressor 110a.       For example, valve 140b may receive flash gas with a
                                              20

   pressure of 532 and reduce the pressure of the flash gas to a pressure of 430 PSI, the
   same pressure as the pressure of refrigerant discharged from compressor 110a. As for
   the remaining refrigerant in flash tank 150, liquid refrigerant precipitates at the
   bottom of flash tank 150 and is discharged to valves 140c and 140d to provide cooling
 5 effects for evaporators 160a and 160b. The openness of valves 140c and 140d may
   control the temperature and pressure of the liquid refrigerant reaching evaporators
   160a and 160b. For example, the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant supplied
   to case 160a may be -30'C and 207 PSI, respectively, and the temperature and
   pressure of the refrigerant supplied to case 160b may be -6'C and 430 PSI,
10 respectively.   Evaporation occurs in evaporators 160, thereby causing the liquid
   refrigerant supplied to cases 160 to change to vapor. Vapor from case 160a may be
   discharged to compressor 110a at a first temperature and pressure and vapor from
   case 160b may be discharged to compressor 110b at a second temperature and
   pressure.   After the vapor from case 160a is compressed by compressor 1 10a, the
15 vapor is discharged at a particular temperature and pressure. This pressure may be the
   same pressure as the pressure of the flash gas discharged from flash tank 150 and the
   pressure of the refrigerant vapor discharged from evaporator 160d. For example, the
   flash gas discharged from valve 140b, the refrigerant vapor discharged from
   evaporator 160b, and the refrigerant vapor discharged from compressor 1 10a may be
20 430 PSI. At this juncture, the refrigerant of the same pressure mixes together and
   continues to flow to compressor 1 10b for compression.
