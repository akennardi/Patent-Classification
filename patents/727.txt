SYSTEM, AND RADIO COMMUNICATION METHOD
ABSTRACT
        Disclosed is a radio communication apparatus to perform communication with another
radio communication apparatus by using a plurality of frequency bands. In one aspect, the radio
communication apparatus comprises: a receiver configured to receive, when performing a
random access procedure to the another radio communication apparatus, a control message by
using a first frequency band as a message transmitted by the radio communication apparatus at a
last of the random access procedure, the control message instructing communication using a
second frequency band different from the first frequency band; and a controller configured to
control communication according to reception of the control message, to perform data
communication with the another radio communication apparatus by using the second frequency
band.

Technical Field
      At least one embodiment discussed herein is related to a radio communication apparatus, a
radio communication system, and a radio communication method.
Background
      A plurality of radio communication systems such as a cell-phone system and a radio MAN
(Metropolitan Area Network) are currently used. For attaining a further speeding up and large
capacity of radio communication, lively discussion is continuously performed about a next
generation radio communication technology.
      For example, in a 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership

                                                - 2
   Project)        being      a    standardization            organization,               there       is
   proposed       a    communication           standard        referred            to   as    an     LTE
    (Long    Term        Evolution)          enabling         communication                using         a
   frequency band of              20 MHz at       a maximum.              Further,       as a next
 5 generation           communication            standard           of        LTE,       there        is
   proposed       a   communication           standard       referred            to   as   an    LTE-A
    (LTE-Advanced) enabling communication using five                                      frequency
   bands    (namely, a frequency band of 100 MHz)                                 of 20 MHz at a
   maximum      (see, for         example, Non-Patent Literatures                          1 and 2).
10 In   the   LTE-A,       the     number     of   frequency          bands        to be    used      is
   proposed        to   be     dynamically         changed         according           to    traffic
    (see, for example, Non-Patent Literature 3).
                Further,         in a radio communication system, from one
   radio     communication              device      (e.g.,       a     mobile         station)        to
15 another      radio      communication          device        (e.g.,         a   base    station)
   which    performs          allocation         control        of      radio        resources,          a
   random access may be performed.                       The random access from the
   mobile      station         to      the   base     station            is     performed,           for
   example,        at    the     time      when    (1)    the      mobile          station       first
20 accesses        the    base        station,       (2)    an      allocation            of     radio
   resources        used     for     data    transmission            is     requested          to    the
   base     station,          and        (3)   synchronization                  is     established
   during     reception          of     data   from     the     base        station,        and      (4)
   synchronization             is      achieved      with       a     mobile          target       base
25 station during a handover.
                The      random         access     includes           a     contention           based
   random     access        and      a    non-contention            based          random      access

   Literature 4,           and 5.       1 section of Non-Patent                   Literature 5).
   In    the    case    of    the     random         access        from   the   mobile       station
   to the base station,                 in the contention based random access,
 5 the    mobile      station         arbitrarily              selects     a   signal      sequence
   from      among    a   plurality            of     signal        sequences    and     transmits
   it to the base station as a random access preamble.                                         In the
   non-contention             based         random          access,        the   base        station
   notifies        the     mobile         station          of      information      in     which       a
10 signal        sequence          is     specified             and     the    mobile        station
   transmits        a   signal       sequence           according        to  the   notification
   from the base station as the random access preamble.

   the     base      station       10     or   the     relay        station     30,   and   then
   transmits and receives data.
25                The    relay        station        30     is    a    radio    communication
   device        which    relays          data     transmission           between     the   base
   station 10 and the mobile station 20.                              The relay station 30

   may      be      a     fixed        communication           device         or       a     mobile
   communication            device.         The    relay     station        30     may      perform
   random        access         to    the     base      station        10     and       establish
   synchronization therewith.                     In addition,          the relay station
 5 30    manages        radio       resources       of   a   link      between         the      relay
   station 30 and the mobile station 20.
                  In      the       following        description           of       the       second
   embodiment,           the     random     access     procedure        performed           between
   the    base       station        10    and   the    mobile        station        20     will       be
10 described.           Even between the base station                     10    and the relay
   station 30         as well as between the relay station 30                               and the
   mobile       station         20,    the    same     random       access       procedure            is
   performed.
                  FIG.      3     is   a   sequence        diagram       illustrating               the
15 contention          based       random     access     procedure.            The      following
   section       will     now discuss          the    case   where      the     random        access
   procedure         is   performed in          only one component              carrier.            The
   sequence         illustrated           in    FIG.     3   includes          the      following
   steps:
20                (Step      Sl)      When    data     to   be    transmitted            in    an     UL
    (uplink)       is    generated,         the   mobile      station        20     selects         one
   arbitrary          signal         sequence       from     among        a     plurality             of
   previously defined signal                   sequences.         The mobile station 20
   then     transmits          a   random     access      preamble        (Msgl)        including
25 the    selected         signal        sequence      to   the      base     station          10     by
   using     a    PRACH       (Physical       Random     Access       Channel) .            At    this
   time,     on the PRACH, a plurality of the mobile stations may

                                                   - 20
   transmit           the      Msgl    of   the      same    signal        sequence,          namely,
   contention of the random access may be caused.
                     (Step      S12)   When     detecting        the     Msgl      on    the   PRACH,
   the base station                10 measures UL transmission timing of                            the
 5 mobile         station        20,    and    at    the   same        time    allocates          a  UL
   radio resource               to the mobile station 20.                    The base         station
   10      then         transmits        the     random        access        response           (Msg2)
   including            information        for      synchronizing           the     UL    timing     or
   information indicating the allocated UL radio resource.                                           In
10 the      case       where      the    contention         of      the    random         access     is
   caused,           the       mobile     stations        which          transmit          the     Msgl
   receive the Msg2,                 respectively.
                     (Step      S13)    When     receiving           the   Msg2,        the    mobile
   station           20      transmits        a     scheduled          transmission             (Msg3)
15 including             the     identification          information            of      the    mobile
   station          20    to    the   base    station       10    by     using      the     UL   radio
   resource           allocated        by   the     base    station        10.        In    the    case
   where       the      contention        of    the    random       access      is     caused,      the
   mobile         stations        which     transmit       the      Msgl      (namely,        receive
20 the Msg2)            transmit an Msg3,             respectively.            In this        case,    a
   plurality of the                transmitted Msg3            sets interfere with each
   other on the same radio resource.
                     (Step S14)        The base station 10 detects the Msg3 on
   the UL radio resource allocated at                            step S12.           Based on       the
25 identification               information         included        in   the    Msg3,       the    base
   station         10     recognizes      the mobile station                20 which performs
   the      random          access.       As     a    result,         the    base       station      10
   11922710

                                                        - 21
   transmits            a    contention             resolution            (Msg4)      indicating             that
   the     mobile         station        20     is     recognized           to    the mobile           station
   20.      The mobile station 20                       then establishes               synchronization
   between          the       base       station           10     and      its      own    station,            and
 5 allows the data communication.
                    Note that           in    the      case where           the     contention           of    the
   random access                is    caused, the            identification information of
   the      mobile         station         as     a    transmission             source       fails        to    be
   extracted from the Msg3.                            In this case, the base station 10
10 transmits            a   message        indicating             that      the     contention          of     the
   random access is                  caused.          After waiting for only the random
   time,        the       mobile        station          20     which        receives         the     message
   returns           to       step       Sl         and      performs           the      random          access
   procedure            again.          When       the      contention           is   eliminated,              the
15 mobile        station           20   establishes              synchronization              between          the
   base      station           10    and    its       own     station,         and    allows        the      data
   communication.
                    FIG.       4 is     a sequence diagram illustrating the non
   contention             based        random         access        procedure.            The      following
20 section         will       now discuss              the     case    where        the   random         access
   procedure           is     performed in              only one component                 carrier.            The
   sequence           illustrated               in      FIG.       4   includes          the       following
   steps:
                     (Step       S21)      When       data      transmitted           in    the      downlink
25  (DL)      reaches           the     base        station          10,     the     base       station         10
   selects         one      unused        signal        sequence          from      among     a    plurality
   of      the     previously              defined           signal        sequences.              The       base
   11922710

                                                   - 22
   station         10      then          transmits            the        dedicated               preamble
   notification           (Msg0)         for     specifying             the      selected           signal
   sequence       to the mobile station 20.                          At this        time,        the base
   station       10   performs           exclusion          control        to     a     plurality        of
 5 mobile       stations         so     as   not       to    allocate          the        same      signal
   sequence at the same time.
                  (Step S22)          Within        the    specified period                  (period of
   validity)        from      receiving         the      Msg0,        the   mobile          station      20
   transmits        the Msgl         including the             signal       sequence           specified
10 by     the   Msg0    to      the     base      station          10   by    using         the     PRACH.
   Here,      since    the       specified          signal         sequence        is      exclusively
   allocated        to   the      mobile       stations           20   within        the      period     of
   validity,         the      contention            of     the       random       access           is   not
   caused.
15                (Step     S23)       When    detecting            the   Msgl       on     the     PRACH,
   the base station              10 allocates             the UL radio resource to                      the
   mobile stations 20.                 The base         station 10          then transmits the
   Msg2      including          information             indicating           the       allocated         UL
   radio       resource          to     the     mobile           station         20.           The     data
20 communication          is      then     enabled        between        the base           station      10
   and     the   mobile        station       20.         Since       the    contention              of  the
   random      access      is     not    caused,        the      base    station          10    need not
   transmit        and    receive          the    Msg3      and       the    Msg4        in     the    non
   contention based random access.
25               The   contention            based        random        access        is    performed,
   for     example,      at      the     time     when       (1)     the    mobile          station      20
   first      accesses        the     base    station          10,     and    at     the      time     when

    (2) the mobile station 20                         requests          the allocation of radio
   resources to the base station 10.                                  The non-contention based
   random           access          is       performed,             for       example,          (3)       when
   receiving           data       from      the base         station        10,     at    the   time      when
 5 the mobile station 20                        establishes           synchronization with the
   base      station           10,     and      (4)   when      performing            handover       to     the
   base       station           10     from      another        base      station,          at   the      time
   when        the      mobile          station         20     establishes             synchronization
   with the base station 10.
10                   Note       that       when      the      non-contention               based      random
   access         is     to     be     performed          (for       example,         at    the    time       of
   establishing                synchronization               during        the     handover        or     when
   the     mobile         station         20    receives         data     from the          base    station
   10)      in       the      case       where       the      separately            allocated         signal
15 sequence           is exhausted in the base station                               10,    the Msg0        not
   including a dedicated preamble                               is    transmitted and received.
   In      this        case,         the       contention            based       random        access         is
   performed.               In    the     case      of   the     handover,          the     base    station
   10    before          the      handover          transmits          the     Msg0      to   the     mobile
20 station          20.       According           to   the     second       embodiment,           the     base

   the    PDCCH     is     not      constant,            the     mobile         station          20      blind
   decodes       the     PDCCH.           Specifically,                the     mobile          station           20
   tries      a   plurality            of   decodes            according            to     a     length          of

   random      access          preamble           (Msgl)       from        the    mobile         station         20
   by using the component carrier notified by the Msg0.
                    (Step       S118)      The     RAR control              unit      18   generates            the

   The    PDCCH control              unit 25 extracts the CIF included                                    in the
   Msg0.      In the case where the plurality of the Msg0                                             sets are
   received,         the      PDCCH       control         unit       25     extracts            the      CIF      in
10 each Msg0.
                  (Step        S123)      The      PDCCH       control         unit        25     identifies
   the    component            carrier        indicated            by     the     CIF        extracted            at

   by   using       the      above       component          carrier.            In     the       case      where
15 the    component           carrier        indicated           by     the     CIF       is     set     as     the
   "Configured but Deactivated CC",                              the      PDCCH control unit 25
   changes       it     into        the    "Configured              and     Activated              CC".        The
   cross     carrier          setting         unit       22    sets       a    frequency             band       for
   performing signal processing.

   component         carrier          indicated by            the CIF.           In the case where
   the     plurality            of      the     Msg0        sets        are      received             and       the
25 plurality of the                 component carriers                   are    identified at                 step
   S123,     the      radio        communication              unit       21    transmits             the     Msgl
   for      each        identified              component              carrier.                  The        radio

   information          included in             the Msg2.           The      radio      communication
   unit 21 performs data communication by using the                                            component
   carrier       in which the Msgl and the Msg2 are                                  transmitted and

                  FIG.      10   illustrates           a  first          random access           example
   according to the               second embodiment.                     Suppose here           that  the
   mobile      station        20     sets      the   CC#1     and       #2    as     the    "Configured
   and    Activated          CC"      and     the    CC#3      to      #5    as     the    "Configured
15 but     Deactivated            CC".          Suppose         further           that       the  "PDCCH
   monitoring set" includes only the CC#1.
                   (Step S131)            The base station 10                  transmits the Msg0
   including         CIF=0b001          to     the mobile          station          20   by using     the
   CC#1 set as the "PDCCH monitoring set".
20                 (Step      S132)        The    mobile        station          20    transmits      the
   Msgl to       the base         station 10 by using the                        CC#2 indicated by
   the    CIF=0b001.            Since        the    CC#2     is      set      as    the     "Configured
   and Activated CC", the mobile station 20                                     need not change a
   state of the CC#2.
25                 (Step S133)            The base station 10                  transmits the Msg2
   to   the     mobile       station          20   by    using        the      CC#2     in    which   the
   Msgl     is   received.            For example,          the mobile station 20                    then

                  Transmission          characteristics                of     radio       signals    are
   different           in    each    component           carrier           (in     each      frequency
   band).            Therefore,         when        the       Msgl        and       the      Msg2    are
 5 transmitted and received by the                           component          carrier in which
   the    data       communication         is     performed,            stabilization            of  the
   data     communication           is    effectively            attained.              In   addition,
   for    ease       of   explanation         of    FIG.      10,      only      the     CC#1    is  set
   as   the      "PDCCH       monitoring         set"       and     further         any     CC   may  be
10 also set as           the "PDCCH monitoring set".                          In this        case,   the
   MsgO is        transmitted by the CC                  set as the "PDCCH monitoring

15 #5   at the        time of      starting the random access procedure are
   the same as those of FIG.                    10.
                    (Step S141)        The base station 10                   transmits the Msg0

   base     station        10,   the mobile           station         20    activates         the   CC#3

                    (Step S143)          The base station 10                    transmits the Msg2
   to    the     mobile      station          20    by     using         the    CC#3       in    which       the
   Msgl      is    received.         For example,               the mobile station 20                      then
   transmits data to the base station 10 by using the CC#3.

   receiving          the   Msg0       and     the      Msgl,        the    base       station         10    and
   the      mobile        station           20     change           a     state         of      the      CC#3.
   Specifically,            the      Msg0      and       the      Msgl      double         as     signaling
   for     changing       a    state        of   the       CC#3.          Accordingly,             the     base
10 station         10   and    the      mobile        station          20    need      not      separately
   perform the signaling for changing a state of the CC#3.
                   FIG.    12    illustrates             a    third       random access              example
   according to the               second embodiment.                      States       of the        CC#1     to
   #5    at the       time of       starting the random access procedure are

                    (Step S151)          The base station 10                    transmits the MsgO
   including          the   CIF=0b001           to     the     mobile        station          20   by using
   the CC#1 set as the "PDCCH monitoring set".
                    (Step S152)          The base station 10                    transmits the Msg0
20 including          the   CIF=0b010           to     the     mobile        station          20   by using
   the CC#1.           Since the CC#3             indicated by the CIF=0b010 is                              set
   as    the     "Configured           but     Deactivated               CC",      the      base     station
   10    activates        the     CC#3       and    changes           it   into       the      "Configured
   and      Activated          CC".           The      base         station          10     may      further
25 transmit two MsgO                sets at the same timing.
                    (Step    S153)        The     mobile          station          20    transmits           the
   Msgl to         the base       station 10 by using CC#2                          indicated by the

                 (Step   S154)     The    mobile     station         20    transmits     the
   Msgl to the base station 10 by using the CC#3 indicated by
   the CIF=0b010.          At this time,        in   the same manner as              in  the
 5 base     station    10,    the mobile      station        20   activates       the CC#3
   and changes it        into the "Configured and Activated CC".                         The
   mobile      station     20   may   further      transmit         two     Msgl   sets   at
   the same timing.
                 (Step S155) By using the CC#2, the base station 10
10 receives       the   Msgl     and   transmits        the     Msg2     to    the   mobile
   station      20.     By   using    the    CC#2,     for      example,       the   mobile
   station 20 then transmits data to the base station 10.
                 (Step S156) By using the CC#3, the base station 10
   receives       the   Msgl     and   transmits        the     Msg2     to   the    mobile
15 station      20.     By   using    the    CC#3,     for      example,       the   mobile
   station 20 then transmits data to the base station 10.
                The     signal       sequence        specified           by     the     Msg0
   transmitted at step S151              and the signal sequence specified
   by   the    Msg0   transmitted        at   step     S152     may be       the   same   or
20 different       from each      other.      Specifically,            with respect       to
   the Msgl transmitted at step S153 and the Msgl transmitted
   at    step     S154,    the    mobile     station        20     may     use   the    same
   signal sequence or different signal sequence.
                In    the      above-described           example         of    the     cross

   implemented,          for       example,           at     the     time       when      the      mobile
   station      20    performs         random         access       to    the      base     station         10
   from a state of the connected mode or idle mode.

                     In addition to format examples of FIGS. 14                                    and 15,
   there         is    also       considered        a   method        in      which       intermediate

10 of FIG. 13 are allocated to the carrier indicator field.
                     Incidentally, in the format example, a data length
   of     the       Msg0     is    different        depending          on      a   DL     bandwidth         of
   the      component carrier.                   Therefore, a plurality of                        the Msg0
   sets       having        different          data   lengths         may      be     transmitted           by
15 the CC#1.             Suppose, for example, that a DL bandwidth of the
   CC#2       is     20   MHz     and     a   DL  bandwidth         of     the      CC#3    is     10    MHz.
   In     this       case,       the    Msg0     corresponding            to     the     CC#2      and     the
   Msg0       corresponding             to    the CC#3 have           different           data     lengths.
                     On    the     other       hand,    the      mobile        station         20    blind
20 decodes          the PDCCH and extracts                   the Msg0.            Accordingly, for
   reducing           an     overhead          of  the     blind        decoding,           the      mobile
   station 20 preferably adjusts a size                                 so that a size of                  the
   Msg0       may be constant even if the DL bandwidth is                                       different

                    FIG.         16     illustrates             a      first         size        adjustment
   example         of     the     MsgO.       The     size      adjustment             example       of    FIG.
   16     corresponds              to   the     format       example          illustrated            in    FIG.
   13.        In     this       size      adjustment          example,            the     PADDING        field
 5 having a           length        according to            the     DL    bandwidth is              inserted
   between           the       Resource          block        Assignment               field       and       the
   Preamble           Index       field.        Through        the      process,          a   size     of    the
   MsgO      becomes constant without relation to                                    the DL bandwidth.
   Since         a     position           of     the       CIF      is    constant,              after       the
10 decoding            of     the     MsgO,        the      CIF      is    easily           extracted          to
   identify the component                       carrier       to be used.                Further, since
   positions            of    the     Preamble          Index      field        and     the      PRACH     Mask
   Index        field         are     constant,           the     Msgl      is       easily       generated
   with reference to the above fields.

   of FIG.         16,      the     PADDING field having a                     length according to
20 the      DL     bandwidth           is    inserted         between           the     Resource         block
   Assignment             field and the Preamble                    Index field.               Through the
   process,           a    size     of    the    MsgO       becomes        constant,            and    at    the
   same      time       a    position         of    the     CIF becomes              constant        without
   relation           to    the      DL   bandwidth.             Positions            of    the     Preamble
25 Index       field        and     the    PRACH Mask           Index       field        further        become
   constant.

   A base       station          and    mobile      station        of      the      third      embodiment
   are     implemented            by    the    same     block       configurations                as   those
   of the base station 10                     and mobile station 20                       of the second
20 embodiment             illustrated           in      FIGS.        6     and        7.       The     third
   embodiment            will       be     described          below         by       using       reference

                  FIG.        19   is    a   flowchart         illustrating                a  process      of
   the     base      station         according         to    the      third        embodiment.            The
25 process         illustrated             in    FIG.       19     includes              the     following
   steps:
                   (Step S211)           The control unit 14                    sets states of the
   11922710

                                                   -  46
   CC#1        to     #5      with      regard         to      the     mobile            station        20.
   Specifically,              the     control        unit      14   identifies             the     above
   described "Configured but Deactivated CC",                                      "Configured and
   Activated CC", and "PDCCH monitoring set".
 5                  (Step      S212)     The     PDCCH        control        unit       16   generates
   the     dedicated           preamble       notification             (Msg0)         not    including
   the     CIF.        The      radio     communication             unit       11     transmits         the
   Msg0        to    the      mobile      station          20    by    using         the     component
   carrier included in the "PDCCH monitoring set.
10                  (Step        S213)      The       radio        communication               unit      11
   receives         the random access preamble                       (Msgl) from the mobile
   station        20     by     using     the     component          carrier           in    which      the
   Msg0      is   transmitted.
                    (Step S214)         The control unit 14 determines whether
15 to    implement          the     cross    carrier          scheduling.              Specifically,
   the     control unit            14 determines whether to perform the data
   communication              except      for     the      component           carrier        in     which
   the     random access            response         (Msg2)      is   transmitted.               If not,
   the     process         advances        to    step        S215.        If     so,      the    process
20 proceeds to step S216.
                    (Step S215)         The RAR control unit 18 sets the                             Obll
   in the        CIF included in the Msg2.                       This binary digit string
   indicates          that      the    data    communication              is    performed         by    the
   component          carrier        in   which       the     Msg2     is     transmitted.              The
25 process then proceeds to step S218.
                    (Step S216) From among the CC#1                          to #5,        the control
   unit       14   selects        one    or   a    plurality         of      component         carriers

                                                  -    47
   in    which      the    data      communication               is    performed,             except      for
   the component carrier in which the Msg2 is                                       transmitted.
                   (Step     S217)       The   RAR      control          unit       18   sets      a    3-bit
   CIF indicating the                component          carrier selected at step                         S216.
 5 Note       that     the     Msg2        is    transmitted                for      each       component
   carrier selected at step S216.
                   (Step      S218)         The      radio          communication                unit      11
   transmits         the   Msg2       including           the     CIF      set     at    step      S215    or
   S217       to    the    mobile         station          20      by     using        the      component
10 carrier       included in          the     "PDCCH monitoring set.                        In    the case
   where      the plurality of the                  component            carriers are             selected
   at    step     S216,     the     radio      communication                unit      11    transmits        a
   plurality          of    the      Msg2       sets.             In      the      case       where       the
   component          carrier        notified           by     the       Msg2       is     set      as    the

   UL    transmission               timing      after        the    random        access      procedure
   by using the Timing Advance Command.
20                 Here,        the Timing Advance Command is described, for
   example,           in     "Evolved         Universal           Terrestrial           Radio      Access

                    In the above-described literature, two types of an
25 absolute           value        in     a   displacement             of      the     timing       and      a
   relative            value          using       as       a     reference           the      currently

   The      absolute         value       is      used      in     the       case      where      the     Timing
   Advance Command is                  first notified, or a validity period of
   a     previously          notified           Timing         Advance           Command      is     expired.
   The     relative          value      is     used      in     the      case where          the validity
 5 period         of     the    previously            notified            Timing         Advance       Command
   is     not     expired.            The     absolute           value        is    represented           by    11
   bits      and     the     relative          value        is    represented             by  6    bits.        In
   the      format          example         of      FIG.       24,       the       relative        value        is
   supposed to be used.
10                  In     the     above        format         example,           a   most     significant
   reserved          bit     is    set      to    one.         A most         significant           R    bit    of
   the Msg2 not including the CIF is                                  set to zero.             Through the
   process,          the     mobile         station          20     easily         determines          whether
   the Msg2 includes the CIF.
15                  FIG.     25 illustrates                a second format example of the
   Msg2.         In    the    format example                 of FIG.         25,     the Msg2        includes
   the     Timing Advance               Command          of    11     bits,       the UL      grant        of   20
   bits,       the      Carrier        Indicator            of     3   bits,        and    the     Temporary
   C-RNTI of 13 bits.                   In the case              of this          format example, the
20 absolute          value      may be         used      as     the      Timing Advance              Command.
   On     the      other      hand,        the     Temporary             C-RNTI        is   smaller          by   3
   bits than that in the case of FIG. 24.                                         The base station 10
   allocates           an identifier capable of being represented by 13
   bits or less to the mobile station 20.
25                  FIG.     26     illustrates             a   third format example                     of    the
   Msg2.         In the       format example                 of FIG.         26,     the Msg2        includes
   the     Timing Advance Command of                           11     bits,       the UL      grant of          20

   bits,       the       Temporary            C-RNTI           of     16    bits,         and     the     Carrier
   Indicator           of     3 bits.            In     the      case     of     this       format example,
   the      absolute            value         may       be      used       as      the      Timing        Advance
   Command.              The       base        station            10     allocates            an     identifier
 5 having        a   value         larger        than        that      of    FIG.        25   to    the     mobile
   station         20.        Note       that       a    size      of     the      Msg2      increases          more
   than those             of    the      format examples                  of    FIGS.        24    and 25.          In
   addition,           the CIF may be provided on                              the least           significant
   bits     in     FIG.       26,      and     further           the    CIF may be             inserted         into
10 the other positions.
                    According             to    this        mobile        communication               system        of
   the      third         embodiment,              by       transmitting               the      Msg2       to     the
   mobile station 20,                     the base           station 10             gives to the mobile
   station          20      a    use       permission              of      the      component            carriers
15 except          the        component              carrier            in      which         the       Msg2        is
   transmitted.                In     short,        the base           station         10    implements           the
   cross       carrier          scheduling             by      using       the     Msg2.         Accordingly,
   the     base        station          10     and       the      mobile         station         20     need      not
   separately             perform          a   procedure             for     the      use     permission            of
20 the component carrier.
                    The      base         station           10     and      the      mobile         station         20
   further         change         the      component            carrier         in     a   de-active          state
   into      that       in     an     active         state        along       with        transmission            and
   reception of the Msg2.                           Therefore, the base                      station        10    and
25 the      mobile           station           20       need        not      separately              perform          a

   embodiments, and the same matters will not be repeated.                                                    In
   the     fourth         embodiment,              the     cross         carrier        scheduling            is
10 implemented by the Msg2 in the same manner as in the third
   embodiment.               Note         that      the     non-contention                based        random
   access      is      supposed             in   the     third       embodiment,              and     on     the
   other     hand       the      contention          based       random access                is    supposed

                                                -    56
   process         illustrated       in      FIG.        27      includes          the     following
   steps:
                   (Step S311)     The control unit 14                      sets states of the
   CC#1       to     #5    with     regard            to    the        mobile         station         20.
 5 Specifically,           the   control          unit      14      identifies           the     above
   described "Configured but Deactivated CC",                                    "Configured and
   Activated CC", and "PDCCH monitoring set".
                   (Step     S312)      The         radio        communication              unit       11
   receives        the random access              preamble          (Msgl)       from the mobile
10 station       20    by  using    the     component            carrier        included        in    the
   "PDCCH       monitoring set".           A signal sequence                   used in       the Msgl
   is    randomly selected by the mobile station 20.
                   (Step S313)     The control unit 14 determines whether
   to     implement       the   cross       carrier          scheduling.              If    not,      the
15 process advances to step S314.                         If so,        the process proceeds
   to step S315.
                   (Step S314)     The RAR control unit 18                         sets the        Obll
   as the CIF included in the Msg2.                           The process then proceeds
   to step S317.
20                 (Step S315)     From among the CC#1                      to #5,      the control
   unit      14   selects     one    or    a    plurality            of    component         carriers
   in    which      the   data    communication               is     performed,           except      for
   the component carrier in which the Msg2 is                                  transmitted.
                   (Step    S316)   The      RAR       control        unit      18   sets     a    3-bit
25 CIF indicating the             component           carrier selected at step                       S315.
   In     addition,       the   Msg2     is       transmitted             for     each     component
   carrier selected at step S315.

                                                      -   57
                     (Step        S317)          The     radio         communication               unit       11
   transmits           the     Msg2       including          the     CIF      set     at   step      S314     or
   S316       to      the      mobile          station        20     by      using       the      component
   carrier         in    which        the      Msgl   is     received.            In    the    case where
 5 the     plurality            of      the      component         carriers           are    selected         at
   step      S315,         the      radio         communication             unit       11    transmits          a
   plurality of the Msg2 sets.
                     (Step        S318)          The     radio         communication               unit       11
   receives          the     Msg3       from the mobile                station 20          by using the
