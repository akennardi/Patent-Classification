          SWEET CORN HYBRID 11-6R-SHY-1514 AND PARENTS THEREOF
                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
        [0001] The present invention relates to the field of plant breeding and, more specifically,
to the development of sweet corn hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and the inbred sweet corn lines SHY
6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
        [0002] The goal of vegetable breeding is to combine various desirable traits in a single
variety/hybrid. Such desirable traits may include any trait deemed beneficial by a grower and/or
consumer, including greater yield, better stalks, better roots, resistance to insecticides,
herbicides, pests, and disease, tolerance to heat and drought, reduced time to crop maturity,
better agronomic quality, higher nutritional value, sugar content, uniformity in germination
times, stand establishment, growth rate and maturity, among others.
        [0003] Breeding techniques take advantage of a plant's method of pollination. There are
two general methods of pollination: a plant self-pollinates if pollen from one flower is transferred
to the same or another flower of the same plant or plant variety.        A plant cross-pollinates if
pollen comes to it from a flower of a different plant variety.
        [0004] Plants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type over many generations
become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding
progeny, a homozygous plant.       A cross between two such homozygous plants of different
genotypes produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that are heterozygous for many gene
loci.  Conversely, a cross of two plants each heterozygous at a number of loci produces a
population of hybrid plants that differ genetically and are not uniform.        The resulting non
uniformity makes performance unpredictable.
        [0005] The development of uniform varieties requires the development of homozygous
inbred plants, the crossing of these inbred plants, and the evaluation of the crosses. Pedigree
breeding and recurrent selection are examples of breeding methods that have been used to
develop inbred plants from breeding populations. Those breeding methods combine the genetic
backgrounds from two or more plants or various other broad-based sources into breeding pools
from which new lines and hybrids derived therefrom are developed by selfing and selection of
                                                -1 -

desired phenotypes. The new lines and hybrids are evaluated to determine which of those have
commercial potential.
                                   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
         [0006] In one aspect, the present invention provides a plant of the sweet corn hybrid
designated 11-6R-SHY-1514, the sweet corn line SHY-6RLAL201 or sweet corn line SHY
6RKCT030.       Also provided are corn plants having all the physiological and morphological
characteristics of such a plant.      Parts of these corn plants are also provided, for example,
including pollen, an ovule, and a cell of the plant.
         [0007] In another aspect of the invention, a plant of sweet corn hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514
and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030 comprising an added heritable
trait is provided.   The heritable trait may comprise a genetic locus that is, for example, a
dominant or recessive allele. In one embodiment of the invention, a plant of sweet corn hybrid
11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030 is defined as
comprising a single locus conversion.        In specific embodiments of the invention, an added
genetic locus confers one or more traits such as, for example, male sterility, herbicide resistance,
insect resistance, resistance to bacterial, fungal, sugar content, nematode or viral disease, and
altered fatty acid, phytate or carbohydrate metabolism. In further embodiments, the trait may be
conferred by a naturally occurring gene introduced into the genome of a line by backcrossing, a
natural or induced mutation, or a transgene introduced through genetic transformation techniques
into the plant or a progenitor of any previous generation thereof. When introduced through
transformation, a genetic locus may comprise one or more genes integrated at a single
chromosomal location.
         [0008] The invention also concerns the seed of sweet corn hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514
and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030. The corn seed of the invention
may be provided, in one embodiment of the invention, as an essentially homogeneous population
of corn seed of sweet corn hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201
and SHY-6RKCT030.          Essentially homogeneous populations of seed are generally free from
substantial numbers of other seed.      Therefore, seed of hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet
corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030 may, in particular embodiments of the
invention, be provided forming at least about 97% of the total seed, including at least about 98%,
99% or more of the seed. The seed population may be separately grown to provide an essentially
                                                -- 2--

homogeneous population of sweet corn plants designated 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn
lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030.
         [0009] In yet another aspect of the invention, a tissue culture of regenerable cells of a
sweet corn plant of hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY
6RKCT030 is provided. The tissue culture will preferably be capable of regenerating corn plants
capable of expressing all of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the starting
plant, and of regenerating plants having substantially the same genotype as the starting plant.
Examples of some of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the hybrid 11-6R
SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030 include those traits
set forth in the tables herein. The regenerable cells in such tissue cultures may be derived, for
example, from embryos, meristematic cells, immature tassels, microspores, pollen, leaves,
anthers, roots, root tips, silk, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, or stalks, or from callus or
protoplasts derived from those tissues. Still further, the present invention provides corn plants
regenerated from a tissue culture of the invention, the plants having all the physiological and
morphological characteristics of hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY
6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030.
         [0010] In still yet another aspect of the invention, processes are provided for producing
corn seeds, plants and parts thereof, which processes generally comprise crossing a first parent
corn plant with a second parent corn plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent corn
plants is a plant of sweet corn line SHY-6RLAL201 or sweet corn line SHY-6RKCT030. These
processes may be further exemplified as processes for preparing hybrid corn seed or plants,
wherein a first corn plant is crossed with a second corn plant of a different, distinct genotype to
provide a hybrid that has, as one of its parents, a plant of sweet corn line SHY-6RLAL201 or
sweet corn line SHY-6RKCT030. In these processes, crossing will result in the production of
seed. The seed production occurs regardless of whether the seed is collected or not.
         [0011] In one embodiment of the invention, the first step in "crossing" comprises
planting seeds of a first and second parent corn plant, often in proximity so that pollination will
occur for example, naturally or manually.       Where the plant is self-pollinated, pollination may
occur without the need for direct human intervention other than plant cultivation.        For hybrid
crosses, it may be beneficial to detassel or otherwise emasculate the parent used as a female.
                                                -- 3--

         [0012] A second step may comprise cultivating or growing the seeds of first and second
parent corn plants into mature plants. A third step may comprise preventing self-pollination of
the plants, such as by detasseling or other means.
         [0013] A fourth step for a hybrid cross may comprise cross-pollination between the first
and second parent corn plants. Yet another step comprises harvesting the seeds from at least one
of the parent corn plants. The harvested seed can be grown to produce a corn plant or hybrid
corn plant.
         [0014] The present invention also provides the corn seeds and plants produced by a
process that comprises crossing a first parent corn plant with a second parent corn plant, wherein
at least one of the first or second parent corn plants is a plant of sweet corn hybrid 11-6R-SHY
1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030. In one embodiment of the
invention, corn seed and plants produced by the process are first generation (F1 ) hybrid corn seed
and plants produced by crossing a plant in accordance with the invention with another, distinct
plant. The present invention further contemplates plant parts of such an F1 hybrid corn plant, and
methods of use thereof. Therefore, certain exemplary embodiments of the invention provide an
F1 hybrid corn plant and seed thereof.
         [0015] In still yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of producing a
plant derived from hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY
6RKCT030, the method comprising the steps of: (a) preparing a progeny plant derived from
hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201                   and SHY-6RKCT030,
wherein said preparing comprises crossing a plant of the hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet
corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030 with a second plant;                  and (b) crossing the
progeny plant with itself or a second plant to produce a seed of a progeny plant of a subsequent
generation.    In further embodiments, the method may additionally comprise: (c) growing a
progeny plant of a subsequent generation from said seed of a progeny plant of a subsequent
generation and crossing the progeny plant of a subsequent generation with itself or a second
plant; and repeating the steps for an additional 3-10 generations to produce a plant derived from
hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030.                    The
plant derived from hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY
6RKCT030 may be an inbred line, and the aforementioned repeated crossing steps may be
defined as comprising sufficient inbreeding to produce the inbred line. In the method, it may be
                                                 -- 4--

desirable to select particular plants resulting from step (c) for continued crossing according to
steps (b) and (c). By selecting plants having one or more desirable traits, a plant derived from
hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030 is
obtained which possesses some of the desirable traits of the line/hybrid as well as potentially
other selected traits.
        [0016] In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method of producing
food or feed comprising: (a) obtaining a plant of sweet corn hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or
sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030, wherein the plant has been cultivated to
maturity, and (b) collecting at least one corn from the plant.
        [0017] In still yet another aspect of the invention, the genetic complement of sweet corn
hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030 is
provided.   The phrase "genetic complement" is used to refer to the aggregate of nucleotide
sequences, the expression of which sequences defines the phenotype of, in the present case, a
sweet corn plant, or a cell or tissue of that plant. A genetic complement thus represents the
genetic makeup of a cell, tissue or plant, and a hybrid genetic complement represents the genetic
make up of a hybrid cell, tissue or plant. The invention thus provides corn plant cells that have a
genetic complement in accordance with the corn plant cells disclosed herein, and seeds and
plants containing such cells.
        [0018] Plant genetic complements may be assessed by genetic marker profiles, and by
the expression of phenotypic traits that are characteristic of the expression of the genetic
complement, e.g., isozyme typing profiles. It is understood that hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or
sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030 could be identified by any of the many
well known techniques such as, for example, Simple Sequence Length Polymorphisms (SSLPs)
(Williams et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1 8:6531-6535, 1990), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic
DNAs (RAPDs), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified
Regions   (SCARs),     Arbitrary Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR),              Amplified
Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) (EP 534 858, specifically incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety), and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) (Wang et al., Science,
280:1077-1082, 1998).
        [0019] In still yet another aspect, the present invention provides hybrid genetic
complements, as represented by corn plant cells, tissues, plants, and seeds, formed by the
                                               -- 5--

combination of a haploid genetic complement of a corn plant of the invention with a haploid
genetic complement of a second corn plant, preferably, another, distinct corn plant. In another
aspect, the present invention provides a corn plant regenerated from a tissue culture that
comprises a hybrid genetic complement of this invention.
        [0020] In still yet another aspect, the invention provides a method of determining the
genotype of a plant of sweet corn hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY
6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030 comprising detecting in the genome of the plant at least a first
polymorphism.     The method may, in certain embodiments, comprise detecting a plurality of
polymorphisms in the genome of the plant. The method may further comprise storing the results
of the step of detecting the plurality of polymorphisms on a computer readable medium. The
invention further provides a computer readable medium produced by such a method.
        [0021] Any embodiment discussed herein with respect to one aspect of the invention
applies to other aspects of the invention as well, unless specifically noted.
        [0022] The term "about" is used to indicate that a value includes the standard deviation
of the mean for the device or method being employed to determine the value. The use of the
term "or" in the claims is used to mean "and/or" unless explicitly indicated to refer to
alternatives only or the alternatives are mutually exclusive. When used in conjunction with the
word "comprising" or other open language in the claims, the words "a" and "an" denote "one or
more," unless specifically noted otherwise. The terms "comprise," "have" and "include" are
open-ended linking verbs.       Any forms or tenses of one or more of these verbs, such as
"comprises," "comprising," "has," "having," "includes" and "including," are also open-ended.
For example, any method that "comprises," "has" or "includes" one or more steps is not limited
to possessing only those one or more steps and also covers other unlisted steps. Similarly, any
plant that "comprises," "has" or "includes" one or more traits is not limited to possessing only
those one or more traits and covers other unlisted traits.
        [0023] Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become
apparent from the following detailed description.      It should be understood, however, that the
detailed description and any specific examples provided, while indicating specific embodiments
of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications
within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from

                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
        [0024] The invention provides methods and compositions relating to plants, seeds and
derivatives of sweet corn hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514, sweet corn line SHY-6RLAL201 and sweet
corn line SHY-6RKCT030. The hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 was produced by the cross of parent
lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030.             The parent lines show uniformity and stability
within the limits of environmental influence. By crossing the parent lines, uniform seed hybrid
11-6R-SHY-1514 can be obtained.
        [0025] Hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514, also known as SV1514SK, is a yellow sh2 sweet corn.
The hybrid has the RpG59 compound gene which provides resistance to some races of Puccinia
sorghi (common rust) (Hu, G. and S. H. Hulbert. 1996. Construction of 'compound' rust genes in
maize. Euphytica 87: 45-51).     Hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 has resistance to Sugarcane Mosaic
Virus and Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus.
        [0026] Inbred line SHY-6RKCT030 is a yellow sweet corn homozygous for the recessive
gene sh2. SHY-6RKCT030 has the RpG59 compound gene which provides resistance to some
races of Puccinia sorghi (common rust) (Hu, G. and S. H. Hulbert. 1996. Construction of
'compound' rust genes in maize. Euphytica 87: 45-51).       It also has resistance to Sugarcane
Mosaic Virus (SCMV) and Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus (MDMV). SHY-6RKCT030 resembles
inbred line SHY084-5023.
        [0027] SHY-6RLAL201 is a yellow sweet corn homozygous for the recessive gene sh2.
Line SHY-6RLAL201 has the RpG gene which provides resistance to some races of Puccinia
sorghi   (common rust). SHY-6RLAL201 resembles inbred lines SYY093-678, SYY093-7001,
and SYY-6R07003.

summarized below.
        A.     Origin and Breeding History of Sweet Corn Hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514
        [0029] . The hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 was produced by the cross of parent lines SHY
6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030.
        [0030] SHY-6RLAL201 is a yellow sweet corn inbred which is homozygous for the
recessive sh2 gene.   The line also has the RpG gene which provides resistance to some races of
Puccinia sorghi.
        [0031]   SHY-6RLAL201 was produced by breeding and selection as described below:

PARENT LINE 1:
Winter, Year 1 - Year 2:     The inbred line CODE6- 5 (a proprietary Seminis inbred)
   was grown in a Hawaii nursery on Molokai and was crossed onto a stock carrying the
   RpG allele.    This stock was obtained from Dr. Jerald Pataky of the University of
   Illinois.  It was coded Seminis accession B142 and was an R168 field corn inbred
   converted to carry the RpG allele.     This allele was reported by Dr. Art Hooker to
   have come from PI 163558. CODE6- 5 was grown in Hawaii nursery row 9790 and
   B 142 was grown in nursery row 9764. The nursery was grown by Hawaiian Research
   Ltd. under a contract with Seminis.      An ear harvested of this F1 cross was given a
   source of HOG: 9790 X 9764/2.
Summer, Year 2:              Seeds of the F1 with source HOG: 9790 X 9764/2 were
   planted in the Seminis DeForest, WI nursery row 4188 and were crossed with inbred
   line CODE6- 5 (a proprietary Seminis inbred) grown in row 4187.      This made a BC1
   generation.   An ear harvested of this BC1 cross was given the source of NO0: 4188 X
   4187/1.
Winter, Year 2 - Year 3:      Seeds of the BC1 with source NO0: 4188 X 4187/1 were
   planted in the Seminis Melipilla, Chile nursery row 7584 and were crossed with
   inbred line CODE6- 5 (a proprietary Seminis inbred) grown in row 7583. This made a
   BC2 generation.    An ear harvested of this BC1 cross was given the source of E01:
   7584 X 7583/1.
Winter, Year 3 - Year 4:      Seeds of the BC2 with source E01: 7584 X 7583/1 were
   planted in Homestead, Florida nursery row 513 and was cross pollinated by SYY093
   678 (a proprietary Seminis inbred) in nursery row 512 to make an Fl. The nursery
   was grown for Seminis by 27 Farms who were paid for their services. One of the ears
   of the F1 cross was given a source of C02: 513 X 512/2.
Summer, Year 4:              Seeds of the F1 with source C02:        513 x    512/2 were
   planted in Seminis DeForest, WI nursery row 5219 and cross pollinated by SYY093
   678 (a proprietary Seminis inbred) in nursery row 5218 to make a BC1.       One of the
   ears of the BC1 cross was give a source of N02: 5219 X 5218/1.
Winter, Year 4 - Year 5:      Seeds of the BC1 with source N02: 5219 X 5218/1 were
   planted in the Seminis Melipilla, Chile nursery row 8956 and cross pollinated by
                                      -- 8--

   SYY093-678 (a proprietary Seminis inbred) grown in nursery row 8955 to make a
   BC2. One of the ears of the BC2 cross was give the source of E03: 8956 x 8955/2.
Summer, Year 5:               Seeds of the BC2 with source E03: 8956 x 8955/2 were
   planted in the Seminis DeForest, WI nursery row 5863. Plants were inoculated with
   Puccinia sorghi and some of the resistant plants were cross pollinated by SYY093
   678 (a proprietary Seminis inbred) grown in nursery row 5858 to make a BC3.      One
   of the ears of the BC3 cross was give the source of N03: 5863 X 5858/1.
Winter, Year 5 - Year 6:      Seeds of the BC3 with source N03: 5863 X 5858/1 were
   planted in the Seminis Melipilla, Chile nursery row 5018 and self pollinated to make
   a BC3F2.     One of the harvested BC3F2 ears was given the source of E04: 5018/1.
   and the name designation of N2785.
Summer, Year 6:               Seeds of the BC3F2 with source E04: 5018/1* were planted
   in the Seminis DeForest, WI nursery row 4037. Plants were inoculated with Puccinia
   sorghi and some of the common rust resistant plants were self pollinated to make the
   BC3F3 generation.      N04: 4037/2. was the source designation given to one of the
   selfed ears following harvest.
Winter, Year 7:               Seeds of the BC3F3 with source N04: 4037/2. were planted
   in the Seminis Melipilla, Chile nursery row 8525 and self pollinated to make a
   BC3F4. E05: 8525/1. was the source given to one of the BC3F4 ears.
PARENT LINE 2:
Winter, Year 3 - Year 4:      Inbred N1217NP2 (a proprietary Seminis inbred now
   named SHW084-5006) was grown in the Seminis Melipilla, Chile nursery in row
   5437.    This line was crossed by inbred SYY093-678 grown in row 5427.        The F1
   cross was given a hybrid designation of SVR 08717186. E02: 5437 X 5427 was the
   source designation given to the cross.
Winter, Year 4 - Year 5:      Hybrid SVR08717186 from source E02: 5437 x 5427 was
   grown in the Seminis Melipilla, Chile nursery in row 9212.   This line was crossed by
   inbred SYY093-678 grown in row 9205 grown from source 208796 to make the BC1.

           were grown in the greenhouse and inoculated with a d-virulent isolate of Puccinia
           sorghi. All 30 plants were resistant which verified the presence of the RpG gene in
           this stock and indicates the line is homozygous for this allele.
        [0032] Sweet corn inbred SHY-6RLAL201 was reproduced by self pollination in the
winter Year 11 - Year 12 in Melipilla, Chile nursery and was judged to be stable. 27 single ears
were sent to Foundation Seed as Breeder's Seed. Inbred SHY-6RLAL201 is uniform for all
traits observed.   SHY-6RLAL201 shows no variants other than what would normally be
expected due to environment or that would occur for almost any character during the course of
repeated sexual reproduction.
        [0033] SHY-6RKCT030 is a yellow sweet corn inbred which is homozygous for the
recessive sh2 gene.    The line has resistance to Sugarcane Mosaic Virus (SCMV) and Maize
Dwarf Mosaic Virus (MDMV). SHY-6RKCT030 also has the compound gene RpG59 which
provides resistance to some races of Puccinia sorghi. This "compound gene" was developed by
Dr. Scot Hulbert while he was at Kansas State University and was released to the public (Hu, G.
and S. H. Hulbert. 1996. Construction of 'compound' rust genes in maize. Euphytica 87: 45-5 1).

       C.      Breeding Corn Plants
        [0037] One aspect of the current invention concerns methods for producing seed of sweet
corn hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 involving crossing sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY
6RKCT030.      Alternatively, in other embodiments of the invention, hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514,
line SHY-6RLAL201, or line SHY-6RKCT030 may be crossed with itself or with any second
plant. Such methods can be used for propagation of hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or the sweet
                                              - - 39 - -

corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030, or can be used to produce plants that are
derived from hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or the sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201 and SHY
6RKCT030.       Plants derived from hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or the sweet corn lines SHY
6RLAL201 and SHY-6RKCT030 may be used, in certain embodiments, for the development of
new corn varieties.
         [0038] The development of new varieties using one or more starting varieties is well
known in the art. In accordance with the invention, novel varieties may be created by crossing
hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 followed by multiple generations of breeding according to such well
known methods. New varieties may be created by crossing with any second plant. In selecting
such a second plant to cross for the purpose of developing novel lines, it may be desired to
choose those plants which either themselves             exhibit one or more selected desirable
characteristics or which exhibit the desired characteristic(s) when in hybrid combination. Once
initial crosses have been made, inbreeding and selection take place to produce new varieties. For
development of a uniform line, often five or more generations of selfing and selection are
involved.
         [0039] Uniform lines of new varieties may also be developed by way of double-haploids.
This technique allows the creation of true breeding lines without the need for multiple
generations of selfing and selection. In this manner true breeding lines can be produced in as
little as one generation. Haploid embryos may be produced from microspores, pollen, anther
cultures, or ovary cultures.   The haploid embryos may then be doubled autonomously, or by
chemical treatments (e.g. colchicine treatment). Alternatively, haploid embryos may be grown
into haploid plants and treated to induce chromosome doubling.               In either case, fertile
homozygous plants are obtained. In accordance with the invention, any of such techniques may
be used in connection with a plant of the invention and progeny thereof to achieve a homozygous
line.
         [0040] Backcrossing can also be used to improve an inbred plant. Backcrossing transfers
a specific desirable trait from one inbred or non-inbred source to an inbred that lacks that trait.
This can be accomplished, for example, by first crossing a superior inbred (A) (recurrent parent)
to a donor inbred (non-recurrent parent), which carries the appropriate locus or loci for the trait
in question. The progeny of this cross are then mated back to the superior recurrent parent (A)
followed by selection in the resultant progeny for the desired trait to be transferred from the non
                                             - - 40 - -

recurrent parent. After five or more backcross generations with selection for the desired trait, the
progeny have the characteristic being transferred, but are like the superior parent for most or
almost all other loci.    The last backcross generation would be selfed to give pure breeding
progeny for the trait being transferred.
        [0041] The plants of the present invention are particularly well suited for the
development of new lines based on the elite nature of the genetic background of the plants. In
selecting a second plant to cross with 11-6R-SHY-1514 and/or sweet corn lines SHY-6RLAL201
and SHY-6RKCT030 for the purpose of developing novel corn lines, it will typically be
preferred to choose those plants which either themselves exhibit one or more selected desirable
characteristics or which exhibit the desired characteristic(s) when in hybrid combination.
Examples of desirable traits may include, in specific embodiments, male sterility, herbicide
resistance, resistance for bacterial, fungal, or viral disease, insect resistance, male fertility, sugar
content, and enhanced nutritional quality.
        D.      Performance Characteristics
As described above, hybrid 11-6R-SHY-1514 exhibits desirable agronomic traits.                      The
performance characteristics of hybrid 1 1-6R-SHY- 1514 were the subject of an objective analysis
of the performance traits relative to other varieties.     The results of the analysis are presented

            E.     FurtherEmbodiments of the Invention
            [0042] In certain aspects of the invention, plants described herein are provided
modified to include at least a first desired heritable trait.        Such plants may, in one
embodiment, be developed by a plant breeding technique called backcrossing, wherein
essentially all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of a variety are
recovered in addition to a genetic locus transferred into the plant via the backcrossing
technique. The term single locus converted plant as used herein refers to those corn plants
which are developed by a plant breeding technique called backcrossing, wherein essentially
all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of a variety are recovered in
addition to the single locus transferred into the variety via the backcrossing technique. By
essentially all of the morphological and physiological characteristics, it is meant that the
characteristics of a plant are recovered that are otherwise present when compared in the same
environment, other than an occasional variant trait that might arise during backcrossing or
direct introduction of a transgene.
            [0043] Backcrossing methods can be used with the present invention to improve or
introduce a characteristic into the present variety. The parental corn plant which contributes
the locus for the desired characteristic is termed the nonrecurrent or donor parent.        This
terminology refers to the fact that the nonrecurrent parent is used one time in the backcross
protocol and therefore does not recur. The parental corn plant to which the locus or loci from
the nonrecurrent parent are transferred is known as the recurrent parent as it is used for
several rounds in the backcrossing protocol.
            [0044] In a typical backcross protocol, the original variety of interest (recurrent
parent) is crossed to a second variety (nonrecurrent parent) that carries the single locus of
interest to be transferred. The resulting progeny from this cross are then crossed again to the
recurrent parent and the process is repeated until a corn plant is obtained wherein essentially
all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of the recurrent parent are
recovered in the converted plant, in addition to the single transferred locus from the
nonrecurrent parent.
            [0045] The selection of a suitable recurrent parent is an important step for a
successful backcrossing procedure. The goal of a backcross protocol is to alter or substitute a
single trait or characteristic in the original variety. To accomplish this, a single locus of the
recurrent variety is modified or substituted with the desired locus from the nonrecurrent
parent, while retaining essentially all of the rest of the desired genetic, and therefore the
                                                      43

desired physiological and morphological constitution of the original variety. The choice of
the particular nonrecurrent parent will depend on the purpose of the backcross; one of the
major purposes is to add some commercially desirable trait to the plant.               The exact
backcrossing protocol will depend on the characteristic or trait being altered and the genetic
distance between the recurrent and nonrecurrent parents. Although backcrossing methods are
simplified when the characteristic being transferred is a dominant allele, a recessive allele, or
an additive allele (between recessive and dominant), may also be transferred. In this instance
it may be necessary to introduce a test of the progeny to determine if the desired
characteristic has been successfully transferred.
         [0046] In one embodiment, progeny corn plants of a backcross in which a plant
described herein is the recurrent parent comprise (i) the desired trait from the non-recurrent
parent and (ii) all of the physiological and morphological characteristics of corn the recurrent
parent as determined at the 5% significance level when grown in the same environmental
conditions.
         [0047] New varieties can also be developed from more than two parents.               The
technique, known as modified backcrossing, uses different recurrent parents during the
backcrossing.     Modified backcrossing may be used to replace the original recurrent parent
with a variety having certain more desirable characteristics or multiple parents may be used
to obtain different desirable characteristics from each.
         [0048] With the development of molecular markers associated with particular traits, it
is possible to add additional traits into an established germ line, such as represented here,
with the end result being substantially the same base germplasm with the addition of a new
trait or traits.   Molecular breeding, as described in Moose and Mumm, 2008 (Plant
Physiology,     147:  969-977),    for example, and elsewhere,     provides a mechanism for
integrating single or multiple traits or QTL into an elite line. This molecular breeding
facilitated movement of a trait or traits into an elite line may encompass incorporation of a
particular genomic fragment associated with a particular trait of interest into the elite line by
the mechanism of identification of the integrated genomic fragment with the use of flanking
or associated marker assays. In the embodiment represented here, one, two, three or four
genomic loci, for example, may be integrated into an elite line via this methodology. When
this elite line containing the additional loci is further crossed with another parental elite line
to produce hybrid offspring, it is possible to then incorporate at least eight separate additional
loci into the hybrid. These additional loci may confer, for example, such traits as a disease
resistance or a fruit quality trait. In one embodiment, each locus may confer a separate trait.
                                                 - 44 -

In another embodiment, loci may need to be homozygous and exist in each parent line to
confer a trait in the hybrid. In yet another embodiment, multiple loci may be combined to
confer a single robust phenotype of a desired trait.
        [0049] Many single locus traits have been identified that are not regularly selected for
in the development of a new inbred but that can be improved by backcrossing techniques.
Single locus traits may or may not be transgenic; examples of these traits include, but are not
limited to, male sterility, waxy starch, herbicide resistance, resistance for bacterial, fungal, or
viral disease, insect resistance, sugar content, male fertility and enhanced nutritional quality.
These genes are generally inherited through the nucleus, but may be inherited through the
cytoplasm. Some known exceptions to this are genes for male sterility, some of which are
inherited cytoplasmically, but still act as a single locus trait.
         [0050] Direct selection may be applied where the single locus acts as a dominant trait.
For this selection process, the progeny of the initial cross are assayed for viral resistance
and/or the presence of the corresponding gene prior to the backcrossing. Selection eliminates
any plants that do not have the desired gene and resistance trait, and only those plants that
have the trait are used in the subsequent backcross.        This process is then repeated for all
additional backcross generations.
         [0051] Selection of corn plants for breeding is not necessarily dependent on the
phenotype of a plant and instead can be based on genetic investigations. For example, one
can utilize a suitable genetic marker which is closely genetically linked to a trait of interest.
One of these markers can be used to identify the presence or absence of a trait in the offspring
of a particular cross, and can be used in selection of progeny for continued breeding. This
technique is commonly referred to as marker assisted selection. Any other type of genetic
marker or other assay which is able to identify the relative presence or absence of a trait of
interest in a plant can also be useful for breeding purposes. Procedures for marker assisted
selection are well known in the art. Such methods will be of particular utility in the case of
recessive traits and variable phenotypes, or where conventional assays may be more
expensive, time consuming or otherwise disadvantageous. Types of genetic markers which
could be used in accordance with the invention include, but are not necessarily limited to,
Simple Sequence Length Polymorphisms (SSLPs) (Williams et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1
8:6531-6535,      1990),    Randomly     Amplified      Polymorphic   DNAs     (RAPDs),      DNA
Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs),
Arbitrary Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), Amplified Fragment Length
Polymorphisms (AFLPs) (EP 534 858, specifically incorporated herein by reference in its
                                                  - 45 -

1082, 1998).
         F.     Plants Derived by Genetic Engineering
         [0052] Many useful traits that can be introduced by backcrossing, as well as directly
into a plant, are those which are introduced by genetic transformation techniques. Genetic
transformation may therefore be used to insert a selected transgene into a plant of the
invention or may, alternatively, be used for the preparation of transgenes which can be
introduced by backcrossing. Methods for the transformation of plants that are well known to
those of skill in the art and applicable to many crop species include, but are not limited to,
electroporation, microprojectile bombardment, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and
direct DNA uptake by protoplasts.
         [0053] To effect transformation by electroporation, one may employ either friable
tissues, such as a suspension culture of cells or embryogenic callus or alternatively one may
transform immature embryos or other organized tissue directly. In this technique, one would
partially degrade the cell walls of the chosen cells by exposing them to pectin-degrading
enzymes (pectolyases) or mechanically wound tissues in a controlled manner.
         [0054] An efficient method for delivering transforming DNA segments to plant cells
is microprojectile bombardment. In this method, particles are coated with nucleic acids and
delivered into cells by a propelling force. Exemplary particles include those comprised of
tungsten, platinum, and preferably, gold.      For the bombardment, cells in suspension are
concentrated on filters or solid culture medium. Alternatively, immature embryos or other
target cells may be arranged on solid culture medium.         The cells to be bombarded are
positioned at an appropriate distance below the macroprojectile stopping plate.
         [0055] An illustrative embodiment of a method for delivering DNA into plant cells by
acceleration is the Biolistics Particle Delivery System, which can be used to propel particles
coated with DNA or cells through a screen, such as a stainless steel or Nytex screen, onto a
surface covered with target cells.     The screen disperses the particles so that they are not
delivered to the recipient cells in large aggregates. Microprojectile bombardment techniques
are widely applicable, and may be used to transform virtually any plant species.
         [0056] Agrobacterium-mediated transfer is another widely applicable system for
introducing gene loci into plant cells. An advantage of the technique is that DNA can be
introduced into whole plant tissues, thereby bypassing the need for regeneration of an intact
plant from a protoplast.      Modern Agrobacterium transformation vectors are capable of
                                                - 46 -

replication in E. coli as well as Agrobacterium, allowing for convenient manipulations (Klee
et al., Bio-Technology, 3(7):637-642, 1985).      Moreover, recent technological advances in
vectors for Agrobacterium-mediatedgene transfer have improved the arrangement of genes
and restriction sites in the vectors to facilitate the construction of vectors capable of
expressing various polypeptide coding genes. The vectors described have convenient multi
linker regions flanked by a promoter and a polyadenylation site for direct expression of
inserted polypeptide coding genes. Additionally, Agrobacterium containing both armed and
disarmed Ti genes can be used for transformation.
         [0057] In those plant strains where Agrobacterium-mediated transformation             is
efficient, it is the method of choice because of the facile and defined nature of the gene locus
transfer. The use of Agrobacterium-mediatedplant integrating vectors to introduce DNA into
plant cells is well known in the art (Fraley et al., BiolTechnology, 3:629-635, 1985; U.S.
Patent No. 5,563,055).
         [0058] Transformation of plant protoplasts also can be achieved using methods based
on calcium phosphate precipitation, polyethylene glycol treatment, electroporation, and
combinations of these treatments (see, e.g., Potrykus et al., Mol. Gen. Genet., 199:183-188,
1985; Omirulleh et al., Plant Mol. Biol., 21(3):415-428, 1993; Fromm et al., Nature,
312:791-793, 1986; Uchimiya et al., Mol. Gen. Genet., 204:204, 1986; Marcotte et al.,
Nature, 335:454, 1988). Transformation of plants and expression of foreign genetic elements
is exemplified in Choi et al. (Plant Cell Rep., 13: 344-348, 1994), and Ellul et al. (Theor.
Apple. Genet., 107:462-469, 2003).
         [0059] A number of promoters have utility for plant gene expression for any gene of
interest including but not limited to selectable markers, scoreable markers, genes for pest
tolerance, disease resistance, nutritional enhancements and any other gene of agronomic
interest. Examples of constitutive promoters useful for plant gene expression include, but are
not limited to, the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) P-35S promoter, which confers
constitutive, high-level expression in most plant tissues (see, e.g., Odel et al., Nature,
313:810, 1985), including in monocots (see, e.g., Dekeyser et al., Plant Cell, 2:591, 1990;
Terada and Shimamoto, Mol. Gen. Genet., 220:389, 1990); a tandemly duplicated version of
the CaMV 35S promoter, the enhanced 35S promoter (P-e35S);l the nopaline synthase
promoter (An et al., Plant Physiol., 88:547, 1988); the octopine synthase promoter (Fromm et
al., Plant Cell, 1:977, 1989); and the figwort mosaic virus (P-FMV) promoter as described in
U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,619 and an enhanced version of the FMV promoter (P-eFMV) where the
promoter sequence of P-FMV is duplicated in tandem; the cauliflower mosaic virus 19S
                                               - 47  -

promoter; a sugarcane bacilliform virus promoter; a commelina yellow mottle virus
promoter; and other plant DNA virus promoters known to express in plant cells.
        [0060] A variety of plant gene promoters that are regulated in response to
environmental, hormonal, chemical, and/or developmental signals can also be used for
expression of an operably linked gene in plant cells, including promoters regulated by (1)
heat (Callis et al., Plant Physiol., 88:965, 1988), (2) light (e.g., pea rbcS-3A promoter,
Kuhlemeier et al., Plant Cell, 1:471, 1989; maize rbcS promoter, Schaffner and Sheen, Plant
Cell, 3:997, 1991; or chlorophyll a/b-binding protein promoter, Simpson et al., EMBO J.,
4:2723, 1985), (3) hormones, such as abscisic acid (Marcotte et al., Plant Cell, 1:969, 1989),
(4) wounding (e.g., wunl, Siebertz et al., Plant Cell, 1:961, 1989); or (5) chemicals such as
methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, or Safener. It may also be advantageous to employ organ
specific promoters (e.g., Roshal et al., EMBO J., 6:1155, 1987; Schernthaner et al., EMBO J.,
7:1249, 1988; Bustos et al., Plant Cell, 1:839, 1989).
        [0061] Exemplary nucleic acids which may be introduced to plants of this invention
include, for example, DNA sequences or genes from another species, or even genes or
sequences which originate with or are present in the same species, but are incorporated into
recipient cells by genetic engineering methods rather than classical reproduction or breeding
techniques. However, the term "exogenous" is also intended to refer to genes that are not
normally present in the cell being transformed, or perhaps simply not present in the form,
structure, etc., as found in the transforming DNA segment or gene, or genes which are
normally present and that one desires to express in a manner that differs from the natural
expression pattern, e.g., to over-express.     Thus, the term "exogenous" gene or DNA is
intended to refer to any gene or DNA segment that is introduced into a recipient cell,
regardless of whether a similar gene may already be present in such a cell. The type of DNA
included in the exogenous DNA can include DNA which is already present in the plant cell,
DNA from another plant, DNA from a different organism, or a DNA generated externally,
such as a DNA sequence containing an antisense message of a gene, or a DNA sequence
encoding a synthetic or modified version of a gene.
        [0062] Many hundreds if not thousands of different genes are known and could
potentially be introduced into a corn plant according to the invention. Non-limiting examples
of particular genes and corresponding phenotypes one may choose to introduce into a corn
plant include one or more genes for insect tolerance, such as a Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.)
gene, pest tolerance such as genes for fungal disease control, herbicide tolerance such as
genes conferring glyphosate tolerance, and genes for quality improvements such as yield,
                                                - 48 -

nutritional enhancements, environmental or stress tolerances, or any desirable changes in
plant physiology, growth, development, morphology or plant product(s).              For example,
structural genes would include any gene that confers insect tolerance including but not
limited to a Bacillus insect control protein gene as described in WO 99/31248, herein
incorporated by reference in its entirety, U.S. Pat. No. 5,689,052, herein incorporated by
reference in its entirety, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,500,365 and 5,880,275, herein incorporated by
reference in their entirety. In another embodiment, the structural gene can confer tolerance to
the herbicide glyphosate as conferred by genes including, but not limited to Agrobacterium
strain CP4 glyphosate resistant EPSPS gene (aroA:CP4) as described in U.S. Pat. No.
5,633,435, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, or glyphosate oxidoreductase gene
(GOX) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,463,175, herein incorporated by reference in its
entirety.
         [0063] Alternatively, the DNA coding sequences can affect these phenotypes by
encoding a non-translatable RNA molecule that causes the targeted inhibition of expression
of an endogenous gene, for example via antisense- or cosuppression-mediated mechanisms
(see, for example, Bird et al., Biotech. Gen. Engin. Rev., 9:207, 1991). The RNA could also
be a catalytic RNA molecule (i.e., a ribozyme) engineered to cleave a desired endogenous
mRNA product (see for example, Gibson and Shillito, Mol. Biotech., 7:125,1997). Thus, any
gene which produces a protein or mRNA which expresses a phenotype or morphology
change of interest is useful for the practice of the present invention.
         G.      Definitions
         [0064] In the description and tables herein, a number of terms are used. In order to
provide a clear and consistent understanding of the specification and claims, the following
definitions are provided:
         [0065] Allele:   Any of one or more alternative forms of a gene locus, all of which
alleles relate to one trait or characteristic. In a diploid cell or organism, the two alleles of a
given gene occupy corresponding loci on a pair of homologous chromosomes.
         [0066] Backcrossing:      A process in which a breeder repeatedly crosses hybrid
progeny, for example a first generation hybrid (F1 ), back to one of the parents of the hybrid
progeny. Backcrossing can be used to introduce one or more single locus conversions from
one genetic background into another.
         [0067] Crossing: The mating of two parent plants.
                                                  - 49 -

in a diploid.
          [0075] Linkage: A phenomenon wherein alleles on the same chromosome tend to
segregate together more often than expected by chance if their transmission was independent.
         [0076] Marker: A readily detectable phenotype, preferably inherited in codominant
fashion (both alleles at a locus in a diploid heterozygote are readily detectable), with no
environmental variance component, i.e., heritability of 1.
          [0077] Phenotype:     The detectable characteristics of a cell or organism, which
characteristics are the manifestation of gene expression.
          [0078] Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL): Quantitative trait loci (QTL) refer to genetic
loci that control to some degree numerically representable traits that are usually continuously
distributed.
          [0079] Resistance: As used herein, the terms "resistance" and "tolerance" are used
interchangeably to describe plants that show no symptoms to a specified biotic pest,
pathogen, abiotic influence or environmental condition.         These terms are also used to
describe plants showing some symptoms but that are still able to produce marketable product
with an acceptable yield. Some plants that are referred to as resistant or tolerant are only so
in the sense that they may still produce a crop, even though the plants are stunted and the
yield is reduced.

a plant breeding technique called backcrossing, wherein essentially all of the morphological
                                                 -50-

and physiological characteristics of a corn variety are recovered in addition to the
characteristics of the single locus transferred into the variety via the backcrossing technique
and/or by genetic transformation.
         [0083] Substantially Equivalent:       A characteristic that, when compared, does not
show a statistically significant difference (e.g., p = 0.05) from the mean.
         [0084] Tissue Culture:      A composition comprising isolated cells of the same or a
different type or a collection of such cells organized into parts of a plant.
         [0085] Transgene:       A genetic locus comprising a sequence which has been
introduced into the genome of a corn plant by transformation.
