A POLYMER WALKWAY ACCESSORY
Field
[0001] The present invention relates to a polymer walkway accessory configured to removably
engage to at least one polymer board that partially defines a walkway. In particular, a polymer
walkway accessory configured to reduce static electricity built up on a user walking on the
walkway.
Background
[0002] It is becoming common to erect scaffolding walkways using polymer boards in place of
the more traditional wooden and/or metallic boards. Polymer boards are typically non
conductive and can encourage a large build-up of static electricity on a person walking across
such a walkway. This static electricity is discharged when the person contacts a conductive
component (e.g. the metal frame of the scaffolding). The discharge of static electricity can be
painful for the person. Further, the discharge of static electricity can generate a spark which
may be hazardous in flammable environments.
[0003] One known method for reducing the build-up of static electricity is to coat the polymer
boards in anti-static coatings, sprays, liquids, etc. However, these coatings typically only last
for approximately 12 months, which is much shorter than the expected five year lifespan for the
polymer boards. A disadvantage of this approach is the polymer boards must be recoated
multiple times during their lifespan, thereby increasing their costs. Further, the polymer boards
are out of service whilst being recoated.
[0004] Another known method for reducing the build-up of static electricity is to increase the
conductivity of the polymer boards themselves by impregnating them with conductive materials.
Disadvantages of this approach include that it decreases the impact strength; minimises the
lifespan; and significantly increases the costs of the polymer boards.
[0005] Another known method for reducing the build-up of static electricity is to increase the
conductivity of each person using the walkway. A disadvantage of this approach is it is costly
as each person must be equipped with specialised equipment/apparel, and difficult to manage
every person that uses the walkway.

materials such that the electrical conductivity of the polymer walkway joint is greater than the
electrical conductivity of the first board and the second board, and the polymer walkway joint
creates an electrical pathway by which static electricity built up on a user walking on the
walkway is discharged when the user contacts the polymer walkway joint.
[0015] In a preferred form, the polymer walkway joint is impregnated with electrically

the polymer walkway joint in place within the walkway.
[0019] In a preferred form, the first channel faces a first direction, the second channel faces a

                                                  4
[0020] In a third aspect, the present invention provides a polymer walkway ramp configured to
removably engage to at least one polymer board that partially defines a walkway, the polymer
walkway ramp being impregnated with electrically conductive materials such that the electrical
conductivity of the polymer walkway ramp is greater than the electrical conductivity of the at
least one polymer board,
         wherein the polymer walkway ramp creates an electrical pathway by which static
electricity built up on a user walking on the walkway is discharged when the user contacts the
polymer walkway ramp.

first lateral end of at least one polymer board that partially defines a walkway, the polymer

least one polymer board,
         wherein the polymer board end cap creates an electrical pathway by which static
electricity built up on a user walking on the walkway is discharged when the user contacts the
polymer board end cap.
[0026] In a preferred form, the polymer board end cap is impregnated with electrically
conductive materials in the range of 10pph resin to 30pph resin, preferably in the range of l5pph
resin to 20pph resin.

                                                      5

plurality of polymer boards, the at least one polymer walkway accessory being impregnated
with electrically conductive materials such that the electrical conductivity of the at least one
polymer walkway accessory is greater than the electrical conductivity of the plurality of polymer
boards,
         wherein the polymer walkway accessory creates an electrical pathway by which static
electricity built up on a user walking on the scaffold platform is discharged when the user
contacts the polymer walkway accessory.
[0029] In a preferred form, one of the at least one polymer walkway accessory is impregnated

[0032] In a preferred form, one of the at least polymer walkway accessory is a polymer
walkway joint, the polymer walkway joint comprising:
         a first channel facing in a first direction, the first channel configured to receive a portion
of a first polymer board of the plurality of polymer boards therein; and
         a second channel facing in a second direction, the second direction configured to receive
a portion of a second polymer board of the plurality of polymer boards therein, the second
polymer board being adjacent the first polymer board, and the second direction being opposite
the first direction
[0033] In a preferred form, the first channel comprises a flange having at least one aperture
therethrough configured to fix the polymer walkway joint in place within the walkway; and

                                                  6
[0034] In a preferred form, the second channel comprises a flange having at least one aperture

[0035] In a preferred form, one of the at least one polymer walkway accessory is a polymer
walkway ramp.

Description of Embodiments
[0048] Figure 7 shows an example of a polymer board 10 that is used to form a walkway, and
which is suitable for use with the polymer walkway accessories described hereinafter. The
polymer board 10 has a top surface 12, a bottom surface 14, a pair of longitudinal edges 16, and
a pair of lateral edges 18. The polymer board 10 is substantially hollow aside from a plurality of
hexagonal conduits 20, triangular conduits 22, and two trapezoidal conduits 24 extending
therethrough (only of each are labelled for clarity of illustration). The plurality of hexagonal
conduits 20, triangular conduits 22, and trapezoidal conduits 24 define a lateral edge profile 26
at each lateral edge 18. The polymer board 10 is produced by extrusion from polyvinyl chloride
(PVC), preferably PVC type k62 or k66. It will be appreciated that the PVC may include
additives in order to improve certain characteristics of the polymer board 10.
[0049] The embodiments disclosed hereinafter are described in relation to use in a walkway that
is least partially defined by one or more of the polymer boards 10. It will be appreciated that
other types of polymer boards may be used in conjunction with the polymer walkway
accessories described hereinafter.
[0050] Figure 1 shows a polymer walkway accessory according to a first embodiment in the
form of a polymer walkway joint 100. The polymer walkway joint 100 has a top portion 102, a
bottom portion 104, and a middle portion 106. The middle portion 106 is connected to and
extends between the top portion 102 and the bottom portion 104.
[0051] Referring to Figure 2, the top portion 102 comprises a first flange 102a and a second
flange 102b, and the bottom portion 104 comprises a first flange 104a and a second flange 104b.
The first flange 102a, middle portion 106 and first flange 104a together define a first profile in

                                                   8
the form of a first channel 108 facing a first direction. The second flange 102b, middle portion
106 and second flange 104b together define a second profile in the form of a second channel 110
facing a second direction. It will be appreciated that the first direction is opposite the second
direction. Each of the first channel 108 and the second channel 110 are dimensioned to
removably engage an edge of one or more polymer boards 10.
[0052] Referring to Figure 1, the first flange 104a has a first plurality of apertures 112
therethrough, and the second flange 104b has a second plurality of apertures 114 therethrough.
Each of the first plurality of apertures 112 and each of the second plurality of apertures 114 are
configured to allow a fastener (e.g. steel wire, cable ties, rope, bolts, screws, etc.) to pass
therethrough in order to allow the polymer walkway joint 100 to be fixed in place within the
walkway.
[0053] The polymer walkway joint 100 is manufactured from PVC impregnated with
electrically conductive materials such as carbon black, graphene or a combination thereof in the
range of 10pph resin to 30pph resin, preferably in the range of l5pph resin to 20pph resin. This
preferred range of 10pph resin to 30pph resin is particularly suitable for the use of carbon black
as the electrically conductive materials. Other electrically conductive materials with different
levels of conductivity are also conceivable, however. In the case of electrically conductive
materials with a higher conductivity than carbon black, such as graphene, it will be appreciated
that such materials may be used in lower proportions. This preferred range of 10pph resin to
30pph resin is also dependent on where the walkway is to be located and the intended purpose of
the walkway (e.g. residential, commercial, industrial, etc.). The polymer walkway joint 100
may be made by extrusion or injection moulding or any other method known in the art. Due to
the impregnated electrically conductive materials, the electrical conductivity of the polymer
walkway joint 100 is greater than the electrical conductivity of the polymer boards 10.
[0054] Use of the polymer walkway joint 100 will now be discussed. Fasteners are passed
through each of the first plurality of apertures 112 and the second plurality of apertures 114 such
that each of the fasteners engage the walkway structure (e.g. the frame of the scaffold), thereby
securing the polymer walkway joint 100 in place within the walkway. Subsequently, a lateral
edge 18 of a polymer board 10 is removably disposed within the first channel 108, and a lateral
edge 18 of another polymer board 10 is removably disposed within the second channel 110. The
polymer walkway joint 100 will therefore be removably disposed between, and removably

                                                  9
engage, the lateral edges 18 of two longitudinally adjacent polymer boards 10 within the
walkway. It is also envisaged that the first channel 108 and the second channel 110 may be
dimensioned to removably receive and engage a lateral edge 18 of two or more laterally
adjacent polymer boards 10 within the walkway.
[0055] Alternatively, a longitudinal edge 16 of a polymer board 10 is removably disposed
within the first channel 108, and a longitudinal edge 16 of another polymer board 10 is
removably disposed within the second channel 110. The polymer walkway joint 100 will
therefore be removably disposed between, and engage, the longitudinal edges 16 of two laterally
adjacent polymer boards 10 within the walkway. It is also envisaged that the first channel 108
and the second channel 110 may be dimensioned to removably receive a longitudinal edge 16 of
two or more longitudinally adjacent polymer boards 10 within the walkway.
[0056] As polymer boards 10 are removably disposed within either of the first channel 108 or
the second channel 110, the top portion 102 of the polymer walkway joint 100 will be disposed
above the top surface 12 of the polymer boards 10, and the bottom portion 104 of the polymer
walkway joint 100 will be disposed below the bottom surface 14 of the polymer boards 10. The
top portion 102 of each polymer walkway joint 100 within the walkway will therefore form part
of the walking surface of the walkway.
[0057] It is envisaged that the walkway may comprise a plurality of polymer walkway joints
100 disposed between the lateral edges 18 of longitudinally adjacent polymer boards 10 within
the walkway and/or between the longitudinal edges 16 of laterally adjacent polymer boards 10
within the walkway.
[0058] Figure 3 shows a polymer walkway accessory according to a second embodiment in the
form of a polymer board end cap 200. The polymer board end cap 200 has a front face 216 and
a rear profile 218. The front face 216 has a depression 217 in which advertising material,
branding, safety information, warnings, etc. may be inserted.
[0059] Referring to Figure 4, the rear profile 218 is defined by a plurality of top projections 220,
a plurality of bottom projections 222, two end projections 224, and a central projection 226.
Referring to Figure 5, it can be seen that each of the plurality of top projections 220 taper in a
direction extending away from the front face 216. It will also be appreciated that each of the
plurality of bottom projections 222 taper in a direction extending away from the front face 216.

                                                 10
[0060]    The polymer board end cap 200 is manufactured using the same materials and similar
methods used to manufacture the polymer walkway joint 100 (see paragraph [0052]). However,
it will be appreciated that the polymer board end cap 200 cannot be extruded. Accordingly, the
electrical conductivity of the polymer board end cap 200 is greater than the electrical
conductivity of the polymer boards 10.
[0061] Use of the polymer board end cap 200 will now be discussed. The rear profile 218 of the
polymer board end cap 200 is complimentary to the lateral edge profile 26 of the polymer board
10. The rear profile 218 of the polymer board end cap 200 is removably inserted into one of the
lateral edges 18 of the polymer board 10 such that each of the plurality of top projections 220
are received within a respective one of the hexagonal conduits 20 of the polymer board 10; each
of the plurality of bottom projections 222 are received within a respective one of the hexagonal
conduits 20 of the polymer board 10; each of the end projections 224 are received within a
respective one of the trapezoidal conduits 24; and the central projection 226 is received within a
respective one of the hexagonal conduits 20. Once the rear profile 218 of the polymer board end
cap 200 has been removably inserted into the lateral edge 18 of a polymer board 10, the polymer
board end cap 200 substantially seals the lateral edge 18 thereby restricting dust, debris, liquids,
etc. entering into the polymer board 10. Further, a top surface of the polymer board end cap 200
will form part of the walking surface of the walkway.
[0062] The polymer board end caps 200 may be used with each polymer board 10 within the
walkway, or only with each of the polymer boards 10 forming the ends of the walkway. It is
also envisaged that the polymer board end caps 200 may be used in conjunction with the
polymer walkway joints 100 within the walkway.
[0063] Figure 6 shows a polymer walkway accessory according to a third embodiment in the
form of a polymer walkway ramp 300. The polymer walkway ramp 300 has a first support 328
a flange 330, a bottom portion 332, an inclined portion 334, and a second support 336.
[0064] The inclined portion 334 extends from the bottom portion at an angle of a and is
connected to the flange 330. The first support 328 is connected between the bottom portion 332
and the connection between the flange 330 and the inclined portion 334. The second support
336 is connected between the bottom portion 332 and the inclined portion 334. The first support
328, flange 330, and bottom portion 332 together define a profile in the form of a channel 338.

                                                 11
The channel 338 is dimensioned to removably engage an edge of one or more polymer boards
10. As can be seen from Figure 6, the flange 330 is angled downwardly towards the bottom
portion 332, which allows the polymer walkway ramp 300 to engage polymer boards 10 of
varying thickness within the channel 338.
[0065] Referring to Figure 7, the flange 330 and the inclined portion 334 have a number of
ridges 340. The ridges 340provide for increased grip for a person walking on the polymer
walkway ramp 300. It is envisaged that other means known in the art for increasing the grip of
the polymer walkway ramp 300 may be utilized.
[0066] The polymer walkway ramp 300 is manufactured using the same materials and similar
methods used to manufacture the polymer walkway joint 100 (see paragraph [0052]).
Accordingly, the electrical conductivity of the polymer walkway ramp 300 is greater than the
electrical conductivity of the polymer boards 10.
[0067] Use of the polymer walkway ramp 300 will now be discussed. Similarly to the polymer
walkway joint 100, a lateral edge 18 or a longitudinal edge 16 of one or more polymer boards 10
is removably disposed within the channel 338 such that the flange 330 of the polymer walkway
ramp 300 is disposed above the top surface 12 of the polymer boards 10, and the bottom portion
332 of the polymer walkway ramp 300 is disposed below the bottom surface 14 of the polymer
boards 10. Accordingly, the flange 330 and the inclined portion 334 of each polymer walkway
ramp 300 within the walkway will form part of the walking surface of the walkway.
[0068] It is envisaged that the walkway may comprise a plurality of polymer walkway ramps
300 disposed on lateral edges 18 of polymer boards 10 within the walkway and/or on
longitudinal edges 16 of polymer boards 10 within the walkway. It is also envisaged that the
polymer walkway ramp 300 may be used in conjunction with the polymer walkway joints 100
and/or polymer board end caps 200 within the walkway.
[0069] During use, as each polymer walkway joint 100, polymer board end cap 200 and
polymer walkway ramp 300 form part of the walking surface of the walkway, they each create
an electrical pathway by which static electricity built up on a user walking on the walkway is
discharged when the user contacts any of the polymer walkway joints 100, polymer board end
caps 200 and/or polymer walkway ramps 300 within the walkway.

                                                   12
[0070] It is envisaged that the polymer walkway accessories described above are to be used, in
any combination, in a scaffold platform formed by a plurality of polymer boards 10.
Accordingly, each of the polymer walkway accessories within the scaffold platform provide an
electrical pathway by which static electricity built up on a user walking on the scaffold platform
is discharged when the user contacts any of the polymer walkway accessories.
[0071] Although specific reference has been made to using the polymer walkway accessories in
a scaffold platform, it is also envisaged that any combination of the polymer walkway
accessories described above may be used in any such walkway that is formed by polymer
boards, such as, for example, decks, temporary walkways, temporary seating, marine jetties or
docks, access platforms, etc.
[0072] A person walking along a walkway formed from polymer boards and using any
combination of the polymer walkway accessories described above is likely to step on one or
more of the polymer walkway accessories, thereby allowing for any static electricity built up on
the person to be discharged. The use of any combination of the polymer walkway accessories as
described above reduces the likelihood of static electricity accumulating on a person to a level
that may be painful, or produce a spark that may be hazardous, when discharged.
[0073] The polymer walkway accessories as described above avoid the need for applying anti
static coatings, sprays, liquids, etc. to the polymer boards, which typically have a much shorter
lifespan than the polymer boards. Accordingly, as the polymer boards are not required to be
coated in anti-static coatings, sprays, liquids, etc., this avoid increasing the overall costs of the
polymer boards and the need to take the polymer boards out of service for recoating.
[0074] As the electrically conductive materials are impregnated in the polymer walkway
accessories as described above and not the polymer boards, the impact strength and lifespan of
the polymer boards are not compromised. Further, it is significantly cheaper to impregnate the
polymer walkway accessories with electrically conductive materials than the impregnating the
polymer boards with electrically conductive materials.
[0075] Impregnating the polymer walkway accessories as described above with electrically
conductive materials reduces the need for each person who is to use the walkway with
specialised equipment/apparel, which is costly and difficult to manage.

[0076] Although the polymer walkway accessories have been described with reference to
preferred embodiments, it will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the invention may
be embodied in many other forms.
