                                          "DRUM - GRAB"
The below statements describe the use, construction and materials of the "Drum Grab" device.
The Drum Grab is used in conjunction with common tie-down straps or rope and allows a single/or
two standard 44 Gallon (200 litres and 205 litre) drums to be securely hauled in the vertical position.
A single or double rope or typical Tie-Down strap(s) can be used to affix the Drum Grab to a box
trailer or commercial vehicle tray.
The Drum Grab is manufactured from Mild Steel hot rolled sections including Flat and Round bar
with a hot dip galvanised coating in accordance with AS 4680.
 The construction design allows access to both the fill and vent points of a standard 44 Gallon drum
while the drum grab is anchored to the trailer or tray.
The Drum Grab has two angled anchor points therefor providing anchorage in both vertical and
horizontal planes when fastened to the trailer or tray.
The Drum Grab includes 4 off safety points to prevent strap slippage when a single tie down or rope
is used.

                                        CLAIMS
1. The Drum Grab is a manufactured rigging device used in conjunction with rope or tie
   down straps and is placed on top of a 44 gallon drum or drums in their vertical
   orientation and incorporates two diagonally angled tie down points.
2. The rigging device as claimed in claim 1 is manufactured from mild steel sections of
   100x6 and 50x6 square edge Flat Bar and 12mm diameter round bar.
3. The 50x6 flat bar section stated in claim 2 is rolled on face to form a ring that
   prevents the drum from dislodging from the device.
4. The diagonal tie down points described in claim 1 are angled to provide force in both
   horizontal and vertical down directions when the rope or straps are under tension.
5. In a case where only a single rope or strap is available, the 12mm diameter round
   bar stated in claim 2 provides four (4) safety points on the device to prevent
   possibility of the rope or strap from sliding off the device.
