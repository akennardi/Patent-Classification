                                                 ABSTRACT
Capable of securing objects on Perspex (also any shape-able material) mounting blocks of any size
which have defined shape that is able to move in a lateral direction, while securely held in place in
any axis (vertically, horizontal, etc.). The system is basically a bespoke rail system with mounting
blocks to suit this system.
The first part of the design houses the specimen to be displayed on a Perspex mounting block with a
unique shape on the base that has been formed to slide into a parallel fixed rail design.
The system at present has been manufactured to accommodate minerals to fit on to mounting blocks
with a surface area of approx. 8 cm, with a height off the base rail of 3 cm. the mounting blocks
used for small mineral display have a bevel on front edge to affix a suitable label with description of
specific specimen.
The rail design at present comprises of a base of two Perspex, 4 cm wide 'C' shape rails (which can
be of any width or length). The rails are fixed to the base at a width which allows clearance for the
mounting block to slide up and down the rails.

Capable of securing objects on Perspex (also any shape-able material) mounting blocks of
any size which have defined shape that is able to move in a lateral direction, while securely
held in place in any axis (vertically, horizontal, etc). the system is basically a bespoke rail
system with mounting blocks to suit this system.
This invention was designed and manufactured by myself to accommodate small specimen
minerals for display and storage in a secure environment. The first part of the design houses
the specimen to be displayed on a Perspex mounting block with a unique shape on the base
that has been formed to slide into a parallel fixed rail design. This design has been researched
and has no known equivalent in the mineral display, collecting and storage industry, whether
used in the private collections or public institutions (museums) within Australia or overseas.
This conclusion was made after research into what systems museum institutions and what
mounting systems were displayed at industry trade shows within Australia and overseas.
The system design structure encompasses all known shapes of minerals (or any object that
can be affixed to the mounting block) the system at present has been manufactured to
accommodate minerals to fit on to mounting blocks with a surface area of approx.. 8 cm, with
a height off the base rail of 3 cm. the mounting blocks used for small mineral display have an
bevel on front edge to affix a suitable label with description of specific specimen.
The rail design at present comprises of a base of two Perspex, 4 cm wide 'C' shape rails
(which can be of any width or length). The rails are fixed to the base at a width which allows
clearance for the mounting block to slide up and down the rails.
This mounting block innovation for the mineral specimens is housed in a bespoke Perspex
case with magnetic locks on the rail junction, where mineral specimens on the mounting
blocks enter and exit the rails. Inside the display case is affixed a water proof LED lighting
system powered by an external battery.
This system has gone through the prototype process and has now been manufactured and is
now utilised to store, display and transport valued mineral specimens for display.
This system could be used in any environment and at any axis even in space.
Photos of parts and system are available as well as operating models of this system can be
forwarded with this patent application.
This application will possibly be transferred to an innovation patent which may be more
suitable for this project.
