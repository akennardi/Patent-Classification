   hereinbefore and hereinafter.
   Background of the Invention
10 Type 2 diabetes is an increasingly prevalent disease that due to a high frequency of
   complications leads to a significant reduction of life expectancy. Because of diabetes
   associated microvascular complications, type 2 diabetes is currently the most frequent cause
   of adult-onset loss of vision, renal failure, and amputations in the industrialized world. In
   addition, the presence of type 2 diabetes is associated with a two to five fold increase in
15 cardiovascular disease risk.
   After long duration of disease, most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually fail on oral
   therapy and become insulin dependent with the necessity for daily injections and multiple
   daily glucose measurements.
20
   The UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) demonstrated that intensive
   treatment with metformin, sulfonylureas or insulin resulted in only a limited improvement of
   glycemic control (difference in HbAlc -0.9%). In addition, even in patients within the
   intensive treatment arm glycemic control deteriorated significantly over time and this was
25 attributed to deterioration of p-cell function. Importantly, intensive treatment was not
   associated with a significant reduction in macrovascular complications, i.e. cardiovascular
   events. Therefore many patients with type 2 diabetes remain inadequately treated, partly
   because of limitations in long term efficacy, tolerability and dosing inconvenience of existing
   antihyperglycemic therapies.
30
   Oral antidiabetic drugs conventionally used in therapy (such as e.g. first- or second-line,
   and/or mono- or (initial or add-on) combination therapy) include, without being restricted
   thereto, metformin, sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones, glinides and a-glucosidase inhibitors.
35 The high incidence of therapeutic failure is a major contributor to the high rate of long-term
   hyperglycemia-associated complications or chronic damages (including micro- and

                                                     -3
   macrovascular complications such as e.g. diabetic nephrophathy, retinopathy or neuropathy,
   or cardiovascular complications) in patients with type 2 diabetes.
   Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for methods, medicaments and pharmaceutical
 5 compositions with a good efficacy with regard to glycemic control, with regard to disease
   modifying properties and with regard to reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
   while at the same time showing an improved safety profile.
   SGLT2 inhibitors inhibitors represent a novel class of agents that are being developed for the
10 treatment or improvement in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.
   Glucopyranosyl-substituted benzene derivative are described in the prior art as SGLT2
   inhibitors, for example in WO 01/27128, WO 03/099836, WO 2005/092877, WO
   2006/034489, WO 2006/064033, WO 2006/117359, WO 2006/117360, WO 2007/025943,
   WO 2007/028814, WO 2007/031548, WO 2007/093610, WO 2007/128749, WO
15 2008/049923, WO 2008/055870, WO 2008/055940. The glucopyranosyl-substituted benzene
   derivatives are proposed as inducers of urinary sugar excretion and as medicaments in the
   treatment of diabetes.
   Renal filtration and reuptake of glucose contributes, among other mechanisms, to the steady
20 state plasma glucose concentration and can therefore serve as an antidiabetic target.
   Reuptake of filtered glucose across epithelial cells of the kidney proceeds via sodium
   dependent glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) located in the brush-border membranes in the
   tubuli along the sodium gradient. There are at least 3 SGLT isoforms that differ in their
   expression pattern as well as in their physico-chemical properties. SGLT2 is exclusively
25 expressed in the kidney, whereas SGLT1 is expressed additionally in other tissues like
   intestine, colon, skeletal and cardiac muscle. SGLT3 has been found to be a glucose sensor
   in interstitial cells of the intestine without any transport function. Potentially, other related, but
   not yet characterized genes, may contribute further to renal glucose reuptake. Under
   normoglycemia, glucose is completely reabsorbed by SGLTs in the kidney, whereas the
30 reuptake capacity of the kidney is saturated at glucose concentrations higher than 10mM,
   resulting in glucosuria ("diabetes mellitus"). This threshold concentration can be decreased
   by SGLT2-inhibition. It has been shown in experiments with the SGLT inhibitor phlorizin that
   SGLT-inhibition will partially inhibit the reuptake of glucose from the glomerular filtrate into
   the blood leading to a decrease in blood glucose concentrations and to glucosuria.

   Summary of the Invention
35 Within the scope of the present invention it has now surprisingly been found that a
   pharmaceutical composition comprising a SGLT2 inhibitor as defined hereinafter can
   advantageously be used for preventing, slowing progression of, delaying or treating a

                                                  -5
   metabolic disorder, in particular for improving glycemic control in patients. This opens up new
   therapeutic possibilities in the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus,
   overweight, obesity, complications of diabetes mellitus and of neighboring disease states.
 5 Therefore, in a first aspect the present invention provides a method for preventing, slowing
   the progression of, delaying or treating a metabolic disorder selected from the group
   consisting of type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance
   (IGT), impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG), hyperglycemia, postprandial hyperglycemia,
   overweight, obesity, metabolic syndrome and gestational diabetes in a patient in need
10 thereof characterized in that an SGLT2 inhibitor as defined hereinbefore and hereinafter is
   administered to the patient.
   According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for improving
   glycemic control and/or for reducing of fasting plasma glucose, of postprandial plasma
15 glucose and/or of glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1 c in a patient in need thereof characterized
   in that an SGLT2 inhibitor as defined hereinbefore and hereinafter is administered to the
   patient.
   The pharmaceutical composition according to this invention may also have valuable disease
20 modifying properties with respect to diseases or conditions related to impaired glucose
   tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG), insulin resistance and/or metabolic
   syndrome.
   According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for preventing,
25 slowing, delaying or reversing progression from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired
   fasting blood glucose (IFG), insulin resistance and/or from metabolic syndrome to type 2
   diabetes mellitus in a patient in need thereof characterized in that an SGLT2 inhibitor as
   defined hereinbefore and hereinafter is administered to the patient.
30 As by the use of a pharmaceutical composition according to this invention, an improvement
   of the glycemic control in patients in need thereof is obtainable, also those conditions and/or
   diseases related to or caused by an increased blood glucose level may be treated.
   According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for preventing,
35 slowing the progression of, delaying or treating of a condition or disorder selected from the
   group consisting of complications of diabetes mellitus such as cataracts and micro- and
   macrovascular diseases, such as nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, tissue ischaemia,

                                                  -6
   diabetic foot, arteriosclerosis, myocardial infarction, accute coronary syndrome, unstable
   angina pectoris, stable angina pectoris, stroke, peripheral arterial occlusive disease,
   cardiomyopathy, heart failure, heart rhythm disorders and vascular restenosis, in a patient in
   need thereof characterized in that an SGLT2 inhibitor as defined hereinbefore and
 5 hereinafter is administered to the patient. In particular one or more aspects of diabetic
   nephropathy such as hyperperfusion, proteinuria and albuminuria may be treated, their
   progression slowed or their onset delayed or prevented. The term "tissue ischaemia"
   particularly comprises diabetic macroangiopathy, diabetic microangiopathy, impaired wound
   healing and diabetic ulcer. The terms "micro- and macrovascular diseases" and "micro- and
10 macrovascular complications" are used interchangeably in this application.
   By the administration of a pharmaceutical composition according to this invention and due to
   the activity of the SGLT2 inhibitor excessive blood glucose levels are not converted to
   insoluble storage forms, like fat, but excreted through the urine of the patient. In animal
15 models it can be seen that loss of fat accounts for the majority of the observed weight loss
   whereas no significant changes in body water or protein content are observed. Therefore, no
   gain in weight or even a reduction in body weight is the result.
   According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for reducing body
20 weight and/or body fat, or preventing an increase in body weight and/or body fat, or
   facilitating a reduction in body weight and/or body fat, in a patient in need thereof
   characterized in that an SGLT2 inhibitor as defined hereinbefore and hereinafter is
   administered to the patient.
25 The pharmacological effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor in the pharmaceutical composition
   according to this invention is independent of insulin. Therefore, an improvement of the
   glycemic control is possible without an additional strain on the pancreatic beta cells. By an
   administration of a pharmaceutical composition according to this invention a beta-cell
   degeneration and a decline of beta-cell functionality such as for example apoptosis or
30 necrosis of pancreatic beta cells can be delayed or prevented. Furthermore, the functionality
   of pancreatic cells can be improved or restored, and the number and size of pancreatic beta
   cells increased. It may be shown that the differentiation status and hyperplasia of pancreatic
   beta-cells disturbed by hyperglycemia can be normalized by treatment with a pharmaceutical
   composition according to this invention.
35
   According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for preventing,
   slowing, delaying or treating the degeneration of pancreatic beta cells and/or the decline of

                                                     -7
   the functionality of pancreatic beta cells and/or for improving and/or restoring the functionality
   of pancreatic beta cells and/or restoring the functionality of pancreatic insulin secretion in a
   patient in need thereof characterized in that an SGLT2 inhibitor as defined hereinbefore and
   hereinafter is administered to the patient.
 5
   By the administration of a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention, an
   abnormal accumulation of ectopic fat, in particular of the liver, may be reduced or inhibited.
   Therefore, according to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method
   for preventing, slowing, delaying or treating diseases or conditions attributed to an abnormal
10 accumulation of ectopic fat, in particular liver fat, in a patient in need thereof characterized in
   that an SGLT2 inhibitor as defined hereinbefore and hereinafter is administered to the
   patient. Diseases or conditions which are attributed to an abnormal accumulation of liver fat
   are particularly selected from the group consisting of general fatty liver, non-alcoholic fatty
   liver (NAFL), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hyperalimentation-induced fatty liver,
15 diabetic fatty liver, alcoholic-induced fatty liver or toxic fatty liver.
   As a result thereof, another aspect of the invention provides a method for maintaining and/or
   improving the insulin sensitivity and/or for treating or preventing hyperinsulinemia and/or
   insulin resistance in a patient in need thereof characterized in that an SGLT2 inhibitor as
20 defined hereinbefore and hereinafter is administered to the patient.
   According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for preventing,
   slowing progression of, delaying, or treating new onset diabetes after transplantation
   (NODAT) and/or post-transplant metabolic syndrome (PTMS).
25
   According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for preventing,
   delaying, or reducing NODAT and/or PTMS associated complications including micro- and
   macrovascular diseases and events, graft rejection, infection, and death.
30 The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is capable of facilitating the
   lowering of serum total urate levels in the patient. Therefore according to another aspect of
   the invention, there is provided a method for treating hyperuricemia and hyperuricemia
   associated conditions, such as for example gout, hypertension and renal failure, in a patient
   in need thereof. The patient may be a diabetic or non-diabetic patient.
35
   The administration of a pharmaceutical composition increases the urine excretion of glucose.
   This increase in osmotic excretion and water release and the lowering of urate levels are

                                                    -8
   beneficial as a treatment or prevention for kidney stones. Therefore in a further aspect of the
   invention, there is provided a method for treating or preventing kidney stones.
   According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for treating
 5 hyponatremia, water retention and water intoxication. By the administration of the
   pharmaceutical composition according to this invention it may be possible to reverse the
   effects of hyponatremia, water retention and water intoxication by acting on the kidney to
   reverse water retention and electrolyte imbalances associated with these diseases and
   disorders.

   Definitions
   The term "active ingredient" of a pharmaceutical composition according to the present
20 invention means the SGLT2 inhibitor according to the present invention. An "active
   ingredient is also sometimes referred to herein as an "active substance".
   The term "body mass index" or "BMI" of a human patient is defined as the weight in
   kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters, such that BMI has units
25 of kg/m 2.
   The term "overweight" is defined as the condition wherein the individual has a BMI greater
   than or 25 kg/m 2 and less than 30 kg/m 2 . The terms "overweight" and "pre-obese" are used
   interchangeably.
30
   The term "obesity" is defined as the condition wherein the individual has a BMI equal to or
   greater than 30 kg/m 2 . According to a WHO definition the term obesity may be categorized
   as follows: the term "class I obesity" is the condition wherein the BMI is equal to or greater
   than 30 kg/m 2 but lower than 35 kg/m 2 ; the term "class II obesity" is the condition wherein the
35 BMI is equal to or greater than 35 kg/m 2 but lower than 40 kg/m 2 ; the term "class Ill obesity"
   is the condition wherein the BMI is equal to or greater than 40 kg/m 2.

                                                 -10
   The term "visceral obesity" is defined as the condition wherein a waist-to-hip ratio of
   greater than or equal to 1.0 in men and 0.8 in women is measured. It defines the risk for
   insulin resistance and the development of pre-diabetes.
 5 The term "abdominal obesity" is usually defined as the condition wherein the waist
   circumference is > 40 inches or 102 cm in men, and is > 35 inches or 94 cm in women. With
   regard to a Japanese ethnicity or Japanese patients abdominal obesity may be defined as
   waist circumference     85 cm in men and     90 cm in women (see e.g. investigating committee
   for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in Japan).
10
   The term "euglycemia" is defined as the condition in which a subject has a fasting blood
   glucose concentration within the normal range, greater than 70 mg/dL (3.89
   mmol/L) and less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L). The word "fasting" has the usual meaning as
   a medical term.
15
   The term "hyperglycemia" is defined as the condition in which a subject has a fasting blood
   glucose concentration above the normal range, greater than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L). The
   word "fasting" has the usual meaning as a medical term.
20 The term "hypoglycemia" is defined as the condition in which a subject has a blood glucose
   concentration below the normal range, in particular below 70 mg/dL (3.89
   mmol/L).
   The term "postprandial hyperglycemia" is defined as the condition in which a subject has
25 a 2 hour postprandial blood glucose or serum glucose concentration greater than 200 mg/dL
   (11.11 mmol/L).
   The term "impaired fasting blood glucose" or "IFG" is defined as the condition in which a
   subject has a fasting blood glucose concentration or fasting serum glucose concentration in a
30 range from 100 to 125 mg/dl (i.e. from 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/I), in particular greater than 110 mg/dL
   and less than 126 mg/dl (7.00 mmol/L). A subject with "normal fasting glucose" has a fasting
   glucose concentration smaller than 100 mg/dl, i.e. smaller than 5.6 mmol/l.
   The term "impaired glucose tolerance" or "IGT" is defined as the condition in which a
35 subject has a 2 hour postprandial blood glucose or serum glucose concentration greater than
    140 mg/dl (7.78 mmol/L) and less than 200 mg/dL (11.11 mmol/L). The abnormal glucose
   tolerance, i.e. the 2 hour postprandial blood glucose or serum glucose concentration can be

                                                  - 11
   measured as the blood sugar level in mg of glucose per dL of plasma 2 hours after taking 75
   g of glucose after a fast. A subject with "normal glucose tolerance" has a 2 hour postprandial
   blood glucose or serum glucose concentration smaller than 140 mg/dl (7.78 mmol/L).
 5 The term "hyperinsulinemia" is defined as the condition in which a subject with insulin
   resistance, with or without euglycemia, has fasting or postprandial serum or plasma insulin
   concentration elevated above that of normal, lean individuals without insulin resistance,
   having a waist-to-hip ratio < 1.0 (for men) or < 0.8 (for women).
10 The terms "insulin-sensitizing", "insulin resistance-improving" or "insulin resistance-lowering"
   are synonymous and used interchangeably.
   The term "insulin resistance" is defined as a state in which circulating insulin levels in
   excess of the normal response to a glucose load are required to maintain the euglycemic
15 state (Ford ES, et al. JAMA. (2002) 287:356-9). A method of determining insulin resistance is
   the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp test. The ratio of insulin to glucose is determined
   within the scope of a combined insulin-glucose infusion technique. There is found to be
   insulin resistance if the glucose absorption is below the 25th percentile of the background
   population investigated (WHO definition). Rather less laborious than the clamp test are so
20 called minimal models in which, during an intravenous glucose tolerance test, the insulin and
   glucose concentrations in the blood are measured at fixed time intervals and from these the
   insulin resistance is calculated. With this method, it is not possible to distinguish between
   hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance.
25 Furthermore, insulin resistance, the response of a patient with insulin resistance to therapy,
   insulin sensitivity and hyperinsulinemia may be quantified by assessing the "homeostasis
   model assessment to insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)" score, a reliable indicator of insulin
   resistance (Katsuki A, et al. Diabetes Care 2001; 24: 362-5). Further reference is made to
   methods for the determination of the HOMA-index for insulin sensitivity (Matthews et al.,
30 Diabetologia 1985, 28: 412-19), of the ratio of intact proinsulin to insulin (Forst et al.,
   Diabetes 2003, 52(Suppl.1): A459) and to an euglycemic clamp study. In addition, plasma
   adiponectin levels can be monitored as a potential surrogate of insulin sensitivity. The
   estimate of insulin resistance by the homeostasis assessment model (HOMA)-IR score is
   calculated with the formula (Galvin P, et al. Diabet Med 1992;9:921-8):
35
   HOMA-IR = [fasting serum insulin (pU/mL)] x [fasting plasma glucose(mmol/L)/22.5]

                                                    -12
   As a rule, other parameters are used in everyday clinical practice to assess insulin
   resistance. Preferably, the patient's triglyceride concentration is used, for example, as
   increased triglyceride levels correlate significantly with the presence of insulin resistance.
 5 Patients with a predisposition for the development of IGT or IFG or type 2 diabetes are those
   having euglycemia with hyperinsulinemia and are by definition, insulin resistant. A typical
   patient with insulin resistance is usually overweight or obese. If insulin resistance can be
   detected, this is a particularly strong indication of the presence of pre-diabetes. Thus, it may
   be that in order to maintain glucose homoeostasis a person needs 2-3 times as much insulin
10 as a healthy person, without this resulting in any clinical symptoms.
   The methods to investigate the function of pancreatic beta-cells are similar to the above
   methods with regard to insulin sensitivity, hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance: An
   improvement of beta-cell function can be measured for example by determining a HOMA
15 index for beta-cell function (Matthews et al., Diabetologia 1985, 28: 412-19), the ratio of
   intact proinsulin to insulin (Forst et al., Diabetes 2003, 52(Suppl. 1): A459), the insulin/C
   peptide secretion after an oral glucose tolerance test or a meal tolerance test, or by
   employing a hyperglycemic clamp study and/or minimal modeling after a frequently sampled
   intravenous glucose tolerance test (Stumvoll et al., Eur J Clin Invest 2001, 31: 380-81).
20
   The term "pre-diabetes" is the condition wherein an individual is pre-disposed to the
   development of type 2 diabetes. Pre-diabetes extends the definition of impaired glucose
   tolerance to include individuals with a fasting blood glucose within the high normal range >
   100 mg/dL (J. B. Meigs, et al. Diabetes 2003; 52:1475-1484) and fasting hyperinsulinemia
25 (elevated plasma insulin concentration). The scientific and medical basis for identifying pre
   diabetes as a serious health threat is laid out in a Position Statement entitled "The
   Prevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes" issued jointly by the American Diabetes Association
   and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (Diabetes Care
   2002; 25:742-749).
30
   Individuals likely to have insulin resistance are those who have two or more of the following
   attributes: 1) overweight or obese, 2) high blood pressure, 3) hyperlipidemia, 4) one or more
   1"  degree relative with a diagnosis of IGT or IFG or type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance can
   be confirmed in these individuals by calculating the HOMA-IR score. For the purpose of this
35 invention, insulin resistance is defined as the clinical condition in which an individual has a
   HOMA-IR score > 4.0 or a HOMA-IR score above the upper limit of normal as defined for the
   laboratory performing the glucose and insulin assays.

                                                  -13
   The term "type 2 diabetes" is defined as the condition in which a subject has a fasting blood
   glucose or serum glucose concentration greater than 125 mg/dL (6.94 mmol/L). The
   measurement of blood glucose values is a standard procedure in routine medical analysis. If
 5 a glucose tolerance test is carried out, the blood sugar level of a diabetic will be in excess of
   200 mg of glucose per dL (11.1 mmol/I) of plasma 2 hours after 75 g of glucose have been
   taken on an empty stomach. In a glucose tolerance test 75 g of glucose are administered
   orally to the patient being tested after 10-12 hours of fasting and the blood sugar level is
   recorded immediately before taking the glucose and 1 and 2 hours after taking it. In a healthy
10 subject, the blood sugar level before taking the glucose will be between 60 and 110 mg per
   dL of plasma, less than 200 mg per dL 1 hour after taking the glucose and less than 140 mg
   per dL after 2 hours. If after 2 hours the value is between 140 and 200 mg, this is regarded
   as abnormal glucose tolerance.
15 The term "late stage type 2 diabetes mellitus" includes patients with a secondary drug
   failure, indication for insulin therapy and progression to micro- and macrovascular
   complications e.g. diabetic nephropathy, or coronary heart disease (CHD).
   The term "HbAlc" refers to the product of a non-enzymatic glycation of the haemoglobin B
20 chain. Its determination is well known to one skilled in the art. In monitoring the treatment of
   diabetes mellitus the HbAlc value is of exceptional importance. As its production depends
   essentially on the blood sugar level and the life of the erythrocytes, the HbAlc in the sense
   of a "blood sugar memory" reflects the average blood sugar levels of the preceding 4-6
   weeks. Diabetic patients whose HbAlc value is consistently well adjusted by intensive
25 diabetes treatment (i.e. < 6.5 % of the total haemoglobin in the sample), are significantly
   better protected against diabetic microangiopathy. For example, metformin on its own
   achieves an average improvement in the HbA1 c value in the diabetic of the order of 1.0 - 1.5
   %. This reduction of the HbA1C value is not sufficient in all diabetics to achieve the desired
   target range of < 6.5 % and preferably < 6 % HbAlc.
30
   The term "insufficient glycemic control" or "inadequate glycemic control" in the scope of
   the present invention means a condition wherein patients show HbA1 c values above 6.5 %,
   in particular above 7.0 %, even more preferably above 7.5 %, especially above 8 %.
35 The "metabolic syndrome", also called "syndrome X" (when used in the context of a
   metabolic disorder), also called the "dysmetabolic syndrome" is a syndrome complex with the
   cardinal feature being insulin resistance (Laaksonen DE, et al. Am J Epidemiol

                                                  - 14
   2002;156:1070-7). According to the ATP Ill/NCEP guidelines (Executive Summary of the
   Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on
   Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment
   Panel Ill) JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association (2001) 285:2486-2497),
 5 diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome is made when three or more of the following risk factors
   are present:
         1.      Abdominal obesity, defined as waist circumference > 40 inches or 102 cm in
         men, and > 35 inches or 94 cm in women; or with regard to a Japanese ethnicity or
         Japanese patients defined as waist circumference         85 cm in men and   90 cm in
10       women;
         2.       Triglycerides:   150 mg/dL
         3.       HDL-cholesterol < 40 mg/dL in men
         4.       Blood pressure - 130/85 mm Hg (SBP         130 or DBP     85)
         5.       Fasting blood glucose     100 mg/dL
15
   The NCEP definitions have been validated (Laaksonen DE, et al. Am J Epidemiol. (2002)
   156:1070-7). Triglycerides and HDL cholesterol in the blood can also be determined by
   standard methods in medical analysis and are described for example in Thomas L (Editor):
   "Labor und Diagnose", TH-Books Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Frankfurt/Main, 2000.
20
   According to a commonly used definition, hypertension is diagnosed if the systolic blood
   pressure (SBP) exceeds a value of 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) exceeds
   a value of 90 mm Hg. If a patient is suffering from manifest diabetes it is currently
   recommended that the systolic blood pressure be reduced to a level below 130 mm Hg and
25 the diastolic blood pressure be lowered to below 80 mm Hg.
   The definitions of NODAT (new onset diabetes after transplantation) and PTMS (post
   transplant metabolic syndrome) follow closely that of the American Diabetes Association
   diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes, and that of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF)
30 and the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, for the
   metabolic syndrome. NODAT and/or PTMS are associated with an increased risk of micro
   and macrovascular disease and events, graft rejection, infection, and death. A number of
   predictors have been identified as potential risk factors related to NODAT and/or PTMS
   including a higher age at transplant, male gender, the pre-transplant body mass index, pre
35 transplant diabetes, and immunosuppression.

                                                  -15
   The term "gestational diabetes" (diabetes of pregnancy) denotes a form of the diabetes
   which develops during pregnancy and usually ceases again immediately after the birth.
   Gestational diabetes is diagnosed by a screening test which is carried out between the 24th
   and 28th weeks of pregnancy. It is usually a simple test in which the blood sugar level is
 5 measured one hour after the administration of 50 g of glucose solution. If this 1 h level is
   above 140 mg/dl, gestational diabetes is suspected. Final confirmation may be obtained by a
   standard glucose tolerance test, for example with 75 g of glucose.
   The term "hyperuricemia" denotes a condition of high serum total urate levels. In human
10 blood, uric acid concentrations between 3.6 mg/dL (ca. 214 pmol/L) and 8.3 mg/dL (ca. 494
   pmol/L) are considered normal by the American Medical Association. High serum total urate
   levels, or hyperuricemia, are often associated with several maladies. For example, high
   serum total urate levels can lead to a type of arthritis in the joints kown as gout. Gout is a
   condition created by a build up of monosodium urate or uric acid crystals on the articular
15 cartilage of joints, tendons and surrounding tissues due to elevated concentrations of total
   urate levels in the blood stream. The build up of urate or uric acid on these tissues provokes
   an inflammatory reaction of these tissues. Saturation levels of uric acid in urine may result in
   kidney stone formation when the uric acid or urate crystallizes in the kidney. Additionally,
   high serum total urate levels are often associated with the so-called metabolic syndrome,
20 including cardiovascular disease and hypertension.
   The term "hyponatremia" denotes a condition of a positive balance of water with or without
   a deficit of sodium, which is recognized when the plasma sodium falls below the level of 135
   mml/L. Hyponatremia is a condition which can occur in isolation in individuals that over
25 consume water; however, more often hyponatremia is a complication of medication or other
   underlying medical condition that leas to a diminished excretion of water. Hyponatremia may
   lead to water intoxication, which occurs when the normal tonicity of extracellular fluid falls
   below the safe limit, due to retention of excess water. Water intoxication is a potentially fatal
   disturbance in brain function. Typical symptoms of water intoxication include nausea,
30 vomiting, headache and malaise.
   The term "SGLT2 inhibitor" in the scope of the present invention relates to compounds, in
   particular to glucopyranosyl-derivatives, i.e. compounds having a glucopyranosyl-moiety,
   which show an inhibitory effect on the sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2), in particular
35 the human SGLT2. The inhibitory effect on hSGLT2 measured as IC50 is prerably below
   1000 nM, even more preferably below 100 nM, most preferably below 50 nM. The inhibitory
   effect on hSGLT2 can be determined by methods known in the literature, in particular as

                                                  -16
   described in the application WO 2005/092877 or WO 2007/093610 (pages 23/24), which are
   incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The term "SGLT2 inhibitor" also comprises
   any pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, hydrates and solvates thereof, including the
   respective crystalline forms.
 5
   The terms "treatment" and "treating" comprise therapeutic treatment of patients having
   already developed said condition, in particular in manifest form. Therapeutic treatment may
   be symptomatic treatment in order to relieve the symptoms of the specific indication or
   causal treatment in order to reverse or partially reverse the conditions of the indication or to
10 stop or slow down progression of the disease. Thus the compositions and methods of the
   present invention may be used for instance as therapeutic treatment over a period of time as
   well as for chronic therapy.
   The terms "prophylactically treating", "preventivally treating" and "preventing" are used
15 interchangeably and comprise a treatment of patients at risk to develop a condition
   mentioned hereinbefore, thus reducing said risk.
   The term "tablet" comprises tablets without a coating and tablets with one or more coatings.
   Furthermore the "term" tablet comprises tablets having one, two, three or even more layers
20 and press-coated tablets, wherein each of the beforementioned types of tablets may be
   without or with one or more coatings. The term "tablet" also comprises mini, melt, chewable,
   effervescent and orally disintegrating tablets.
   The terms "pharmacopoe" and "pharmacopoeias" refer to standard pharmacopoeias such
25 as the "USP 31-NF 26 through Second Supplement" (United States Pharmacopeial
   Convention) or the "European Pharmacopoeia 6.3" (European Directorate for the Quality of
   Medicines and Health Care, 2000-2009).

  Even more specifically, the crystalline form (1.9X) is characterised by an X-ray powder
  diffraction pattern, made using CuKal radiation, which comprises peaks at degrees 20 (0.1
  degrees 20) as shown in Figure 1.

                                                     - 23
   Furthermore the crystalline form (1.9X) is characterised by a melting point of about 1490C
   30C (determined via DSC; evaluated as onset-temperature; heating rate 10 K/min).The
   obtained DSC curve is shown in Figure 2.
 5 The X-ray powder diffraction patterns are recorded, within the scope of the present invention,
   using a STOE - STADI P-diffractometer in transmission mode fitted with a location-sensitive
   detector (OED) and a Cu-anode as X-ray source (CuKal radiation, k = 1,54056 A , 40kV,
   40mA). In the Table 1 above the values "20 [0]" denote the angle of diffraction in degrees
   and the values "d[A]" denote the specified distances in A between the lattice planes. The
10 intensity shown in the Figure 1 is given in units of cps (counts per second).
   In order to allow for experimental error, the above described 20 values should be considered
   accurate to  0.1 degrees 20, in particular  0.05 degrees 20. That is to say, when
   assessing whether a given sample of crystals of the compound (1.9) is the crystalline form in
15 accordance with the invention, a 20 value which is experimentally observed for the sample
   should be considered identical with a characteristic value described above if it falls within 
   0.1 degrees 20 of the characteristic value, in particular if it falls within  0.05 degrees 20 of
   the characteristic value.
20 The melting point is determined by DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) using a DSC 821
   (Mettler Toledo).
   In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form according to the present
   invention comprises the compound (1.9), wherein at least 50 % by weight of the compound
25 (1.9) is in the form of its crystalline form (1.9X) as defined hereinbefore. Preferably in said
   composition or dosage form at least 80 % by weight, more preferably at least 90 % by weight
   of the compound (1.9) is in the form of its crystalline form (1.9X) as defined hereinbefore.
   Regarding the active pharmaceutical ingredients it can be found that the dissolution
30 properties of the pharmaceutical composition and dosage form is affected inter alia by the
   particle size and particle size distribution of the respective active pharmaceutical ingredient.
   In the pharmaceutical composition and pharmaceutical dosage form according to the
   invention the active pharmaceutical ingredients preferably have a particle size distribution
   such that at least 90 % of the respective active pharmaceutical ingredient particles, with
35 regard to the distribution by volume, has a particle size smaller than 200 pm, i.e. X90 < 200
   pm.

   In particular, with regard to the glucopyranosyl-substituted benzene derivative of the formula
   (1), in particular the compound (1.9) or its crystalline form (1.9X), it was found that the particle
   size influence the manufacturability, in particular that too small particles influence the
 5 manufacturability by sticking or filming. On the other hand too large particles negatively affect
   the dissolution properties of the pharmaceutical composition and dosage form and thus the
   bioavailability. In the following preferred ranges of the particle size distribution are described.
   Therefore, in one aspect, in the pharmaceutical composition and pharmaceutical dosage
10 form according to the invention the glucopyranosyl-substituted benzene derivative of the
   formula (1), in particular the compound (1.9), preferably its crystalline form (19.X), preferably
   has a particle size distribution (by volume) such that at least 90 % of the respective active
   pharmaceutical ingredient has a particle size smaller than 200 pm, i.e. X90 < 200 pm,
   preferably X90       150 pm. More preferably the particle size distribution is such that X90     100
15 pm, even more preferably X90         90 pm. In addition the particle size distribution is preferably
   such that X90       1 pm, more preferably X90       5 pm, even more preferably X90       10 pm.
   Therefore preferred particle size distributions are such that 1 pm        X90 < 200 pm, particularly
   1 pm      X90    150 pm, more preferably 5 pm        X90     150 pm, even more preferably 5 pm
   X90      100 pm, even more preferably 10 pm         X90    100 pm. A preferred example X90        75
20 pm. Another preferred example is 20 pm          X90     50 pm.
   Furthermore in the pharmaceutical composition and pharmaceutical dosage form according
   to the invention the glucopyranosyl-substituted benzene derivative of the formula (1), in
   particular the compound (1.9), preferably its crystalline form (19.X), preferably has a particle
25 size distribution (by volume) such that X50        90 pm, more preferably X50      75 pm, even
   more preferably X50       50 pm, most preferably X50        40 pm. In addition the particle size
   distribution is preferably such that X50      1 pm, more preferably X50       5 pm, even more
   preferably X50       8 pm. Therefore preferred particle size distributions are such that 1 pm
   X50      90 pm, particularly 1 pm    X50     75 pm, more preferably 5 pm       X50    75 pm, even
30 more preferably 5 pm        X50    50 pm. A preferred example is 8 pm       X50    40 pm.
   Furthermore in the pharmaceutical composition and pharmaceutical dosage form according
   to the invention the glucopyranosyl-substituted benzene derivative of the formula (1), in
   particular the compound (1.9), preferably its crystalline form (19.X), preferably has a particle
35 size distribution (by volume) such that X10        0.1 pm, more preferably X10      0.5 pm, even
   more preferably X10        1 pm, in particular X10     2 pm.

   The value X90 refers to the 90% value of the volume distribution measured using a laser

10 volume distribution. Analogously the value X50 refers to the 50% value (median) of the
   volume distribution measured using a laser diffractometer. In other words, for the purposes of
   the present invention, the X50 value denotes the particle size below which 50% of the
   quantity of particles is found based on the volume distribution. Analogously the value X10
   refers to the 10% value of the volume distribution measured using a laser diffractometer. In

   Preferably all X90, X50, X1 0 values hereinbefore and hereinafter are by volume and
   determined by laser-diffraction method, in particular low angle laser light scattering, i.e.
   Fraunhofer diffraction. A preferred test is described in the experimental section. The laser
   diffraction method is sensitive to the volume of a particle and provides a volume-average
 5 particle size, which is equivalent to the weight-average particle size if the density is constant.
   The skilled artesian knows that the results of the particle size distribution determination by
   one technique can be correlated with that from another technique, for example on an
   empirical basis by routine experimentation. Alternatively the particle size distribution in the
   pharmaceutical composition or dosage form can be determined by microscopy, in particular
10 electron microscopy or scanning electron microscopy.

 5 A dosage form according to this invention, such as a tablet, capsule or film-coated tablet,
   may be prepared by methods well-known to the one skilled in the art.
   Suitable methods of manufacturing a tablet include compression of the pharmaceutical
   composition in the form of a powder, i.e. direct compression, or compression of the
10 pharmaceutical composition in the form of granules, and if needed with additional excipients.
   Granules of the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention may be prepared by
   methods well-known to the one skilled in the art. Preferred methods for the granulation of the
   active ingredients together with the excipients include wet granulation, for example high
15 shear wet granulation and fluidized bed wet granulation, dry granulation, also called roller
   compaction.
   In the wet granulation process the granulation liquid are the solvent alone or a preparation of
   one or more binders in a solvent or mixture of solvents. Suitable binders are described
20 hereinbefore. Examples are hypromellose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, povidone and
   copovidone. Suitable solvents are for example purified water, ethanol, methanol,
   isopropanol, acetone, preferably purified water, including mixtures thereof. The solvent is a
   volatile component, which does not remain in the final product. The one or more active
   ingredients and the other excipients, in particular the one or more diluents and the one or
25 more disintegrants, usually with exception of the lubricant, are premixed and granulated with
   the granulation liquid, for example using a high shear granulator. The wet granulation step is
   usually followed by one or more drying and sieving steps. For example a drying oven or a
   fluid bed dryer can then be used for drying.
30 The dried granules are sieved through an appropriate sieve. After optional addition of the
   other excipients, in particular disintegrant, binder, filler and/or glidant, with exception of the
   lubricant the mixture is blended in a suitable blender, for example a free fall blender, followed
   by addition of the one or more lubricants, for example magnesium stearate, and final
   blending in the blender.

   be measured via sieve analysis, for example with a sonic sifter. In one embodiment, at least
   80 %, at least 90 %, or at least 95 % by weight of the granules is in the given range.
   When this invention refers to patients requiring treatment or prevention, it relates primarily to
15 treatment and prevention in humans, but the pharmaceutical composition may also be used
   accordingly in veterinary medicine in mammals. In the scope of this invention adult patients
   are preferably humans of the age of 18 years or older. Also in the scope of this invention,
   patients are adolescent humans, i.e. humans of age 10 to 17 years, preferably of age 13 to
   17 years. It is assumed that in a adolescent population the administration of the
20 pharmaceutical composition according to the invention a very good HbAlc lowering and a
   very good lowering of the fasting plasma glucose can be seen. In addition it is assumed that
   in an adolescent population, in particular in overweight and/or obese patients, a pronounced
   weight loss can be observed.
25 As described hereinbefore by the administration of the pharmaceutical composition
   according to this invention and in particular in view of the high SGLT2 inhibitory activity of the
   SGLT2 inhibitors therein, excessive blood glucose is excreted through the urine of the
   patient, so that no gain in weight or even a reduction in body weight may result. Therefore, a
   treatment or prophylaxis according to this invention is advantageously suitable in those
30 patients in need of such treatment or prophylaxis who are diagnosed of one or more of the
   conditions selected from the group consisting of overweight and obesity, in particular class I
   obesity, class II obesity, class Ill obesity, visceral obesity and abdominal obesity. In addition
   a treatment or prophylaxis according to this invention is advantageously suitable in those
   patients in which a weight increase is contraindicated. The pharmaceutical composition as
35 well as the methods according to the present invention allow a reduction of the HbA1 c value
   to a desired target range, for example < 7 % and preferably < 6.5 %, for a higher number of

                                                 -  34
   patients and for a longer time of therapeutic treatment compared with a corresponding
   monotherapy or a therapy using only two of the combination partners.
   The pharmaceutical composition according to this invention and in particular the SGLT2
 5 inhibitor therein exhibits a very good efficacy with regard to glycemic control, in particular in
   view of a reduction of fasting plasma glucose, postprandial plasma glucose and/or
   glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc). By administering a pharmaceutical composition according
   to this invention, a reduction of HbAlc equal to or greater than preferably 0.5 %, even more
   preferably equal to or greater than 1.0 % can be achieved and the reduction is particularly in
10 the range from 1.0 % to 2.0 %.
   Furthermore, the method and/or use according to this invention is advantageously applicable
   in those patients who show one, two or more of the following conditions:
   (a)    a fasting blood glucose or serum glucose concentration greater than 100 mg/dL, in
15        particular greater than 125 mg/dL;
   (b)    a postprandial plasma glucose equal to or greater than 140 mg/dL;
   (c)    an HbAlc value equal to or greater than 6.5 %, in particular equal to or greater than 7.0
          %, especially equal to or greater than 7.5 %, even more particularly equal to or greater
          than 8.0 %.
20
   The present invention also discloses the use of the pharmaceutical composition for
   improving glycemic control in patients having type 2 diabetes or showing first signs of pre
   diabetes. Thus, the invention also includes diabetes prevention. If therefore a pharmaceutical
   composition according to this invention is used to improve the glycemic control as soon as
25 one of the above-mentioned signs of pre-diabetes is present, the onset of manifest type 2
   diabetes mellitus can be delayed or prevented.
   Furthermore, the pharmaceutical composition according to this invention is particularly
   suitable in the treatment of patients with insulin dependency, i.e. in patients who are treated
30 or otherwise would be treated or need treatment with an insulin or a derivative of insulin or a
   substitute of insulin or a formulation comprising an insulin or a derivative or substitute
   thereof. These patients include patients with diabetes type 2 and patients with diabetes type
   1.
35 Therefore, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a
   method for improving glycemic control and/or for reducing of fasting plasma glucose, of
   postprandial plasma glucose and/or of glycosylated hemoglobin HbAlc in a patient in need

                                                    - 35
   thereof who is diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting blood
   glucose (IFG) with insulin resistance, with metabolic syndrome and/or with type 2 or type 1
   diabetes mellitus characterized in that an SGLT2 inhibitor as defined hereinbefore and
   hereinafter is administered to the patient.
 5
   According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a
   method for improving gycemic control in patients, in particular in adult patients, with type 2
   diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise.
10 It can be found that by using a pharmaceutical composition according to this invention, an
   improvement of the glycemic control can be achieved even in those patients who have
   insufficient glycemic control in particular despite treatment with an antidiabetic drug, for
   example despite maximal recommended or tolerated dose of oral monotherapy with
   metformin. A maximal recommended dose with regard to metformin is for example 2000 mg
15 per day or 850 mg three times a day or any equivalent thereof.
   Therefore, the method and/or use according to this invention is advantageously applicable in
   those patients who show one, two or more of the following conditions:
   (a)     insufficient glycemic control with diet and exercise alone;
20 (b)     insufficient glycemic control despite oral monotherapy with metformin, in particular
           despite oral monotherapy at a maximal tolerated dose of metformin;
   (c)     insufficient glycemic control despite oral monotherapy with another antidiabetic agent,
           in particular despite oral monotherapy at a maximal tolerated dose of the other
           antidiabetic agent.

   The lowering of the blood glucose level by the administration of an SGLT2 inhibitor according
   to this invention is insulin-independent. Therefore, a pharmaceutical composition according
   to this invention is particularly suitable in the treatment of patients who are diagnosed having
   one or more of the following conditions
30 -     insulin resistance,
   -     hyperinsulinemia,

   (b) triglyceride blood level - 150 mg/dL,
   (c) HDL-cholesterol blood level < 40 mg/dL in female patients and < 50 mg/dL in male
         patients,
 5 (d) a systolic blood pressure       130 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure e 85 mm Hg,
   (e) a fasting blood glucose level       100 mg/dL.
   It is assumed that patients diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting
   blood glucose (IFG), with insulin resistance and/or with metabolic syndrome suffer from an
10 increased risk of developing a cardiovascular disease, such as for example myocardial
   infarction, coronary heart disease, heart insufficiency, thromboembolic events. A glycemic
   control according to this invention may result in a reduction of the cardiovascular risks.
   Furthermore, a pharmaceutical composition according to this invention is particularly suitable
15 in the treatment of patients after organ transplantation, in particular those patients who are
   diagnosed having one or more of the following conditions
   (a) a higher age, in particular above 50 years,
   (b) male gender;
   (c) overweight, obesity (including class 1,11and/or Ill obesity), visceral obesity and/or

   The patient may be a diabetic or non-diabetic mammal, in particular human.
   Furthermore, a pharmaceutical composition according to this invention is particularly suitable
   in the treatment of patients who are diagnosed having one or more of the following
35 conditions:
   (a) high serum uric acid levels, in particular greater than 6.0 mg/dL (357 pmol/L);
   (b) a history of gouty arthritis, in particular recurrent gouty arthritis;

                                                  - 37
   (c) kidney stones, in particular recurrent kidney stones;
   (d) a high propensity for kidney stone formation.
   A pharmaceutical composition according to this invention exhibits a good safety profile.
 5 Therefore, a treatment or prophylaxis according to this invention is advantageously possible
   in those patients for which the mono-therapy with another antidiabetic drug, such as for
   example metformin, is contraindicated and/or who have an intolerance against such drugs at
   therapeutic doses. In particular, a treatment or prophylaxis according to this invention may be
   advantageously possible in those patients showing or having an increased risk for one or
10 more of the following disorders: renal insufficiency or diseases, cardiac diseases, cardiac
   failure, hepatic diseases, pulmonal diseases, catabolytic states and/or danger of lactate
   acidosis, or female patients being pregnant or during lactation.
   Furthermore, it can be found that the administration of a pharmaceutical composition
15 according to this invention results in no risk or in a low risk of hypoglycemia. Therefore, a
   treatment or prophylaxis according to this invention is also advantageously possible in those
   patients showing or having an increased risk for hypoglycemia.
   A pharmaceutical composition according to this invention is particularly suitable in the long
20 term treatment or prophylaxis of the diseases and/or conditions as described hereinbefore
   and hereinafter, in particular in the long term glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes
   mellitus.
   The term "long term" as used hereinbefore and hereinafter indicates a treatment of or
25 administration in a patient within a period of time longer than 12 weeks, preferably longer
   than 25 weeks, even more preferably longer than 1 year.
   Therefore, a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a method
   for therapy, preferably oral therapy, for improvement, especially long term improvement, of
30 glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially in patients with late
   stage type 2 diabetes mellitus, in particular in patients additionally diagnosed of overweight,
   obesity (including class I, class || and/or class Ill obesity), visceral obesity and/or abdominal
   obesity.

                                                 - 42
   Pharmaceutical compositions and methods according to this invention can be tested in
   genetically hyperinsulinemic or diabetic animals like db/db mice, ob/ob mice, Zucker Fatty
   (fa/fa) rats or Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats. In addition, they can be tested in animals with
 5 experimentally induced diabetes like HanWistar or Sprague Dawley rats pretreated with
   streptozotocin.
   The effect on glycemic control according to this invention can be tested after single dosing of
   the SGLT2 inhibitor in an oral glucose tolerance test in the animal models described
10 hereinbefore. The time course of blood glucose is followed after an oral glucose challenge in
   overnight fasted animals. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present
   invention significantly improve glucose excursion, for example compared to another
   monotherapy, as measured by reduction of peak glucose concentrations or reduction of
   glucose AUC. In addition, after multiple dosing of the SGLT2 inhibitor in the animal models
15 described hereinbefore, the effect on glycemic control can be determined by measuring the
   HbA1 c value in blood. The pharmaceutical compositions according to this invention
   significantly reduce HbA1 c, for example compared to another monotherapy or compared to a
   dual-combination therapy.
20 The improved independence from insulin of the treatment according to this invention can be
   shown after single dosing in oral glucose tolerance tests in the animal models described
   hereinbefore. The time course of plasma insulin is followed after a glucose challenge in
   overnight fasted animals.
25 The increase in active GLP-1 levels by treatment according to this invention after single or
   multiple dosing can be determined by measuring those levels in the plasma of animal models
   described hereinbefore in either the fasting or postprandial state. Likewise, a reduction in
   glucagon levels in plasma can be measured under the same conditions.
30 The effect of a SGLT2 inhibitor according to the present invention on beta-cell regeneration
   and neogenesis can be determined after multiple dosing in the animal models described
   hereinbefore by measuring the increase in pancreatic insulin content, or by measuring
   increased beta-cell mass by morphometric analysis after immunhistochemical staining of
   pancreatic sections, or by measuring increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in
35 isolated pancreatic islets.

   Pharmacological Examples
   The following examples show the beneficial effect on glycemic control of the pharmaceutical
   compositions according to the present invention.
 5 Example 1:
   According to a first example an oral glucose tolerance test is performed in overnight fasted 9
   weeks old male Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats (ZDF/Crl-Lepra). A pre-dose blood sample
   is obtained by tail bleed. Blood glucose is measured with a glucometer, and the animals are
   randomized for blood glucose (n = 5 / group). Subsequently, the groups receive a single oral
10 administration of either vehicle alone (0.5% aqueous hydroxyethylcellulose containing 3 mM
   HCI and 0.015% Polysorbat 80) or vehicle containing the SGLT2 inhibitor. The animals
   receive an oral glucose load (2 g/kg) 30 min after compound administration. Blood glucose is
   measured in tail blood 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 180 min after the glucose
   challenge. Glucose excursion is quantified by calculating the reactive glucose AUC. The data
15 are presented as mean  SEM. The two-sided unpaired Student t-test is used for statistical
   comparison of the control group and the active groups.
   A representative experiment is shown in Figures 3A and 3B. Compound (1.9) (1-chloro-4-(p
   D-glucopyranos-1-yl)-2-[4-((S)-tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy)-benzyl]-benzene) was orally
   administered to ZDF rats at doses of 0.3 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg body weight. The
20 animals then received an oral glucose bolus and the resulting glucose-time profile is shown
   in Figure 3A. The baseline-corrected area under the glucose-time curves are shown in Figure
   3B. Compound (1.9) reduced glucose excursion by 15% at 0.3 mg/kg (not significant), by
   62% at 3 mg/kg (p < 0.001) and by 89% at 30 mg/kg (p < 0.001).
25 Example 2:
   According to a second example an oral glucose tolerance test is performed in overnight
   fasted male Sprague Dawley rats (Crl:CD(SD)) with a body weight of about 200 g. A pre
   dose blood sample is obtained by tail bleed. Blood glucose is measured with a glucometer,
   and the animals are randomized for blood glucose (n = 5 / group). Subsequently, the groups
30 receive a single oral administration of either vehicle alone (0.5% aqueous
   hydroxyethylcellulose containing 0.015% Polysorbat 80) or vehicle containing the SGLT2
   inhibitor. The animals receive an oral glucose load (2 g/kg) 30 min after compound
   administration. Blood glucose is measured in tail blood 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min
   after the glucose challenge. Glucose excursion is quantified by calculating the reactive
35 glucose AUC. The data are presented as mean  S.E.M. Statistical comparisons are
   conducted by Student's t test.

                                                  - 44
   Example 3:         Treatment of pre-diabetes
   The efficacy of a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention in the treatment of
   pre-diabetes characterised by pathological fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance
   can be tested using clinical studies. In studies over a shorter period (e.g. 2-4 weeks) the
 5 success of the treatment is examined by determining the fasting glucose values and/or the
   glucose values after a meal or after a loading test (oral glucose tolerance test or food
   tolerance test after a defined meal) after the end of the period of therapy for the study and
   comparing them with the values before the start of the study and/or with those of a placebo
   group. In addition, the fructosamine value can be determined before and after therapy and
10 compared with the initial value and/or the placebo value. A significant drop in the fasting or
   non-fasting glucose levels demonstrates the efficacy of the treatment. In studies over a
   longer period (12 weeks or more) the success of the treatment is tested by determining the
   HbA1 c value, by comparison with the initial value and/or with the value of the placebo group.
   A significant change in the HbAlc value compared with the initial value and/or the placebo
15 value demonstrates the efficacy of the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention
   for treating pre-diabetes.
   Example 4:         Preventing manifest type 2 diabetes
   Treating patients with pathological fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance (pre
20 diabetes) is also in pursuit of the goal of preventing the transition to manifest type 2 diabetes.
   The efficacy of a treatment can be investigated in a comparative clinical study in which pre
   diabetes patients are treated over a lengthy period (e.g. 1-5 years) with either a
   pharmaceutical composition according to this invention or with placebo or with a non-drug
   therapy or other medicaments. During and at the end of the therapy, by determining the
25 fasting glucose and/or a loading test (e.g. oGTT), a check is made to determine how many
   patients exhibit manifest type 2 diabetes, i.e. a fasting glucose level of >125 mg/dl and/or a
   2h value according to oGTT of >199 mg/dl. A significant reduction in the number of patients
   who exhibit manifest type 2 diabetes when treated with a pharmaceutical composition
   according to this invention as compared to one of the other forms of treatment, demonstrates
30 the efficacy in preventing a transition from pre-diabetes to manifest diabetes.
   Example 5:         Treatment of type 2 diabetes
   Treating patients with type 2 diabetes with the pharmaceutical composition according to the
   invention, in addition to producing an acute improvement in the glucose metabolic situation,
35 prevents a deterioration in the metabolic situation in the long term. This can be observed is
   patients are treated for a longer period, e.g. 3 months to 1 year or even 1 to 6 years, with the
   pharmaceutical composition according to the invention and are compared with patients who

                                                   - 45
   have been treated with other antidiabetic medicaments. There is evidence of therapeutic
   success compared with patients treated with other antidiabetic medicaments if no or only a
   slight increase in the fasting glucose and/or HbAlc value is observed. Further evidence of
   therapeutic success is obtained if a significantly smaller percentage of the patients treated
 5 with a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention, compared with patients who
   have been treated with other medicaments, undergo a deterioration in the glucose metabolic
   position (e.g. an increase in the HbAlc value to >6.5% or >7%) to the point where treatment
   with an additional oral antidiabetic medicament or with insulin or with an insulin analogue is
   indicated.
10
   Example 6:          Treatment of insulin resistance
   In clinical studies running for different lengths of time (e.g. 2 weeks to 12 months) the
   success of the treatment is checked using a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic glucose clamp
   study. A significant rise in the glucose infusion rate at the end of the study, compared with
15 the initial value or compared with a placebo group, or a group given a different therapy,
   proves the efficacy of a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention in the
   treatment of insulin resistance.
   Example 7:          Treatment of hyperglycaemia
20 In clinical studies running for different lengths of time (e.g. 1 day to 24 months) the success
   of the treatment in patients with hyperglycaemia is checked by determining the fasting
   glucose or non-fasting glucose (e.g. after a meal or a loading test with oGTT or a defined
   meal). A significant fall in these glucose values during or at the end of the study, compared
   with the initial value or compared with a placebo group, or a group given a different therapy,
25 proves the efficacy of a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention in the
   treatment of hyperglycaemia.
   Example 8:          Prevention of micro- or macrovascular complications
   The treatment of type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes patients with a pharmaceutical composition
30 according to the invention prevents or reduces or reduces the risk of developing
   microvascular complications (e.g. diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic
   nephropathy, diabetic foot, diabetic ulcer) or macrovascular complications (e.g. myocardial
   infarct, acute coronary syndrome, unstable angina pectoris, stable angina pectoris, stroke,
   peripheral arterial occlusive disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, heart rhythm disorders,
35 vascular restenosis). Type 2 diabetes or patients with pre-diabetes are treated long-term,
   e.g. for 1-6 years, with a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention and
   compared with patients who have been treated with other antidiabetic medicaments or with

                                                  - 46
   placebo. Evidence of the therapeutic success compared with patients who have been treated
   with other antidiabetic medicaments or with placebo can be found in the smaller number of
   single or multiple complications. In the case of macrovascular events, diabetic foot and/or
   diabetic ulcer, the numbers are counted by anamnesis and various test methods. In the case
 5 of diabetic retinopathy the success of the treatment is determined by computer-controlled
   illumination and evaluation of the background to the eye or other ophthalmic methods. In the
   case of diabetic neuropathy, in addition to anamnesis and clinical examination, the nerve
   conduction rate can be measured using a calibrated tuning fork, for example. With regard to
   diabetic nephropathy the following parameters may be investigated before the start, during
10 and at the end of the study: secretion of albumin, creatinin clearance, serum creatinin values,
   time taken for the serum creatinin values to double, time taken until dialysis becomes
   necessary.
   Example 9:          Treatment of Metabolic Syndrome
15 The efficacy of a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention can be tested in
   clinical studies with varying run times (e.g. 12 weeks to 6 years) by determining the fasting
   glucose or non-fasting glucose (e.g. after a meal or a loading test with oGTT or a defined
   meal) or the HbAlc value. A significant fall in these glucose values or HbAlc values during
   or at the end of the study, compared with the initial value or compared with a placebo group,
20 or a group given a different therapy, proves the efficacy of an active substance in the
   treatment of Metabolic Syndrome. Examples of this are a reduction in systolic and/or
   diastolic blood pressure, a lowering of the plasma triglycerides, a reduction in total or LDL
   cholesterol, an increase in HDL cholesterol or a reduction in weight, either compared with the
   starting value at the beginning of the study or in comparison with a group of patients treated
25 with placebo or a different therapy.
   Example 10a:           Prevention of NODAT and/or PTMS, and NODAT/PTMS associated
   complications
   Treatment of patients after organ transplantation with the pharmaceutical composition
30 according to the invention prevents the development of NODAT and/or PTMS, and
   associated complications. The efficacy of the treatment can be investigated in a comparative
   clinical study in which patients before or immediately after transplantation are treated over a
   lengthy period (e.g. 1-5 years) with either a pharmaceutical composition according to this
   intervention or with a placebo or with a non-drug therapy or other medicaments. During and
35 at the end of the therapy, the incidence of NODAT, PTMS, micro- and macrovascular
   complications, graft rejection, infection and death will be assessed. A significant reduction in

                                                  - 47
   the number of patients experiencing these complications demonstrates the efficacy in
   preventing development of NODAT, PTMS, and associated complications.
   Example 10b:         Treatment of NODAT and/or PTMS with prevention, delay or reduction
 5 of associated complications
   Treatment of patients with NODAT and/or PTMS with the pharmaceutical composition
   according to the invention prevents, delays or reduces the development of NODAT/PTMS
   associated complications. The efficacy of the treatment can be investigated in a comparative
   clinical study in which patients with NODAT and/or PTMS are treated over a lengthy period
10 (e.g. 1-5 years) with either a pharmaceutical composition according to this intervention or
   with a placebo or with a non-drug therapy or other medicaments. During and at the end of
   the therapy, the incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications, graft rejection,
   infection and death will be assessed. A significant reduction in the number of patients
   experiencing these complications demonstrates the efficacy in preventing, delaying or
15 reducing the development of NODAT and/or PTMS associated complications.
   Example 11 a:       Treatment of gestational diabetes
   In clinical studies running for a shorter period (e.g. 2-4 weeks) the success of the treatment is
   checked by determining the fasting glucose values and/or the glucose values after a meal or
20 after a loading test (oral glucose tolerance test or food tolerance test after a defined meal) at
   the end of the therapeutic period of the study and comparing them with the values before the
   start of the study and/or with those of a placebo group. In addition, the fructosamine value
   can be determined before and after treatment and compared with the initial value and/or a
   placebo value. A significant fall in the fasting or non-fasting glucose levels demonstrates the
25 pharmaceutical compositon according to the invention.
   In longer-running studies (12 weeks or more) the success of the treatment is checked by
   determining the HbAlc value (compared with initial value and placebo group). A significant
   change in the HbAlc value compared with the starting value and/or placebo value
   demonstrates the efficacy of the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention in
30 the treatment of gestational diabetes.
   Example lb:         Treatment of women who have had gestational diabetes
   Patients with gestational diabetes have a significantly increased risk of contracting manifest
   type 2 diabetes after the pregnancy. Therapy may be provided with the objective of
35 preventing the transition to manifest type 2. For this purpose, women with a history of
   gestational diabetes are treated either with a pharmaceutical composition according to the
   invention or with placebo or with a non-drug therapy or with other medicaments, over a

                                                   - 48
   lengthy period (e.g. 1-4 years). During and at the end of the treatment a check is carried out
   by determining the fasting glucose and/or by a loading test (e.g. oGTT) to see how many
   patients have developed manifest type 2 diabetes (fasting glucose level >125 mg/dl and/or
   2h value after oGTT >199 mg/dl). A significant reduction in the number of patients who
 5 develop manifest type 2 diabetes when treated with a pharmaceutical composition according
   to the invention compared with a different type of therapy, is proof of the efficacy of a
   pharmaceutical composition in preventing manifest diabetes in women with a history of
   gestational diabetes.
10 Example 12:         Treatment of hyperuricemia
   Patients with elevated levels of uric acid above the normal range (above 8.3 mg/dL or 494
   pmol/L) or patients with a history of gout or gouty arthritis with a uric acid level greater than
   6.0 mg/dL or 357 pmol/L have a significant risk of future episodes of gout or gouty arthritis as
   well as having an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Therapy may be provided with
15 the objective of lowering serum levels of uric acid as a means of preventing future episodes
   or flare-ups of gout or gouty arthritis. Additionally, lowering serum uric acid levels may reduce
   the risk of cardiovascular disease. For this purpose patients with an elevated uric acid level
   or a history of gout or gouty arthritis are treated either with a pharmaceutical composition
   according to the invention or with placebo or with a non-drug therapy or with other
20 medicaments, over a lengthy period (e.g. 6 months to 4 years). During and at the end of the
   treatment a check is carried out by determining the serum uric acid level and the number of
   episodes of gout or gouty arthritis occurences. A reduction in uric acid below 6.0 mg/dL
   and/or fewer episodes of gout or gouty arthritis occurrence when treated with a
   pharmaceutical composition according to the invention compared with a different type of
25 therapy, is proof of the efficacy of a pharmaceutical composition in preventing episodic gout
   or gouty arthritis or treating hyperuricemia.
   In a twelve week study of patients with manifest type 2 diabetes mellitus serum uric acid
   levels were measured at baseline and every 4 weeks in patients randomized to an
   administration of the compound (1.9) of 5mg, 10mg, or 25mg or placebo or metformin
30 2000mg, daily for 12 weeks. When compared to baseline, patients receiving all doses of the
   compound (1.9) had a reduction in their serum uric acid levels of 0.5 to 0.7 mg/dL when
   compared to baseline, while serum uric acid levels increased in patients randomized to either
   metformin or placebo.

   Example 13:        Treatment of hyponatremia
   Patients with hyponatremia and water intoxication whether due to an increase in water
 5 resorption or an increase in water intake, are at risk of central nervous system abnormalities
   and possibly death. Therapy may be provided with the objective of increasing the amount of
   free water to be excreted in the renal filtrate without disturbing sodium balance with the
   objective of increasing the overall sodium concentration of the interstitial fluids. For this
   purpose, patients with a history of hyponatremia are treated either with a pharmaceutical
10 composition according to the invention or with placebo or with a non-drug therapy or with
   other medicaments, over a short period (e.g. 3 to 6 months), with periodic assessment of
   serum sodium levels. An increase in sodium levels into the normal range reported during
   this time period when treated with a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention
   compared with a different type of therapy, is proof of the efficacy of a pharmaceutical
15 composition in treating hyponatremia.
   Example 14:        Treatment/ prevention of kidney stones
   Patients with a history of kidney stones, particularly calcium, mixed calcium, and uric acid
   stones frequently have a history of hyperuricemia. These renal stones may relate to small
20 urate crystals forming a nidus in the renal filtrate upon which further crystalization of urate or
   other crystalizing substances in the solute can induce renal stone formation. These stones
   are not related to renal stones caused by certain kidney infections (such as staghorn - type
   stones). Therapy may be provided with the objective of increasing the neutral solutes (for
   example glucose) and free water content of the renal filtrate, making it difficult for a urate
25 nidus to form, despite a possible increase in the absolute amounts of urate in the renal
   filtrate. These neutral solutes and free water will also reduce the formation of stones other
   than uric acid stones. For this purpose patients with a history of kidney stones particularly
   calcium, mixed calcium, and uric acid stones are treated either with a pharmaceutical
   composition according to the invention or with placebo or with a non-drug therapy or with
30 other medicaments, over a lengthy period (e.g. 6 months to 4 years). A reduction in the
   number of kidney stones stones particularly calcium, mixed calcium, and uric acid stones
   reported during this time period when treated with a pharmaceutical composition according to

                                                 - 50
   the invention compared with a different type of therapy, is proof of the efficacy of a
   pharmaceutical composition in preventing kidney stones particularly calcium, mixed calcium,
   and uric acid stones.
 5 Example 15: Body weight and body fat reduction
   The following example shows the beneficial effect of the compound (1.9) on body weight and
   total body fat content. All experimental procedures concerning the use of laboratory animals
   were carried out under a Home Office Certificate of Designation. An animal model of obesity
   was used to study the effect of the compound (1.9) on body weight and total body fat content.
10 For this, female Wistar rats were made obese by exposure to a simplified cafeteria diet
   containing high fat chow, chocolate and ground peanuts for approximately 24 weeks.
   Following the induction of obesity, rats were given vehicle (0.5% aqueous hydroxyethyl
   cellulose) for 7 days and then dosed orally once daily with either vehicle or 3 mg/kg or 10
   mg/kg compound (1.9) for 28 days. For the duration of the study rats were maintained on the
15 cafeteria diet. Body weight was monitored daily and the final body weight after 28 day
   treatment is given in the Figure 4A. Therein "Cpd A" denotes the glucopyranosyl-substituted
   benzene derivative (1.9) at a dose of 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg. Results are means (adjusted for
   differences between the body weights of the different treatment groups at baseline (Day 1))
   SEM (calculated from the residuals of the statistical model), n = 10. After 28 day daily oral
20 treatment with the compound (1.9) a reduced body weight compared to the vehicle-treated
   control group was observed. Body weight data was analysed by analysis of covariance with
   body weights on Day 1 as covariate. P values versus vehicle control are indicated by
   symbols above the bars (*, p<0.05) Multiple comparisons against the vehicle control group
   were performed by Williams' test for the two freely-feeding "Cpd A" groups. The
25 glucopyranosyl-substituted benzene derivative (1.9) reduced the body weight by 4.1% at 3
   mg/kg and significantly by 6.9% at 10 mg/kg.
   At the end of the study on Day 34 (24 hours after the last treatment on Day 33) all rats were
   terminated, the body exsanguinated and the following tissues removed: the caudate liver
30 lobe, the pancreas, the left kidney and one soleus muscle. Body composition (body fat,
   protein and water) was determined using the FoodScan NIR (near infra-red) meat analyser
   (Foss UK). This machine has AOAC (Association of Official Analytical Chemists) approval as
   reference method for the analysis of moisture, fat and protein in meat. The carcasses were
   milled under liquid nitrogen and a portion of the milled carcass was analysed in the
35 FoodScan Analyser. The results of the determination of body fat content are given in figure
   4B. Therein "Cpd A" denotes the glucopyranosyl-substituted benzene derivative (1.9) at a
   dose of 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg. After 33 day daily oral treatment with the compound (1.9) a

                                                    - 51
   reduced body fat content compared to the control group was observed. Means (n=9-1 0) are
   adjusted for differences between treatment groups in body weight at baseline (Day 1).
   Carcasses from all animals were analysed less terminal bleeds (exsanguination), pancreas
   and caudate lobe of the liver whilst 4-5 animals per group additionally had the left kidney and
 5 one soleus muscle removed. Statistical analysis was by robust regression and included Day
    1 body weight as a covariate. Standard errors of the mean (SEM) are calculated from the
   residuals of the statistical model. Comparisons against the vehicle-treated control group on
   the cafeteria diet were by Williams' tests for the freely feeding "Cpd A" animals (3 mg/kg and
    10 mg/kg). Significant differences are denoted by *p<0.05. The total body fat content
10 (expressed as weight per rat) was significantly lower after treatment with 10 mg/kg of the
   compound (1.9) in comparison to vehicle-treated animals.

 5 Copovidone is dissolved in purified water at ambient temperature to produce a granulation
   liquid. An glucopyranosyl-substituted benzene derivative according to the present invention,
   mannitol, pregelatinized starch and corn starch are blended in a suitable mixer, to produce a
   pre-mix. The pre-mix is moistened with the granulation liquid and subsequently granulated.
   The moist granulate is sieved through a suitable sieve. The granulate is dried at about 60 'C
10 inlet air temperature in a fluid bed dryer until a loss on drying value of 1-4 % is obtained. The
   dried granulate is sieved through a sieve with a mesh size of 1.0 mm.
   Crospovidone is added to the dried granulate and mixed for 5 minutes to produce the main
   blend. Magnesium stearate is passed through a sieve for delumping and added to main
15 blend. Subsequently the final blend is produced by final blending in a suitable blender for
   three minutes and compressed into 8 mm round tablet cores with a compression force of 16
   kN.
   Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide and iron oxide are
