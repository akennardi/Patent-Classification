ABSTRACT
This invention relates to a wing comprising a generally aerofoil (or airfoil) shaped body having a leading
edge, a trailing edge, a span, and first and second major surfaces extending between the leading edge and the
trailing edge, where at least one of said first or second major surfaces comprises cyclic spanwise variations at
or near the leading edge thereof, but not the trailing edge thereof. In preference, the cyclic spanwise
variations extend substantially chordwise from at or near the leading edge, progressively diminishing as they
extend chordwise so as to disappear at or before reaching the trailing edge of the wing.

PRIORITY DOCUMENT
[0001]             The present application claims priority from:
Australian Provisional Patent Application No 2012903527 titled "IMPROVED WING
CONFIGURATION" and filed on 16 August 2012. The content of this application is hereby incorporated
by reference in its entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]             The present invention relates to wings or blades for apparatus which employ these, and of
the type which generally employ an aerofoil (or airfoil) cross-sectional shape. For the purpose of this
specification, the terms "wing" and "blade" can be considered interchangeable.
BACKGROUND
[0003]             Conventional wings of streamlined aerofoil shape have a cross-sectional shape that is
substantially constant across a span of the wing. These conventional wings perform well at low to
moderate angles of attack, but at higher angles of attack (or increased loading) separation and
aerodynamic stall occur.
[0004]             Various attempts have been made to improve, amongst other things, the efficiency and
stall characteristics of wings.
[0005]             Traditional methods employed to improve wing performance include (leading-edge)
slats, (trailing-edge) flaps, strakes and vortex generators. Slats and flaps are devices that are used to
increase wing area and camber (curvature) and are usually deployed by large aircraft during take-off and
landing, and low-speed manoeuvres. Strakes and vortex generators are used to keep the flow attached
over the low-pressure side of the wing, but these generate additional drag on the wing, and so are
generally small in size and hence are of limited benefit at large angles of attack. None of these reduce
induced drag.
[0006]             Previous attempts to improve wing performance by other means can be found in United
States Patent US 6,431,498, which discloses a wing comprising scallops in the leading edge thereof, and
United States Patent US 4,830,315, which discloses an aerofoil-shaped body comprising a relatively thin
trailing edge which incorporates a series of alternating, adjoining, downstream-extending troughs and

                                                         2
ridges which terminate at the trailing edge. It was proposed that such wing modifications would lead to a
reduced pressure at the protrusions, leading to an increase in lift and a reduction in drag, however, their
effectiveness has since been challenged by newer studies.
[0007]            It is against this background and the problems and difficulties associated therewith that
the present invention has been developed.
[0008]            Certain objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the
following description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein, by way of
illustration and example, an embodiment of the present invention is disclosed.
SUMMARY
[0009]            According to a first aspect, there is provided a wing "form" for relative movement with
respect to a fluid, the wing comprising a leading edge, a trailing edge, a span, and means for effecting a
cyclic spanwise variation in a force generated in a sense (direction) substantially perpendicular to a
direction of relative movement.
[0010]            Depending on the application and orientation of the wing, this force may be anyone of
lift, down force, or an otherwise directed driving force resulting in movement of the fluid (as in the case
of a fan, propeller or the like) or movement of the wing (as in the case of a turbine blade or the like). In
one form, the means effects a cyclic variation in the lift per unit span (or wing loading) of the wing.
[0011]            In one form, a lower pressure is created on one side of the wing than on the other, and the
means effects said spanwise variation on the lower pressure side only.
[0012]            In one form, the wing comprises first and second major surfaces extending between the
leading edge and the trailing edge, and said means comprises cyclic spanwise variations of at least one of
said first and second major surfaces.
[0013]            In one form, at least one of said first or second major surfaces comprises cyclic spanwise
variations at or near the leading edge thereof, but not the trailing edge thereof.
[0014]            In one form, the cyclic spanwise variations extend substantially chordwise from at or
near the leading edge, progressively diminishing as they extend chordwise so as to disappear at or before
reaching the trailing edge of the wing.

                                                        3
[0015]           In a further aspect, the invention may be said to reside in a wing "form" for movement
through a fluid, the wing comprising a leading edge, a trailing edge, a span, first and second major
surfaces extending between the leading edge and the trailing edge, where at least one of said first or
second major surfaces comprises cyclic spanwise variations thereof.
[0016]           In one form, one major surface comprises said cyclic spanwise variations thereof, and the
other major surface does not.
[0017]           In one form, both of the first and second major surfaces comprise said cyclic spanwise
variations thereof.
[0018]           In one form, said cyclic spanwise variation form peaks and troughs in the or each surface.
[0019]           In one form, said peaks and troughs extend substantially chordwise.
[0020]           In one form, transition between adjacent peaks and troughs is substantially smooth.
[0021]           In one form, transition between adjacent peaks and troughs is substantially linear.
[0022]           In one form, transition between adjacent peaks and troughs is substantially stepwise.
[0023]           In one form, for a stepwise transition the wing is substantially linear between steps.
[0024]           In one form, all steps are either of steps up or down spanwise. In an alternative, up and
down steps alternate spanwise.
[0025]           In one form, peaks and troughs in each of the first and second major surfaces are
synchronized or in phase with each other.
[0026]           In one form, peaks and troughs in each of the first and second major surfaces are out of
phase with each other.
[0027]           In one form, peaks in one major surface are synchronized or in phase with troughs in the
other major surface.
[0028]           In one form, the cyclic spanwise variations are variations in angle of attack.

                                                       4
[0029]            In one form, the cyclic spanwise variations are variations in maximum wing section
thickness.
[0030]            In one form, the cyclic spanwise variations are variations in camber.
[0031]            In one form, the wing comprises a plurality of wavelengths (ie the distance over which
the wings spanwise form repeats) of spanwise variation.
[0032]            In one form, the wavelength for each spanwise variation is substantially constant. In an
alternative the wavelength for each spanwise variation varies spanwise.
[0033]            In a further aspect, the invention may be said to reside in a wing comprising a generally
aerofoil (or airfoil) shaped body having a leading edge, a trailing edge, a span, and first and second major
surfaces extending between the leading edge and the trailing edge, where at least said leading edge
comprises cyclic spanwise variations thereof, each of which extend substantially chordwise therefrom.
[0034]            In a further aspect, the invention may be said to reside in a wing comprising a first form
comprising a generally aerofoil (or airfoil) shaped body having a leading edge, a trailing edge, a span, and
first and second major surfaces extending between the leading edge and the trailing edge, and a second
form which further comprises cyclic spanwise variations of at least one of said first or second major
surfaces, the wing further comprising means for selectively changing between the first and second forms.
[0035]            In one form, this means for selectively changing between the first and second forms may
include any one or more of shape-memory alloys, pneumatic actuators and/or electro-mechanical
actuators. Another means is by the use of a leading-edge slat which allows the wing to change between
first and second forms when it is deployed.
[0036]            In one form, the wing is swept, in which case, the waves may be aligned with the
direction of flow (which is parallel with the wing's chord in any event), not the leading edge). In an
alternative, the wing is unswept.
[0037]            In one form, the wing is tapered. In an alternative, the wing untapered.

along with accompanying figures that illustrate by way of example the principles of the invention. While

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0078]           Referring now to Figure 1, where there is illustrated a conventional wing, as discussed in
the background of this specification. For reference purposes, the wing span can be seen at S, and the wing
chord can be seen at 'c'.
[0079]           Referring now to Figure 2, where there is illustrated a wing whose leading edge 1 and
trailing edge 2 are relatively straight when viewed in plan (mutually normal to the flow direction and
longitudinal axis of the wing), and both the cross-sectional shape and the local angle of attack of the wing
vary cyclically along the span of the wing (ie spanwise) so that at least one cycle of variation occurs
between the root 3 and the tip 4. This results in the leading edge 1 of the wing rising and falling cyclically
from root 3 to tip 4, such that regions of high angle of attack 6 and regions of low angle of attack 5 are
produced, while the trailing edge 2 is substantially straight.
[0080]           Figures 4 and 4(a) are representative of forward edge and cross-sectional views through
the wing illustrated in Figure 2. It will be apparent from Figure 4(a) in particular, that the above
described cyclic spanwise variations of the wing illustrated in Figures 2, 4 and 4(a) extend substantially
chordwise from at or near the leading edge 1, progressively diminishing as they extend chordwise so as to
disappear at or before reaching the trailing edge 2 of the wing.

                                                        8
[0081]            Referring now to Figure 3, where there is illustrated a wing whose leading edge 1 and
trailing edge 2 are relatively straight when viewed in plan (mutually normal to the flow direction and
longitudinal axis of the wing). In this embodiment the local angle of attack of the wing varies in a step
wise cyclic manner along the span of the wing so that at least one cycle of variation occurs between the
root 3 and the tip 4. This results in the leading edge 1 of the wing rising and falling cyclically but step
wise from root 3 to tip 4, while the trailing edge 2 is substantially straight. Here the steps are formed by
discontinuities in sectional shape occurring at positions (steps) 7, such that regions of high angle of attack
and regions of low angle of attack are produced.
[0082]            Figures 16 and 16(f) are representative of forward edge and cross-sectional views
through the wing illustrated in Figure 3. It will be apparent from Figure 16(f) in particular, that the above
described cyclic spanwise variations of the wing illustrated in Figures 3, 16 and 16(f) extend substantially
chordwise from at or near the leading edge 1, progressively diminishing as they extend chordwise so as to
disappear at or before reaching the trailing edge 2 of the wing.
[0083]            Referring now to Figures 4 through 10, where the spanwise variations in wing shape are
such that each segment of the cycle blends smoothly and progressively (including sinusoidally) into the
next across the span of the wing. For reference purposes, the amplitude of the wing illustrated in Figure 4
is denoted 'A', and the wavelength is denoted 'X'.
[0084]            Referring again to Figures 4 and 4(a), where the cyclic spanwise variations form peaks 6
and troughs 5 in both (ie upper and lower) major surfaces 10 and 12, along with the leading edge 1 (but
not the trailing edge 2), and where peaks 6 in one major surface are synchronized or in phase with troughs
5 in the other major surface.
[0085]            Referring now to Figures 5 and 5(b), wherein the cyclic spanwise variations are lateral
displacements of wing section. These cyclic spanwise variations form peaks 6 and troughs 5 in both (ie
upper and lower) major surfaces 10 and 12 of the wing, along with both the leading and trailing edges 1
and 2 of the wing, where peaks 6 in one major surface are synchronized or in phase with troughs 5 in the
other major surface.
[0086]            Referring now to Figures 6 and 6(c), wherein the cyclic spanwise variations are
symmetrical changes in the cross-sectional thickness of the wing. These cyclic spanwise variations form
pairs of opposing peaks 6 and pairs of opposing troughs 5 in both major surfaces 10 and 12 of the wing,
resulting in a wing section which alternates between thick and thin sections. It will be apparent from
Figure 6(c) in particular, that the above described cyclic spanwise variations of the wing illustrated in

                                                       9
Figures 6 and 6(c) extend substantially chordwise, but disappear at or before reaching the trailing edge 2
of the wing.
[0087]            Referring now to Figures 7 and 7(d) wherein the cyclic spanwise variations are
asymmetric changes in cross-sectional thickness. Here the cyclic spanwise variations form peaks 6 and
troughs 5 in the first (or upper) major surface 10, while the second (or lower) major surface 12
incorporates no such cyclic spanwise variations. It will be apparent from Figure 7(d) in particular, that the
above described cyclic spanwise variations of the wing illustrated in Figures 7 and 7(d) extend
substantially chordwise, but disappear at or before reaching the trailing edge 2 of the wing.
[0088]            Referring now to Figures 8 and 8(e) wherein the cyclic spanwise variations are changes
in section camber. Here the cyclic spanwise variations form peaks 6 and troughs 5 in the first (or upper)
major surface 10 which are more pronounced than the peaks 6 and troughs 5 in the second (or lower)
major surface 12. It will be apparent from Figure 8(e) in particular, that the above described cyclic
spanwise variations of the wing illustrated in Figures 8 and 8(e) extend substantially chordwise, but
disappear at or before reaching the trailing edge 2 of the wing.
[0089]            Referring now to Figures 9 and 9(f), wherein the wing is similar to the wing of Figure 4,
differing in that the wing of Figures 9 and 9(f) further comprises steps 7 in wing section which alternate
between steps up and down spanwise. It will be apparent from Figure 9(f) in particular, that the above
described cyclic spanwise variations of the wing illustrated in Figures 9 and 9(f) extend substantially
chordwise, but disappear at or before reaching the trailing edge 2 of the wing.
[0090]            Referring now to Figures 10 and 10(g), wherein the wing comprises steps 7 in wing
section, and each segment of wing defined between respective steps 7 spanwise is substantially identical
or at least physically similar, and curved in the fashion described above for one half of a wavelength
thereof. It will be apparent from Figure 10(g) in particular, that the above described cyclic spanwise
variations of the wing illustrated in Figures 10 and 10(g) extend substantially chordwise, but disappear at
or before reaching the trailing edge 2 of the wing.
[0091]            Referring now to Figures 11 through 17, where the cyclic spanwise variations in wing
shape are such that each segment of the cycle occurs at an abrupt discontinuity.
[0092]            Referring now to Figures 11 and 11(a), wherein the cyclic spanwise variations are
changes in angle of attack. These cyclic spanwise variations form peaks 6 and troughs 5 in both (ie upper
and lower) major surfaces 10 and 12, along with the leading edge 1 (but not the trailing edge 2), and
where peaks 6 in one major surface are synchronized or in phase with troughs 5 in the other major

                                                      10
surface. It will be apparent from Figure 11(a) in particular, that the above described cyclic spanwise
variations of the wing illustrated in Figures 11 and 11(a) extend substantially chordwise, but disappear at
or before reaching the trailing edge 2 of the wing.
[0093]            Referring now to Figures 12 and 12(b), wherein the cyclic spanwise variations are lateral
displacement of the section. These cyclic spanwise variations form peaks 6 and troughs 5 in both (ie
upper and lower) major surfaces 10 and 12 of the wing, along with the leading and trailing edges 1 and 2
of the wing, where peaks 6 in one major surface are synchronized or in phase with troughs 5 in the other
major surface.
[0094]            Referring now to Figures 13 and 13(c), wherein the cyclic spanwise variations are
symmetrical changes in cross-sectional thickness. These cyclic spanwise variations form opposing peaks
6 and opposing troughs 5 in both major surfaces 10 and 12 of the wing, resulting in a wing section which
alternates between thick and thin sections. It will be apparent from Figure 13(c) in particular, that the
above described cyclic spanwise variations of the wing illustrated in Figures 13 and 13(c) extend
substantially chordwise, but disappear at or before reaching the trailing edge 2 of the wing.
[0095]            Referring now to Figures 14 and 14(d), wherein the cyclic spanwise variations are
asymmetric changes in cross-sectional thickness. Here the cyclic spanwise variations form peaks 6 and
troughs 5 in the first (or upper) major surface 10, while the second (or lower) major surface 12
incorporates no such cyclic spanwise variations. It will be apparent from Figure 14(d) in particular, that
the above described cyclic spanwise variations of the wing illustrated in Figures 14 and 14(d) extend
substantially chordwise, but disappear at or before reaching the trailing edge 2 of the wing.
[0096]            Referring now to Figures 15 and 15(e), wherein the cyclic spanwise variations are
changes in section camber. Here the cyclic spanwise variations form peaks 6 and troughs 5 in the first (or
upper) major surface 10 which are more pronounced than the peaks 6 and troughs 5 in the second (or
lower) major surface 12. It will be apparent from Figure 15(e) in particular, that the above described
cyclic spanwise variations of the wing illustrated in Figures 15 and 15(e) extend substantially chordwise,
but disappear at or before reaching the trailing edge 2 of the wing.
[0097]            Referring now to Figures 16 and 16(f), wherein the cyclic spanwise variations are steps in
wing section, as discussed above.
[0098]            Referring now to Figures 17 and 17(g), wherein the cyclic spanwise variations are steps
in wing section, where the steps alternate between steps up and down spanwise. It will be apparent from
Figure 17(g) in particular, that the above described cyclic spanwise variations of the wing illustrated in

                                                       11
Figures 17 and 17(g) extend substantially chordwise, but disappear at or before reaching the trailing edge
2 of the wing.
[0099]            Referring now to Figure 19, where the wing embodiment illustrated in Figures 4 and 4a,
and described above, is employed in a plurality of blades or vanes 15 for an impeller 13 of the type
commonly used as a fan for cooling personal computers. The impeller 13 comprises a cylindrical hub 14
to which all of the blades 15 are mounted.
[00100]           Referring now to Figure 20, where the wing embodiment illustrated in Figures 11 and
Figure 11(a), and described above, is similarly employed in a plurality of blades or vanes for an impeller.
[00101]           Referring now to Figure 21, where the wing embodiment illustrated in Figures 16 and
Figure 16(f), and described above, is similarly employed in a plurality of blades or vanes for an impeller.
[00102]           For each of the impellers illustrated in Figures 19, 20 and 21, the mean camber line for
each blade 15 is concentric to the hub 14 profile, the leading edge for each blade root is mounted close to
a front face 14a of the hub 14, and the trailing edge for each blade root is mounted close to a rear face 14b
of the hub 14. Each blade root camber line "wraps" the circular hub tangentially and axially.
[00103]           Referring now to Figure 22, where the wing embodiment illustrated in Figures 2 and 4,
and described above, is employed in a plurality of blades or vanes 22 for a centrifugal impeller 20.
[00104]           An advantage of the wings according to the present invention is their suitability for use in
impellers incorporating pressed-metal blades. These blades may be made from flat or cambered thin sheet
metal, and as such they operate efficiently over a relatively narrow range of flow conditions. The
incorporation of waves in the impeller blade according to this invention will broaden the range of
efficient operating conditions of the impellers, reducing their tendency to undergo sudden stall and
decreasing their aerodynamic noise under all operating conditions.
[00105]           Each of the above described wings according to the present invention, produce a cyclic
spanwise variation in pressure distribution (or lift per unit span), which leads to the formation of stream
wise vortices above the wing without significant additional wing surface area or significant spanwise
variation in wing cross sectional shape.
[00106]           These vortices have been shown to increase the momentum exchange between the free
stream and the fluid near the surface of the wing, thereby decreasing the tendency of the wing to stall. In
fact, the streamwise vortices lead to alternating regions of separated and attached flow, thereby spreading

                                                        12
the stall process over a broader range of angles of attack. This leads to a "softer", less sudden stall
characteristic that lends itself to use in devices such as wind turbines and aircraft, where soft stall
characteristics are usually desirable.
[00107]           An additional benefit is that the streamwise vortices decrease the spanwise transport of
fluid near the wing tips, thereby decreasing the size of any separation zone near the wing tip and the
strength of the wing tip vortices, hence induced drag.
[00108]           The effect of the present invention is quantifiable in that the lift (hence the local mean
pressure difference across the wing) is directly proportional to the effective angle of attack of the aerofoil.
During cruise, the angle of attack is typically 3 degrees for modem aircraft. A spanwise cyclic variation
in angle of attack of just +/- 1 degree will lead to an average pressure difference across the wing that
varies by +/- 33% along the span. This is sufficient to generate strong streamwise vortices on the top of
the aerofoil, hence an increased tendency to maintain attached flow, and a reduced tendency to form a
strong wing tip vortex downstream of the wing (hence reduced induced drag).
[00109]           Induced drag is a significant contributor to the aerodynamic drag of aircraft in particular.
The wing tip vortices left behind aircraft, particularly during take-off and landing, are also a significant
danger to aircraft that follow. The presence of these tip vortices limits the time period between
successive take-offs and landings at airports. Elimination of these tip vortices would allow a four-fold
increase (at least) in capacity at large airports, saving billions of dollars per year world-wide.
[00110]           While induced drag is reduced, the maximum lifting force produced by the wing is
increased when compared to conventional wing configurations, so the lift-to-drag ratio is also improved.
[00111]           A further advantage is that the spanwise cyclic variation in sectional shape reduces the
coherence of the velocity fluctuations in the wake of the wing, hence decreasing the acoustic emission
from the flow around the wing. For one embodiment a reduction in tonal noise of up to 32dB and a
decrease in the broadband noise of 8 dB have been measured.
[00112]           In addition to the above, the wing according to the present invention can be configured to
generate a disturbance to the flow only where and when it is needed, that is the upper (low pressure)
major surface. In contradistinction, the wing disclosed in United States Patent US 6,431,498 creates a
disturbance to flow around both the upper and lower sides of the wing disclosed therein.
[00113]           In many of the embodiments discussed herein, the present invention uses variations in
camber and/or angle of attack to perturb the flow. Such perturbations can be expected to produce large

                                                        13
variations in the pressure distribution along the span, so that only a small spanwise geometric variation is
required to produce a large aerodynamic perturbation (the Figures illustrate exaggerated impressions of
the shape variations). By comparison, the leading edge scallops of US 6,431,498 do not (or at least not
significantly) alter the camber or angle of attack - this document discusses only the leading edge sweep.
It is likely that such scallops and/or sweep variations would need to be relatively large in order to produce
a significant effect on the flow.
[00114]            A further difference between the wing according to the present invention and the leading
edge scallops of US 6,431,498 is that the strength of the resultant streamwise vortices will be somewhat
independent of the angle of attack (in the un-stalled flow condition), whereas for the leading edge scallops
of US 6,431,498 the streamwise vortices will be weak at zero angle of attack, and increase in strength as
the angle of attack increases.
[00115]            By comparison, the disclosure of United States Patent US 4,830,315, describes
downstream-extending troughs and ridges that do not extend to the leading edge, and so cannot work as
effectively at large angles of attack because they do not extend far enough towards the leading edge. Also,
in order to generate the desired effect, these features must be significant in size.
[00116]            In addition to its numerous benefits and advantages, the wing according to the present
invention is applicable to a broad range of applications, including but not limited to aircraft and water
craft of any size, wind turbines, racing car wings, submarines, yachts, ships, axial and centrifugal fans,
HVAC turning vanes, gas turbine rotors and stators, surfboards, bicycle frames and components, and
aeronautical applications where short take-off or landing at slower speed is needed. In wind and water
turbines, where the root stall problem is significant, the present invention can reduce the likelihood and
extent of root stall due to turbulent flow conditions and also produce a less sudden, more progressive stall
process, thereby increasing the fatigue life of the blades.
[00117]            Tests on 120mm-diameter axial fan impellers of the type illustrated in Figures 19 through
21, with blade modifications according to the present invention, were performed to determine the effect of
the modifications on the power consumption at a defined rotational speed. It was found that the best
performing embodiment employs the sinusoidally-varying angle of attack of the type illustrated in Figure
2. In fact, all of the impellers of this type out-performed the embodiments with scalloped leading edges
of the type disclosed in US 6,431,498. Moreover, the best of the sinusoidally-varying angle of attack
cases shared the same ratio of amplitude to wavelength ie A/E        = 0.34.

                                                        14
[00118]           Referring now to Figure 18, where there is illustrated a wing wherein the cyclic
variations 5 and 6 can be concealed beneath a leading edge slat 9 during normal operation, and provide
aerodynamic effects only when the leading edge slat 9 is deployed.
[00119]           In non-illustrated alternatives, the spanwise cyclic variation in sectional shape may be
separable from the wing by means of a leading-edge slat. Alternatively, these features may be deployed
by actuators within the wing that distort the wing surface shape to produce the desired wing shape
profiles. Materials such as shape-memory alloys may be used to achieve such an effect. Alternatively,
pockets within the wing surface may be inflated using a fluid such as air, water or oil to achieve such a
change in surface shape. The shape-memory alloy possibility would be ideally suited to small unmanned
air vehicles, as these vehicles are often too small to use retractable slats and flaps.
