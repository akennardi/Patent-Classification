         Figures 1-12 illustrated an illuminated track system 1, with the source of illumination 2
positioned down the center of the track segments 3. Each track segment comprises a floor 4. A
front section 5 is integral and part of floor 4 as is a back section 6. , an underside 7, a top section
8, a first side section 9 and a second side section 10.
         The front section 5 comprises a coupler 11, and a coupler mouth 12, which is attached to
the back section 6. More specifically, each track segment 3 has a front section having a coupler
11 and a back section 6 having a coupler mouth 12. The coupler 11 has a left coupler side 13 and
a right coupler side 14 and the coupler mouth 12 has a left coupler mouth side 15 and a right
coupler mouth side 16. The track segment 3 is made out of plastic, and the various parts are
integral.
         The track segment 3 also has an underside 17. The underside contains 17 a first
conductive contact 18 connecting said left coupler side 13 at the front section 5 of a track
segment 3 to said left coupler mouth side 15 on the same track segment 3. It should be noted that
the underside 17 also contains a second conductive contact 19 connecting said right coupler side
14 at the front section 5 of a track segment 3 to said right coupler mouth side 16 on the same
track segment 3. In one embodiment, the conductive contacts 18, 19 are strips of copper.
                                                    2

        The underside 17 also contains an illumination device 20. In one embodiment, the
illumination device 20 is an LED, with wires 21, 22 touching or connected to first conductive
contact 18 and first conductive contact 19.
        The floor 4 also has a top section 8. In one embodiment, there is an opening for each of
said LEDS to fit in through the top section. More specifically, in one embodiment the top section
8 has a top raised middle section 24 through which there is an opening 25 for the LED 20 to
emerge.
        The coupler and the coupler mouth serve two functions. They allow the track segments 3
to be joined together. Second, they allow the power to pass through the track segments 3.
        The track segment 3 also has a first side wall 26 and a second side wall 27. The first side

section 6 of the second wall 27.
        In an alternative embodiment, the arrangement of the coupling arm 28 and the coupling
pocket 29 can be reversed, so, for example, the first side wall 26 has a first coupling pocket 29
near the front section 5 on the first side wall 26 and a first coupling arm 28 on the first side wall
26 near the back section 6. The same rearrangement can be made for the second side wall.
