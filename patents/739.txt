SURGICAL INSTRUMENT WITH STAMPED DOUBLE-FLAG JAWS
AND ACTUATION MECHANISM
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, the
contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
BACKGROUND
1.      Technical Field
[0002] The present disclosure relates generally to the field of surgical instruments. In particular,
the disclosure relates to an endoscopic electrosurgical forceps that is economical to manufacture
and is capable of sealing and cutting relatively large tissue structures.
2.      Background of Related Art
[0003] Instruments such as electrosurgical forceps are commonly used in open and endoscopic
surgical procedures to coagulate, cauterize and seal tissue. Such forceps typically include a pair
of jaws that can be controlled by a surgeon to grasp targeted tissue, such as, e.g., a blood vessel.
The jaws may be approximated to apply a mechanical clamping force to the tissue, and are
associated with at least one electrode to permit the delivery of electrosurgical energy to the
tissue. The combination of the mechanical clamping force and the electrosurgical energy has
been demonstrated to join adjacent layers of tissue captured between the jaws. When the
adjacent layers of tissue include the walls of a blood vessel, sealing the tissue may result in
hemostasis, which may facilitate the transection of the sealed tissue. A detailed discussion of
the use of an electrosurgical forceps may be found in U.S. Patent No 7,255,697 to Dycus et al.
[0004] A bipolar electrosurgical forceps typically includes opposed electrodes disposed on
clamping faces of the jaws. The electrodes are charged to opposite electrical potentials such that
an electrosurgical current may be selectively transferred through tissue grasped between the
electrodes. To effect a proper seal, particularly in relatively large vessels, two predominant
mechanical parameters must be accurately controlled; the pressure applied to the vessel, and the
gap distance established between the electrodes.

                                                   2
[0005] Both the pressure and gap distance influence the effectiveness of the resultant tissue seal.
If an adequate gap distance is not maintained, there is a possibility that the opposed electrodes
will contact one another, which may cause a short circuit and prevent energy from being
transferred through the tissue. Also, if too low a force is applied the tissue may have a tendency
to move before an adequate seal can be generated. The thickness of a typical effective tissue
seal is optimally between about 0.001 and about 0.006 inches. Below this range, the seal may
shred or tear and above this range the vessel walls may not be effectively joined. Closure
pressures for sealing large tissue structures preferably fall within the range of about 3kg/cm2 to
about 16 kg/cm 2 .
OBJECT
[0006] It is the object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate
one or more of the above disadvantages, or at least provide a useful alternative.

includes a pair of laterally spaced flanges, and wherein each of the flanges includes a camming
surface thereon;
         a knife extending at least partially through the elongated shaft and selectively movable in
a longitudinal direction between the flanges of the jaw members, a blade of the knife extendable
into a tissue contacting portion of the jaw members; and
         a drive rod extending at least partially through the elongated shaft and selectively
movable in a longitudinal direction with respect to the knife and with respect to the elongated
shaft, the drive rod carrying a cam pin positioned to engage the camming surface of each of the

                                                   4
drive rod substantially surrounding the knife on four lateral sides to restrict motion of the knife
in at least two orthogonal planes.
[0011] There is also disclosed herein a surgical instrument for treating tissue that is economical
to manufacture and is capable of sealing and cutting relatively large tissue structures. The
surgical instrument includes a housing and an elongated shaft extending distally therefrom. The
elongated shaft includes a proximal portion coupled to the housing and a distal portion opposite
the proximal portion, and defines a longitudinal axis. A drive rod extends at least partially
through the elongated shaft, and is selectively movable in a longitudinal direction with respect to
the elongated shaft. A cam pin is supported by the drive rod such that longitudinal movement of
the drive rod is imparted to the cam pin. An end effector is supported by the distal portion of the
elongated shaft, and is adapted for treating tissue. The end effector includes an upper jaw
member pivotally coupled to the distal portion of the elongated shaft about a pivot axis, and the
upper jaw member includes a first pair of laterally spaced flanges each defining a camming slot
for engaging the cam pin. The end effector also includes a lower jaw member pivotally coupled
to the distal portion of the elongated shaft about the pivot axis, and the lower jaw member
includes a second pair of laterally spaced flanges each defining a camming slot for engaging the
cam pin. The first and second pairs of flanges of the jaw members are arranged in an offset
configuration such that one flange of the upper jaw member is positioned on a laterally exterior
side of a corresponding flange of the lower jaw member, and the other flange of the upper jaw
member is positioned on a laterally interior side of the other flange of the lower jaw member.
[0012] The upper and lower jaw members may be constructed as substantially identical
components positioned in a laterally offset manner with respect to one another. Each of the
flanges may extend proximally from a tissue engaging portion of the jaw members, and the
tissue engaging portions may be substantially curved. The pivot axis may extends through each
of the flanges in a direction substantially transverse to the longitudinal axis.
[0013] The drive rod may extend through the jaw members on a laterally interior side of each of
the flanges, and the drive rod may exhibit a generally u-shaped profile. The surgical instrument
may further include a knife selectively movable in a longitudinal direction with respect to the
drive rod, and the knife may be supported within the u-shaped profile such that the drive rod
provides restricts lateral movement of the knife in a first lateral plane. The drive rod may also
include an overfold disposed opposite a u-shaped connector portion of the drive rod such that

                                                    5
the knife is substantially surrounded on four lateral sides, and such that the overfold and the u
shaped connector portion restrict movement of the knife in a second lateral plane that is
orthogonal to the first lateral plane.
[0014] The jaw member may be adapted for electrosurgically treating tissue and may include
electrical wires extending proximally therefrom for facilitating connection of the respective jaw
members to a source of electrosurgical energy. At least one of the flanges of each of the jaw
members may include an electrically isolative wire guide disposed on a lateral side thereof,
wherein the electrical wire of the respective jaw member extends through the wire guide. The
wire guides may be constructed of an electrically isolative plastic molded onto the respective
flanges.
[0015] There is also disclosed herein a surgical instrument including a housing and an elongated
shaft extending therefrom. The elongated shaft includes a proximal portion coupled to the
housing and a distal portion opposite the proximal portion and defining a longitudinal axis. An
end effector is supported by the distal portion of the elongated shaft. The end effector is adapted
for treating tissue and includes first and second jaw members pivotally coupled to one another to
move between open and closed configurations. Each of the jaw members includes a pair of
laterally spaced flanges, and each of the flanges includes a camming surface thereon. A knife
extends at least partially through the elongated shaft and is selectively movable in a longitudinal
direction between the flanges of the jaw members. A blade of the knife is extendable into a
tissue contacting portion of the jaw members. A drive rod extends at least partially through the
elongated shaft and is selectively movable in a longitudinal direction with respect to the knife
and with respect to the elongated shaft in response to manipulation of the housing. The drive
rod carries a cam pin positioned to engage the camming surface of each of the flanges to induce
the jaw members to move between the open and closed configurations. The drive rod
substantially surrounds the knife on four lateral sides to restrict motion of the knife in at least
two orthogonal planes.
[0016] The laterally spaced flanges of the jaw members may be arranged in a nestled
configuration wherein both of the flanges of one of the jaw members are arranged within a
laterally interior side of the laterally spaced flanges of the other of the jaw members. The knife
may be constructed of a substantially flat piece of metal, and the drive rod may be constructed
of metal folded to exhibit a generally u-shaped profile extending around the four lateral sides of

                                                 6
the knife. A distal-most end of the drive rod may extend around the four lateral sides of the
knife and a proximal portion of the drive rod may extend around fewer than four lateral sides of
the knife.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0051] The present disclosure relates to an electrosurgical apparatus and methods for
performing electrosurgical procedures. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to
electrosurgically sealing tissue. As is traditional, the term "distal" refers herein to an end of the
apparatus that is farther from an operator, and the term "proximal" refers herein to the end of the
forceps 10 which is closer to the operator.
[0052] Referring initially to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an electrosurgical forceps 10 generally
includes a housing 12 that supports various actuators thereon for remotely controlling an end
effector 14 through an elongated shaft 16. Although this configuration is typically associated
with instruments for use in laparoscopic or endoscopic surgical procedures, various aspects of
the present disclosure may be practiced with traditional open instruments and in connection with
endoluminal procedures as well.
[0053] The housing 12 is constructed of a left housing half 12a and a right housing half 12b.
The left and right designation of the housing halves 12a, 12b refer to the respective directions as
perceived by an operator using the forceps 10. The housing halves 12a, 12b may be constructed

                                                  10
of sturdy plastic, and may be joined to one another by adhesives, ultrasonic welding or other
suitable assembly methods.
 [0054] To mechanically control the end effector 14, the housing 12 supports a stationary handle
20, a movable handle 22, a trigger 26 and rotation knob 28. The movable handle 22 is operable
to move the end effector 14 between an open configuration (FIG. 2A) wherein a pair of opposed
jaw members 30, 32 are disposed in spaced relation relative to one another, and a closed or
clamping configuration (FIG. 2B) wherein the jaw members 30, 32 are closer together.
Approximation of the movable handle 22 with the stationary handle 20 serves to move the end
effector 14 to the closed configuration and separation of the movable handle 22 from the
stationary handle 20 serves to move the end effector 14 open configuration. The trigger 26 is
operable to extend and retract a knife blade 56 (see FIG. 2A) through the end effector 14 when
the end effector 14 is in the closed configuration. The rotation knob 28 serves to rotate the
elongated shaft 16 and the end effector 14 about a longitudinal axis A-A extending through the
forceps.
 [0055] To electrically control the end effector 14, the housing 12 supports a switch 36 thereon,
which is operable by the user to initiate and terminate the delivery of electrosurgical energy to
the end effector 14. The switch 36 is in electrical communication with a source of
electrosurgical energy such as electrosurgical generator 40. The generator 40 may include
devices such as the LIGASURE* Vessel Sealing Generator and the Force Triad* Generator as
sold by Covidien. A cable 42 extends between the housing 12 and the generator 40 and may
include a connector (not shown) thereon such that the forceps 10 may be selectively coupled and
decoupled electrically from the generator 40. In other embodiments (not shown) a battery
powered instrument may be provided in which a generator and connector may be internal or
integral to the instrument.
 [0056] Referring now to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the end effector 14 may be moved from the open
configuration (FIG. 2A) wherein tissue (not shown) may be received between the jaw members
30, 32, and the closed configuration (FIG. 2B), wherein the tissue may be clamped and sealed.
Upper jaw member 30 and lower jaw member 32 are mechanically coupled to the elongated
shaft 16 about a pivot pin 44. The upper jaw member 30 is electrically coupled to cable 42, and
thus to the generator 40, (see FIG. 1) through a wire 46b extending through the elongated shaft
 16. The lower jaw member 32 is also coupled to the generator 40 by another wire 46a (FIG. 4)

                                                   11
extending through the elongated shaft 16. The wires 46a, 46b provide an electrical pathway to a
pair of electrically conductive, tissue-engaging sealing plates 48, 50 disposed on the lower and
upper jaw members 32, 30, respectively. The sealing plate 48 of the lower jaw member 32
opposes a sealing plate 50 of the upper jaw member 30, and, in some embodiments, the sealing
plates 48 and 50 are electrically coupled to opposite terminals, e.g., positive or active (+) and
negative or return (-) terminals associated with the generator 40. Thus, bipolar energy may be
provided through the end effector 14. Alternatively, the end effector 14 may be configured for
delivering monopolar energy to the tissue. In a monopolar configuration, the end effector 14
delivers electrosurgical energy from an active terminal, e.g. (+), while a return pad (not shown)
is placed generally on a patient and provides a return path to the opposite terminal, e.g. (-), of
the generator 40.
[0057] The jaw members 30, 32 may be pivoted about the pivot pin 44 to move the end effector
14 to the closed configuration of FIG. 2B wherein the sealing plates 48, 50 provide a pressure to
the tissue grasped therebetween. In some embodiments, to provide an effective seal, a pressure
within a range between about 3 kg/cm 2 to about 16 kg/cm 2 and, desirably, within a working
range of 7 kg/cm 2 to 13 kg/cm 2 may be applied to the tissue. Also, in the closed configuration, a
separation or gap distance "G" may be maintained between the sealing plates 48, 50 by an array
of stop members 54 disposed on or adjacent the sealing plates 48, 50. The stop members 54
contact opposing surfaces on the opposing jaw member 30, 32 and prohibit further
approximation of the sealing plates 48, 50. In some embodiments, to provide an effective tissue
seal, an appropriate gap distance of about 0.001 inches to about 0.006 inches and, desirably,
between about 0.002 and about 0.005 inches may be provided. In some embodiments, the stop
members 54 are constructed of an electrically non-conductive plastic or other material molded
onto the jaw members 30, 32, e.g., by a process such as overmolding or injection molding. In
other embodiments, the stop members 54 are constructed of a heat-resistant ceramic deposited
onto the jaw members 30, 32. Other methods of controlling gap are contemplated including
those described in the commonly assigned patent application entitled GAP CONTROL VIA
OVERMOLD TEETH AND HARD STOPS (Application No. 13/835,004).
[0058] Electrosurgical energy may be delivered to the tissue through the electrically conductive
seal plates 48, 50 to effect a tissue seal. Once a tissue seal is established, a knife blade 56 may
be advanced through a knife channel 58 defined in the jaw members 30, 32 to transect the sealed
tissue. Knife blade 56 is depicted in FIG. 2A as extending from the elongated shaft 16 when the

                                                   12
end effector 14 is in an open configuration. In some embodiments, a knife lockout is provided
to prevent extension of the knife blade 56 into the knife channel 58 when the end effector 14 is
in the open configuration, thus preventing accidental or premature transection of tissue.
 [0059] Referring now to FIG. 3, the elongated shaft 16 includes various longitudinal
components that operatively couple the end effector 14 to the various actuators supported by the
housing 12 (FIG. 1). An outer shaft member 60 defines an exterior surface of the elongated
shaft 16 and supports movement of other components therethrough as described below. The
outer shaft member 60 may be constructed from a flat stock piece of metal. In constructing the
outer shaft member 60, a stamping, punching or similar metal-working process may be
employed to initially generate a flat blank that includes an appropriate outer profile and any
interior openings or features. Thereafter, the necessary folds, bends and curves, etc., may be
formed by bending the flat blank with a press brake, or other suitable metal-working equipment.
In some instances, folds, bends and curves may be formed in metal components simultaneously
with the outer profile and interior openings, or with the same equipment employed for forming
the outer profile and interior openings. Thus, a reference to a stamping process may be
understood to include the formation of a flat profile, as well as imparting any curves, rolls or
bends, etc., to the relevant component. The outer shaft member 60 may be formed by folding
the flat blank into a generally rectangular profile such that two opposing longitudinal edges of
the flat blank meet at a longitudinal seam 62 (see FIG. 4). The longitudinal seam 62 may be
joined by laser welding (or other suitable processes) the two opposing longitudinal edges
together to form a continuous rectangular profile. The seam 62 may be generally straight as
depicted, or alternatively, a box joint, a dovetail joint or other interfaces known in the metal
working arts may be defined along the seam 62.
 [0060] The outer shaft member 60 defines a clevis 64 at a distal end thereof for receiving the
jaw members 30 and 32. Opposing vertical sidewalls 64a and 64b of the outer shaft member 60
extend distally of horizontal walls 64c and 64d and include respective bores 66a, 66b extending
therethrough. The bores 66a, 66b frictionally support the pivot pin 44 and maintain an
orientation of the pivot pin 44 with respect to the outer shaft member 60. Alternatively or
additionally, the pivot pin 44 may be fastened to the outer shaft member 60 by laser or heat
based welding, adhesives, chemical bonding, or other suitable processes.

                                                 13
 [0061] At a proximal end of the outer shaft member 60, a pair of tabs 66c (only one visible in
FIG. 3) are provided to couple the outer shaft member 60 to the rotation knob 28. The
connection established between the outer shaft member 60 and the rotation knob is described
below with reference to FIGS. 5 and 6.
 [0062] The pivot pin 44 extends through a proximal portion of each of the jaw members 30, 32
to pivotally support the jaw members 30, 32 at the distal end of the outer shaft member 60. As
described in greater detail below with reference to FIG. 12, a proximal portion of each of the
jaw members 30, 32 is configured as a "double flag" (alternately referred to as a "double
 flange"). The double flag configuration refers to the two laterally spaced parallel flanges or
"flags" 30a, 30b and 32a, 32b respectively, extending proximally from a distal portion of the
jaw members 30 and 32. A lateral cam slot 30c and a lateral pivot bore 30d extend through each
of the flags 30a, 30b of the upper jaw member 30. Similarly, a lateral cam slot 32c and a lateral
pivot bore 32d extend through each of the flags 32a, 32b of the lower jaw member 32. The
pivot bores 30d, 32d receive the pivot pin 44 in a slip-fit relation that permits the jaw members
30, 32 to pivot about the pivot pin 44 to move the end effector 14 between the open and closed
configurations (FIGS. 2A and 2B respectively).
 [0063] A distal portion of each of the jaw members 30, 32 extends distally of the outer shaft
member 60. The distal portion of each of the jaw members 30, 32 may be curved to facilitate
manipulation of tissue and to provide better "line of sight" for accessing organs and large tissue
structures. As depicted in FIG. 3, the jaw members 30, 32 curve to the left from the perspective
of a user. As described in greater detail below with reference to FIG. 8, for example, the end
effector 14 may be rotated about the longitudinal axis A-A such that the jaw members 30, 32
curve to the right. In some alternative embodiments, as described below with reference to FIG.
28, for example, and end effector 220 may be rotated to a stable orientation where jaw members
222, 224 curve in an upward direction.
 [0064] A pair of wire guides 68 are provided to protect the wires 46a, 46b (FIG. 4) The wire
guides 68 are positioned adjacent interior surfaces of the opposing vertical sidewalls 64a and
64b of the outer shaft member 60. Adhesives, screws or similar fastening mechanisms may be
employed to affix the wire guides 68 such that position of the wire guides 68 may be
maintained. In some alternative embodiments, as described below with reference to FIG. 23,

                                                 14
wire guides 68 may be eliminated and structures may be incorporated into nearby components
which may serve as wire guides.
[0065] The wire guides 68 are generally flat and may be constructed of metal, a lubricious
plastic such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or similar material. The wire guides 68 may thus
provide a bearing surface for the exterior surfaces of flags 32a and 32b of the lower jaw member
32 as the jaw members 30, 32 pivot about the pivot pin 44. The wire guides 68 include a
longitudinal passageway 70 through which a respective one of the wires 46a, 46b (FIG. 4) may
extend to connect the sealing plates 48, 50 (FIG. 2A) to the electrosurgical generator 40 (FIG.
1). The passageways 70 maintain the wires against the sidewalls 64a, 64b of the clevis 64 to
discourage entanglement of the wires due to motion of the various components within the
elongated shaft 16. A distal flare 72 is provided in the passageways 70 to provide clearance for
the wires to move with the jaw members 30, 32 as the jaw members 30, 32 pivot. Holes 74 are
provided in the wire guides 68 to permit passage of the pivot pin 44 therethrough, and slots 76
are provided to guide motion of a cam pin 92 as described below with continued reference to
FIG. 3. The slots 76 are optional and may be excluded from the wire guides 68 in some
alternative embodiments where the cam pin 92 is sufficiently short. The holes 74 and the slots
76 are disposed on a central axis of the wire guides 68, and thus, two identical wire guides 68,
oriented oppositely, may provide proper alignment with the holes 66a and 66b on outer shaft
member 60.
[0066] A pair of wire conduits 78a and 78b may be provided to guide wires 46a and 46b (FIG.
4) proximally of the wire guides 68. The wire conduits 78a, 78b may be constructed of a plastic
tube, and serve to protect the wires 46a, 46b from sharp edges that may form on surrounding
components. The wire conduits 78a, 78b may also provides some rigidity to facilitate feeding
the wires 46a, 46b into position during assembly.
[0067] A jaw drive rod 80 is received within the outer shaft member 60 and is configured for
longitudinal motion with respect to the outer shaft member 60. The jaw drive rod 80 is
constructed from a flat, metal stock piece, and may be formed by a stamping process similar to
the formation of the outer shaft member 60 as described above. The jaw drive rod 80 generally
exhibits a U-shaped profile including sidewalls 82a, 82b and a u-shaped connector portion 82c.
Horizontal flanges 84a and 84b protrude laterally from the respective sidewalls 82b and 82a and
laterally support the jaw drive rod within the outer shaft member 60. A distal portion 86 of the

                                                   15
jaw drive rod 80 is configured for receipt within the outer shaft member 60 and includes features
for operatively coupling the jaw drive rod 80 to the end effector 14. A proximal portion 88 of
the jaw drive rod 80 is configured for receipt within the housing 12 (FIG. 1), and includes
features for operatively coupling the jaw drive rod 80 to the actuators supported thereon, e.g. the
movable handle 22.
 [0068] The distal portion 86 of the jaw drive rod 80 includes a round hole 90 extending through
the sidewalls 82a, 82b for receiving the cam pin 92. The cam pin 92 may be friction fit, welded
or otherwise fastened within the hole 90 such that the cam pin 92 is fixedly coupled to the jaw
drive rod 80 and protrudes laterally from each of the sidewalls 82a and 82b. Distally of the hole
90, a longitudinal slot 96 is defined through the sidewalls 82a, 82b. The longitudinal slot 96
provides clearance for the pivot pin 44, and thus, permits longitudinal reciprocation of the jaw
drive rod 80 independent of the pivot pin 44.
 [0069] An overfold 98 is defined in the vicinity of the hole 90 and the slot 96. A portion of the
sidewall 82b is folded toward the opposing sidewall 82a such that a portion of the jaw drive rod
 80 exhibits a generally closed profile in the vicinity of the overfold 98. As described in greater
detail below with reference to FIG. 4, the overfold 98 permits the jaw drive rod 80 to serve as a
knife guide to guide the motion of a knife 102.
 [0070] The proximal portion 88 of the jaw drive rod 80 includes a set of laterally protruding
collar stops 88a, 88b and 88c, and a pair of laterally protruding spring stops 88d, 88e. The
collar stops 88a, 88b, 88c engage a drive collar 184, and the spring stops 88d, 88e engage a
spring keeper 192, which, as described below with reference to FIG. 18, cooperate to
operatively couple the jaw drive shaft 80 to the movable handle 22.
 [0071] The knife 102 is a generally flat, metal component defining a profile that may be
constructed by a stamping process as described above. The knife 102 supports the sharpened
knife blade 56 at a distal-most end thereof. The sharp edge of the knife blade 56 may be applied
to the distal end of the knife 102 subsequent to the stamping process that forms the profile. For
example, various manufacturing techniques may be employed such as grinding, coining,
electrochemical etching or other suitable manufacturing processes for forming sharpened edges.
A longitudinal slot 106 is defined with the knife 102 to provide clearance for the pivot pin 44
and the cam pin 92. Proximal tabs 108a, 108b protrude from the knife 102 and provide a

                                                  16
mechanism for operatively coupling the knife 102 to the trigger 26. The connection between the
knife 102 and the trigger 26 is described in detail below with reference to FIGS. 19 and 20.
[0072] Referring now to FIG. 4, the various components of the elongated shaft 16 are depicted
assembled to one another and to the upper and lower jaw members 30, 32. The outer shaft
member 60 is secured to the rotation knob 28 by the engagement of the tabs 66c on the outer
shaft member 60 with the rotation knob 28 (see also, FIG. 6). The jaw drive rod 80 is positioned
within the outer shaft member 60 such that the horizontal flanges 84a and 84b of the jaw drive
rod 80 abut the sidewalls 64a and 64b of the outer shaft member 60. The wire guides 68 are
positioned between the sidewalls 64a and 64b of the outer shaft member 60 and the flags 32a,
32b of the lower jaw member 32, thus, providing lateral support to the lower jaw member 32.
The flags 30a, 30b of the upper jaw member 30 are disposed laterally within the flags 32a, 32b
of the of the lower jaw member 32. This arrangement of flags 30a, 30b laterally within the flags
32a, 32b may be described as a "nestled" arrangement. Other arrangements are contemplated
such as the "offset" arrangement described below with reference to FIG. 15.
[0073] The knife 102 is centrally disposed within the jaw drive shaft 80. The sidewalls 82a, 82b
of the jaw drive shaft 80 provide lateral support to the knife 102, and vertical support is
provided by the u-shaped connector portion 82c and the over-fold 98. The knife 102 is
substantially surrounded at its distal end by the jaw drive shaft 80 on four lateral sides, and by
substantially surrounding the knife 102 at its distal end, the jaw drive shaft 80 constrains the
motion of the knife 102 in the four lateral directions. Free motion of the knife 102 is permitted
only in a longitudinal direction. Thus, the jaw drive shaft 80 serves as a knife guide by urging
the knife 102 into a central position within the elongated shaft 16, and thus ensuring proper
alignment of the knife 102 as the knife 102 reciprocates within knife channel 58 (FIG. 2A). By
substantially surrounding the knife 102 at its distal end, the jaw drive rod 80 restricts movement
of the knife 102 in two orthogonal lateral planes, e.g. a vertical and a horizontal plane. The jaw
drive rod 80 may also serve to protect the knife 102 and other components from damage
throughout the assembly of the elongated shaft 16 and jaw members 30, 32.
[0074] Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, the rotation knob 28 is configured as a single
component. In some alternative embodiments, as described below with reference to FIG 25, for
example, a rotation knob 260 may be provided that is constructed of multiple components
affixed to one another. The rotation knob 28 includes a distal opening 112 defined therein for

                                                  17
receiving the outer shaft member 60. The distal opening 112 is bounded by lateral walls 1 12a,
1 12b, 1 12c and 1 12d, which define a generally rectangular profile corresponding to the
rectangular profile of the outer shaft member 60. The distal opening 112 includes an interior
landing 114 for seating a proximal-most surface of the outer shaft member 60 and two lateral
latch pockets 116 for receiving the tabs 66c of the outer shaft member 60. The tabs 66c are
flexible and project laterally outward in a distal direction such that the insertion of the proximal
end of the outer shaft member 60 onto the distal opening 112 of the rotation knob 28 induces the
tabs to flex inwardly momentarily as the tabs 66c engage lateral walls 112a, 112b, and then
return to the outwardly projecting orientation inside the latch pockets 116. The tabs 66c thus
lock the outer shaft member 60 to the rotation knob 28. Due to the rectangular profile of the
outer shaft member 60 and the opening 112, rotational motion imparted to the rotation knob 28
about the longitudinal axis A-A (FIG. 1) is transferred to the outer shaft member 60.
[0075] A passageway 120 is defined through the rotation knob 28 to permit longitudinal motion
of the jaw drive shaft 80 (FIG. 3) therethrough. The passageway 120 is shaped such that
rotational motion imparted to the rotation knob 28 is transferred to the jaw drive shaft 80. In
one embodiment, a cable clearance passageway 122 is also defined through rotation knob 28 to
permit passage of electrical cables (e.g., 46a, 46b, FIG. 4) that electrically couple the sealing
plates 48, 50 (FIG. 2A) to the electrosurgical generator 40 (FIG. 1). Rotational motion imparted
to the rotation knob 28 may thus impart rotational motion to each of the components of the
elongated shaft 16, and to the end effector 14, which is coupled thereto.
[0076] Referring now to FIGS. 7 and 8, a proximal end of the rotation knob 28 is configured to
engage the housing 12. A circular groove 124 is defined around a circular boss 126 projecting
proximally from the rotation knob 28. The circular groove 124 receives an inwardly projecting
wall (not visible) of the housing 12 to maintain the rotation knob 28 against the distal end of the
housing 12. The circular groove 124 guides the rotational motion of the rotation knob 28 about
the longitudinal axis A-A (FIG. 1).
[0077] The rotational motion of the rotation knob 28 may be limited by a stop boss 130
projecting distally from the housing 12. The stop boss 130 is positioned to engage rotation stops
134 on the rotation knob 28 to prevent rotational motion of the rotation knob further than, for
example, 180 degrees in either direction. Detents 136 project proximally from the rotation knob
28 to engage a distal surface of the stop boss 130 prior to the stop boss 130 engaging the

                                                  18
rotation stops. When the rotation knob 28 is rotated to a position wherein the stop boss 130 is
positioned between a rotation stop 134 and a detent 136, the rotational position of the rotation
knob 28 is relatively stable, and may be releasably maintained until a sufficient force is supplied
to move the detents 136 over the stop boss 130. Two radially opposite positions are defined
wherein the rotational position of the rotation knob 28 is relatively stable. These two radially
opposite positions correspond with two orientations of the end effector 14 (FIG. 1) in which the
jaw members 30, 32 curve to the right and to the left from the perspective of a user.
 [0078] Referring now to FIG. 9, the end effector 14 is coupled to the distal end of the elongated
shaft 16 by the pivot pin 44. The pivot pin 44 is coupled to the sidewalls 64a and 64b of the
clevis 64 defined at the distal end of the outer shaft member 60. Thus, the pivot pin 44
represents a longitudinally stationary reference for the longitudinal movements of jaw drive rod
 80 and the knife 102. Laterally inward of the sidewalls 64a, 64b, the pivot pin 44 extends
through the wire guides 68, the flags 32a, 32b of the lower jaw member 32, the flags 30a and
30b of the upper jaw member 30, the sidewalls 82a, 82b of the jaw drive shaft 80, and the knife
 102. The jaw members 30, 32 are free to pivot about the pivot pin 44, and the jaw actuation
shaft 80 and the knife 102 are free to translate longitudinally around the pivot pin 44.
 [0079] Referring now to FIG. 10, the jaw drive rod is 80 is disposed in a distal position
maintaining the end effector 14 in the open configuration. Since the jaw drive rod 80 is coupled
to the cam pin 92, when the jaw drive rod 80 is in the distal position, the cam pin 92 is located in
a distal position in cam slots 30c and 32c defined through the flags 30a, 30b, 23a, 32b of the jaw
members 30, 32. Also, when the jaw drive rod 80 is in the distal position, a distal-most face 86a
of the jaw drive rod 80 extends to a tissue receiving region 14a of the end effector 14. Thus, the
jaw drive rod 80 provides a stop to prevent the entry of tissue into the elongated shaft 16.
 [0080] The jaw drive rod 80 may be drawn proximally relative to the pivot pin 44 (the
stationary longitudinal reference) to move the end effector 14 to the closed configuration (see
FIG. 2B). Since the longitudinal position of the pivot pin 44 is fixed (by the outer shaft member
60, which is removed from view in FIG. 10 for clarity), and since the cam slots 30c, 32c are
obliquely arranged with respect to the longitudinal axis A-A, proximal retraction of the cam pin
92 through the cam slots 30c, 32c induces the jaw members 30, 32 to pivot toward one another
about the pivot pin 44. Conversely, when the end effector 14 is in the closed configuration,

                                                  19
longitudinal translation of the jaw drive rod 80 in a distal direction induces the jaw members 30,
32 to pivot away from one another toward the open configuration.
 [0081] Referring now to FIG. 11, when the end effector 14 is in the closed configuration, the
knife 102 is freely movable in a longitudinal direction within the jaw drive shaft 80. The slot
 106 in the knife 102 extends around the both the pivot pin 44 and the cam pin 92, and thus the
pins 44, 92 do not interfere with the reciprocal motion of the knife 102. The blade 56 at the
distal-most end of the knife 102 is centrally aligned by the distal-most end of the jaw drive rod
 80 that includes the fold-over 98. Properly aligned, the blade 104 readily enters the knife
channel 58 defined in the jaw members 30, 32. The portion of the knife 102 extending distally
from the jaw drive rod 80 is free to bend and, thus, the blade 104 follows the curvature of the
knife channel 58 through the jaw members 30, 32 as the knife 102 reciprocates longitudinally.
 [0082] Referring now to FIGS. 12 and 13, the lower jaw member 32 is constructed of three
major components. These components include a double-flag jaw insert 140, an insulator 142
and the sealing plate 48. In some alternative embodiments, as described below with reference to
FIG. 22, for example, a jaw member 224 may be provided that is constructed of major
components arranged to provide unique advantages.
 [0083] The flags 32a, 32b of the jaw member 32 define a proximal portion of the double-flag
jaw insert 140, and a generally u-shaped channel 144 extends distally to support the tissue
engaging portion of the jaw member 32. The double-flag jaw insert 140 includes various planar
surfaces, and may be constructed as a sheet metal component formed by a stamping process as
described above. In such a stamping process, the cam slots 32c and pivot holes 32d may be
punched into a flat blank, and subsequently the blank may be bent to form the flags 32a, 32b and
the u-shaped channel 144. A lateral bend may also be applied to the jaw insert 140 to
accommodate the curvature of the jaw member 32.
 [0084] The insulator 142 may be constructed of an electrically isolative plastic such as a
polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), or a blend (PC/ABS) thereof. The
electrically isolative plastic may be overmolded onto the jaw insert 140 in a single-shot injection
molding process. Various features may be molded into the insulator 142 that facilitate the
attachment of the sealing plate 48 to the insert 140. For example, tabs may be provided that
permit a snap-fit attachment of the sealing plate 48, or ridges may formed that permit ultrasonic

                                                  20
welding of the sealing plate onto the insulator 142. The sealing plate 50 may be constructed of
an electrically conductive metal, and may be stamped from a flat sheet stock.
[0085] Referring now to FIG. 14, the flags 30a, 30b of the upper jaw member 30 are depicted
schematically in a nestled configuration with respect to the flags 32a, 32b of the lower jaw
member 32. A. The proximal portion of the upper jaw member 30 is narrower than the
proximal portion of the lower jaw member 32, and thus, a lateral spacing "S" between the flags
32a, 32b is sufficient to permit the flags 30a and 30b to be positioned therebetween. A pivot
axis "P0" extends through an overlapping portion of the flags 30a, 32a, and 30b, 32a such that
the upper and lower jaw members 30, 32 may pivot about the common axis "PO." In the nestled
configuration, the proximal portions of the upper and lower jaw members 30, 32 also share a
common centerline "CL - 1" that is transverse with respect to the pivot axis "PO."
[0086] An alternative to the nestled configuration illustrated in FIG. 14 is the offset
configuration illustrated schematically in FIG. 15. A proximal portion of double-flag upper jaw
member 150 includes flags 150a and 15Ob. A proximal portion of a double-flag lower jaw
member 152 includes flags 152a and 152b and exhibits a width that is identical to a width of the
proximal portion of the upper jaw member 150. To provide an overlapping portion of the flags
150a, 152a and 150b, 152b such that the jaw members 150, 152 may pivot about the common
axis "PO," one flag 150a of the upper jaw member 150 is positioned on a laterally exterior side
of the corresponding flag 152a of the lower jaw member 152, and the other flag 150b of the
upper jaw member 150 is positioned on a laterally interior side of the corresponding flag 152b
of the lower jaw member 152. In the offset configuration, a centerline "CL - 2" of the proximal
portion of the upper jaw member 150 is laterally offset with respect to a centerline "CL - 3" of
the lower jaw member 152.
[0087] In embodiments where a distal, tissue engaging portion (depicted in phantom) of the jaw
members 150, 152 is generally straight, e.g., without the lateral curve of jaw members 30, 32
(see, e.g., FIG. 2B), the offset configuration permits the jaws 150 and 152 to be constructed as
substantially identical components. The straight distal portions of the jaw members 150, 152
may be aligned along a common centerline "CL-4" although proximal portions of the jaw
members 150, 152 are aligned along their respective centerlines "CL - 2" and "CL - 3."
Generally, a forceps with identically configured jaw members 150, 152 may be relatively
economical to produce.

                                                 21
 [0088] Referring now to FIG. 16, an alternate embodiment of an actuation mechanism 160 is
depicted. The actuation mechanism 160 employs a pair of stamped lever links 162, 164 for
opening and closing a pair of jaw members 166, 168. An upper jaw member 166 includes a
proximal flange 166a pivotally coupled to a lower lever link 162 about pivot axis "Pl." A lower
jaw member 168 includes proximal flanges 168a pivotally coupled to an upper lever link 164
about pivot axis "P2." Each of the proximal flanges 166a and 168a may also be constructed as
stamped metal components as described above. The lever links 162, 164 are pivotally coupled
to a reciprocating drive rod 170 about respective pivot axes "P3" and "P4" and each of the
proximal flanges 166a, 168a is pivotally coupled about a pivot pin 172, which is arranged about
a pivot axis "P5." The pivot pin 172 is coupled to an outer shaft member (not shown), and thus
represents a fixed reference for the motion of the motion of the actuation mechanism 160.
 [0089] The reciprocating drive rod 170 is movable in a distal longitudinal direction as indicated
by arrow "D1" and a proximal longitudinal direction, as indicated by arrow "D2." Since the
longitudinal position of the pivot pin 172 is fixed, longitudinal movement of the reciprocating
drive rod 170 induces the link 162 to pivot simultaneously about axes "P1" and "P3," and
 induces link 164 to pivot simultaneously about axes "P2" and "P4." This simultaneous pivoting
of the links 162, 164 induces the jaw members 166, 168 to pivot about the axis "P5" between
the closed configuration depicted and an open configuration (not shown).
 [0090] The double flag jaw members 166, 168 include proximal flanges 166a, 168a arranged in
a nestled configuration (see FIG. 14). The upper link 164 may also be characterized as
"nestled," or disposed laterally between, the flags of proximal flange 168a of the lower jaw
member 168. The proximal flange 166a of the upper jaw member 166 is "nestled" within the
lower lever link 162. Each of the pivot links 162, 164 and the proximal flanges 166a, 168a
include a generally u-shaped cross section to permit the pivot links 162, 164 to interleave with
the proximal flanges 166a, 168a in this manner. This configuration provides a central channel
 174 through which a knife or other centrally disposed drive component (not shown) may extend.
 [0091] The actuation mechanism 160 allows the jaw members 166, 168 to open or separate from
one another to a greater degree than an actuation mechanism for opening similarly sized jaw
members employing a simple cam slot (see, e.g., FIG. 10). The actuation mechanism 160 also
provides a tactile feel that some operators may prefer. The stamped lever links 162, 164 and
proximal flanges 166a, 168a provide a relatively strong actuation mechanism 160, which

                                                 22
permits the jaw members 166, 168 to apply a relatively large force to tissue captured
therebetween.
[0092] Referring now to FIG. 17, the connection of the movable handle 22 and the knife trigger
26 to the longitudinally movable components of the elongated shaft 16 is described. The
movable handle 22 may be manipulated to impart longitudinal motion to the jaw drive rod 80
(FIG. 10), and knife trigger 26 may be manipulated to impart longitudinal motion to the knife
102 (FIG. 11). As discussed above, longitudinal motion of the jaw drive rod 80 serves to move
the end effector 14 between the open configuration of FIG. 2A and the closed configuration of
FIG. 2B, and longitudinal motion of the knife 102 serves to move knife blade 56 through knife
channel 58 (FIG. 2A).
[0093] The movable handle 22 is operatively coupled to the jaw drive rod 80 by a connection
mechanism 176. The connection mechanism 176 includes a clevis 178 defined at an upper end
of the movable handle 22. The clevis 178 is pivotally supported on the right housing half 12a
by a pivot boss 180. A second complementary pivot boss 180 (not shown) is provided on the
left housing half 12b (FIG. 1) to support the clevis 178. Each of two upper flanges 178a and
178b of the clevis 178 include rounded drive surfaces 182a and 182b thereon for engaging
respective rims 184a and 184b of a drive collar 184 (FIG. 18). The drive surfaces 182a, 182b
are arranged along the longitudinal axis A-A such that pivotal motions of the movable handle 22
about the pivot bosses 180 induce corresponding longitudinal motions of the drive collar 184
along the longitudinal axis A-A.
[0094] Referring now to FIG. 18, a distal longitudinal motion may be imparted to the
connection mechanism 176 by pushing the distal rim 184a of the drive collar 184 with the
movable handle 22 (FIG. 17) as indicated by arrow D3. The distal rim 184a engages the collar
stops 88a (FIG. 3), 88b and 88c. Thus, the distal longitudinal motion of the drive collar 184 will
be transmitted directly to the jaw drive rod 80 to induce a corresponding distal motion of the jaw
drive rod 80. A proximal longitudinal motion may be imparted to the connection mechanism
176 by pushing the proximal rim 184b of the drive collar 184 with the movable handle 22 (FIG.
17) as indicated by arrow D4. The proximal rim 184b engages a compression spring 188, which
is constrained between the proximal rim 184b and a spring keeper 192. The spring keeper 192
engages the spring stops 88d (FIG. 3) and 88e of the jaw drive rod 80. Thus, the proximal

                                                 23
motion of the drive collar 184 is transmitted to the jaw drive rod 80 through the compression
spring 188 and the spring keeper 192.
 [0095] Proximal movement of the jaw drive rod 80 draws the cam pin 92 proximally to pivot
the jaw members 30, 32 toward one another to move the end effector 14 to the closed
configuration as described above with reference to FIG. 10. Once the jaw members 30 and 32
are closed, the jaw drive rod 80 essentially bottoms out (i.e., further proximal movement of the
jaw drive rod 80 is prohibited since the jaw members 30, 32 contact one another). Further
proximal movement of the movable handle 22 (FIG. 17), however, will continue to move the
drive collar 184 proximally. This continued proximal movement of the drive collar 184
compresses the spring 188. When compressed, the spring 188 imparts additional force to the
jaw drive rod 80, which results in additional closure force applied to tissue captured between the
jaw members 30, 32 (see FIG. 2B). The spring 188 also serves to bias the jaw members 30, 32
and the movable handle 22 to the open configuration.
 [0096] A rotation spacer 196 is supported at the proximal end of the jaw drive rod 80. The
rotation spacer 196 includes an interior passageway (not shown) that receives the irregular
cross-section of the jaw drive rod 80. An outer surface of the rotation spacer 196 is generally
cylindrical, and thus, the rotation spacer 196 may support the proximal end of the jaw drive rod
 80 within the housing 12 (see FIG. 17) through rotation of the elongated shaft 80 about the
longitudinal axis A-A, e.g., rotation induced by rotation of the rotation knob 28 (FIG. 17). In
some embodiments, e.g., where longitudinal translation between the rotation spacer 196 and
spring keeper 192 is not required, the rotation spacer 196 and the spring keeper 192 may be
constructed as a single component as depicted in phantom. The single component spring keeper
 192 and rotation spacer 196 may be coupled to the jaw drive shaft 80 by a dowel pin (not
shown).
 [0097] Referring again to FIG. 17, the trigger 26 is pivotally supported in the housing 12 about
a pivot boss 202 protruding from the trigger 26. The trigger 26 is operatively coupled to the
knife 102 (FIG 11) by a knife connection mechanism 204 such that pivotal motion of the trigger
26 induces longitudinal motion of the knife 102. The knife connection mechanism 204 includes
upper flanges 26a, 26b of the trigger 26, a link 208, and a knife carriage 210. The link 208 is
pivotally coupled to the flanges 26a, 26b and the knife carriage 210 such that pivotal motion of
the trigger 26 induces longitudinal motion of the knife carriage 210.

                                                   24
[0098] Referring now to FIG. 19, the knife carriage 210 is longitudinally movable over the jaw
drive rod 80 independently of the motion of the jaw drive rod 80. Thus, the jaw drive rod 80
may be regarded as a stationary reference for the movement of the knife carriage 210. The knife
carriage 210 includes a sleeve 212, a knife arm 216, and a cap 218.
[0099] The knife arm 216 includes a pivot boss 216a, about which the link 208 (see FIG. 21C)
is coupled to knife arm 216. As described below with reference to FIG. 21C, the link 208
imparts longitudinal movement to the knife carriage 210 in a distal direction of arrow A9.
Guide arms 216b protrude laterally from the proximal end of the knife arm 216, and engage a
respective guide slot 12c (shown schematically in FIG. 19 and visible in FIG. 21C) defined in
the housing 12 to guide the longitudinal motion of the knife carriage 210.
[0100] The sleeve 212 is coupled to the knife arm 216, and thus, the sleeve 212 translates along
with the knife bar 216. The sleeve 212 includes indentations or catches 212a defined therein,
which receive snap-in arms 218a of the cap 218. The cap 218 may thus be assembled to the
sleeve 212 such that cap 218 and the sleeve 212 translate together. Thus, the entire knife
carriage 210, i.e., the knife bar 216, the sleeve 212 and the cap 218, may all be induced to
translate together along the jaw drive rod 80 in the direction of arrow A9. The knife carriage
210 abuts a spring 219, which is compressed against the rotation knob 28 (shown schematically
in FIG. 19) when the knife carriage 210 translates in the direction of arrow A9. The spring 219
biases the knife carriage 210 in a proximal direction to a proximal position along the jaw drive
rod 80.
[0101] Referring now to FIG. 20, the knife 102 is coupled to the knife carriage 210 such that the
longitudinal motion of the knife carriage 210 is transmitted to the knife 102. The proximal tabs
108a, 108b protruding from the knife 102 are captured between the sleeve 212 and the cap 218,
and thus the knife 102 will translate with the knife carriage 210 in both the proximal and distal
directions. The proximal tabs 108a, 108b are free to rotate about the longitudinal axis A-A
within the sleeve 212, and thus, the knife 102 may rotate along with the jaw drive rod 80 within
the knife carriage 210 when the rotation knob 28 is rotated as described above.
[0102] Referring now to FIGS. 21A, 21B, 21C and 21D, a sequence of motions may be initiated
by moving the movable handle 22 to induce motion in the jaw drive mechanism in order to close
the jaws 30, 32, and by moving the trigger 26 to induce motion in the knife actuation

                                                  25
mechanism in order to translate the bade 56 through the jaws 30, 32. Initially, both the
moveable handle 22 and the knife trigger 26 are in a distal or un-actuated position as depicted in
FIG. 21A. This arrangement of the moveable handle 22 and trigger 26 sustains the end effector
 14 in the open configuration (FIG. 2A) wherein the jaw members 30, 32 are substantially spaced
from one another, and the knife blade 56 is in a retracted or proximal position with respect to the
jaw memebers 30, 32. The initial distal position of the trigger 22 is actively maintained by the
influence of the spring 219 on the knife actuation mechanism. The distal position of the
moveable handle 22, however, is only passively maintained, e.g., by internal friction within the
jaw actuation mechanism. When both the moveable handle 22 and the knife trigger 26 are in the
distal, un-actuated position, pivotal motion of the knife trigger 26 in a proximal direction, i.e.,
toward the stationary handle 20, is prohibited by interference between the trigger 26 and
moveable handle 22. This interference prohibits advancement of the knife blade through the jaw
members 30, 32 when the end effector 14 is in the open configuration.
 [0103] The movable handle 22 may be moved from the distal position of FIG. 21A to the
intermediate position depicted in 21B to move the jaw members 30, 32 to the closed
configuration (FIG. 2B). As the movable handle 22 pivots about the pivot boss 180 in the
direction of arrow M1, the drive surface 182b engages the proximal rim 184b of the drive collar
 184. The drive collar 184, the spring 188 and the spring keeper 192 are all driven proximally
against the spring stops 88d and 88e of the jaw drive rod 80, and thus, the jaw drive rod 80 is
driven proximally in the direction of arrow M2. As discussed above with reference to FIG. 10,
proximal movement of the jaw drive rod 80 serves to draw the cam pin 92 proximally though
the cam slots 30c, 32c of the jaw members 30, 32 and thus pivot the jaw members 30, 32 toward
one another. As the jaw members 30, 32 engage one another and no further pivotal movement
of the jaw members 30, 32 may be achieved, the jaw actuation mechanism "bottoms out" and
further proximal movement of the cam pin 92 and the jaw drive rod 80 is prohibited.
 [0104] The movable handle 22 may be moved from the intermediate position of FIG. 21B to the
actuated or proximal position of FIG 21C to increase the pressure applied by the jaw members.
30, 32. As the movable handle 22 pivots further about the pivot boss 180 in the direction of
arrow M3, the drive surface 182b presses the proximal rim 184b of the drive collar 184 further
distally against the spring 188 in the direction of arrow M4. The spring 188 is compressed
against the spring keeper 192, and a tensile force is transmitted through the jaw drive rod 80 to
the jaw members 30, 32. The tensile force supplied by the spring 188 ensures that the jaw

                                                   26
members 30, 32 apply an appropriate pressure to effect a tissue seal. When the movable handle
22 is in the actuated or proximal position, electrosurgical energy may be selectively supplied to
the end effector 14 to generate a tissue seal.
[0105] When the movable handle 22 is in the actuated or proximal position, a flange 22a on the
moveable handle 22 is received in a railway 20a supported within the stationary handle 20. The
railway 20a serves to temporarily lock the movable handle 22 in the proximal position against
the bias of the spring 188, which biases the movable handle 22 from the proximal position of
FIG. 21C to the intermediate position of FIG. 21B. Thus, the railway 20a permits the
maintenance of pressure at the end effector 14 without actively maintaining pressure on the
movable handle 22. The flange 22a may be released from the railway 20a by pivoting the
movable handle 22 proximally and releasing the movable handle 22 to move under the influence
of the spring 188. Operation of the railway 20a is described in greater detail in U.S. Patent
Application Serial No. 11/595,194 to Hixon et al., now U.S. Patent No. 7,766,910. In some
embodiments (not shown), the flange 22a and the railway 22a may be eliminated to provide an
instrument without the temporary locking capability provided by these features.
[0106] When the movable handle 22 is in the actuated or proximal position, the knife trigger 26
may be selectively moved from the distal position of FIG. 21C to the proximal position of FIG.
21D to advance the knife blade 56 distally through the jaw members 30, 32. The knife trigger
26 may be pivoted in the direction of arrow M5, about pivot boss 202 to advance the flange 26b
of the knife trigger 26 distally in the direction of arrow M6. Movement of the flange 26b
induces the link 208 to pivot with respect to the flange 26b of the trigger 26, and with respect to
the knife arm 216 such that the link 208 draws the knife carriage 210 distally in the direction of
arrow M7. As described above with reference to FIGS. 11 and 19-20, distal movement of the
knife carriage 210 advances the knife blade 56 distally through the jaw members 30, 32.
[0107] Referring now to FIGS. 22-29, various alternate components are described, which may
be substituted individually or in combination for the similarly named components described
above in order to provide specific functionality to a surgical instrument. With reference to FIG.
22, an alternate embodiment of an end effector 220 includes upper and lower jaw members 222
and 224 respectively, which are configured to facilitate blunt dissection of tissue. Each jaw
member 222, 224 exhibits a scalloped distal end with a ledge 222a, 224a protruding distally
from a less prominent portion 222b, 224b of the distal tip. When the end effector 220 is in the

                                                 27
closed configuration as depicted, the ledges 222a, 224a may be pressed into tissue to be
dissected. The end effector 220 may then be moved to the open configuration to separate the
jaw members 222, 224 and any tissue gripped by the ledges 222a, 224a.
 [0108] The ledges 222a, 224a may be constructed of an electrically isolative material, e.g., the
insulator 230 as depicted in FIG. 23. The upper jaw member 222 is constructed of three major
components including a double-flag jaw insert 234, the insulator 230 and a sealing plate 238.
The insulator 230 may molded onto a u-shaped channel 236 of the of the double-flag jaw insert
234 and the sealing plate 238 in a single-shot molding operation. The insulator 230 may
completely surround the u-shaped channel 236, and may include various features such as the
ledge 224a (FIG. 22) at the distal end thereof, and a wire guide 240 at a proximal end thereof.
 [0109] The wire guide 240 is a portion of the insulator 230 that is molded to a lateral side of the
double-flag jaw insert 234, and over the wire 46b that couples the sealing plate 238 to the
electrosurgical generator 40 (FIG. 1) as described above. The wire guide 240 includes a hole
244 to provide clearance for a pivot pin 44 (FIG. 24), and is disposed on a single lateral side of
the upper jaw member 222. Lower jaw member 224 (FIG. 22) may include a similar wire guide
(not shown), which may be positioned on the opposing lateral side when the upper and lower
jaw members 222, 224 are assembled to an outer shaft member 250 in an "offset" arrangement
as depicted in FIG. 24. The wire guide 240 may thus protect the wire 46b from abrasion from
the outer shaft member 250 as the upper jaw member 222 pivots about pivot pin 44.
 [0110] Referring now to FIG. 25, a rotation knob 260 is constructed of two distinct components
262 and 264. An exterior component 262 provides gripping surfaces 268 which may be
engaged by an operator in use. The exterior component 262 generally exhibits a thin wall
construction to facilitate molding from a plastic or similar material. Inner wall portions 270 are
provided to engage an inner component 264 of the rotation knob 260 in a snap-fit manner. The
inner component 264 includes a distal engagement portion 272 for coupling the rotation knob
260 to the outer shaft member 250 (see FIG. 27), and a circular boss 276 extending proximally
therefrom. The circular boss 276 includes radially spaced detents 278 projecting radially from
an outer circumference thereof and a proximal extension 280 protruding longitudinally
therefrom. The detents 278 and proximal extension 280 define the rotational limits of the
rotation knob 260 as described below with reference to FIG. 28.

                                                 28
[0111] Referring now to FIGS. 26 and 27, the outer shaft member 250 may be coupled to the
rotation knob 260 in a snap-fit manner. The outer shaft member 250 includes a pair of
rectangular openings 284 extending through vertical sidewalls 250a, 250b near a proximal end
thereof. The rectangular openings 284 provide flexibility to the proximal end of the outer shaft
member 250 such that a pair of latches 288 at a proximal end of the sidewalls 250a, 250b may
be installed into the distal engagement portion 272 of the interior component 264 of the rotation
knob 260. The distal engagement portion 272 includes tapered walls 272a, 272b to urge the
latches 288 laterally inward temporarily as the outer shaft member 250 is inserted longitudinally
between the walls 272a, 272b. Once the latches 288 have been inserted proximally beyond the
walls 272a, 272b, the latches 288 will snap into place as the resiliency of the outer shaft member
250 urges the latches laterally outward. The outer shaft member 250 may thus be operatively
coupled to the rotation knob 260.
[0112] Referring now to FIG. 28, the rotational motion of the rotation knob 260 is limited by its
connection to a housing 302, which includes right and left housing halves 302a, 302b,
respectively. A stop 304 projects laterally inward from housing half 302b and is positioned to
engage the proximal extension 280 to prevent rotational motion of the rotation knob further
than, in one embodiment, 180 degrees in either direction. A pair of the detents 278 extending
from outer circumference of the rotation knob 260 engage a pair of cantilever arms 306
projecting from the housing half 302b. The engagement of the detents 278 with the cantilever
arms 306 defines a relatively stable relation between the rotation knob 260 and the housing 302.
In one embodiment, the detents 278 are radially spaced by about 90 degrees such that at least
three relatively stable positions may be defined within the extent of the rotation permitted by
proximal extension 280 and the stop 304. These positions may correspond to a configuration
wherein jaw members 222 and 224 (FIG. 22) curve to the left, in an upward direction, and to
right from the perspective of a user. The components for limiting the rotation of the rotation
knob 260 are all defined on an interior of the housing 302, and thus, interference from foreign
materials is limited.
[0113] The outer shaft member 250, rotation knob 260 and the housing 302 define a
longitudinal passage through which jaw drive rod 80, knife 102 and wire conduits 78a and 78b
may extend. The rotation knob 260 may also include an interior shelf (not shown) against which
spring 219 may be compressed (see FIG. 21D for a depiction of the spring 219 in a compressed
state).

                                                  29
[0114] Referring now to FIG. 29, a knife carriage 310 may be operatively coupled to the knife
102 by relative rotation of the knife carriage 310 with respect to the knife. The knife carriage
310 includes a single component (compare with knife carriage 210 described above with
reference to FIG. 19, which includes both a cap 218 and a sleeve 212 for capturing the knife
102). An opening 312 in the knife carriage 310 receives the proximal tabs 108a, 108b of the
knife 102. Rotation of the knife carriage 310 in the direction of arrow QI captures the proximal
tabs 108a, 108b against a proximal ledge of the knife carriage. Thus, longitudinal motion may
be transmitted between the knife carriage 310 and the knife 102.
[0115] While several embodiments of the disclosure have been shown in the drawings, it is not
intended that the disclosure be limited thereto, as it is intended that the disclosure be as broad in
scope as the art will allow and that the specification be read likewise. Therefore, the above
description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as examples of particular
embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision other modifications within the scope and
spirit of the disclosure herein.
