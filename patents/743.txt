           Apparatuses, systems and methods for providing a pressed beverage using a press and
  lid system. In one aspect, a beverage material is pressed to the bottom of a beverage container
  by means of a press ring including a filter. The walls of the beverage container exert a force on
  the press ring, folding flaps (perimeter portions) that are attached to the press ring by means of
5 a flexible attachment member. Any beverage material or other debris that is not collected by
  the filter in the press ring is collected by a filter in the lid. Other variations and features
  consistent with the present invention exist.

                                     FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5 [0002]       The present invention relates, generally, to a French coffee press, and more
   specifically, to a method, system and apparatus for preparing a cup of coffee, tea or other
   infused beverage in the same manner as a French coffee press using a disposable lid system and
   a standard disposable cup.
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
10 [0003]      Beverage presses are found in several forms. For example, a traditional French
   press is a device for preparing French press coffee. A French press usually consists of at least a
   cylindrical jug (usually glass or plastic), a lid, and a press ring disposed beneath the lid and
   connected to a rod that extends through and above the lid. The press ring may be made of
   metal or plastic, and includes a filter, often made of fine wire. The press ring is often circular,
15 with a diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the cylindrical jug, so that the periphery of
   the press ring contacts the inner wall of the jug, forming a seal. The filter is disposed in the
   press ring such that the hot liquid and also oils from rough coffee grounds may pass through,
   but grounds and other debris are stopped.
   [0004]      The operation of a traditional French press is as follows. First, rough ground coffee
20 is placed at the bottom of the jug. Next, a hot liquid is poured into the jug, over the rough
   ground coffee. The oils from the grounds permeate and infuse the liquid and then, the grounds
   are "pressed" to the bottom of the jug by the press ring, by means of the rod. The grounds are
   held at the bottom of the jug by the press ring.

                                                    -2
   [0005]      Presently, in order to offer French press coffee, many coffee retailers prepare the
   coffee using a traditional French press, and then pour the French press coffee into a disposable
   "to-go" coffee cup, or into a "for here" mug. The disposable cups sold by retailers are usually
   tapered, often made of paper or Styrofoam®. This manner of preparing French press coffee
 5 poses a problem because it typically takes three or four minutes to prepare each cup.
   Additionally, the French press must be cleaned after each use. This is not efficient or practical
   for a coffee retailer that depends on a high volume of coffee sales in order to be profitable.
   [0006]      Thus, there is a need for a quick and cost-effective method for serving French press
   coffee.
10 [0007]      One potential solution is to replace the jug of a traditional French press with a
   disposable "to-go" coffee cup. U.S. Published Patent Application 20050139091
   ("Haverstock"), is an example of such systems. In Haverstock, a separate rod and press are
   used with a disposable cup and dome lid. A hole is pre-fabricated into the dome lid for the rod.
   The customer must install the press ring in the cup, and then press the rough grounds.
15 [0008]      There are multiple problems with Haverstock and similar designs that render it
   unsatisfactory. First, the hot liquid softens paper cups such that the force of the press ring on
   the inner wall of the cup flexes walls. The flexing creates space between the press ring and the
   inner wall of the cup, through which grounds and other debris may pass making the coffee
   undrinkable. The farther the press ring moves along the tapered length of the disposable cup,
20 the more severe the flexing. This flaw exists whether the disposable cup is made of paper,
   Styrofoam, or even plastic. Furthermore, the hole in the lid as described by Haverstock allows
   hot liquid to pour out onto the customer as the cup is tipped.
   [0009]      Thus, there exists a need for a disposable French press that can operate with a
   typical disposable "to-go" coffee cup.

                DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
   [0060]       There are many non- disposable beverage press systems available today such as the
 5 'French Press'. These systems are typically made of glass, metal and plastic and are priced in
   the medium to expensive range and are to be used for years. These pressing systems are too
   bulky and not convenient for taking in the car, transporting, or to dispense a pressed beverage
   in a retail setting. What is missing in the commercial, retail and consumer markets is a truly
   disposable beverage press that is as convenient to use as a standard disposable beverage cup
10 and is inexpensive.
   [0061]       The beverage press according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention,
   is comprised of multiple components, each of which solves different deficiencies and flaws
   within the prior art presses. Exemplary embodiments of the components will be described
   individually, and as part of exemplary disposable beverage presses.
15 [0062]       The "top" and "bottom" of a cup will be referred to throughout the written
   description for ease of reference. The top of the cup refers to the open end with the wider
   circumference, and the bottom of the cup refers to the closed end with the smaller
   circumference. This convention is adopted merely for convenience, and should not in any way
   be read to limit the breadth of the present invention.
20 [0063]       Figure 1 illustrates a Press Ring 1 according to an exemplary embodiment of the
   present invention. The Press Ring 1 includes a Filter 11, Flaps 12, Flap Attachment Elements
   13, a Frame 14, Frame Members 18, Struts 15, a Push Rod Guide and Stop16, and a Lid
   Alignment Flange 17.
25 [0064]       The Frame Members 18 of Frame 14 intersect to form an enclosed area F as shown
   in Figure 1. Each Strut 15, extends inwardly from the perimeter of the area F defined by the
   Frame 14, and attaches to the Push Rod Guide and Stop 16. The Push Rod Guide and Stop 16
   is disposed at the center point of the area F. The Push Rode Guide and Stop 16 is substantially
   cylindrical in shape and volume. The Push Rod Guide and Stop 16 is bored at one end,
30 creating a bore along the axis of the Push Rode Guide and Stop 16, but not completely through,

                                                     -8
   leaving one end closed. As will be described later, a push rod bottom may be inserted into the
   bore. The axis of the Push Rod Guide and Stop 16 extends generally perpendicular to the plane
   of the area F. The Push Rod Guide and Stop 16 may extend through (i.e., break) the plane of
   the area F, or one end of the Push Rod Guide and Stop 16 (e.g., the closed end) may abut the
 5 area F.
   [0065]       The Flaps 12 are attached to the Frame 14 by the Flap Attachment Elements 13.
   Each Flap 12 is attached to the Frame 14 such that the plane of the Flap 12 is on substantially
   the same plane as the enclosed area F. According to the exemplary embodiment illustrated in
   Figure 1, there are eight Frame Members 18, and eight Flaps 12. One of ordinary skill in the
10 art would recognize that the number of Frame Members 18 and Flaps 12 may be fewer or
   greater based on specific circumstances.
   [0066]      According to the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figure 1, there are four Struts
    15, but one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that number of Struts 15 could be
   greater or fewer depending on, for example, the longitudinal compression on the Frame 14 and
15 the Frame Members 18.
   [0067]       The Filter 11, according to this exemplary embodiment, may be substantially disc
   shaped, and disposed across the bottom of the Frame 14 and Flaps 12, such that substantially all
   of the surface area of the area F, extending to the perimeter of the Flaps 12, is covered by the
   Filter 11. In this exemplary embodiment, the radius from the center of the Filter 11 to the
20 perimeter of the Filter 11 is at least equal to the radius from the center of the Guide Hole 16 to
   the perimeter formed by the outer most edge of the Flaps 12, although the radius to the
   perimeter of the Filter 11 may be longer.
   [0068]      Figures 2a and 2b each are a side view of the Press Ring 1 illustrated in Figure 1.
   [0069]      As illustrated by Figure 2a, the Adhesion Spikes 19 are disposed beneath the Filter
25  11, and the Frame 14.
   [0070]      Figure 2b illustrates the effect of a force Fi applied to the Flaps 12. When a
   sufficient Force Fi is applied to the Flaps 12, the Flaps 12 pivot around a Pivot Point Pi. The
   location of Pivot Point Pi depends on the material and dimensions of the Flap Attachment
   Element 13 (Fig. 1), but typically Pivot Point Pi is located near the contact point of a Flap
30 Attachment Element 13 and the Frame 14.

                                                     -9
   [0071]        According to one exemplary embodiment, the Flaps 12, pivot around the Flap
   Attachment Elements 13, which operate like a mechanical hinge. The Attachment Elements 13
   may rotate around a pin, or may be made of a material that is sufficiently flexible, such as
   plastic, paper, etc.
 5 [0072]        In this exemplary embodiment is essentially a mechanical hinge. One of ordinary
   skill in the art would know that the present invention is not limited to the exemplary
   embodiment of the Press Ring 1 described herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would
   recognize that the specific embodiment of the Press Ring may be changed without diverging
   from the spirit of the invention. For example, the Press Ring could crumple or compress as a
10 force is applied to the perimeter. Instead of Flaps, The Press Ring could have a single
   continuous flap that pivots upward, crumples or compresses. Alternatively, the Press Ring
   could include multiple layers, where a layer fails as a force is applied to the perimeter. One of
   ordinary skill in the art would recognize that other modifications exist.
   [0073]        Figure 3 is an exploded view of the Lid System 2 according to an exemplary
15 embodiment of the present invention. The Lid System 2 includes a Lid 20 and a Lid Filter 29.
   [0074]        Figure 4 illustrates a top-down view of a Lid 20 according to an exemplary
   embodiment of the present invention. The Lid 20 includes a Pressure Ring 23, a Seal 21, and a
   Press Ring Guide Hole 22. The Lid 20 may also include a Vent 24, a Condiment Hole 25, and
   a Pour Spout 26.
20 [0075]        The Pressure Ring 23 is a recessed portion disposed around the outer perimeter of
   the Lid 20. The recessed portion of the Pressure Ring 23 engages the lip/rim of a typical
   beverage container. Once the Pressure Ring 23 engages the lip/rim of a beverage container, it
   forms a liquid tight seal.
25 [0076]        The Seal 21 is a flexible material disposed around the Press Ring Guide Hole 22.
   The Seal 21 compresses (i.e., flexes in a direction toward the bottom of the Lid 20) when a
   force is applied on the Seal 21. In another exemplary embodiment, the Seal 21 may include
   slits that allow an object larger than the circumference of the Press Ring Guide Hole 22 to pass
   through.
30 [0077]        According to another exemplary embodiment the Seal 21 is not present. Instead, the
   push rod may create a liquid tight seal over the Guide Hole 22. The liquid tight seal is created,

                                                    - 10
   in part, by a Top Flange 42 and a Bottom Flange 44 of a Push Rod 4 (Figure 10), which have a
   larger diameter than the Guide Hole 22, and thus can cover the Guide Hole 22.
   [0078]       Figure 5 illustrates a bottom-up view of the Lid System 2 according to an exemplary
   embodiment of the present invention. From this perspective it is possible to view the Lid 20, a
 5 Filter Slot 27, Lid Filter 29, Condiment Hole 25, Pour Spout 26, and the Press Ring Guide Hole
   22.
   [0079]       Figure 6 is a cut-out view of the Lid System 2 according to an exemplary
   embodiment of the present invention. Here, the Lid Filter 29 is disposed beneath the Pour
   Spout 26. The Lid Filter 29 resides in the Filter Slot 27 (not shown), and is attached to the Lid
10 20 such that it completely covers the bottom opening of the Pour Spout 26. There are multiple
   ways that that Lid Filter 29 could be attached to the Lid 20. For example, the Lid Filter 29
   could be glued, welded, sewed, etc. According to this exemplary embodiment, the filter slot is
   slightly depressed so that the underside of the middle portion of the Lid 20 having that Guide
   Hole 22 is not on the same plane.

   the present invention. In this exemplary embodiment, a Lid Filter 39 is held in place by a Filter
   Retainer 38.
   [0081]       Figure 7 is a bottom up view the Filter Retainer 38 according to an exemplary
   embodiment of the present invention. The Filter Retainer 38 is a substantially circular shape.
20 The body of the Filter Retainer 38 extends in from a perimeter to a removed portion to form an
   "0" ring. Holes may be disposed across a portion of the body of the Filter retainer 38, as
   illustrated in Figure 7. The perimeter of the Filter Retainer 38 extends upwardly, transverse to
   the plane of the body of the Filter Retainer 38, around the entire circumference of the Filter
   retainer 38.

   according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. When the Filter Retainer 38
   is fastened to the Lid 30, the removed portion is dispose beneath the Condiment Hole 35. As
   explained above, the Filter Retainer 38 may also include a second portion with holes that is
   disposed beneath the Lid Filter 39. The second portion with holes could also be a removed
30 portion, as long as the Lid Filter 39 is held in place, and liquid can pass the Filter Retainer 38 to
   (and through) the Lid Filter 39.

   [0083]      Figure 9 is an exploded view of the lid System 3 including the Filter Retainer 38,
   according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The Lid Filter 39 inserts into
   the lid, and the Filter Retainer 33 inserts into the Lid 30, and abuts the Lid Filter 39, holding it
   into place.
 5 [0084]      Figure 10 illustrates a Push Rod 4 according to an exemplary embodiment of the
   present invention. The Push Rod 4 includes a Rod Bottom 41, a Top Flange 42, a Lock Flange
   43, and a Bottom Flange 44.
   [0085]      Figure 11 is a cut-out view of a Lid, Cup and Rod System 5 according to an
   exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The Lid, Cup and Rod System 5 includes the
10 Rod 4, the Lid System 3, the Press Ring 1 and the Cup 100. The recessed portion of the
   Pressure Ring 33 of the Lid 30 engages the rim/lip of the Cup 100, creating a liquid-tight seal.
   The Rod Bottom 41 (Figure 10) inserts into the Push Rode Guide and Stop 16, which is
   positioned in the Push Rode Guide Hole 32 (Figure 14).
   [0086]      Figure 12 is an exploded view of a Lid and Press System 6 according to an
15 exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The Lid and Press System 6 includes the Lid
   30, the Lid Filter 39, the Filter Retainer 38 (i.e., the Lid System 3, Figure 9), and the Press Ring
    1.
   [0087]      Figure 13 is a cut-out view of the Lid and Press System 6 according to an exemplary
   embodiment of the present invention. The Push Rod Guide and Stop 16 and Lid Alignment
20 Flange 17 inserts into the Press Ring Guide Hole 32 (Figure 14). The Push Rod Guide and
   Stop 16, Lid Alignment Flange 17 and Press Ring Guide Hole 32, couple/snap together using
   force created from Alignment Flange 17 against the Press Ring Guide Hole 32 (Figure 14).
   [0088]      Figure 14 is a cut-out view of the Lid and Press System 6 according to an exemplary
   embodiment of the present invention. The Push Rod Guide and Stop 16 and Lid Alignment
25 Flange 17 inserts into the Press Ring Guide Hole 32, located substantially at the center of the
   body of the Lid 30. In the exemplary embodiment described in Figure 13, the Press Ring
   Guide Hole 32 includes slits extending into the Lid 30. As explained, these slits may optionally
   be included to allow the Bottom Flange 44 of the Push Rod 4 (Figures 10 and 11) to easily pass
   through the Press Ring Guide Hole 32.
30 [0089]      Figure 15 is an exploded view of a Cup, Lid and Press System 7 according to an
   exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The Cup 100 is a typical beverage container,

                                                  - 12
   like those sold by a coffee retailer. The Cup 100 may come in any size, as long as the lip/rim
   of the Cup 100 can engages the Lid 30.
   [0090]      As described above, the Filter 39 is held in place by the Filter Retainer 38. The
   Push Rod Guide 16 and Lid Alignment Flange 17, insert into the Press Ring Guide Hole 32,
 5 and the Push Rod Guide 16, Lid Alignment Flange 17, and Press Ring Guide Hole 32
   couple/snap together using pressure created by the Press Ring Alignment Flange 17 (Figure 1
   and Figure 14).
   [0091]      The Push Rod Bottom 41 inserts into the Push Rod Guide and Stop 16 (Figure 10
   and Figure 1). When pressure is applied to the Push Rod Top Flange 42 (Figure 10), after
10 insertion into the Press Ring Press Guide Hole 32, the Press Ring 1 is forced out of the Lid 30.
   The Push Rod 4 forces the Press Ring 1 toward the distal end of the Cup 100.
   [0092]      Figure 16 is a cut-out view of the Cup, Lid and Press System 7 after the Press Ring
    1 separates from the Lid 30 due to the applied force that disengages the Alignment Flange 17
   from the Press Ring Guide Hole 32.
15 [0093]      In this exemplary embodiment, the body of the Cup 100 tapers from top to the
   bottom, that is, the circumference of the Cup 100 shrinks from the top to the bottom. Thus, as
   the Press Ring 1 travels down the axis of the Cup 100, a force Fc is applied at the Flaps 12 in
   the opposite direction that the Press Ring 1 is traveling. The force Fc causes the Attachment
   Elements 13 to bend uniformly while the Flaps 12 still maintain contact with the inner wall of
20 the Cup 100.
   [0094]       Continued pressure on the Push Rod Top 42 continues to force the Press Ring 1
   downwardly along the axis of the Cup 100 until the Adhesion Spikes 19 (if included, see Figure
   2a) contact the bottom of the Cup 100. The Adhesion Spikes 19 maintain contact with the
   bottom of the Cup 100.
25 [0095]      Figure 17 is a cut-out view of the Lid 30 and the Push Rod 4. The Lock Flange 43
   (Figure 10) of the Push Rod 4 catches under the Press Ring Guide Hole 32 and the Guide Hole
   Seal 31. The Seal 31 is depressed by the force of the Top Flange 42 (Figure 10). The
   depressed Seal 31 flexes downwardly and creates a seal over the Press Ring Guide Hole 32
   with the Lock Flange 43 (Figure 10).
30 [0096]      Next, the use of the Lid, Ring and Cup system 7 (i.e., the beverage press) will be
   described according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.

                                                    - 13
   [0097]       Figure 18a-18c illustrate the steps to produce an infused beverage using a beverage
   press with references to Figures 7-16, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present
   invention. A beverage material, e.g., ground coffee, tea, etc., may be deposited into the
   beverage container (Step Sl). Next, a liquid, hot or cold, is added to the Cup 100 (Step S2). A
 5 Lid and Press System 6 is fitted over the opening of the Cup 100 such that the Pressure Ring 33
   of the Lid 30 engages the rim/lip of the Cup 100 (Step S3). Next, the Push Rod Bottom 41 is
   inserted into the Push Rod Guide and Stop 16 (Step S4). Once the Push Rod Bottom 41 is
   inserted into the Push Rod Guide and Stop 16, pressures is applied to the Top Flange 42 of the
   Push Rod 4 (Figure 10), the downward pressure decouples the Alignment Flange 17 from the
10 Press Ring Guide Hole 32 (Step S5). Pressure on the Top Flange 42 of the Push Rod 4 (Figure
    10) separates the Press Ring 1 from of the Lid System 3, and into the Cup 100 (Step S6).
   Pressure on the Push Rod Top Flange 42 moves the Press Ring 1 along the axis of the Cup 100
   toward the distal end, and eventually the Press Ring 1 contacts the mix of beverage material
   (e.g., coffee grounds) and liquid (Step S7). As pressure continues to force the Press Ring 1
15 toward the distal end of the Cup 100, the infused liquid passes through the Filter 11, but the
   beverage grounds (and any other debris) is collected beneath the Filter 11, and is pushed along
   the axis of the Cup 100 by the Filter 11 (Step S8).
   [0098]       In this exemplary embodiment, the Cup 100 tapers (i.e., the circumference of the
   Cup 100 decreases from the top to the bottom), and is made of a flexible material, such as paper
20 or Styrofoam®. Flaps 12 and Filter 11 maintain contact with the inner wall of the Cup 100 as
   the Press Ring 1 moves downward. This contact insures that most of the beverage material and
   debris remains under the Filter 11. Continued pressure on the Push Rod Top Flange 42 forces
   the Press Ring 1, the beverage material, and any debris to the bottom of the cup (Step S9).
   Lock Flange 43 (Figure 10) catches under the Press Ring Guide Hole 32 (Step S 10). The Seal
25 31 compresses down around the Press Ring Guide Hole 32 by the Push Rod Top Flange 42 to
   seal the Press Ring Guide Hole 32 around the Push Rod 4 (Step S 11). This stops the liquid
   from passing through the Press Ring Guide Hole 32, and holds the Push Rod 4 firmly pressed
   against the Push Rod Guide and Stop 16, which in turn holds the Press Ring 1 near the bottom
   of the Cup 100.
30 [0099]       If there are Adhesion Spikes 19 beneath the Press Ring 1, the Adhesion Spikes 19
   will remain firmly pressed against the bottom of the Cup 100.

                                                    - 14
   [0100]       At this point, condiments may be added to the coffee cup via the Condiment Hole
   35, by first pressing on the Condiment Hole Cover until a perforated portion separates from the
   lid, and then adding the condiments via the condiment hole Cover (Step not shown). However,
   this step is not required.
 5 [0101]       Next, as the Cup 100 is tipped, some beverage material and debris "escapes" from
   beneath the Filter 11, between the Inner Wall of the Cup 100, the Flaps 12 and Filter 11 (Step
   S12). As explained above, this is because the beverage cup is made of a material that does not
   readily maintain its shape, and when the liquid is of a sufficient temperature (the temperature of
   a cup of coffee), the material is even more malleable. Thus, when the cup is tipped, or even
10 when the Flaps 12 and Filter 11 apply force to the inner wall of the Cup 100, the cross section
   of the Cup 100 is deformed from a substantially circular shape to, for example, an oval shape,
   and beverage material and debris escape upward past the Flaps 12 and Filter 11.
   [0102]       As the Cup 100 is tipped, infused liquid passes through Lid Filter 39 (Step S13)
   Any beverage material or debris that escaped passed the Flaps 12 and Filter 11 is trapped
15 beneath Lid Filter 39, so that only liquid pass through the Pour Spout 36.
   [0103]       Figures 19 - 21 illustrate a Press Ring 200 according to another exemplary
   embodiment of the present invention. Figure 19 is a side view of the Press Ring 200. The
   Press Ring 200 includes a Filter 201, a Guide and Stop 202, an Alignment Flange 203, Upper
   Flaps 204, and Lower Flaps 205. According to this exemplary embodiment, the Filter 201 is
20 disposed between the Upper Flaps 204 and the Lower Flaps 205. Both the Upper Flaps 204
   and Lower Flaps 205 are attached to an Upper Frame 209 and a Lower Frame 210, and pivot
   around Flap Attachment Elements 208, that couple the Upper Flaps 204 and Lower Flaps 205,
   to the Upper Frame 209 and the Lower Frame 210.
   [0104]       The Upper Flaps 204 are connected to the perimeter of an Upper Frame 209, and the
25 Lower Flaps are connected to the perimeter of a Lower Frame 210.
   [0105]       Figure 20 is a top-down view of the Press Ring 200, that makes it possible to see
   that the Press Ring 200 further includes Struts 207, an Upper Frame 209, and Attachment
   Elements 208. The Guide and Stop 202 is disposed at the center of the area defined by the
   Upper Frame 209. The Struts 207 extend from the Upper Frame 209 to the Guide and Stop
30 202. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the number of Struts 207 could
   change.

                                                    - 15
   [0106]       The Guide and Stop 202, as with the Guide and Stop 16 (Figure 1), couples to the
   Lid 20 (e.g., Figure 3) by inserting into the Guide Hole 22 (Figure 4). The Press Ring 200 and
   a Lid 20 (Figure 3) "snap" together, by apply pressure to the Press Ring 200 until the
   Alignment Flange 203 passes through the Press Ring Guide Hole 22 (Figure 4). The Press
 5 Ring 200 stays coupled to the Lid 30 (Figure 4) by the pressure of the Press Ring Guide Hole
   22 on the Alignment Flange 203.
   [0107]       The Upper Flaps 204 and Lower Flaps 205 may be at a position so the that the plane
   of the flaps are on substantially the same plane as the area defined by the Upper Frame 209 and
   Lower Frame 210. As with the Press Ring 1 (Figure 1), when the Press Ring 204 moves from
10 the Lid 30 (Figure 4) to the distal end of a beverage container, if the beverage container tapers
   toward the distal end, the inner walls of the beverage container exert a force that causes the
   Upper Flaps 204 and Lower Flaps 205 to pivot in the opposite direction as the Press Ring 204
   is moving.
   [0108]       In another exemplary embodiment, the Upper Flaps 204 and Lower Flaps 205 may
15 be bent downward (toward the distal end of the beverage container) at a 45 degree angle. By
   bending the Upper Flaps 204 and Lower Flaps 205 before pressing the Press Ring 200, when
   the inner wall of the beverage container exerts a force on the Upper Flaps 204 and Lower Flaps
   205, the flaps will bend toward the distal end of the beverage container, in the same direction
   that the Press Ring 200 is moving. As the Upper Flaps 204 and lower Flaps 205 bend toward
20 the distal end of the beverage container, the flaps may form a basket-like enclosure around the
   beverage material and any other debris collected under the Filter 201.
   [0109]       According to one exemplary embodiment, the Upper Flaps 204 and Lower Flaps
   205, pivot around the Attachment Elements 208, which operate like a mechanical hinge. The
   Attachment Elements 208 may rotate around a pin, or it may be made of a material that is
25 sufficiently flexible, such as plastic, paper, etc. Additional mechanical hinges may be added so
   that that the flaps bend at more than one point. For example, additional hinges could be added
   at the point where the Upper Flaps 204 and Lower Flaps 205 contact the Attachment Element
   208, and hinges could be added at the point where the Attachment Elements 208 contact the
   Upper Frame 209 and Lower Frame 208. By adding additional hinges, the Press Ring 200 may
30 assume a more basket like enclosure around the beverage material and debris.

   [0110]       Figure 21 is a side view of the Press Ring 200 in the closed position. The Upper
   Frame 209 and the Lower Frame 210, close, holding between them the Filter 201. The Upper
   Frame 209 and Lower Frame 210 could be closed during manufacturing, for example by a
   welding, or later, by "snapping" together the two pieces using methods known to those having
 5 ordinary skill in the art.
   [0111]       Figures 27 through 30 illustrate a Press Ring 601 according to an exemplary
   embodiment of the present invention. Figure 27 is an exploded view of the Press Ring 601. In
   this exemplary embodiment, the Press Ring 601 may include an Upper Press Ring Portion 608,
   a Press Ring Filter 610, and a Lower Press Ring Portion 609. The Upper Press Ring Portion
10 608 may include Upper Flaps 612, Upper Attachment Elements 613, Upper Strut 615, Push
   Rod Guide and Stop 616, Lid Alignment Flange 617, Stack Guide 618, and Press Ring Pin
   Guide Hole 614. Press Ring Filter 610 may include Press Ring Filter Pin Holes 611. Lower
   Press Ring Portion 609 may include Lower Flaps 622, Pressure Relief Control 627, Lower
   Attachment Elements 623, Lower Struts 625, Lower Frame 621, Stack Probe 628, and Press
15 Ring Pins 624.
   [0112]       In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figure 27, the Upper Press Ring Portion
   608 and the Lower Press Ring Portion 609 "snap" together, holding the Press Ring Filter 610
   between the two portions. The Press Ring Pins 624 pass through the Press Ring Filter Pin
   Holes 611 and insert into the Press Ring Pin Guide Holes 614. A flange at the end of the Press
20 Ring Pins 624 stops the Press Ring Pins 624 from retracting back through the Press Ring Pin
   Guide Holes 614, fastening the Upper Press Ring Portion 608 to the Lower Press Ring Portion
   609. The Upper Press Ring Portion 608 and Lower Press Ring Portion 609 may also fasten
   together by, for example, welding, adhesive, or other means known to those of ordinary skill in
   the art.
25 [0113]       In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figures 27 through 30, the Upper Flaps
   612 and the Lower Flaps 622 are bent in a downward (what would be toward the distal end of a
   beverage cup) angle. The Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622 should be sufficiently angled
   such that the flaps clear the mouth of a beverage cup when the Press Ring 601 is inserted into a
   cup. However, the Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622 should not be given such a severe
30 angle that debris escapes around the flaps. In one exemplary embodiment the Upper Flaps 612
   and Lower Flaps 622 are angled such that flaps contact the inner wall of a beverage container,
   as illustrated in Figure 38. As further illustrated in Figure 38, pressure on the Upper Flaps 612

                                                   - 17
   and Lower Flaps 622 (shown in Figure 30) from the inner walls of the Beverage Container 650
   acts to hold the Press Ring 601 "seated" near the distal end of the Beverage Container 650.
   [0114]      As illustrated in Figures 27 through 30, the Pressure Relief Control 627, according
   to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, may be a notch disposed at the perimeter
 5 of Lower Flaps 612. As beverage material gathers underneath the Press Ring Filter 610, it may
   slow or stop the flow of fluid through the Press Ring Filter 610. The remaining fluid, debris,
   and beverage material may accumulate beneath the Lower Flaps 622 and the Upper Flaps 612,
   and, as the Press Ring 601 is urged toward the distal end of the beverage container, exert
   pressure on the Lower Flaps 622 and Upper Flaps 612. This pressure can bend upward (away
10 from the distal end of the beverage container) one or more of the Lower Flaps 622 and Upper
   Flaps 612. If one or more of the Lower Flaps 622 and Upper Flaps 612 bend upward, a gap
   may form sufficient to allow unfiltered fluid (i.e., fluid including debris and beverage material)
   to bypass the Press Ring Filter 610, and contaminate the filtered fluid. Further, the pressure on
   the Lower Flaps 622 and Upper Flaps 612 from the remaining fluid and beverage material may
15 be sufficient to stop the urging of the Press Ring 601 toward the distal end of a beverage
   container. If the Press Ring 601 stops before it seats (described above), then the Press Ring
   601 could retract (i.e., move away from the distal end of the beverage container) if the beverage
   container is tilted or jostled, which in turn may allow unfiltered fluid to bypass the Press Ring
   Filter 610.
20 [0115]      The Pressure Relief Control 627 allows a limited amount of fluid and debris to
   bypass the Press Ring Filter 610, sufficient to reduce the pressure on the flaps which might
   otherwise cause one or more of the Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622 to bend upwards, or
   obstruct the Press Ring 601 from seating at the distal end of the beverage container. In the
   exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figures 27 through 30, the Pressure Relief Control 627
25 may be a notch disposed at the perimeter of each of the Lower Flaps 622. A notch disposed at
   the permieter of each of the Lower Flaps 622 equalizes the pressure on the all of the Lower
   Flaps 622 and Upper Flaps 612. However, a single notch on a single Lower Flap 622 could
   provide sufficient pressure relief. The Pressure Relief Control 627 may be disposed anywhere
   on the Lower Flaps 622 to allow a sufficiently limited amount of fluid and debris to bypass the
30 Press Ring Filter 610, and to reduce the pressure on the Lower Flaps 622 and Upper Flaps 612.
   For example, the Pressure Relief Control 627 could be one or more holes or slits through the
   Lower Flaps 622. Alternatively, the Upper Flaps 612 may have a smaller angle than the Lower

                                                  - 18
   Flaps 622, forming a small space between the Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622 that
   allows a sufficient amount of fluid and debris to bypass the Press Ring Filter 610 to relieve the
   pressure on the Upper Flaps 612 and the Lower Flaps 622. The Pressure Relief Control 627 is
   not limited to the Lower Flap 622, and could be disposed on the Upper Flaps 612 in any of the
 5 manners described above.
   [0116]      The Stack Probe 628 illustrated in Figures 27 and 29, will now be described
   according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The Stack Probe 628 may be
   a cylindrical, elongated member, that protrudes from the bottom of the Lower Press ring
   Portion 609. As illustrated in Figures 27 and 29, the Stack Probe 628 protrudes from the center
10 of the area formed by the Lower Frame 621, which, in this exemplary embodiment, is a point
   where the Lower Struts 625 intersect. The Stack Probe 628 includes a Stack Stop 629, which
   may be a flange or ridge formed by a wider diameter at the top (the end of the Stack Probe 628
   that contacts the Lower Struts 625) of the Stack Probe 628 than along the length of the
   remainder of the Stack Probe 628. The Stack Probe 628 may be shaped so that it will insert
15 into the Stack Guide 618, which, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present
   invention, is also the Push Rod Guide and Stop 616. When the Stack Probe 628 inserts into the
   Stack Guide 618, the Stack Stop 629 abuts a ridge or flange inside the Stack Guide 618 and
   impedes the Stack Probe 628 from inserting farther. In this manner, multiple Press Rings 601
   may be stacked without damaging the frames or flaps of the Press Ring 601. According to
20 another exemplary embodiment, the Stack Probe 628 may be long enough that the bottom (the
   distal end of the Stack Probe 628 from the Lower Struts 625) can abut the bottom of the Stack

 5 the diameter of the base of the Stack Probe 628 relative to the remainder of the Stack Probe
   628. The Stack 629 is not limited to such an embodiment, and could, for example, be a ring of
   material protruding all the way around, or part of the way around, the elongated shaft of the
   Stack Probe 628.

15 [0120]       A Lid System 602 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention
   will now be described with reference to Figures 31-32.
   [0121]       Figure 31 is an exploded-view of a Lid System 602, according to an exemplary
   embodiment of the present invention. According to this exemplary embodiment, the Lid
   System 602 includes a Lid 630 and a Lid Filter 631. The Lid 630 may include a Pour Spout
20 635, Press Ring Guide Hole 633, Filter Slot 632, and Pressure Ring 634. The Pressure Ring
   634 may be a recessed portion disposed around the outer perimeter of the Lid 630. The
   recessed portion of the Pressure Ring 634 engages the lip/rim of a typical beverage container.
   Once the Pressure Ring 634 engages the lip/rim of a beverage container, it forms a liquid tight
   seal.

   raised portion along a part of the perimeter of the dome of the Lid 630. According to one
   exemplary embodiment, the Pour Spout 635 is of a sufficient height (i.e., protrude out along the
   y-axis) to form a surface area that provides sufficient "lip grip" to create a water-tight seal
   between a user's lip and the Pour Spout 635. "Lip grip" refers to the ability of a user to "grip"
30 the Pour Spout 635 with their lip because there is sufficient surface area to contact the lip.

   [0123]       According to an exemplary embodiment, the Lid 630 does not include a seal around
   the Press Ring Guide Hole 633. According to an exemplary embodiment, the Push Rod 640, as
   illustrated in Figure 36, includes a Lock Flange 643 between the Top Flange 642 and Bottom
   Flange 644. The Lock Flange 643 engages the perimeter edge of the Press Ring Guide Hole
 5 633, with the Top Flange 642 above and extending across the perimeter edge of the Press Ring
   Guide Hole 633, and the Bottom Flange 644 below and extending across the perimeter edge of
   the Press Ring Guide Hole 633. This forms a liquid-tight seal.
   [0124]       Figures 33 and 34 illustrate a Lid and Press System 603 according to an exemplary
   embodiment of the present invention. Figure 33 is an exploded view of the Lid and Press
10 System 603. The Lid and Press System 603 may include a Press Ring 601 and a Lid System
   602. According to an exemplary embodiment, the Push Rod Guide and Stop 616 and Lid
   Alignment Flange 617 inserts into the Press Ring Guide Hole 636, and the Lid Alignment
   flange 617 engages the Press Ring Guide Hole 636 such that the Press Ring 601 may be
   attached to the Lid System 602, as illustrated in Figure 34.
15 [0125]       In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figures 33 and 34, the Upper Flaps 612
   and Lower Flaps 622 are angled downward away from the Lid System 602.
   [0126]       Figure 35 illustrates Lid and Press Systems 603 stacked, one on top of the other, by
   utilizing the Stack Probe 628, Stack Stop 629 and Stack Guide 618, described above.
   [0127]       Figure 36 illustrates a Push Rod 640 according to an exemplary embodiment of the
20 present invention. The Push Rod 640 may include a Rod Bottom 641, Top Flange 642, Lock
   Flange 643, and Bottom Flange 644. According to an exemplary embodiment the Bottom
   Flange 644 may be cone-shaped. The Lock Flange 643 may be formed by the base of the cone
   shaped Bottom Flange 644 and the Top Flange 642, which form an indentation around the Push
   Rod 640.
25 [0128]       Figures 37-39 illustrate a Cup, Lid, and Press System 700 according to an
   exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Figure 37 illustrate an exploded-view of the
   Cup, Lid, and Press System 700. The Cup, Lid and Press System 700 may include a Push Rod
   640, a Lid 630, a Lid Filter 631, a Press Ring 601 and a Cup 650.

                                                     -21
   [0129]       Figure 38 is a cut-out view of the Cup, Lid and Press System 700 after the Press
   Ring 601 separates from the Lid 630 due to the applied force from the Push Rod 640 that
   disengages the Lid Alignment Flange 617 from the Press Ring Guide Hole 633.
   [0130]       In this exemplary embodiment, the body of the Cup 650 tapers from top to the
 5 bottom, that is, the circumference of the Cup 650 shrinks from the top to the bottom. The
   Upper Flaps 612 and the Lower Flaps 622 (as shown in Figure 30) are angled downward. As
   the Press Ring 601 travels down the axis of the Cup 650, a force Fc (illustrated in Figure 40B)
   is applied at the Upper Flaps 612 and the Lower Flaps 622, urging the Upper Flaps 612 and the
   Lower Flaps 622 to bend farther inward. The Upper Flaps 612 and the Lower Flaps 622, in
10 turn apply a force   FF (illustrated in Figure 40b) outward against the inner wall of the Cup 650.
   The force Fc causes the Upper Attachment Elements 613 and Lower Attachment Elements 603
   to bend uniformly while the Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622 maintain contact with the
   inner wall of the Cup 650. The Press Ring 601 "seats" at the bottom of the cup, where the
   force Fc holds the Press Ring 601 at the bottom of the Cup 650 in addition to the force from the
15 Push Rod 640.
   [0131]       As explained above, fluid and beverage material gathered beneath the Lower Flaps
   622 and the Upper Flaps 612 may put pressure on the flaps, forcing one or more of the Lower
   Flaps 622 and the Upper Flaps 612 to angle upwards, obstructing the Press Ring 601 from
   properly seating at the bottom of the Cup 650, or shifting the entire Press Ring 650 a-kilter. As
20 illustrated in Figures 40A and 40B, according to an exemplary embodiment, in addition, or
   separate, to the Pressure Relief Control 627, described above, the surface area of the Upper
   Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622 that contact the inner wall of the Cup 650 may be treated to
   increase the coefficient of friction between the Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622, and the
   inner wall of the Cup 650. By increasing the coefficient of friction, and as illustrated in Figure
25 40B, the frictional force   FFR  acts on the Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622 (not shown) to
   keep the flaps angled downward, countering the force      FFL applied from the pressure of the
   accumulated fluid, beverage material, and debris beneath the Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps
   622.
   [0132]       The Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622 may be treated according to methods
30 known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including, but not limited to, etching, barbing,
   roughing, or utilizing other friction enhancing materials, such as rubber. In another exemplary
   embodiment according to the present invention, the inner wall of the Cup 650 may be treated to

                                                    - 22
   increase the coefficient of friction between the inner wall and the Upper Flaps 612 and Lower
   Flaps 622.
   [0133]       Figure 39 is a cut-out-view of the Lid System 602 and Push Rod 640 according to
   an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in Figure 39, the Lock
 5 Flange 643 has engaged the perimeter edge of the Press Ring Guide Hole 633, with the Top
   Flange 642 above and extending across the perimeter edge of the Press Ring Guide Hole 633,
   and the Bottom Flange 644 below and extending across the perimeter edge of the Press Ring
   Guide Hole 633.
   [0134]       Next, the operation of the Lid, Ring and Cup system 700 will be described
10 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, with reference to Figures 27
   40B
   [0135]       As illustrated in Figure 41, a beverage material, e.g., ground coffee, tea, etc., may be
   deposited into the Cup 650 (Step S101). Next, a liquid, hot or cold, is added to the Cup 650
   (Step S 102). A Lid and Press System 603 is fitted over the opening of the Cup 650 such that
15 the Pressure Ring 634 of the Lid 630 engages the rim/lip of the Cup 650 (Step S103). Next, the
   Push Rod Bottom 641 is inserted into the Push Rod Guide and Stop 616 (Step S104). Once the
   Push Rod Bottom 641 is inserted into the Push Rod Guide and Stop 616, pressures is applied
   to the Top Flange 642 of the Push Rod 640, the downward pressure decouples the Lid
   Alignment Flange 617 from the Press Ring Guide Hole 633 (Step S105). Pressure on the Top
20 Flange 642 of the Push Rod 640 separates the Press Ring 601 from of the Lid System 602, and
   into the Cup 650 (Step S 106). Pressure on the Top Flange 642 moves the Press Ring 601 along
   the axis of the Cup 650 toward the distal end, and eventually the Press Ring 601 contacts the
   mix of beverage material (e.g., coffee grounds) and liquid (Step S107). As pressure urges the
   Press Ring 601 toward the distal end of the Cup 650, the infused liquid passes through the Press
25 Ring Filter 610, and beverage material and debris collects beneath the Press Ring Filter 610,
   pushed along the axis of the Cup 650 by the Pres Ring Filter 610 (Step S108).
   [0136]       In this exemplary embodiment, the Cup 650 tapers (i.e., the circumference of the
   Cup 650 decreases from the top to the bottom), and is made of a flexible material, such as paper
   or Styrofoam®. The Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622 are initially angled downward, as
30 illustrated in Figures 34 and 38. The Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622 maintain contact
   with the inner wall of the Cup 650 as the Press Ring 601 moves downward (S109). This

                                                 - 23
   contact ensures that most of the beverage material and debris remains under the Press Ring
   Filter 610. Continued pressure on the Top Flange 642 forces the Press Ring 601, the beverage
   material, and any debris to the bottom of the cup (Step SI10). As the beverage material, fluid
   and debris accumulate beneath the Press Ring Filter 610, the flow of fluid through the Press
 5 Ring Filter 610 slows, and the fluid, beverage material, and debris accumulate beneath the
   Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622. A part of the accumulated fluid, beverage material, and
   debris passes through the Press Relief Control 627, relieving any pressure on the Upper Flaps
   612 and Lower Flaps 622 (Step 111).
   [0137]      According to an exemplary embodiment, the Lock Flange 643 catches under the
10 Press Ring Guide Hole 633 (Step S 112). This stops the liquid from passing through the Press
   Ring Guide Hole 633, and holds the Push Rod 640 firmly pressed against the Push Rod Guide
   and Stop 616, which in turn seats the Press Ring 601 near the bottom of the Cup 650, along
   with the force from the inner wall of the cup Fc.
   [0138]      Next, as the Cup 650 is tipped, some beverage material and debris "escape" through
15 the Pressure Relief Control 627, and from between the inner wall of the Cup 650 and the Upper
   Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622. As explained above, escapage between the inner wall of the
   Cup 650 and the flaps may occur because the beverage cup is made of a material that does not
   readily maintain its shape, and when the liquid is of a sufficient temperature (the temperature of
   a cup of coffee), the material is even more malleable. Thus, when the cup is tipped, or even
20 when the Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622 apply force to the inner wall of the Cup 650,
   the cross section of the Cup 650 is deformed from a substantially circular shape to, for
   example, an oval shape, and beverage material and debris escape upward past the edges of the
   Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622. Escaping beverage material and debris, however, are
   reduced in this exemplary embodiment, because, among other reasons, the downward angled
25 Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622 maintain contact with the inner wall at a point closer to
   the distal end of the Cup 650, holding the beverage material and debris in a basket-like
   enclosure. Further, the walls of the Cup 650 deform to a lesser degree near the distal end of the
   Cup 650.
   [0139]      As the Cup 650 is tipped, infused liquid passes through Lid Filter 631 (Step S 113)
30 Any beverage material or debris that escaped by the Upper Flaps 612 and Lower Flaps 622, or
   passed through the Pressure Relief Control 627, is trapped beneath Lid Filter 631, so that only
   liquid passes through the Pour Spout 635.

   [0140]      Turning to another exemplary embodiment, Figure 22 is a cut-out view of a Lid,
   Cup, Press 300 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The Lid, Cup,
   System 300, instead of a press ring, uses a vertical filtration system, operated by a Side Lever
   301. The Slide Filter 302 is attached to the Slide Lever 401, and extends downward to the
 5 bottom of the Cup 307. The Slide Lever 301 is disposed on Lid 304. By sliding the Slide
   Lever 301 across the Lid 304, the Slide Filter 302 moves horizontally, collecting Beverage
   Material 311.
   [0141]      Figure 23 is a top-down view of the Lid, Cup, Press System 300. A Slide Lever Slot
   306 is located on the top of the Lid 304. The Slide Lever Slot 306 extends across the diameter
10 of the Lid 304. The Slide Lever Slot 306 opening extends into the Lid 304, so that the Slide
   Lever 301 may be attached to the Slide Filter 302. As the Slide Lever 301 is moved along the
   Slide Lever Slot 36, the attached Slide Filter 302 is pulled in the same direction, filtering the
   Beverage Material 311. When the Lid, Cup, Press System 300 is tipped to pour out liquid, any
   Beverage Material 311 or other debris that is not collected by the Slide Filter 302 is collected
15 by the Lid Filter 303, located beneath the Pour Spout 305.
   [0142]      Figure 24 is a cut-out view of a Lid, Cup, Press System 400 according to an
   exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The Lid, Cup, System 400, instead of a press
   ring, uses a vertical filtration system, operated by a Dial 401. The Slide Filter 402 is attached
   to the Dial 401, and extends downward to the bottom of the Cup 407. The Dial 401 is disposed
20 on Lid 404. By turning the dial 401, the Slide Filter 402 moves horizontally, collecting
   Beverage Material 411.
   [0143]      Figure 25 is a top-down view of the Lid, Cup, Press System 400. The Dial 401 is
   disposed at the top of the Lid 404.. As the Dial 401 is turned, the attached Slide Filter 402 is
   pulled across the Cup 407, filtering the Beverage Material 411. When the Lid, Cup, Press
25 System 400 is tipped to pour out liquid, any Beverage Material 411 or other debris that is not
   collected by the Slide Filter 402 is collected by the Lid Filter 403, located beneath the Pour
   Spout 405.
   [0144]      Figure 26 is a cut-out view of a Lid, Cup and Static Press System 500, according to
   an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The Lid, Cup, and Static Press System 500
30 includes a Press Ring with Filter 501, A Lid 502, a Lid Filter 503, a Static Rod 504, a Pour
   Spout 505, and a Cup 506. The Static Rod 504, Press Ring with Filter 501 and Lid 502 are a

                                                    - 25
   single unit. The Static Rod 504 is attached to the underside of the Lid 502 on one end, and the
   Press Ring with Filter 501 on the other end. By making the Lid 502, Static Rod 504 and Press
   Ring with Filter 501 a single unit, there is no need for a Guide and Stop 16 (Figure 1) or a
   Guide Hole 22 (Figure 2), as in other embodiments. This obviates the need for a Press Rod 4,
 5 which has a Top Flange 42 and Bottom Flange 44 (Figure 10). To use the Lid, Cup and Static
   Press System 500, beverage material is placed in the Cup 506, a liquid is added, and then the
   single unit of the Lid 502, Static Rod 504, and Press Ring with Filter 501, is attached to the
   Cup 506. As the Lid 502 is placed on the Cup 506, the Press Ring with Filter 501 presses
   beverage material and any debris to the bottom of the cup by collecting the beverage material
10 and debris beneath the filter in the Press Ring with Filter 501. When the cup is tipped to pour
   out water via the Pour Spout 505, any beverage material or debris that escapes the Press Ring
   with Filter 501, is collected by the Lid Filter 503.
   [0145]      One of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention could take many different
   embodiments, and the described embodiments are not intended to limit the invention thereto.
15 For example, instead of a push rod, in another exemplary embodiment, a string is located at the
   bottom of the beverage container that passes through the bottom (i.e., closed) end of the cup
   and attaches to a press ring. When pulled, the string applies a force to the press ring, pulling it
   toward the distal end of the beverage container.
   [0146]      In another exemplary embodiment, the beverage grounds are placed at the bottom of
20 a cup during a manufacturing process. A press ring, similar to the Press Ring 1 (Figure 1), or
   Press Ring 200 (Figure 19), holds the beverage material against the bottom of the cup. After
   adding a hot liquid, a Lid, such as Lid 20 (Figure 4), is placed over the cup. The hot liquid is
   infused through the filter in the Press Ring. In another exemplary embodiment, a tight seal is
   maintained between the press ring and the wall of the cup, and a typical disposable beverage
25 container lid is used instead of a Lid 20.
   [0147]      In another exemplary embodiment, there is no press ring, merely a filter made of,
   for example plastic.
   [0148]      One of ordinary skill in the art would realize that there are many advantages
   achieved by the components and systems described above. For example, the Lid and Press
30 system described above can be utilized in most commercially available dome lids. The Lid and
   Press system is stackable just like the dome lids available at many retailers. Further, the Lid

                                                    - 26
   and Press System will fit on the typical cup found at many retailers. Further, the Press Lid and
   Press system described above requires virtually no assembly, other than snapping the Lid and
   Press system on a cup and inserting the Rod.
