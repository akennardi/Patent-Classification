SMALL ORGANIC MOLECULE BASED FLOW BATTERY
Abstract
The invention provides an electrochemical cell based on a new chemistry for a flow battery
for large scale, e.g., grid scale, electrical energy storage. Electrical energy is stored
chemically at an electrochemical electrode by the protonation of small organic molecules
called quinones to hydroquinones. The proton is provided by a complementary
electrochemical reaction at the other electrode. These reactions are reversed to deliver
electrical energy. A flow battery based on this concept can operate as a closed sys-tern. The
flow battery architecture has scaling advantages over solid electrode batteries for large scale
energy storage.

           This invention was made with government support under grant number 0670-4322 from
   the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy - U.S. Department of Energy. The
   government has certain rights to the invention.
 5                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           Intermittent renewable electrical power sources such as wind and photovoltaics (PV)
   cannot replace a significant fraction of our current fossil fuel-based electrical generation unless
   the intermittency problem is solved. Fluctuations in renewable source power are generally
   backed up by natural gas fired "peaker" plants. Inexpensive, reliable energy storage at or near the
 0 generation site could render the renewable source dispatchable (e.g. demand-following) and
   permit the gas peakers to replace baseload coal. It could also permit full utilization of the
   transmission capacity of power lines from the generation site, permitting supply capacity
   expansion while deferring the need for transmission capacity expansion.
           The advantages of flow batteries are giving them increased attention for grid-scale
25 electrical storage [1]: because all of the reactants and products are stored in tanks outside the
   electrochemical conversion device, the device itself may be optimized for the required power
   while the required energy is independently determined by the mass of reactant and the size of
   storage tanks. This can drive down the storage cost per kWh, which is the single most
   challenging requirement for grid-scale storage. In contrast, in solid electrode batteries the
30 energy/power ratio (i.e. the peak-power discharge time) does not scale and is inadequate for
   rendering intermittent renewable power sources dispatchable. Most solid-electrode batteries have
   peak-power discharge times << 1 hr., whereas rendering PV and wind dispatchable require ~15
   and -50 hrs., respectively [2].
                                                       1

          The commonly recognized technology options for grid-scale electrical energy storage are
  summarized in Table 1. Commercial activity with zinc-bromine hybrid flow batteries illustrates
  the technical feasibility of liquid bromine and hydrobromic acid as reactants. However, by its
  nature the design -   involving Zn plating within the electrochemical conversion device -      does
5 not permit flow battery-like energy scaling; it also presents a dendrite-shorting risk [1]. Arguably
  the most developed flow battery technologies are vanadium redox flow batteries (VRBs) and
  sodium-sulfur batteries (NaSBs). Costs per kW are comparable, whereas VRBs are considerably
  more costly on a cost per kWh basis, in part due to the high price of vanadium, which sets a floor
  on the ultimate cost per kWh of a VRB [3]. The vanadium itself costs around $160/kWh based
0 on recent costs for V 20 5 [4]. VRBs do benefit from a longer cycle life, with the ability to be
  cycled in excess of 10,000 times, whereas NaSBs are typically limited to about 4,500 cycles [3].
  For VRBs, costs per kW are likely to move lower, as recent improvements in VRB cell design
  have led to significantly higher power densities and current densities, with values of 0.55 W/cm 2
                2
  and 0.9 A/cm , respectively [5], but these don't help lower the ultimate floor on the cost per
5 kWh. These values, to our knowledge. represent the best performance achieved in VRBs
  reported to date in the literature. NaSBs have to operate above 300 'C to keep the reactants
  molten, which sets a floor on their operating costs. Over 100 MW of NaSBs have been installed
  on the grid in Japan, but this is due to government fiat rather than market forces. NaSBs have the
  longest duration (energy/power) at ~7 hrs. VRBs are the subject of aggressive development,
0 whereas NaSBs represent a static target. There is also recent work on the regenerative
  electrolysis of hydrohalic acid to dihalogen and dihydrogen [6-9], where the halogen is chlorine
  or bromine. These systems have the potential for lower storage cost per kWh than VRBs due to
  the lower cost of the chemical reactants.

                                      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
               The invention provides an electrochemical cell based on a new chemistry for a flow
 5 battery for large scale, e.g., gridscale, electrical energy storage. Electrical energy is stored
   chemically at an electrochemical electrode by the protonation of small organic molecules called
   quinones to hydroquinones. The proton is provided by a complementary electrochemical reaction
   at the other electrode. These reactions are reversed to deliver electrical energy. A flow battery
   based on this concept can operate as a closed system. The flow battery architecture has scaling
 0 advantages over solid electrode batteries for large scale energy storage. Because quinone-to
   hydroquinone cycling occurs rapidly and reversibly in photosynthesis, we expect to be able to
   employ it to obtain high current density, high efficiency, and long lifetime in a flow battery.
   High current density drives down power-related costs. The other advantages this particular
   technology would have over other flow batteries include inexpensive chemicals, energy storage
15 in the form of safer liquids, an inexpensive separator, little or no precious metals usage in the
   electrodes, and other components made of plastic or inexpensive metals with coatings proven to
   afford corrosion protection.
               Variations of a quinone-based cell are described. One is a quinone/hydroquinone couple
   as the negative electrode against a positive electrode with a redox active species. In one
20 embodiment, the positive electrode and the negative electrode are quinone/hydroquinone
   couples.
               In one aspect, the invention provides a rechargeable battery having first and second
   electrodes, wherein in its charged state, the battery includes a redox active species in contact
   with the first electrode and a hydroquinone dissolved or suspended in aqueous solution in contact
                                                         3

   with the second electrode, wherein during discharge the redox active species is reduced and the
   hydroquinone is oxidized to a quinone. In certain embodiments, the redox active species is
   dissolved or suspended in aqueous solution. Redox active species may include chlorine,
   bromine, iodine, oxygen, vanadium, chromium, cobalt, iron, manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper,
 5 or lead, in particular, bromine or a manganese oxide, a cobalt oxide or a lead oxide.
   Alternatively, the redox active species is a second quinone dissolved or suspended in aqueous
   solution, as described herein. In a specific embodiment, the hydroquinone and quinone, e.g., a
   water-soluble anthraquinone optionally including one or more sulfonate groups, have a standard
   electrochemical potential below 0.4 volts with respect to a standard hydrogen electrode.
 0 Typically, the first electrode is separated from the second electrode by a barrier that inhibits the
   passage of the redox-active species and the hydroquinone, e.g., an ion conducting membrane or a
   size exclusion membrane. In a specific embodiment, the first and second electrodes are
   separated by an ion conducting barrier, and the redox active species includes bromine.
            In another aspect, the invention features a rechargeable battery including first and second
 5 electrodes separated by an ion conducting hydrocarbon barrier or size-exclusion barrier, wherein
   in its charged state, the battery includes a quinone at the first electrode and a hydroquinone at the
   second electrode, wherein during discharge, the quinone is reduced, and the hydroquinone is
   oxidized.
            In a related aspect the invention features a rechargeable battery including first and second
 0 electrodes separated by an ion conducting barrier, wherein in its charged state, the battery
   includes a quinone in aqueous solution at the first electrode and a hydroquinone in aqueous
   solution at the second electrode, wherein during discharge, the quinone is reduced, and the
   hydroquinone is oxidized. In a further related aspect, the invention features a rechargeable
   battery including first and second electrodes separated by an ion conducting barrier, wherein in
25 its charged state, the battery includes bromine at the first electrode and a hydroquinone at the
   second electrode, wherein during discharge, bromine is reduced, and the hydroquinone is
   oxidized. In yet a further aspect, the invention features a rechargeable battery including first and
   second electrodes separated by an ion conducting hydrocarbon barrier, wherein in its charged
   state, the battery includes a quinone at the first electrode and a hydroquinone at the second
30 electrode, wherein during discharge, the quinone is reduced, and the hydroquinone is oxidized.

   formula (I) or (II):

            The absence of active metal components in both redox chemistry and catalysis represents
   a significant shift away from modem batteries. In particular, the use of quinones, such as 9,10
   anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonate, offers several advantages over current flow battery technologies:
        (1)        Scalability: it contains the earth-abundant atoms, such as carbon, sulfur, hydrogen
35                 and oxygen, and can be inexpensively manufactured on large scales. Because some
                                                         7

                 quinones are natural products, there is also the possibility that the electrolyte
                 material can be renewably sourced.
        (2)       Kinetics: it undergoes rapid two-electron redox on simple carbon electrodes and
                 does not require a costly precious metal catalyst.
 5      (3)       Stability: the quinone should exhibit minimal membrane crossover because of its
                 relatively large size and potential for a dianionic state. Furthermore, although
                 bromine crossover is a known issue in zinc-bromine and hydrogen-bromine cells,
                 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonate is stable to prolonged heating in concentrated
                 Br 2/HBr mixtures.
 0      (4)      Solubility: it has a solubility of order 1 M at pH 0 and can be stored at relatively
                 high energy densities.
        (5)      Tunability: The reduction potential and solubility of quinones can be further
                 optimized by introduction of electron-donating functional groups such as -OH.
   These features lower the capital cost of storage chemicals per kWh, which sets a floor on the
 5 ultimate system cost per kWh at any scale. Sulfonated anthraquinones are used on an industrial
   scale in wood pulp processing for paper, and they can be readily synthesized from the
   commodity chemicals anthraquinone and oleum. We estimate chemical costs of $21 kWh-I for
   9,10-anthraquinone-2.,7-disulfonate and $6 kWh-' for bromine. A quinone-bromine flow battery
   offers significant cost improvements to vanadium flow batteries that cost $81 kWh-'.
 o Optimization of engineering and operating parameters such as the flow field geometry, electrode
   design, membrane separator, and temperature should lead to significant performance
   improvements in the future, as it has for vanadium flow batteries, which took many years to
   surpass 100 mW cm-2. The use of quinones represents a new and promising direction for cost
   effective, large-scale energy storage.

                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
            The invention points the way to a high efficiency, long cycle life redox flow battery with
   reasonable power cost, low energy cost, and all the energy scaling advantages of a flow battery.
   In some embodiments, the separator can be a cheap hydrocarbon instead of a fluorocarbon, and
 0 reactant crossover will be negligible. The electrodes can be inexpensive conductors, conformally
   coated with a layer of active material so thin as to be negligible in cost [9]. Many of the
   structural components can be made of cheap plastic, and components that need to be conducting
   can be protected with conformally coated ultrathin films. Chemical storage can be in the form of
   cheap, flowing liquids held in cheap plastic tanks and require neither compression nor heating
 5 above the liquid's boiling point. The electrochemical cells are based on small organic molecules
   (SOMs) called quinones (Fig. 1). Because quinone-to-hydroquinone cycling occurs rapidly and
   reversibly in photosynthesis, we are able to employ it to obtain high current density (high current
   density is very important because the cost per kW of the system is typically dominated by the
   electrochemical stack's cost per kW, which is inversely proportional to the power density -       the
 0 product of current density and voltage), high efficiency, and long lifetime in a flow battery.
   There are hundreds of different quinones spanning a wide range in properties [10-13] such as
   reduction potential (Fig. 1), solubility and stability in water and other solvents. In addition, there
   are many structures that can be readily screened computationally and synthesized. For example,
   quinones with high redox potential and candidates with low redox potential, along with other
25 desirable attributes can be identified based on computation screens. In one embodiment, a full
   cell includes a low redox potential quinone/hydroquinone couple and a bromine/bromide
   counterelectrode. In another embodiment, the full cell includes a high redox potential quinone/
   hydroquinone couple vs. a low redox potential quinone/hydroquinone couple. A performance
   target is 80% round-trip efficiency in each cell at 0.25 W/cm 2 .
30          The organic quinone species, e.g., anthraquinones, can be synthesized [39] from
   inexpensive commodity chemicals that cost a factor of three less per kWh of storage than the
   vanadium metal ions used in the most highly commercialized flow battery systems. It also
   permits further organic functionalization to increase the cell voltage and energy storage capacity.
   Upon scale-up, quinone-based flow batteries can provide massive electrical energy storage at
35 greatly reduced cost.
                                                      11

   Small Organic Molecule (SOM) technical background
            The invention is employs a knowledge base in oxygen-free fuel cells [14-16]. There is
   also a growing knowledge base on SOM electrochemistry for hydrogen storage [17,18]. Organic
 5 based fuel cells have been the subject of numerous studies, many focusing on alcohols (methanol
   and ethanol) and formic acid (H*COOH-). Cells utilizing these fuels typically rely on high
   precious metal content catalysts (Pt, Pd, or Ru) [19-21]. Current densities approaching 1 A/cm 2
   and power densities exceeding 250 mW/cm 2 have been obtained in direct formic acid fuel cells
   [19]. Reactant crossover is more important with methanol than formic acid [21]. Although there
 0 are a number of choices for a SOM redox couple [22-24], quinone-based compounds present a
   highly promising class of SOMs. Quinones are abundant in nature, they play a vital role in
   oxygen-evolving photosynthesis, and we eat them in green vegetables. In particular,
   plastoquinone is reversibly and rapidly reduced to plastoquinol as part of the electron transport
   chain that ultimately leads to the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH, which is then used in the
 5 synthesis of useful organic molecules from CO 2 [25]. A 2009 publication exploring quinones for
   flow batteries makes the potential clear for flow batteries based on quinone/hydroquinone
   couples [26]. They reported one promising quinone/hydroquinone couple (sulfonic quinol) as the
   positive electrode against the conventional Pb/PbSO 4 negative solid electrode. They obtained
                                                        2
   disappointing current densities of order 10 mA/cm . Indeed the reported [13] exchange current
 0 density is relatively high for the para-benzoquinone/hydroquinone couple on smooth Pt, It is
   comparable to that for the chlorine/chloride couple on smooth RuO 2 -      the basis of the
   commercial Dimensionally Stabilized Anode (DSA) for the Chlor-Alkali industry [27].
            The quinone to hydroquinone reduction reaction consists of converting an oxygen that is
   doubly bonded ("=O") to an sp 2 C6 ring into a singly-bonded hydroxyl ("-OH"), as shown in Fig.
25 2(a). An electrode contributes an electron as the acidic electrolyte provides the proton. This
   typically occurs with pairs of oxygens in the ortho or para configurations; in aqueous solutions
   the two oxygen sites undergo the reaction at potentials that are virtually indistinguishable. The
   transition from the hydroquinone to the quinone involves simply removing protons without
   disrupting the rest of the bonding (Fig. 2(b)), and so these molecules are exceedingly stable.
30 Because the redox potentials shift with changing solvent, but the hierarchy is much less affected,
   the 2-Volt range reported in dimethyl sulfoxide in Fig. 1(a) is encouraging for the prospects in
   aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 1(b)). The first concern we have in creating a quinone-based flow
   battery is selecting a quinone with the appropriate value of the redox potential (Fig. 1). In
   aqueous solutions the positive electrode cannot operate at voltages above about 1.5 V vs.
35 Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) or else 02 evolution becomes significant. The negative
                                                     12

   electrode cannot operate at voltages below about -0.2 V to 0 V (depending on electrocatalyst) vs.
   SHE or else H2 evolution becomes significant. These reactions are near the ends of the range of
   potentials shown in Fig. 1(b). The survey, from which selections are shown in Fig. 1(b), is
   limited by some discrepancies in reported literature values, e.g. Nivinskas et al. [28] claim a
 5 redox potential of 0.040 V for tetramethylbenzoquinone, whereas Song et al. claim 0.068 V [29].
   Nevertheless, it is clear from the figure that adding electron-withdrawing groups, such as Cl,
   raises the redox potential whereas adding electron-donating groups, such as methyl or isopropyl,
   lowers the redox potential.
            In addition to redox potential, important molecular characteristics include solubility,
 0 stability, toxicity, and potential or current market price. High solubility is important because the
   mass transport limitation at high current density in a full cell is directly proportional to the
   solubility. Solubility can be enhanced by attaching polar groups such as the sulfonate groups, as
   in 1,2-Dihydroxybenzene-3,5-disulfonic acid (Fig. l(b)). Stability is important not only to
   prevent chemical loss for long cycle life, but also because polymerization on the electrode can
 5 compromise the electrode's effectiveness. Stability against water and polymerization can be
   enhanced by replacing vulnerable C-H groups adjacent to C+O groups with more stable groups
   such as C-R, where R is optionally substituted C 1 6 alkyl, hydroxy, optionally substituted C 1 6
   alkoxy, SO 3 H, amino, nitro, carboxyl, phosphoryl, or phosphonyl,.
            Many quinones or hydroquinones are available commercially on a small scale, and their
 0 current market price sets an upper limit on what the price might be at large scale. The very
   common 1,4-parabenzoquinone ("BQ"), for example, currently costs only about $10.53/kWh,
   assuming a 1-V cell, as shown in Table 2. Other quinones can be synthesized.

   Quinones or hydroquinones       may be present in a mixture. For example, a mixture of sulfonated
   quinones can be produced by reacting sulfuric acid with an anthraquinone, e.g., 9,10
   anthraquinone.
 5         Quinones may be dissolved or suspended in aqueous solution in the batteries. The
   concentration of the quinone ranges, for example, from 3 M to liquid quinone, e.g., 3-15 M. In
   addition to water, solutions may include alcohols (e.g., methyl, ethyl, or propyl) and other co
   solvents to increase the solubility of a particular quinone. In some embodiments, the solution of
   quinone is at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%. 70%, or 80% water, by mass. Alcohol or
 0 other co-solvents may be present in an amount required to result in a particular concentration of
   quinone. The pH of the aqueous solution for a quinone may also be adjusted by addition of acid
   or base, e.g., to aid in solubilizing a quinone.
   A quinone flow battery
15         This cell is based on a quinone/hydroquinone couple with low redox potential (an
   example of which is shown in Fig. 2) vs. redox active species, e.g., the bromide/bromine couple.
   Other redox active species include chlorine, iodine, oxygen, vanadium, chromium, cobalt, iron,
   manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper, or lead, e.g., a manganese oxide, a cobalt oxide or a lead
   oxide. If the quinone redox potential is -0.02 V, then the equilibrium potential will be about 1.1
20 V, varying with concentration according to the Nernst Equation. Examples of
   quinone/hydroquinone couples with a low redox potential include 2-Methyl-5-iso-propyl-1,4
   benzoquinone or 2,6- Methoxyl- 1,4-benzoquinone (Fig. 1(b)).
           A high-potency low-cost chlorine/chloride and bromine/bromide electrocatalyst is known
   [30], and a powerful chlorine/chloride cell has been developed [9,3 1]. While the use of bromine
25 is advantageous in many systems, use in a manned environment, such as the home, is limited
                                                      19

   based on toxicity concerns; therefore bromine-based systems are best focused on industrial and
   some commercial applications. Nevertheless, the toxicity is not so high, and its safe handling not
   so difficult, so as to prevent its commercialization in zinc-bromine batteries.
 5 An all-quinone/hydroquinone flow battery.
            This cell is based on the quinone/hydroquinone couple with high redox potential vs.
   quinone/hydroquinone with low redox potential. An all-quinone cell brings many advantages.
   Many of the structural components could be made of cheap plastic. The molecules are big
   enough that the separator is expected to be much cheaper than Nafion [32-34], and reactant
 o crossover will still be negligible. The electrodes can be inexpensive conductors such as titanium
   [35] or glassy carbon, conformally coated with layer of active material so thin as to be negligible
   in cost. Engineering for two-phase flow will be unnecessary. Chemical storage can be in the
   form of flowing liquids requiring neither compression nor heating above the boiling point of
   water.

            Electrode materials can be screened for good molecule-specific electrode kinetics.
   Although evidence indicates that quinone/hydroquinone catalysis is not a significant barrier,
   some electrode materials are expected to become deactivated due to the chemisorption of
 0 molecules or fragments, or the polymerization of reactants. Electrodes for use with a quinone or
   hydroquinone include any carbon electrode. e.g.. carbon paper electrodes, carbon felt electrodes,
   or carbon nanotube electrodes. Electrodes suitable for other redox active species are known in
   the art.
25 Fabrication offull cell
            The fabrication of full cells requires the selection of appropriate electrodes. Bromine and
   quinone electrodes can be made of a high specific surface area conducting material, such as
   nanoporous metal sponge [35], which has synthesized previously by electrochemical dealloying
   [36], or conducting metal oxide, which has been synthesized by wet chemical methods and
30 shown to be good for bromine [9,30]. Chemical vapor deposition can be used for conformal
   coatings of complex 3D electrode geometries by ultra-thin electrocatalyst films.
   Fabrication of testing hardware and cell testing
            The balance of system around the cell will include fluid handling and storage, and
35 voltage and round-trip energy efficiency measurements can be made. Systems instrumented for
                                                       20

   measurement of catholyte and anolyte flows and pH, pressure, temperature, current density and
   cell voltage may be included and used to evaluate cells. Testing can be perfonned as reactant and
   acid concentrations and the cell temperature are varied. In one series of tests, the current density
   is measured at which the voltage efficiency drops to 90%. In another, the round-trip efficiency is
 5 evaluated by charging and discharging the same number of amp-minutes while tracking the
   voltage in order to determine the energy conversion efficiency. This is done initially at low
   current density. and the current density is then systematically increased until the round-trip
   efficiency drops below 80%. Fluids sample ports can be provided to permit sampling of both
   electrolytes, which will allow for the evaluation of parasitic losses due to reactant crossover or
 0 side reactions. Electrolytes can be sampled and analyzed with Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
   Spectrometry, and other standard techniques.
   Ion Conducting Barriers
           The ion conducting barrier allows the passage of protons but not a significant amount of
 5 the quinone, hydroquinone, or other redox active species. Example ion conducting barriers are
   Nafion, i.e., sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene based fluoropolymer-copolymer, hydrocarbons, e.g.,
   polyethylene, and size exclusion barriers, e.g., ultrafiltration or dialysis membranes with a
   molecular weight cut off of 100, 250, 500, or 1,000 Da. For size exclusion membranes, the
   molecular weight cut off will be determined based on the molecular weight of the quinone,
 0 hydroquinone, or other redox active species employed.
   Additional Components
           A battery of the invention may include additional components as is known in the art.
   Quinones, hydroquinones, and other redox active species dissolved or suspended in aqueous
25 solution will be housed in a suitable reservoir. A battery may further include pumps to pump
   aqueous solutions or suspensions past one or both electrodes. Alternatively, the electrodes may
   be placed in a reservoir that is stirred or in which the solution or suspension is recirculated by
   any other method, e.g., convection, sonication, etc. Batteries may also include graphite flow
   plates and aluminum current collectors.

   Examples
   Example 1
           1 molal 1,2-ortho-benzohydroquinone (catechol) was oxidized in 1 N H 2SO 4 at a flat Pt
   electrode, obtaining the cyclic voltammetry curves shown in Figure 3a. The sweep starts at (0.2
35 V, 0 mA/cm2 ) and proceeds at 25 mV/s to the right. At about 600 mV vs. Ag/AgC1 (the known
                                                      21

   E0 is 795 mV vs. SHE), the current density increases as catechol is oxidized to the orthoquinone
   form. The oxidative current density peaks at about 150 mA/cm 2. The peak and downturn are
   caused by reactant depletion in a quiescent (non-flowing, non-stirred) electrolyte. In a test at a
   higher concentration of 3.9 molal (Fig. 3b), we observe asymmetric oxidation and reduction
 5 peaks, achieving current densities above 500 mA/cm2 for the former. The asymmetric shape of
   the curve in Fig. 3b arises because the quinone form is unstable in aqueous solution. In addition
   the limited solubility of ortho-benzoquinone (0.06 M) compared to its reduced form precludes
   symmetric behavior at high concentration.
 0 Example 2
           The half-cell redox behavior of hydroquinone-2-sulfonic acid (HQSA) is shown in Figure
   4. At a pH of 7 a rise in current density was observed beginning near 0.5 V and peaking at higher
   voltage. Upon reversing the direction of the voltage sweep, negative current (indicating a
   reduction event) was observed near 0.3 V. The large difference between where the oxidation and
 5 reduction currents are observed indicates a chemical process was likely occurring. In this case,
   upon oxidation of HQSA to the quinone form, water reacted with the quinone to form a new
   species. This species was reduced at the lower 0.3 V potential. At a pH of 13, the reaction
   became rapid and reversible because in basic solution the -OH groups on HQSA became
   deprotonated. The positive and negative current density observed near 0 V was indicative of a 2
 0 electron redox event with no protons having been exchanged.
   Example 3
           AQDS was subjected to half-cell electrochemical measurements. Cyclic voltammetry of a
    1 mM solution of AQDS in 1 M sulfuric acid on a glassy carbon disc working electrode showed
25 current peaks corresponding to reduction and oxidation of the anthraquinone species (Fig. 5a).
   The peak separation of 34 mV was close to the 59 mV/n, where n was the number of electrons
   involved, expected for a two-electron process.
   Example 4.
30         The glassy carbon disk in Example 3 was rotated at a variety of rates yields mass
   transport limited currents from which the AQDS diffusion coefficient (D = 3.8(1) x 10-6 cm2 s-1)
   (compare D in [38]) and kinetic reduction rate constant could be determined (Figs. 5b, 6, 7, and
   8). Kinetic data showed the rate constant for AQDS reduction on glassy carbon to be ka = 7.2(5)
   x 10-3 cm s-I, which exceeded the rate constant on Au [39]. This rate constant was faster than
35 that found for many other species used in flow cells such as V /V , Br 2/Br-, and S 4 -/S2 - (see
                                                    22

   Table 2 in [40]). The electrochemical reversibility of the two-electron redox reaction was
   confirmed by the slope of the Tafel plot (Figure 8), which gave the transfer coefficient a = 0.474,
   which is close to the value of 0.5 expected for an ideally reversible reaction.
 5 Example 5
            To further understand the AQDS redox behavior, we generated a Pourbaix diagram
   (Figure 5c) of the equilibrium potential of the AQDS redox couple vs. pH. Aqueous 1 mM
   solutions of AQDS disodium salt were prepared and pH buffered using the following chemicals:
   sulfuric acid (1 M, pH 0), HS0   4 /S0 4 - (0.1 M, pH 1-2), AcOH/AcO- (0.1 M, pH 2.65-5),
 0 H2 PO 4 -/HPO4- (0.1 M, pH 5.3-8), HPO2/PO4- (0.1 M, pH 9,28-11,52), and KOH (0.1 M, pH
   13). The pH of each solution was adjusted with 1 M H2 SO 4 or 0.1 M KOH solutions. In acidic
   solutions (pH < 7), the 59 mV/pH slope indicated that a two-electron, two-proton process occurs
   ([39]). In more basic conditions (7 < pH < 11), a two-electron, one-proton process occurred,
   giving a 30 mV/pH slope. The potential became pH-independent at values greater than 11, which
 5 indicated a two-electron, zero-proton process. These results indicated that AQDS performed
   reversible two-electron redox chemistry in a pH range of 0 to 14, and the protonation state of the
   reduction product dihydro-AQDS, which yielded approximate pK, values of 7 and 11.
   Example 6
 0          A solution of anthraquinone was heated in concentrated sulfuric acid or a solution of 30%
   SO 3 in concentrated sulfuric acid (oleum), resulting in a mixture of sulfonated anthraquinones as
   previously described [37]. This crude mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and was
   diluted with 1 M sulfuric acid to give a solution of 1 mM sulfonated anthraquinone. This solution
   was subjected to half-cell measurements that demonstrate that the behavior of the mixture of
25 sulfonated anthraquinones was nearly identical to the pure 9, 10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic
   acid illustrated in Example 3, as shown in Figure 9.
   Example 7.
            A solution of 1,8-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone was heated in concentrated sulfuric acid
30 and a yellow solid was isolated after addition of NaCl, which contained 1,8-dihydroxy-9,10
   anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid disodium salt (1,8-(OH) 2 -AQDS) in > 95 % purity. A solution
   consisting of 1 mM 1,8-(OH) 2-AQDS in 1 M H 2SO 4 was subjected to half-cell measurements
   under similar conditions to Example 3, The traces of 1,8-(OH) 2-AQDS and AQDS are shown in
   Figure 10, and illustrate that the peak potentials of AQDS were shifted by nearly 100 mV by the
35 addition of -OH groups to the AQDS backbone.
                                                     23

   Example 8.
            A quinone-hydrogen fuel cell is illustrated by schematic in Figure Ila. 1,4-benzoquinone
   was used as the positive electrode material and H 2 gas as the negative material for fuel cell tests.
 5 We operated the cell in discharge mode, with the p-benzoquinone / p-hydroquinone mixture
   recirculated past the quinone electrode on the positive side, and H 2 flowing past the hydrogen
   electrode. The Nafion membrane conducted H' ions towards the cathode. The cell reached
   current densities of about 150 mA/cm 2 and power densities of about 35 mW/cm2 , which were
   higher than values previously reported using soluble quinones for the positive electrode in a full
 0 cell configuration [26]. We used a fuel cell test bench constructed by Sustainable Innovations,
   LLC, and modified in our lab [9]. Fig. 1lb shows an image of the cell used. The cell featured
   aluminum endplates, pyrolytic graphite current collectors with serpentine flow channels, a 50 [tm
   thick Nafion 212 proton exchange membrane (which prior to use was pretreated using methods
   previously described [9]), and PTFE/Viton tubing and gasketing throughout. On both sides of the
 5 cell, a commercial Pt-Ru/C carbon paper commercial electrode was used. The cell was operated
   in galvanic mode using previously described methods [9], with high-purity hydrogen gas flowed
   through the negative side of the cell at 5 psig and quinone solution flowed through the positive
   side using a Cole Parmer Masterflex pump. The solution consisted of para-benzoquinone in 1 N
   H 2SO 4 . Before each set of measurements, an N 2 purge was performed to remove any remaining
 0 02  and to ensure there were no leaks in the assembly. After reactant introduction to the cell, the
   voltage was allowed to stabilize for a few minutes, after which a DC electronic load was used to
   draw incrementally higher currents from the cell. In general, in order to allow the voltage to
   stabilize, we waited about 15 seconds after each change in current. In Fig. I lc, we show the cell
   potential versus current density for tests done using a 0.1 M solution. In general, we observed a
25 nearly linear drop in potential with increasing current density indicating robust electrode kinetics
   for the redox reaction, i.e. relatively low activation overpotentials. In Fig. 1 d, we show the cell
   power density as a function of galvanic current density. The power density fell off rapidly near
   the limiting current density.
30 Example 9.
            Solutions of 9, 10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid disodium salt and HBr in 1 M
   sulfuric acid were pumped through a flow cell as outlined in Fig, 12. Circular endplates were
   machined out of solid aluminum, 3 in. x 3 in. pyrolytic graphite blocks with single-serpentine
   flow channels (channel width = 0.0625 in., channel depth = 0.08 in., landing between channels
35 0.031 in., Fuel Cell Technologies, Inc.) were used as current collectors. Pretreated 2 cm2, double
                                                      24

   stacked Toray carbon paper electrodes (each of which is about 7.5 pLm uncompressed) were used
   on both sides of the cell. Pretreatment consisted of a 10 min. sonication in isopropyl alcohol
   followed by a 30 min. immersion in hot (80 C) 6 M sulfuric acid and then a 4 hr. heat treatment
   in an air furnace at 400 "C. Nafion@ 212 (50 pm thick) was used as a proton-exchange
 5 membrane (PEM, Alfa Aesar), and PTFE gasketing was used to seal the cell assembly.
   Membrane pretreatment was done according to previously published protocols [9]. Six bolts
   (3/8"-16) torqued to 10.2 Nm completed the cell assembly, and PTFE tubing was used to
   transport reactants and products into and out of the cell. The cell was kept on a hot plate and
   wrapped in a PID-controlled heating element for temperature control, and the liquid electrolyte
 0 reservoirs were heated to improve thermal management. On the positive side of the cell, 35 mL
   of 1.75 M HBr and 0.9375 M NaHSO 4 were used as the electrolyte solution. On the negative
   side, 0.75 M 2,7-AQDS disodium salt in 1 M H 2SO 4 were used, These concentrations were used
   so that, at a 50% state of charge, no pH or total ion concentration gradients exist across the
   membrane. Measurements shown here were done at 50 'C. A Masterflex peristaltic pump was
 5 used to circulate the fluids. A CHInstruments 1 100C potentiostat was used to measure
   electrochemical properties of the battery. A potential of 1.5 volts was applied to charge the cell.
   The potential-current response (Figure 14a), potential-power (Figure 14b), and open circuit
   potential (Fig. 15) for various states of charge (SOCs) were measured. As the SOC increased
   from 20% to 90%, the open circuit potential increased linearly from 0.76 V at 0.98 V. In the
 0 galvanic direction, peak power densities were 77 mW cm-2 and 168 mW cm-2 at these same
   SOCs, respectively (Figure 14b). In order to avoid significant water splitting in the electrolytic
   direction, we used a cut-off voltage of 1.5 V, at which point the current densities observed at
   20% and 90% SOCs were         630 mA cm-2 and      196 mA cm 2 , respectively, with corresponding
   power densities of    939 mW cm- 2 and      291 mW cm-2. As an investigation of the reproducibility
25 and durability of the QBFB, the voltage was cycled  0.6 V away from the open circuit potential
   (0.85 V @ 50% SOC) one hundred times for one minute each. The current density at the end of
   each cycle (Fig. 15, inset) was constant over the time scale of the experiment, and indicated that
   there were no immediate degradation, fouling, or crossover issues in the cell.
30 Example 10.
           Performance characteristics of a quinone-bromine flow battery were measured under
   identical conditions to Example 9, except for the following: A 0.1 M solution of 9,10
   anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid in 1 M sulfuric acid was used for the negative electrolyte
   solution; 0.2 M HBr in 1 M sulfuric acid was used as the positive electrolyte solution;
                                                     25

   Interdigitated flow channels (channel width = 0.0625 in.. channel depth = 0.08 in., landing
   between channels = 0.031 in., Fuel Cell Technologies, Inc.) were used as current collectors;
   Pretreated 2 cm 2 , stacked (6x) Toray carbon paper electrodes (each of which is about 7.5 pm
   uncompressed) were used on both sides of the cell - pretreatment consisted of a 10 minute
 5 sonication in isopropyl alcohol followed by a five hour soak in a hot (50 *C) mixture of
   undiluted sulfuric and nitric acids in a 3:1 volumetric ratio. Constant-current cycling data were
   collected at 0.2 A cm 2 . The cycles were highly reproducible and indicate that columbic
   efficiencies for the battery were, at a minimum, around 95% (Figure 13d).
 0 Example 11
            Performance characteristics of a quinone-bromine flow battery were measured under
   identical conditions to Example 10, except for the following: 120 mL of 2 M HBr and 0.5 M Br 2
   were used as the positive electrolyte solution; 1 M 2,7-AQDS in 2 M H2 SO 4 was used as the
   negative electrolyte solution. As the SOC increased from 10% to 90%, the open circuit potential
 5 increased linearly from 0.69 V to 0.92 V (Figure 13a, inset). In the galvanic direction, peak
   power densities were 0.246 W cm-2 and 0.600 W cm-2 at these same SOCs, respectively (Figure
    13b). In order to avoid significant water splitting in the electrolytic direction, we used a cut-off
   voltage of 1.5 V, at which point the current densities observed at 10% and 90% SOCs were
                 -2                 -2
     2.25 A Cm      and 0.95 A cm . respectively, with corresponding power densities of 3.342 W
 0 cm-2 and     1.414 W cm-2 . The cell was cycled at 500 mA cm-2, and the voltage was recorded
   (Figure 16). This showed a coulombic efficiency of over 93 % and no loss in charge capacity
   over the course of 10 cycles and 100 hours.
   Example 12
25          50 mg of 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid was dissolved in 0.4 mL of D2 0 was
   treated with 100 pL of Br 2 . The IH and   13C NMR spectra (Figs. 17 and 18, a and b) were
   unchanged from the starting material after standing for 20 hours at 25 'C. 50 mg of AQDS was
   then treated with 1 mL of concentrated HBr and 100 pL of Br 2 . The reaction was heated to
    100'C for 48 h and evaporated to dryness at that temperature. The resulting solid was fully
30 dissolved in D2 0 giving unchanged 1H and      1C  NMR (Figs. 17 and 18, c); however, the IH NMR
   reference was shifted due to residual acid. 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid demonstrated
   no reaction with 2 M HBr and bromine when heated to 100 'C for two days (Figs. 17 and 18),
   meaning that bromine crossover will not lead to irreversible destruction of AQDS.
                                                      26

  Example 13
          1 mM solutions of the quinones listed in the following table were prepared in 1 M
  sulfuric acid solution. The pH of the solutions was 0. Half-cell electrochemical data were
  recorded using a working electrode consisting of a flat 3 mm diameter disk of glassy carbon, a
5 coiled platinum wire as a counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCI reference electrode. Cyclic
  voltammograms were recorded using sweep rates of 25 mV/s. The E0 was measured for each
  quinone by taking the average voltage value of the anodic and cathodic current density peaks and
  adding 0.210 V to convert form the Ag/AgCl reference to the standard hydrogen electrode
  (SHE).
