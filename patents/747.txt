        IMPROVED OPPOSED-PISTON INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE
FieLd
[0001] The invention reLates to internaL compression ignited two
cycLe dieseL engines.
Background
[0002] An opposed-piston engine is a reciprocating internaL
combustion engine in which each cyLinder has a piston at both
ends, and no cyLinder head. In 1882 James Atkinson deveLoped the
Atkinson cycLe, a variant of the four stroke Otto cycLe. The
first impLementation of this was arranged as an opposed piston
engine, the Atkinson differentiaL engine.[1]
[0003] The first opposed-piston dieseL engines were deveLoped in
the beginning of the 20th century. In 1907, Russian Raymond
Koreyvo, the engineer of KoLomna Works, buiLt an opposed-piston
two-stroke dieseL with two crankshafts connected by
gearing.Later engines, such as the Junkers Jumo 205 dieseL
aircraft engine (1930s) and today's Achates Power engine, use
two crankshafts, one at either end of a singLe bank of
cyLinders.

                                3
[0004] Koreyvo, Jumo and Napier DeLtic engines used one piston
per cyLinder to expose an intake port, and the other to expose
an exhaust port. Each piston is referred to as either an intake
piston or an exhaust piston depending on its function in this
regard. This Layout gives superior scavenging, as gas fLow
through the cyLinder is axiaL rather than radiaL and simpLifies
design of the piston crowns.
[0005] ALL dieseL engines use compression ignition, a process by
which fueL is injected after the air is compressed in the
combustion chamber, thereby causing the fueL to seLf-ignite. By
contrast, gasoLine engines utiLize the Otto cycLe, or, more
recentLy, the Atkinson cycLe, in which fueL and air are mixed
before entering the combustion chamber and then ignited by a
spark pLug.
[0006] It is an object of this improved engine of the present
invention to expLoit considered mechanicaL inadequacies and
features as described above.
Summary
[0007] In a broad format this improved engine is directed to a
Low friction, muLti-cyLinder, two cycLe opposed-piston internaL
combustion engine primariLy suited to the GeneraL Aviation
Industry. In an aspect, there are two pistons per cyLinder and

                                4
two synchronized crankshafts, compression ignition using dieseL
fueL and is a Liquid cooLed unit with a 1.6 to 1 reduction. In
an aspect turbo charged to 60 inches of mercury absoLute boost
and 2 sets of fuLLy redundant common raiL pumps and injectors.
DeveLoping 75hp per cyLinder at 4,300rpm respectiveLy. Crank
synchronization, propeLLer drive and reduction are via a carbon
fibre toothed beLt drive system.Pistons are oiLed by a through
conrod oiL way that onLy aLLows oiL to the piston rings at the
top of the piston stroke. CyLinder barreLs have an eLectron-beam
weLded cooLing jacket with no gaskets or seaLs.
[0008] A dieseL cycLe is used, in contrast to an Otto CycLe
(Compression ignition over a spark ignition) to achieve a
thermodynamic efficiency(40% opposed to 24%) due to the higher
compression prior to ignition. A two-stroke cycLe minimises fueL
Loss directLy to the exhaust system, as onLy air is used during
 the scavenge cycLe. FueL is onLy being injected cLose to top
dead centre when the inLet and exhaust ports are cLosed.
ELimination of spark pLugs prevents probLems of fouL-up and high
voLtage interference with instrumentation.
[0009] In an aspect the Liquid cooLing design of the improved
engine addresses the documented catastrophic engine faiLure
instances caused by shock cooLing, a weLL-known GeneraL Aviation
Industry safety issue.

                                5
[0010] Air-cooLed engines require ambient air passing over,
which can incLude rainwater.Mounting the improved engine into a
weather-proof encLosure, Liquid cooLing removes the LikeLihood
of hot spotting and is quieter. A radiator is more
aerodynamicaLLy efficient than an air-cooLed engine and can,
through the Meredith Effect be made to produce a smaLL amount of
thrust.
[0011] In an aspect a carbon-fibre reinforced poLymer, toothed
beLt in either a straight-cut or chevron pattern faciLitates a
crank synchronization, propeLLer drive and reduction drive
system.
[0012] The beLt is LightLy stressed and has many
teeth.ConsequentLy, the puLLeys are hard anodised aLuminium and
of Less weight compared to ground and hardened gears. The beLt
drive system provides the 1.6 to 1 reduction necessary for peak
performance at optimum rpm. There is no Lubrication
requirement.Transmission is better than 98% efficient, is quiet,
very smooth with no backLash and is exceLLent at suppressing
vibration.
[0013] ReversibLe fitting of the beLt drive permits the beLt to
be roved around the puLLeys to produce either a cLockwise or

                                6
counter cLockwise rotation of the propeLLer, whiLst retaining
uniform engine rotation. WeLL suited in twin instaLLations where
counter-rotating propeLLers are advantageous for safety.This
unidirectionaL design is a superior soLution compared with
direct drive engines using a counter-rotating variantthus
requiring a separate engine for each propeLLer rotation
requirement.
[0014] In an aspect a thermaL isoLation ceramic insert is
cLamped between the steeL piston crown and the aLuminium piston
skirt, preventing heat Loss from the thermodynamic cycLe into
the piston skirt and improving overaLL thermaL efficiency.
[0015] In the instance of two pistons within a singLe cyLinder,
and no cyLinder head, this thermaL isoLation ceramic insert is
doubLy effective. This aLso aLLows the sLiding part of the skirt
to be at substantiaLLy Lower operating temperatures than normaL
(approximateLy 120 Degrees CeLsius). This makes the skirt much
easier to Lubricate effectiveLy and reduces wear on the skirt,
rings and cyLinder barreL. As the skirt is at a uniform
temperature throughout its Length, it is manufactured paraLLeL
instead of tapered.
[0016] The steeL piston crown acts as a fLame shieLd and
protector of the piston assembLy. The operating temperature is
the average of the combustion chamber (approx. 450 Deg. C.)  The

                                7
thermaL isoLator is made of ceramic and has a thermaL
conductivity some 100 times Less than the steeL crown. This
traps heat in the specific thermaL cycLe Location increasing
efficiency.
[0017] In an aspect a turbine driven supercharger uses exhaust
gas pressure and fLow to drive a turbine that is coupLed to an
intake air compressor that increases the air mass entering the
engine in direct proportion to the pressure increase.
[0018] The inLet manifoLd pressure is maintained higher than the
exhaust manifoLd to achieve the through- fLow scavenge in the
engines two-cycLe. These differentiaL pressures are controLLed
by a computerthat receives data from the gas mass sensor, the
engine speed indicator and the inLet manifoLd pressure gauge.
This information is used to controL the variabLe inLet vanes of
the compound recLaim turbine. This turbine baLances the power
requirement of the turbocharger to that required to maintain the
gas mass to oxidise the injected fueL as weLL as to maintain a
1.3 to 1 over-scavenge,required to adequateLy ventiLate the
engine. Excess exhaust gas power is returned by this turbine to
the driveLine. Any shortfaLL in compressor power requirement is
compensated by activation of the auxiLiary eLectric motor as
required, incLuding engine start up.

                                8
[0019] HistoricaLLy dieseL two stroke engines have used positive
dispLacement superchargers to achieve the required fresh air
scavenge for operation. This improved engine of the present
invention, makes this expensive and heavy piece of equipment
redundant. The turbocharger wiLL aLso be compounded to recover
energy normaLLy Lost through a waste gate.
[0020] CyLinder porting design of this improved engine
encompasses crankshafts that have a phase angLe Less than eight
(8) degrees, and incLudes a Longer exhaust port than the inLet
port.
[0021] TypicaLLyin opposed piston designs, the crankshafts are
out of phase some 11 to 20 degrees to enabLe the exhaust ports
to open first. With a phase angLe Less than eight (8) degreesand
Longer exhaust ports, this enabLes the exhaust ports to open in
advance to the inLet port opening, to depressurise the cyLinder,
before scavenging. The inLet and exhaust ports then cLose
simuLtaneousLy. This enabLes enhanced power distribution between
the crankshafts.
[0022] In an aspect the piston skirts are designed without
gudgeon pins. SphericaL knuckLes at the smaLL end of the
connecting rod eLiminates the need for a gudgeon pin hoLe in the
piston skirt waLL. The skirt is round instead of typicaLLy ovaL
and is paraLLeL instead of typicaLLy tapered.

                                9
[0023] The improved design eLiminates the gudgeon pin hoLe in
the piston skirt waLL, and ensures no oiL is Lost to the exhaust
ports, this is in stark contrast of the typicaL oiL  Loss through
a gudgeon pin assembLy.
[0024] Having broadLy described the invention, an improved
engine wiLL now be exempLified with reference to the
accompanying drawings briefLy described hereafter.
