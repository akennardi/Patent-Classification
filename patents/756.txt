COUPLED FIBRES IN COMPOSITE ARTICLES
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application
No. 2014360838, which claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 12/968,575 filed
on 15 December 2010, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
FIELD
[0002] The present disclosure relates generally to composites and, more particularly, to fibre
reinforced composite structures having coupled fibres for improved ballistic performance.
BACKGROUND
[0003] Composite structures typically comprise a matrix reinforced with fibres wherein the
fibres are embedded in the matrix. Composite structures are designed to transmit loads along
the length of the fibres. Loads from one fibre may be transferred to another fibre in the same
layer or to fibres in an adjacent layer by passing through the matrix material. However, the
matrix is typically weaker than the fibres such that when a sufficiently high load is transmitted
from one fibre to another fibre across the matrix, the matrix will fail. The failure of the matrix
allows the fibres to move laterally within the composite structure.
[0004] During a ballistic event where a composite panel may be impacted by a projectile, the
ability of the fibres to move laterally or sideways is generally detrimental to the overall ballistic
performance of the composite panel. For example, the ability of the fibres in the matrix to move
laterally allows the projectile to wedge between the fibres. The wedging of the projectile
between the fibres allows the projectile to penetrate the thickness of a composite panel without
fracturing the fibres. In this regard, lateral movement of the fibres and subsequent wedging of a
projectile reduces the ballistic performance capabilities of the panel.
[0005] As can be seen, there exists a need in the art for a composite structure that provides
reduced susceptibility to lateral movement of the fibres such that ballistic performance may be
improved. Reduced susceptibility to lateral movement of the fibres may also result in an

                                                      2
improvement in the structural performance of a composite structure during static and/or quasi
static loading of the composite structure.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0067] Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating
preferred and various embodiments of the disclosure, shown in Figure 1 is an embodiment of a
composite structure 10. The composite structure 10 may be fabricated as a fibre-reinforced
composite panel 14 comprising a substantially optically transparent and/or infrared transparent
polymeric matrix 22 and a plurality of likewise substantially optically-transparent and/or
infrared-transparent fibres 30 which may be embedded within the polymeric matrix 22.
Although illustrated in Figure 1 in a panel 14 configuration having panel surfaces 16, the
composite structure 10 may be provided in any one of a wide variety of sizes, shapes and
configurations, without limitation, and may include planar and/or compound curvature surfaces.
[0068] Referring to Figure 2, shown is an exploded illustration of the panel 14 of Figure 1 and
illustrating a plurality of the fibres 30 which are formed as strips having an elongated cross
sectional shape and being arranged in layers 60. In Figure 2, the middle fibre is indicated by
reference numeral 31. The fibres 30 in any of the layers 60 may be provided in any size, shape
and configuration and are not limited to elongated cross-sectional shapes. In any of the
embodiments disclosed herein, the fibres 30 may be oriented in substantially parallel relation to
one another in any given layer 60 although non-parallel orientations of fibres 30 within a layer
60 are contemplated. Advantageously, the composite structure 10 as disclosed herein provides

                                                  10
for coupling of the fibres 30 to one another at one or more connection sites 80 as schematically
illustrated in Figure 2. For example, Figure 2 illustrates three of the layers 60, each including a
plurality of fibres 30 arranged substantially parallel to one another. The fibres 30 in each one of
the layers 60 are connected to adjacent fibres 30 at a plurality of connection sites 80 which may
be spaced at any desired interval along a length of one or more of the fibres 30. The coupling of
the fibres 30 at one or more connection sites 80 may facilitate interaction and/or cooperation
between adjacent fibres 30 and/or non-adjacent fibres 30 which may significantly alter load
paths (e.g., the direction and/or length of the load paths) through the composite structure 10 and
may limit damage propagation through the composite structure 10 such as may occur during a
failure event such as a ballistic impact event. Furthermore, in any embodiment disclosed herein,
the addition of fibre 30 coupling at one or more connection sites 80 may advantageously
improve and/or control the mechanical properties of the composite structure 10 including
improving properties such as interlaminar shear strength, delamination resistance, stiffness,
compression strength, fracture toughness, and damage tolerance of the composite structure 10.
[0069] Although Figure 2 illustrates connection sites 80 which are schematically represented as
relatively thin lines extending between generally flattened fibres 30 of a composite structure 10.
It should be noted that in the schematic illustrations of Figure 1-9 and in the schematic
illustrations of Figures 13A-33, the fibres 30 in each layer 60 are shown at an exaggerated
spacing from one another to illustrate the concept of coupling the fibres 30 at one or more
connection sites 80. However, the fibres 30 in a layer 60 of an actual composite structure 10
may be spaced in relatively close proximity to one another and, in some examples, the parallel
fibres 30 in each layer 60 may be in contact with one another, but may only be coupled to one
another at one or more connection sites 80. In addition, the schematic illustrations of Figures 1
4 show the fibres 30 in an exaggerated cross-sectional size relative to the size of the composite
structure 10. For example, although Figure 2 shows seven (7) individual fibres 30 in each of the
three (3) layer 60 of the composite structure 10, an actual composite structure 10 may have tens
of thousands or more fibres 30 in each layer 60. Furthermore, an actual composite structure 10
may have hundred of layers 60. In addition, in an actual composite structure 10, the thickness of
each fibre 30 may be relatively small. For example, the thickness of each fibre 30 may be may
be in the range of from approximately 5 microns to approximately 5,000 microns (e.g., 0.0002
to 0.20 inch). However, the fibres 30 may be provided in any fibre thickness 50, without
limitation.

                                                  11
[0070] The schematic representation of the connection sites 80 in Figure 2 illustrate in-plane
coupling 82 of the fibres 30 in each layer 60. However, the present disclosure contemplates out
of-plane coupling 84 of fibres 30 or combinations of in-plane coupling 82 and out-of-plane
coupling 84 of the fibres 30 in any one of a variety of different arrangements as described
below. Fibres 30 may be coupled at one or more connection sites 80 using one or more
connection types 88 including, but not limited to, adhesive bonding, chemical bonding, thermal
fusing, mechanical pinning, and/or other suitable connection types. Adhesive bonding may
comprise bonding the fibres 30 at the connection sites 80 using a suitable adhesive. Chemical
bonding may comprise reactively bonding the outer surfaces of fibres 30 at locations where
fibres 30 come into contact with one another as a result of the chemical composition of the fibre
30 materials, as described below. Thermal fusing may comprise locally heating the fibres 30 at
each connection site 80 to fuse or weld the fibres 30 together at each connection site 80. For
example, the fibres 30 may be locally heated by a laser (not shown) at each connection site 80 to
a temperature above the glass transition temperature of the fibres 30 in order to fuse the fibres
30 together.
[0071] The technical effect of the coupling of fibres 30 to one another at the connection sites 80
is in an improvement of the composite structure 10 in resisting penetration of a projectile
through the composite structure 10. More specifically, by coupling the fibres 30 to one another
at one or more connection sites 80 throughout the composite structure 10, the ability of a
projectile in wedging between the fibres 30 is reduced. Furthermore, the coupling of the fibres
30 to one another at one or more connection sites 80 throughout the composite structure 10
provides a means for controlling the size or area of the composite structure 10 that may be
damaged as a result of impact by a projectile. In this regard, the coupling of the fibres 30 at one
or more connection sites 80 throughout the composite structure 10 provides a means for tuning
or tailoring the stiffness of the composite structure 10 for improving ballistic performance such
as during a ballistic event when fibres 30 may be subjected to relatively high strain rates. In
addition, coupling of fibres 30 may be applied to composite structures 10 that are subjected to
static loading and/or quasi-static loading to improve the structural performance of such
composite structures 10.
[0072] Referring to Figure 3, shown is an enlarged perspective illustration of the composite
structure 10 illustrating the fibres 30 arranged in layers 60 within the matrix 22. In Figure 3,
each one of the layers 60 includes fibres 30 oriented substantially parallel to one another. The

                                                     12
fibres 30 in each layer 60 are oriented perpendicularly relative to the fibre 30 in adjacent layers
60 forming a cross-ply configuration 72 of the composite structure 10 similar to that which is
illustrated in Figure 2. However, for any of the embodiments disclosed herein, the fibres 30
may be arranged in any orientation relative to one another within the composite structure 10 and
are not limited to the arrangements illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. For example, the fibres 30 in
each one of the layers 60 may be oriented parallel to the fibres 30 in adjacent layers 60 forming
a unidirectional configuration 70 (Figure 6) of the composite structure 10. Even further, the
fibres 30 in any given layer 60 may be oriented at any angle, without limitation, relative to the
orientation of the fibres 30 in adjacent layers 60. For example, in any of the embodiments
disclosed herein, the fibres 30 of one layer 60 may be oriented at any non-perpendicular angle
(i.e., 150. 22.50, 450, 60', 750, etc.) relative to the fibres 30 of an adjacent one of the layers 60.
[0073] Although the composite structure 10 is illustrated in Figure 3 as having three layers 60 of
fibres 30, any number of layers 60 may be provided. For example, the composite structure 10
may contain a single layer 60 of fibres 30 or tens or hundreds of layers 60. In any of the
embodiments disclosed herein, the fibres 30 in one or more of the layers 60 may be arranged to
be in contacting or non-contacting relation with the fibres 30 of adjacent layers 60. For
example, the matrix 22 may hold the fibres 30 in non-contacting relation to one another.
However, in some embodiments, the layers 60 of fibres 30 arranged in non-contacting relation
with the exception of the coupling of the fibres 30 at the connection sites 80 as illustrated in
Figures 2 and 3 and illustrated in alternative embodiments in Figures 5-9 as discussed below.
For example, Figures 3-4 schematically illustrate in an exaggerated manner the layers 60 spaced
apart so that the fibres 30 are in non-contacting relation to one another. However, the layers 60
may be arranged to be in generally contacting relation to one another in a matrix 22. Some of
the fibres may be in contact with one another at some location along the length of the fibres 30,
and at other locations, there may be a relatively thin film of matrix 22 between the layers 60.
The spacing between the layers 60 is dependent in part upon the thickness of the matrix 22
surrounding or coating each fibre 30. For example, the fibres 30 may be provided as prepreg
fibres 30 having a coating of matrix 22 surrounding the fibre 30.
[0074] During fabrication of the composite structure 10 in a process well known in the art, the
fibres 30 may be laid on top of one another in layers 60 and may be heated to soften and allow
intermingling of the matrix 22 between the adjacent fibres 30, after which the composite
structure 10 is cooled to solidify the matrix 22 and resulting in the finished composite structure

                                                   13
10. The thickness of the matrix 22 on each fibre 30 will determine the spacing between the
layers 60 of fibres 30. During the design of the composite structure 10, the matrix 22 coating
thickness on the fibres 30 can be selected to achieve a desired fibre-volume fraction of the
composite structure 10, as known in the art. A composite structure 10 with layers 60 spaced
relatively far apart will have fewer total fibres 30 and therefore a lower total volume of fibres 30
(i.e., a lower fibre-volume fraction) than a composite structure 10 with layers 60 spaced closer
together. In this regard, the fibre-volume fraction represents the total volume of fibres 30 in the
cured composite structure 10 relative to the total volume of the cured composite structure 10.
[0075] A cured composite structure 10 with a relatively high fibre-volume fraction may have
higher specific strength and/or higher specific stiffness than a cured composite structure 10 with
a lower fibre-volume fraction. Therefore, as is well known in the art, for some applications, it
may be desirable to design and fabricate the composite structure 10 to have a relatively high
fibre-volume fraction. In some examples, the fibre-volume fraction of a composite structure 10
may be in the range of from approximately 50-70 percent although a higher fibre-volume
fraction may be achievable. However, the composite structure 10 must typically include enough
matrix 22 material to hold the fibres 30 in position relative to one another during the life of the
composite structure 10 such that a fibre-volume fraction of 100 percent (i.e., the composite
structure 10 contains no matrix 22) is typically undesirable. It should be noted that the specific
strength and specific stiffness that may be desired in a composite structure 10 may be different
for different applications. In addition, as is well known in the art, the fibre-volume fraction of a
composite structure 10, and whether the layers 60 are in contacting or non-contacting relation,
may be based upon manufacturing considerations, weight considerations, cost considerations,
and a variety of other considerations.
[0076] Referring to Figure 4, shown is a cross-sectional illustration of a composite structure 10
similar to that which is illustrated in Figure 3 and illustrating an embodiment of the arrangement
of the fibres 30 in three (3) layers 60 within the matrix 22. In Figure 4, the middle fibre located
between the upper and lower layers 60 is indicated by reference numeral 31. As can be seen in
Figure 4, the two fibres 30 in the upper layer 60 and in the lower layer 60 may be provided with
an elongated cross-sectional shape having relatively flattened or substantially planar fibre 30
faces, e.g., upper and lower surfaces 44 and 46, to minimize scattering of light that may
otherwise occur when light strikes or passes through a curved surface. The middle fibre in

                                                   14
Figure 4 is shown in side view in correspondence to the orientation of the fibres 30, 31 in Figure
3 from which Figure 4 is taken.
[0077] Advantageously, the substantially planar configuration of the fibre 30 upper and lower
surfaces 44, 46 reduces optical distortion of the composite structure 10. For example where the
composite structure 10 is a transparency such as a window of a building or a vehicle, the
reduction in optical distortion may improve optical clarity of objects observed through the
composite structure 10. The generally elongated cross-sectional shape of the fibres 30 is
preferably provided with a relatively high aspect ratio which may be defined as the ratio of the
fibre width 52 to fibre thickness 50. In any of the embodiments disclosed herein, the fibres 30
may be provided with an elongated cross-sectional shape having relatively flattened or
substantially planar fibre faces and wherein the fibres have an aspect ratio may vary from
approximately 3 to approximately 500 although the fibre 30 cross section may be provided in
any aspect ratio. Furthermore, the fibre thickness 50 may be provided in any suitable thickness.
In any of the embodiments disclosed herein, the thickness of the fibre 30 may be in the range of
from approximately 5 microns to approximately 5,000 microns (e.g., 0.0002 to 0.20 inch).
However, the fibre 30 may be provided in any fibre thickness 50, without limitation.
[0078] Referring still to Figure 4, the elongated cross-sectional shape of a fibre 30 may include
the pair of substantially planar fibre 30 faces (i.e., upper and lower surfaces 44, 46) which are
preferably oriented to be substantially parallel to the structure surface 12 of the composite
structure 10. However, in any of the embodiments disclosed herein, the fibres 30 may be
embedded and oriented within the matrix 22 such that the fibre 30 faces are arranged in any
orientation relative to the structure surface 12. Although illustrated as being substantially
planar, the fibre 30 faces may be slightly curved including slightly concave, slightly convex or
crowned and are not limited to a strictly substantially planar or flat profile. Even further, it is
contemplated that the fibre 30 faces may include one or more surface features (not shown) on
one or more of the fibre 30 faces and are not limited to the strictly rectangular elongated cross
sectional shape illustrated in Figure 4.
[0079] Figure 4 schematically illustrates a cross-section of the composite structure 10 of Figure
3. As indicated above, the fibres in the composite structure 10 of Figure 3 are in a cross-ply
configuration 72 as known in the art wherein the lengthwise direction of the fibres 30 in each
layer 60 are oriented perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of the fibres 30 in the adjacent

                                                  15
layers 60. In this regard, Figure 4 shows a cross-section of the fibres 30 in the upper, middle,
and lower layers 60 taken along line 4 of Figure 3. In the upper layer 60 of Figure 4, the cross
section is perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of the fibres 30 in the upper layer 60. In the
middle layer 60 of Figure 4, the cross-section of the fibre 31 is parallel to the lengthwise
direction of the fibre 31 in the middle layer 60. In the lower layer 60 of Figure 4, the cross
section is perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of the fibres 30 in the lower layer 60.
[0080] In the upper and lower layers 60, the side edges 48 of adjacent fibres 30 are shown
spaced apart from one another. However, in an embodiment not shown, the fibres 30 in a layer
60 may be arranged such that a side edges 48 of a fibre 30 are placed in contacting relation with
the side edges 48 of an adjacent one of the fibres 30 (e.g., see Figures 35-36). However, as
stated above, the fibres 30 may be arranged in any desirable spacing and are not limited to the
fibre 30 spacing illustrated in Figure 4.
[0081] Referring now to Figure 5, shown is a schematic illustration of a layer 60 of parallel
fibres 30 separated from one another. In this regard, Figure 5 schematically illustrates
connection sites 80 coupling the fibres 30 in an in-plane coupling 82 arrangement, similar to the
in-plane coupling 82 arrangement illustrated in Figure 2. The fibres 30 are illustrated in
relatively heavy line weight and may be selectively coupled at connection sites 80, which are
illustrated in relatively lighter line weights compared to the line weights representing the fibres
30. The arrangement of fibres 30 in Figure 5 represents a single layer 60 wherein the fibres 30
may be connected to one another at at least one connection site 80.
[0082] The fibres 30 illustrated in Figure 5 may be selectively coupled to one another at the
connection sites 80 using a connection type 88 which may have connection qualities 100 as
described in detail below, to provide the desired response of the composite structure 10 during
an impact event. More specifically, Figure 5 illustrates a first fibre 32 and a second fibre 34 of
the plurality of fibres 30 which may be connected to one another at a plurality of connection
sites 80. In any of the embodiments disclosed herein, the connection sites 80 may be distributed
in a variety of arrangements along the lengths of the fibres 30. For example, Figure 5 illustrates
a relatively uniform spacing 86 of the connection sites 80 along the length of the fibres 30.
However, the connection sites 80 connecting the adjacent fibres 30 may be spaced at a
predetermined periodicity along the length of the fibres 30 as described in greater detail below.

                                                  16
[0083] The first and second fibres 32, 34 may be connected to one another at a plurality of the
connection sites 80 by adhesive bonding, fusing, and/or mechanical pinning or other suitable
connection types 88. Adhesive bonding may comprise bonding the fibres 30 at the connection
sites 80 using a suitable adhesive such as epoxy to directly bond the fibres 30 to one another at
the connection sites 80. However, other suitable adhesives may be used to bond the fibres 30
together at the connection sites 80. In another embodiment, the connection type 88 may
comprise fusing or welding the fibres 30 together at the connection sites 80. For example, the
fibres 30 may be locally heated above the glass transition temperature or melt temperature of the
fibres 30 or fibre coating in order to fuse or weld the fibres 30 together. In some embodiment,
the side edges 48 (Figure 4) of the fibres 30 in a layer 60 may be placed in contacting relation to
the side edges 48 of adjacent fibres 30 in the same layer 60. The side edges 48 may be locally
heated to locally fuse or weld the fibres 30 together to form a connection site 80. In a further
embodiment illustrated in Figure 31-33, the fibres 30 may be provided as core-sheath fibres 56
which may be described as having a core 57 surrounded by a fusible sheath 58 formed of fusible
material. A fusible sheath 58 is fusible in the sense the fusible sheaths 58 of two core-sheath
fibres 56 may be placed in contact with one another at at least one location and the fusible
sheaths 58 may be locally heated at the location of contact to melt and fuse together the fusible
sheaths 58 at that location. The fusible sheath 58 may be formed of any material, without
limitation, including metallic material, ceramic material, composite material (e.g., epoxy,
thermoplastic material, etc.). For example, the fusible sheath 58 may be formed of
thermoplastic material which may be thermoplastically fused to the fusible sheath 58 of another
fibre 30 at a connection site 80, as described in greater detail below.
[0084] Referring still to Figure 5, in a further embodiment, the fibres 30 may be locally
mechanically coupled by mechanical pinning. For example, surface features for mechanically
coupling the fibres 30 together at the connection sites 80 may be introduced onto the side edges
48 (Figure 4) of the fibres 30 to couple the fibres 30 together. In this regard, any suitable
portion of the fibres 30 may be mechanically coupled together at the connection site 80. In a
non-limiting embodiment, the mechanical pinning may comprise increasing the surface
roughness at a local point along the fibres 30 to reduce or prevent relative axial movement of the
fibres 30. In a further embodiment, notches (not shown), scallops (not shown) or other features
may be applied to the fibre surfaces 42 (Figure 4) to mechanically pin the fibres 30 together and
restrict or resist relative axial movement of the fibres 30 relative to one another. The coupling
or connection between the fibres 30 may limit the degree of relative movement of the fibres 30.

                                                   17
More specifically, the connection of the fibres 30 to one another at the connection sites 80 may
limit the degree of movement of the fibres 30 relative to one another and/or limit the movement
of the fibres 30 relative to the matrix 22.
[0085] The selection of the connection type 88 may be based upon the desired degree of
connectivity. For example, a connection type 88 may be selected to provide a connection failure
strain that may be lower than the failure strain of the matrix 22 to limit the amount of movement
of the fibres 30 relative to one another. In the context of the present disclosure, strain comprises
failure strain which represents the strain at which the connection between fibres 30 fails or
breaks. In addition, in the context of any one of the embodiments disclosed herein, properties
such as strength, strain, and elastic modulus are in terms of dynamic properties and/or quasi
static properties. Connection quality 100 may be represented as the connection strength,
connection failure strain, and the elastic modulus at a connection site 80. Connection strength
may represent the magnitude of the force required to break the connection at a connection site
80 between fibres. Connection strength may be characterized in terms of absolute value or
relative value. For example, absolute value of the connection strength at a connection site 80
may be characterized in terms of pounds of force required to break a connection between two
fibres 30. Connection strength may also be characterized in relative terms as a percentage of the
strength of the matrix material within the composite structure 10. Connection failure strain may
represent the strain at which the connection between fibres 30 fails or breaks, and may be
characterized as a percentage (plus or minus) of the failure strain of the matrix 22 as discussed
above. Elastic modulus of a connection site 80 may be described as the tensile modulus or
Young's modulus of the connection site 80 and may be characterized as the relative stiffness or
tendency of a connection between fibres 30 to stretch when a force is applied.
[0086] In an arrangement wherein the connection type 88 comprises a relatively low connection
strain, a relatively strong interaction may occur between the coupled fibres 30 during an impact
event. In an embodiment, the connection between the fibres 30 may be characterized as a
connection having a failure strain that differs by at least approximately 25% relative to the
failure strain of the matrix 22. For example, the connection may have a failure strain that is at
least 25% higher than the failure strain of the matrix 22. Alternatively, the connection may have
a failure strain that is at least 25% lower than the failure strain of the matrix 22. However, the
connection may include a failure strain comprising any percentage of the failure strain of the
matrix 22.

                                                  18
[0087] In addition, the connection between fibres 30 such as the first and second fibres 32, 34
illustrated in Figure 5 may be defined by a connection strength relative to the tensile strength of
the matrix 22. In any one of the embodiments disclosed herein, the connection strength between
the fibres 30 may be characterized as a connection having a tensile strength that differs by at
least approximately 25% relative to the tensile strength of the matrix 22. For example, the
connection strength may be 25% higher than the tensile strength of the matrix 22. Alternatively,
the connection strength may be 25% lower than the tensile strength of the matrix 22. However,
the connection strength may include a tensile strength comprising any percentage of the tensile
strength of the matrix 22 and is not limited to a connection strength that differs by at least
approximately 25% relative to the tensile strength of the matrix 22.
[0088] Figure 5 illustrates the coupling of fibres 30 in an in-plane coupling 82 configuration
wherein the fibres 30 that are coupled are located immediately adjacent to one another in the
same layer 60. In this regard, although the Figures generally illustrate coupling of adjacent
fibres 30, it is contemplated that coupling of the fibres 30 may include coupling of non-adjacent
fibres 30. As can be seen in Figure 5, a first layer 62 includes first and second fibres 32, 34 that
are located adjacent to one another and are coupled to one another at connection sites 80. In the
present application, the first layer 62 may designate any layer 60 with a layer stack 66 of a
composite structure 10 and may include an outermost layer 60 (e.g., a top layer 60 or a bottom
layer 60) of a layer stack 66 or an internal layer 60 within a layer stack 66. In any embodiment
disclosed herein, the connection sites 80 may be spaced at any desired interval including a
pattern or periodicity of spacing 86. Such a pattern or periodicity of spacing 86 may facilitate
manufacturing of the fibres 30 and/or composite structure 10. However, the spacing 86 of the
connection sites 80 in any of the figures may be random or a combination of random and
periodic spacing 86 of the connection sites 80 and which may vary in any desired manner in
order to achieve a desired failure response of any given portion of the composite structure 10 as
described in greater detail below. In addition, the connection sites 80 connecting fibres 30 in a
given layer 60 may be arranged in a global connection site pattern 110 as illustrated in the non
limiting examples of Figures 24-33 and as described in greater detail below.
[0089] Referring still to Figure 5, the in-plane coupling 82 of the fibres 30 may generally define
a planar layer 60 of the fibres 30 which may be described as being generally parallel to the x-y
plane of a reference coordinate system 24 as illustrated in Figure 5. Out-of-plane coupling 84 as
illustrated in Figures 6-9 may comprise coupling that is non-coincident with the x-y plane such

                                                   19
as coupling oriented generally along the z-axis of the reference coordinate system 24. However,
out-of-plane coupling 84 may include coupling at any angle relative to the x-y plane including,
but not limited to, the out-of-plane coupling 84 illustrated in Figure 9.
[0090] Figure 6 illustrates an out-of-plane coupling 84 of fibres 30 using the connection sites
80. More specifically, Figure 6 illustrates a first layer 62 and a second layer 64 each including a
plurality of fibres 30. In the present application, the first layer 62 may designate any layer 60
with a layer stack 66 of a composite structure 10, as indicated above. Likewise, the second layer
64 may designate any layer 60 with a layer stack 66 of a composite structure 10, and may
include the two (2) outermost layers 60 (e.g., the two top layers 60 or the two bottom layers 60)
of a layer stack 66, or two (2) internal layers 60 within the layer stack 66. In Figure 6, the first
layer 62 may include a first fibre 32. The second layer 64 may include a second fibre 34. The
first fibre 32 of the first layer 62 may be located adjacent to the second fibre 34 of the second
layer 64. As can be seen in Figure 6, each one of the first and second layers 62, 64 includes a
plurality of the fibres 30 which are each oriented substantially parallel to one another such that
the arrangement in Figure 6 forms a unidirectional configuration 70 of layers 60.
[0091] In Figure 6, the fibres 30 in each one of the layers 60 may be generally aligned with one
another in order to facilitate out-of-plane coupling 84 wherein the adjacently-disposed fibres 30
are connected at the connection sites 80 along a direction which may be parallel to the z-axis of
the reference coordinate system 24 illustrated in Figure 6. Although the connection sites 80 in
Figure 6 are illustrated as being arranged in a uniform spacing, the connection sites 80 may be
spaced at any one of a variety of different spacing 86 arrangements. For example, the
connection sites 80 may be spaced at a predetermined periodicity along the length of the fibres
30. The periodicity for the spacing 86 of the connection sites 80 may comprise a substantially
uniform spacing 86 as illustrated in Figures 5 and 6. However, the periodicity may comprise a
geometrically varying or progressing (i.e., progressively increasing or decreasing) spacing along
the length of the fibres 30. The connection sites 80 may be spaced in a variety of other
arrangements including random spacing or a sinusoidal periodicity of the spacing or other
suitable spacing arrangements which may be tailored for the application.
[0092] Referring now to Figure 7, shown is a further embodiment of a configuration for
selectively coupling fibres 30 and which combines the in-plane coupling 82 configuration
illustrated in Figure 5 with the out-of-plane coupling 84 configuration illustrated in Figure 6.

                                                    20
For example, Figure 7 illustrates an arrangement wherein a first layer 62 includes first and
second fibres 32, 34 and a second layer 64 includes third and fourth fibres 36, 38. The third and
fourth fibres 36, 38 are oriented substantially parallel to the first and second fibres 32, 34. In
this regard, the fibres 30 in each one of the first and second layers 62, 64 may be oriented
substantially parallel to one another such that Figure 7 illustrates a unidirectional configuration
70 of the layers 60. Figure 7 illustrates in-plane coupling 82 wherein the first and second fibres
32, 34 in the first layer 62 are illustrated as being interconnected at a plurality of the connection
sites 80. Likewise, the third and fourth fibres 36, 38 in the second layer 64 are illustrated as
being interconnected at a plurality of the connection sites 80.
[0093] In Figure 7, out-of-plane coupling 84 is provided by connecting the first fibre 32 in the
first layer 62 with the third fibre 36 in the second layer 64 and connecting the second fibre 34 in
the first layer 62 with the fourth fibre 38 in the second layer 64 using one or more connection
sites 80. Figure 7 illustrates coupling of fibres 30 which are disposed immediately adjacent to
one another. However, the present disclosure contemplates coupling of non-adjacent fibres 30.
Furthermore, Figure 7 illustrates coupling of fibres 30 in the first layer 62 which are aligned
with fibres 30 in the second layer 64. However, it is contemplated that the fibres 30 in different
layers 60 may not necessarily be vertically aligned with one another but may be horizontally
offset (i.e., relative to the y-axis).
[0094] Referring to Figure 8, shown is an arrangement illustrating fibre 30 coupling for a cross
ply configuration 72 of the layers 60. Figure 8 illustrates out-of-plane coupling 84 of the fibres
30 in one layer 60 to the fibres 30 in another layer 60. For example, in Figure 8, shown is a first
layer 62 which includes first and second fibres 32, 34 which are located immediately adjacent to
one another. As can be seen, the fibres 30 in the first layer 62 are substantially parallel to one
another. A second layer 64 in Figure 8 includes third, fourth and fifth fibres 36, 38, 40 which
are also oriented substantially parallel to one another but which are oriented substantially
perpendicularly relative to the first and second fibres 32, 34. In this regard, the first and second
layers 62, 64 illustrate a cross-ply configuration 72 of the layers 60 as implemented in the
composite structure 10 illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.
[0095] Referring still to Figure 8, it can be seen that the third and fifth fibres 36, 40 are located
immediately adjacent to the fourth fibre 38 and are located on opposite sides of the fourth fibre
38. Out-of-plane coupling 84 of the first and second layers 62, 64 may be facilitated by

                                                   21
connecting the first fibre 32 to each one of the third and fifth fibres 36, 40 at the noted
connection sites 80 which may be at the approximate location of the shortest distance between
the first fibre 32 and the third and fifth fibres 36, 40. Likewise, the second fibre 34 may be
coupled to the fourth fibre 38 at a connection site 80 located approximately at the shortest
distance between the second fibre 34 and the fourth fibre 38. The arrangement illustrated in
Figure 8 represents out-of-plane coupling 84 of the fibres 30 in a staggered arrangement.
Although Figure 8 illustrates a cross-ply arrangement wherein the fibres 30 of one layer 60 are
oriented generally perpendicular to the fibres 30 of an adjacent layer 60, a cross-ply arrangement
for any embodiment disclosed herein may include fibres 30 in one or more layers 60 being
oriented in a non-parallel angle (i.e., 150. 22.50, 450, 60', 750, etc.) relative to the fibres of any
other layer 60 in the composite structure 10.
[0096] Referring to Figure 9, shown is a variation of the embodiment illustrated in Figure 8 and
wherein Figure 9 illustrates out-of-plane coupling 84 of the first layer 62 with the adjacent fibres
30 in the second layer 64. Figure 9 additionally illustrates staggered out-of-plane coupling 84 of
non-adjacent fibres 30. For example, Figure 9 illustrates the second fibre 34 being further
connected or coupled to the third and fifth fibres 36, 40 at the location of the connection sites 80
where the third and fifth fibres 36, 40 are connected to the first fibre 32. In this regard, Figure 9
illustrates coupling of multiple fibres 30 at a single connection site 80 which may provide
improved or stronger interaction between the coupled fibres 30 relative to fibre 30 coupling
having only a single connection at a single connection site 80.
[0097] Figures 5-9 illustrate configurations for coupling fibres 30 in different layers 60 to
achieve a desired response in the composite structure 10 such as to an impact event. For
example, Figures 5-9 illustrate in-plane coupling 82, out-of-plane coupling 84 and combinations
of in-plane coupling 82 and out-of-plane coupling 84 for adjacent and non-adjacent fibres 30
and for unidirectional configurations 70 and cross-ply configurations 72. However, as was
earlier indicated, the fibres 30 of one layer 60 may be arranged at any orientation relative to the
fibres 30 of adjacent layers 60 including any non-perpendicular orientation relative to the fibres
30 of adjacent layers 60 and are not limited to unidirectional configurations 70 and cross-ply
configurations 72.
[0098] For any one of the embodiments disclosed herein, the fibres 30 and/or the matrix 22 may
be comprised of any substantially optically-transparent material and/or infrared-transparent

                                                    22
material. Optical transparency may include transparency in the visible spectrum. Infrared
transparency may include transparency in the infrared spectrum. However, for applications
where optical transparency of the composite structure 10 is undesirable, the fibre 30 and matrix
22 may be comprised of materials providing reduced optical transparency including, but not
limited to, substantially opaque materials. In this regard, the fibre 30 and matrix 22 may be
comprised of materials having any desired level of transparency between substantially
transparent and substantially opaque in the optical and/or infrared spectrum. In an embodiment,
the matrix 22 and/or fibres 30 may be formed of thermoplastic material which may comprise at
least one of the following materials: fluorocarbons, polyamides, polyethylenes, polyesters,
polypropylenes, polycarbonates, polyurethanes, polyetheretherketone, polyetherketoneketone,
polyetherimide, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyoxymethylene. In addition, the matrix 22
and/or fibres 30 may be formed of any suitable thermoset material including, but not limited to,
polyurethanes, phenolics, polyimides, bismaleimides, polyesters, and epoxies. Even further, the
matrix 22 and/or the fibres 30 may be formed of glasses or glass material comprising E-glass
(i.e., alumino-borosilicate glass), S-glass (i.e., alumino silicate glass), pure silica, borosilicate
glass, optical glass and other suitable glasses. The fibres 30 and/or the matrix 22 may also be
formed of inorganic materials including, but not limited to, carbons, silicon carbide, and boron.
The fibres 30 may additionally be formed of metallic materials including, but not limited to,
steel, titanium, copper, aluminum, and other metallic materials or metal alloys. The matrix 22
and/or fibres 30 may also be formed of ceramic materials.
[0099] Referring to Figure 10, shown is an illustration of a composite structure 10 having a
plurality of layers 60 arranged in a cross-ply configuration 72. The composite structure 10
illustrated in Figure 10 includes a stack 66 of layers 60 having an outermost layer 68 located on
an uppermost portion of the composite structure 10 and an outermost layer 68 on a lowermost
side of the composite structure 10. In an embodiment, the composite structure 10 may be
configured as a panel 14 for providing ballistic protection. The fibres 30 in the outermost layer
68 may be disposed immediately adjacent to a strike face 18 of the panel 14. The strike face 18
may comprise the side of the panel 14 intended or configured to receive impacts such as from a
projectile. A back face 20 of the panel 14 may be located on an opposite side of the panel 14 as
illustrated in Figure 10. The outermost layers 68 are each illustrated in Figure 10 as comprising
a plurality of substantially parallel fibres 30 being coupled to one another at a plurality of
connection sites 80 such that each outermost layer 68 illustrated in Figure 10 represents in-plane
coupling 82 of the fibres 30 similar to that which is schematically illustrated in Figure 5. The

                                                  23
layers 60 may be embedded in a suitable matrix 22. For example, the matrix 22 may comprise a
resin such as an epoxy. In another non-limiting embodiment, the fibres 30 may optionally
comprise metal fibres 30 embedded in a ceramic or glass matrix 22 although the fibres 30 and
the matrix 22 may be formed of a variety of different materials and combinations of materials as
indicated above.
[0100] Referring to Figure 11, shown is a computer simulated impact event 200 wherein a
projectile moving along the direction indicated by the arrow 208 has partially passed through a
panel 14 similar to the panel 14 illustrated in Figure 10. Figure 11 illustrates the effects of the
projectile impact on the back face 20 of the panel 14. As can be seen in Figure 11, the projectile
may be decelerated and captured without completely passing through the composite structure 10
as a result of the coupling of the fibres 30 (Figures 5-9) at the plurality of connection sites 80
(Figures 5-9). Although the back face 20 is illustrated in the computer simulation as exhibiting
matrix cracking 202 and fibre disbonding 204, the coupling of the fibres 30 in the outermost
layer 68 (Figure 10) of the back face 20 may prevent wedge-through of the projectile between
the coupled fibres 30.
[0101] As was earlier indicated, the coupling of the fibres 30 such as the in-plane coupling 82
illustrated in Figure 11 may be achieved by adhesive bonding, fusing, mechanical pinning and
other suitable means. Furthermore, the coupling of the fibre 30 may be tuned or tailored to the
environment or application for which the composite panel 14 is intended. For example, for any
one of the embodiments disclosed herein, the periodicity of the connection sites 80 coupling the
fibres 30 may be selected to provide the desired amount of interaction between the coupled
fibres 30 during an impact event. As indicated above, connection sites 80 between fibres 30
may facilitate the interaction and/or cooperation of multiple fibres 30 which may alter load paths
(e.g., the direction and/or length of the load paths) through the composite structure 10 during a
ballistic impact event, and limit damage propagation through a composite structure 10 during a
ballistic impact event. Furthermore, fibre 30 coupling via one or more connection sites 80 may
improve and/or control interlaminar shear strength, stiffness, compression strength, fracture
toughness and damage tolerance of the composite structure 10. The degree of connectivity of
the fibres 30 may be selected to achieve the desired ballistic performance. For example, for any
one of the embodiments disclosed herein, one or more connection sites 80 may be configured
with a connection yield and/or failure strain that may be lower than the yield and/or failure
strain of the matrix 22 for tying the fibres 30 together in a manner to prevent relative movement

                                                   24
and minimizing or eliminating wedge-through of a projectile (Figure 11). The coupling may be
tailored to provide a limited amount of damage during an impact event in order to preserve the
optical transparency of the non-impacted portions of the panel 14 (Figure 11).
[0102] Referring to Figure 12, shown is an illustration of a flow diagram comprising one or
more operations which may be implemented in a methodology for manufacturing a composite
structure 10. Step 302 of Figure 12 may comprise arranging a plurality of fibres 30 in
substantially parallel relation to one another and wherein the fibres 30 may comprise first and
second fibres 32, 34. In this regard, Figures 5-9 illustrate the fibres 30 in each one of the layers
60 as being oriented substantially parallel to one another. The fibres 30 in the figures are
illustrated as being arranged in relatively uniform spacing 86 across the width of the layer 60.
However, as was indicated above, the present disclosure contemplates non-uniform or varying
spacing of the fibres 30 in order to provide a desired response to a ballistic event or to provide a
desired level of optical or mechanical performance.
[0103] Referring still to Figure 12, Step 304 of the methodology of manufacturing the
composite structure 10 may comprise connecting the first fibre 32 to the second fibre 34 similar
to that which is illustrated in Figure 5. In this regard, the connection between the first fibre 32
and the second fibre 34 may be implemented at a plurality of connection sites 80. As was earlier
indicated, such connection sites 80 may be achieved using one or more connection types 88
(Figure 5) including, but not limited to, adhesive bonding (Figure 5), fusing (Figure 5),
mechanical pinning and other means for coupling the fibres 30 at the connection sites 80.
[0104] The fibres 30 may be coupled in an in-plane 82 configuration similar to that which is
illustrated in Figure 5 wherein the first fibre 32 may be connected to a second fibre 34 of the
plurality of fibres 30 in a first layer 62 and wherein the first and second fibres 32, 34 may be
located adjacent to one another. Alternatively, the methodology may comprise arranging the
plurality of fibres 30 in two layers 60 comprising a first layer 62 and a second layer 64 similar to
that which is illustrated in Figure 6. As can be seen in Figure 6, the first layer 62 may include
the first fibre 32 and the second layer 64 may include the second fibre 34. The methodology
may include locating the first and second fibres 32, 34 adjacent to one another and connecting
the first and second fibres 32, 34 at one or more connection sites 80 to provide out-of-plane
coupling 84 of the fibres 30.

                                                     25
[0105] Step 304 of Figure 12 may further comprise coupling the fibres 30 of a plurality of layers
60 in a combination of in-plane 82 and out-of-plane coupling 84. For example, Figure 7
illustrates a plurality of fibres 30 in the first layer 62 and the second layer 64. The first layer 62
is illustrated as including the first and second fibres 32, 34. The third and fourth fibres 36, 38
are included in the second layer 64. The fibres 30 in the first layer 62 are parallel to the fibres
30 in the second layer 64 such that Figure 7 illustrates a unidirectional configuration 70 of the
layers 60. Step 304 may comprise connecting the third and fourth fibres 36, 38 at a plurality of
connection sites 80 to provide in-plane coupling 82 at the connection sites 80. The first and
second fibres 32, 34 may likewise be coupled in-plane 82 at one or more connection sites 80.
Out-of-plane coupling 84 may be achieved in Step 304 by connecting the first and second fibres
32, 34 to respective ones of the third and fourth fibres 36, 38 at a plurality of connection sites
80.
[0106] In constructing the arrangement illustrated in Figure 8, the plurality of fibres 30 in the
first layer 62 may include the first and second fibres 32, 34 which may be oriented substantially
parallel to one another and which may be located immediately adjacent to one another.
Likewise, the second layer 64 may include the third, fourth and fifth fibres 36, 38, 40 which also
may be oriented substantially parallel to one another and perpendicularly relative to the first and
second fibres 32, 34 of the first layer 62. Step 304 may comprise connecting the first fibre 32 to
each one of the third and fifth fibres 36, 40 at connection sites 80 located approximately at the
shortest distance between the first fibre 32 and the respective ones of the third and fifth fibres
36, 40. Likewise, the second fibre 34 may be connected to the fourth fibre 38 at the connection
site 80 at the location of the shortest distance across the second fibre 34 and fourth fibre 38.
[0107] In this regard, Step 304 may comprise construction of a cross-ply configuration 72 of
layers 60 wherein the fibres 30 in the layers 60 are connected in a staggered, out-of-plane
coupling 84 configuration. Figure 9 represents an additional level of connection between the
fibres 30 by connecting the second fibre 34 to the third and fifth fibres 36, 40 at the connection
sites 80 where the first fibre 32 is connected to the third and fifth fibres 36, 40. In this regard,
Figure 9 illustrates a means for staggered adjacent and non-adjacent fibre 30 coupling in an out
of-plane 84 configuration.
[0108] The fibres 30 (Figures 5-9) may be connected at the connection sites 80 by a suitable
connection means including, but not limited to, adhesively bonding the fibres 30 at the

                                                  26
connection site 80 such as by localized heating of the side edges 48 (Figure 4) or other portions
of the fibre 30 to be bonded to the adjacent fibres 30 using a suitable adhesive such as an epoxy.
The fibres 30 may also be connected at the connection sites 80 by fusing or welding such as by
localized application of thermal energy or heat to localized portions of adjacent fibres 30. For
example, the localized heating may comprise heating the fibres 30 to above the glass transition
temperature or melt temperature such that the fibre 30 material at the localized areas fuses
together and are then allowed to cool. In a non-limiting embodiment, the localized heating of
the fibres 30 may include a heating element to locally apply heat to the connections sites 80 for
locally fusing the fibres 30. Alternatively, the localized heating may comprise ultrasonically
heating the fibres 30. In a further embodiment, the connection between the fibres 30 may be
facilitated by mechanically pinning the fibres 30 at the connection sites 80 such as by the
application of localized increased surface roughness of the fibres 30 or by forming mechanical
features on the fibres 30 such as by locally deforming the fibres 30 at the locations of the
connection sites 80. For example, localized notches may be formed in the fibre surfaces 42
(Figure 4) for engaging a corresponding mechanical feature formed in an adjacent fibre 30.
[0109] The connection quality 100 (Figures 5-9) of a connection site 9- may also be selected to
provide the desired degree of interaction between coupled fibres 30 as mentioned above. For
example, the connection quality 100 may comprise a connection strain which may be a
connection yield strain and/or a connection failure strain. Connection yield strain may represent
the connection strain at which the connection between coupled fibres 30 or between a fibre 30
and a planar element 78 plastically deforms (e.g., non-elastically deforms). Connection failure
strain may represent the strain at which the connection between coupled fibres 30 or between a
fibre 30 and a planar element 78 fails or breaks. The connection quality 100 may also comprise
a connection strength, and/or an elastic modulus of the connection site 80. The connection
strength that may be higher than the tensile strength of the matrix 22 to provide a high degree of
interaction of the coupled fibres 30 during an impact event. In an embodiment, the connection
strain may be lower than the failure strain of the matrix 22. The connection quality 100 may
alternatively comprise a connection strain that may be higher than the failure strain of the matrix
22 and a connection strength that may be lower than the tensile strength of the matrix 22 to
provide a low degree of interaction of the coupled fibres 30 during an impact event and/or to
facilitate relatively greater amounts of movement of the coupled fibres 30 relative to one
another. The elastic modulus of a connection site 80 may be described as the tensile modulus or
Young's modulus of the connection site 80 and may represent the relative stiffness of the

                                                  27
connection between fibres 30 and/or between a fibre 30 and a planar element 78 as described
below.
[0110] In a non-limiting embodiment, each connection site 80 (Figures 5-9) may include a
connection quality 100 (Figures 5-9) and may comprise a connection yield and/or failure strain
(Figures 5-9) that differs from the failure strain of the matrix 22 by at least approximately 25
percent and/or a connection strength (Figures 5-9) that differs from the tensile strength of the
matrix 22 by at least approximately 25 percent. However, the connection quality 100 may
comprise any desired combination of connection strain and connection strength relative to the
failure strain and tensile strength of the matrix 22 to achieve a desired response of the composite
structure 10. The connection quality 100 may be selected in consideration of factors including,
but not limited to, environmental factors such as temperature and humidity and/or as a function
of event parameters including, but not limited to, projectile velocity, mass, hardness, geometric
size, cross-sectional area and other factors.
[0111] As indicated above, fibres 30 may be coupled together using connection types 88 such as
adhesive bonding, chemical bonding, thermal fusing, mechanical pinning, and/or other
connection types. The connection quality 100 such as the connection strength and connection
strain of an adhesive bond between two fibres may be controlled by using an adhesive having
predetermined strength and strain properties. The connection strength and/or connection strain
of an adhesive may be an advertised property provided by a manufacturer of the adhesive.
Alternatively, the connection strength and/or connection strain of an adhesive may be
determined experimentally such as in a laboratory environment under controlled conditions by
measuring the amount of force required to pull apart two components bonded together by the
adhesive. The connection failure strain of the adhesive may also be measured when the
connection strength is measured. As known in the art, connection strain is a measure of the
amount of displacement or stretching of the adhesive bond between two components at the point
of failure of the bond. The connection strength and/or connection strain of a chemical bond
between two fibres 30 may be altered by altering the chemical composition of at least one of the
fibres 30. For example as described below, a first-functional fibre 140 (Figure 40) may be
formed of a material having a chemical composition that chemically reacts and forms a chemical
bond with the material of a second-functional fibre 142 (Figure 40) at locations where the first
functional fibre 140 and second-functional fibre 142 come into contact with one another.

                                                 28
[0112] Different combinations of chemical compositions may be tested in a laboratory
environment by performing a series of tests measuring the amount of force required to pull apart
two components chemically bonded as a result of the different chemical compositions of the two
components. Connection strength and connection strain data from such laboratory testing may
be used to select a chemical composition for the first-functional fibres 140 and a chemical
composition for the second-functional fibres 142 such that the chemical bond has a desired
connection strength and connection strain at the connection sites 80 connecting the first
functional fibres 140 with the second-functional fibres 142. The connection strength and
connection strain of thermal fusing of fibres 30 and mechanical pinning of fibres 30 may also be
determined in a laboratory environment in a manner similar to that described above for adhesive
bonding and chemical bonding. For example, the connection strength and/or the connection
strain of thermal fusing between two fibres 30 may be altered by altering the size or length of
the thermally fused connection between two fibres 30. For example, a relatively long thermally
fused connection site 80 between two fibres 30 will have a higher connection strength than a
relatively short thermally fused connection site 80 between two fibres 30. Different types of
mechanical pinning may be determined in the laboratory and/or determined analytically using
well-known strength analysis techniques to determine the connection strength and connection
strain corresponding to each type of each mechanical pinning configuration. Laboratory test
data representing the connection strength and connection strain of different types of thermal
fusing and different types of mechanical pinning may be used to select the type of connection to
be implemented in connecting fibres 30 in a composite structure 10. Connection strength and
connection strain may also be determined by performing a strength analysis for determining the
strength properties of each connection type.
[0113] Advantageously, coupling of the fibres 30 (Figures 5-9) provides a means for improving
the ballistic performance of a panel 14 or other composite structure 10 by increasing the
resistance of the fibres 30 to wedging of a projectile (Figure 11) between fibres 30 during a
ballistic event or an impact event. In addition, coupling of the fibres 30 may facilitate control of
the extent or size of area that is damaged by a ballistic event or an impact event. Likewise,
coupling of the fibres 30 at connection sites 80 may provide a means for attaining a desired
degree of panel stiffness or resistance to bending and minimizing optical distortion in non
impacted portions of the panel 14.

                                                  29
[0114] Selection of the connection type 88 and/or connection quality 100 to be used for
connecting the fibres 30 in a composite structure 10 may be determined based on the results of
strength analysis and/or laboratory testing of different connection types 88 as described above.
For example, the connection strength and/or connection strain of a given connection type 88
may be determined in the laboratory. As well known in the art of strength analysis, a finite
element model or computer model (not shown) of the actual composite structure 10 may be
constructed to facilitate the prediction of the desired connection strength and/or connection
strain at the connection sites 80 between fibres 30 in the composite structure 10. The computer
model of the actual composite structure 10 may include a computer model of the fibres 30
included in the composite structure 10. The connection sites 80 between the fibres 30 in the
computer model may be assigned a connection type 88 having a corresponding connection
strength and/or connection strength as determined analytically and/or experimentally as
described above. A determination may be made regarding the loads (e.g., the magnitude and
direction of loads) to which the composite structure 10 may be subjected during service.
[0115] A computer simulation of the loading scenario may be applied to the computer model of
the composite structure 10 to determine the reaction of the composite structure 10 to the loads.
The results of the computer simulation may indicate the relative deflection of the composite
structure 10 under the simulated loading. The relative deflection of the computer model may
represent the stiffness of the composite structure 10 containing the fibres 30 connected using a
connection type 80 and/or connection quality 100. Multiple computer simulations may be
performed with a variety of different connection sites 80 connecting the fibres 30 of the
composite structure 10 to determine the response (i.e., stiffness) of the composite structure 10
when subjected to the loads. In this manner, a determination may be made regarding an optimal
connection type 88 and/or connection quality 100 to be incorporated into the connection sites 80
of an actual composite structure 10.
[0116] Step 306 of Figure 12 may comprise at least partially embedding the fibres 30 in a
matrix 22 similar. As indicated above, the matrix 22 is preferably formed of substantially
optically transparent and/or infrared transparent material. Likewise, the fibres 30 are preferably
formed of substantially optically and/or infrared transparent material. Step 306 may include
curing or solidifying the matrix 22 and/or fibres 30 to form the composite structure 10 having
connection sites 80 wherein fibres 30 are connected with a desired connection type 88 and/or
connection quality 100. As indicated above, the connection type 88 and/or connection quality

                                                   30
100 to be implemented in the connection sites 80 may be selected analytically and/or
experimentally-determined as data described above. In this regard, the composite structure 10
may be subjected to heat and/or pressure to facilitate curing or solidifying.
[0117] Referring to Figure 13A-13C, shown are schematic views of an example of a composite
structure 10 in a unidirectional configuration 70 and having fibres 30 interconnected at
connection sites 80 arranged in localized connection regions 114, 116. As indicated above, the
plurality of fibres 30 may be least partially embedded within a matrix 22 of the composite
structure 10. Each connection region 114, 116 may represent locations where fibres 30 in the
same layer 60 may be coupled together and/or where fibres 30 in different layers 60 may be
coupled together. Figure 13A is a top schematic view of the composite structure 10 showing the
arrangement of a plurality of first connection regions 114 and a plurality of second connection
regions 116. In the embodiment shown, the horizontally-oriented first connection regions 114
are closer together than the horizontally-oriented second connection regions 116. The
vertically-oriented first connection regions 114 may be spaced further apart than the vertically
oriented second connection regions 116. However, the composite structure 10 may be provided
with connection regions that are oriented in any arrangement or spacing, and are not limited to
the arrangement shown in Figure 13A. In addition, the connection regions may be provided in
any geometric size, shape, orientation, and configuration and are not limited to the relatively
narrow, linearly-shaped first and second connection regions 114, 116 shown in Figure 13A.
[0118] Figure 13B is a schematic side view of the composite structure 10 of Figure 13A. In
Figure 13B, the fibres 30 are illustrated in a relatively heavy (e.g., thick) line weight and are
selectively coupled together at connection sites 80 which are illustrated in a relatively light (e.g.,
thin) line weight compared to the heavy line weight representing the fibres 30. Figure 13B
illustrates out-of-plane coupling 84 of the fibres 30 of the first and second layers 62, 64 along
the first connection regions 114 and out-of-plane coupling 84 of the fibres 30 in the second and
third layers 64, 65 along the second connection regions 116. Although the fibres 30 in the first,
second, and third layers 62, 64, 65 are shown having a unidirectional configuration 70 with
parallel fibres 30 in each layer, the fibres 30 in any one of the first, second, and third layer 62,
64, 65 may be arranged in any orientation relative to other fibres 30 in the same layer and in any
orientation relative to other fibres 30 in other layers. In addition, any one of the layers 62, 64,
65 may be provided as a woven fibre fabric ply 74 (Figure 22) or as a planar element 78 (Figure
22) such as a film, a sheet, or a plate, as discussed below. Furthermore, the composite structure

                                                  31
10 may include any number of layers 60 having fibres 30 interconnected along one or more
connection regions, and is not limited to the three-layer 62, 64, 65 arrangement shown in Figure
13B.
[0119] Figure 13C is a schematic end view of the composite structure 10 of Figure 13A and
illustrating out-of-plane coupling 84 of the fibres 30 of the first and second layer 62, 64 along
the first connection regions 114, and further illustrating the out-of-plane coupling 84 of the
fibres 30 of the second and third layers 64, 65 along the second connection regions 116.
However, as indicated above, the composite structure 10 may be provided with connection
regions representing connection sites 80 between fibres 30 in the same layer 60, and/or
representing connection sites 80 between fibres 30 in different layers 60. By providing localized
connection regions 114, 116 where fibres 30 in the same layer 60 and/or different layers 60 are
coupled, the performance of the composite structure 10 may be tailored to the environment or
application for which the composite structure 10 is intended. For example, the localized
connection regions 114, 116 may provide fibre 30 coupling and fibre 30 interaction in certain
locations of a composite panel 14 during an impact event to preserve the optical transparency of
non-impacted portions of the composite panel 14, or to provide other ballistic or optical
performance characteristics for the composite panel 14. In addition, the connection sites 80 in
any one of the connection regions may be provided with different connection types 88 and/or
different connection qualities 100 and are not limited to the same connection type 88 and/or
same connection quality 100 at each connection site 80.
[0120] Figure 14 is a schematic side view of a composite structure 10 in a unidirectional
configuration 70 and having a layer stack 66 comprising ten (10) layers 60 and illustrating out
of-plane coupling 84 of the fibres 30 between immediately-adjacent layers 60 such as between
the layers 1 and 2. The fibres 30 in any one of the remaining layers 3-10 may be unconnected to
fibres 30 in other layers 60. Although the fibres 30 in Figure 14 are arranged in a unidirectional
configuration 70 with the fibres 30 in each layer 60 being parallel to the fibres 30 in other layers
60, the fibres 30 in any one of layers 60 may be non-parallel to fibres 30 in other layers 60. For
example, the fibres 30 in two or more of the layers 60 may be provided in a cross-ply
configuration 72 (e.g., fibres 30 in one layer 60 are perpendicular to fibres 30 in another layer
60) or in other angular orientations. Advantageously, by interconnecting the fibres 30 in two or
more layers 60, the ballistic performance of the composite structure 10 may be tailored. For
example, connecting the fibres 30 in the outermost layers 60 of the composite structure 10 (e.g.,

                                                   32
layers 1-2) may increase the interaction between the interconnected fibres 30 in the outermost
layers 60 which may result in an increase in the stiffness of the outermost layers 60 relative to a
reduced stiffness of the inner layers 60 (e.g., layers 3-10) having uncoupled fibres 30.
[0121] Figure 15 is a schematic side view of a composite structure 10 in a unidirectional
configuration 70. The composite structure 10 is shown having a layer stack 66 with ten (10)
layers 60 and illustrating out-of-plane coupling 84 of fibres 30 in alternating layers 60 of the
layer stack 66. In the embodiment shown, the fibres 30 in layers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 may be
coupled, and the fibres 30 in layers 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 may be uncoupled. Figure 15 represents
one example of a wide variety of embodiments wherein at least one of the fibres 30 in at least
one layer 60 may be connected to at least one of the fibres 30 in at least one other layer 60. The
fibres 30 may be connected at a plurality of connection sites 80. In a composite structure 10
such as a composite panel 14, the connection sites 80 coupling the fibres 30 between two of the
layers 60 may be of a different connection type 88 and/or a different connection quality 100 than
the connection sites 80 coupling fibres 30 between two or more other layers 60. In addition, in
any of one of the layers 60, the fibres 30 may be coupled to other fibres 30 within the same layer
60 with connection sites 80 that may have the same or different connection type 88 and/or
connection quality 100. For example, in any one of the multilayer composite structure 10
embodiments disclosed herein, the connection sites 80 between the fibres 30 of the outermost
layers 60 may have a connection quality 100 that includes a high-strength/low-strain connection
106 relative to the connection quality 100 of the connection sites 80 between the fibres 30
connected between the inner layers 60 which may have a low-strength/high-strain connection
108.
[0122] Figure 16 is a schematic side view of a composite structure 10 in a cross-ply
configuration 72 and illustrating out-of-plane coupling 84 between fibres 30 in different pairs of
the layers 60 and with different coupling densities. For example, Figure 16 illustrates all of the
fibres 30 of layer 1 being coupled to one or more the fibres 30 of layer 2. Layers 2-3, 4-5, 6-7,
and 8-9 may be uncoupled. The coupling density between layers 3-4 may be less than the
coupling density between layers 1-2. For example, every other fibre 30 of layer 3 may be
coupled to one or more fibres 30 of layer 4. The remaining pairs of coupled layer pairs may
have decreasing coupling density. For example, every fourth fibre 30 of layer 5 may be coupled
to one or more fibres 30 of layer 6. Every ninth fibre of layer 7 may be coupled to one or more
fibres of layer 8. The coupling density between layers 9-10 may be less than the coupling

                                                 33
density between layers 7-8. By providing increased coupling density in certain layer 60 pairs,
the coupled layer 60 pairs may exhibit increased global stiffness relative to the global stiffness
of layer pairs that have reduced coupling density.
[0123] It should be noted that the global stiffness of a coupled pair of layers 60 is different than
the local stiffness at a connection site 80 between fibres 30. For example, the composite
structure 10 in Figure 16 may have a relatively high stiffness in the region of the composite
structure 10 defined by the outermost layers 1-2, and decreasing stiffness in a downward
direction of the composite structure 10 from layer 3 to 10. The relatively higher stiffness of the
composite structure 10 at the outermost layers and reduced stiffness in the inner layers 60 may
advantageously improve the ballistic performance of a composite structure 10. In the
embodiment of Figure 16, the connection sites 80 coupling the fibres 30 in the layer pairs are
shown having the same connection type 88 and/or connection quality 100.
[0124] Figure 17 is a schematic side view of a further embodiment of a composite structure 10
in a cross-ply configuration 72 having out-of-plane coupling 84 in different pairs of layers 60
similar to the embodiment shown in Figure 16, and further illustrating changes in connection
quality 100 in the connection sites 80 between different layer pairs. For example, the
connection sites 80 coupling the fibres 30 between layers 1-2 may be provided with a first
connection type 88a and/or first connection quality 100a. Examples of a first connection type
88a may include, but are limited to, adhesive bonding, chemical bonding, thermal fusing, and
mechanical pinning. As indicated above, adhesive bonding may comprise bonding the fibres 30
at connection sites 80 using an adhesive. Chemical bonding may comprise reactively bonding
first-functional fibres 140 (Figure 40) to second-functional fibres 142 (Figure 40) at locations
where the first-functional fibres 140 are in contact with the second-functional fibres 142, as
shown in Figures 40-43 and described below.
[0125] Thermal fusing may comprise locally heating and fusing the fusible sheaths 58 of core
sheath fibres 56 with the fusible sheaths 58 of core-sheath fibres 56 at locations wherein the
fusible sheaths 58 contact one another as shown in Figures 34-39 and described below. For
example, the fusible sheaths 58 may be locally heated by a laser (not shown) at a connection site
80 to a temperature above the glass transition temperature of the fusible sheaths 58 in order to
locally fuse together the fusible sheaths 58 of two core-sheath fibres 56. In Figure 17, the
connection sites 80 coupling the fibres 30 between the remaining coupled layer pairs may be

                                                  34
provided with a second connection type 88b and/or second connection quality 100b that may be
different than the first connection type 88a and/or connection quality 100a. Examples of a
second connection type 88b may also include, but are limited to, adhesive bonding, chemical
bonding, thermal fusing, and mechanical pinning. As may be appreciated, connection sites 80 in
the same layer 60 may be provided with different connection types 88 and/or connection quality
100 to achieve the desired ballistic performance of the composite structure 10.
[0126] Figure 18 is a schematic illustration of a single (e.g., first) layer 62 of unidirectional
fibres 30. In any of the embodiments disclosed herein, the composite structure 10 may include
additional layers 60 not shown. Such additional layers 60 may be comprised of fibres 30 and/or
the additional layers 60 may be configured as planar elements 78 (Figure 19) as described
below. In Figure 18, the unidirectional fibres 30 may be oriented substantially parallel to one
another and may be connected to one another via in-plane coupling 82 at a plurality of
connection sites 80.
[0127] In Figure 18, the connection sites 80 within the first layer 62 may have at least two
different connection types 88a and 88b and/or connection qualities 100a and 100b. In some
embodiments, the different connection types 88 may be patterned within the first layer 62. For
example, a layer 60 may include a first fibre 32, a second fibre 34, a third fibre 36, and a fourth
fibre 38. The first fibre 32 may be connected to the second fibre 34 at one or more connection
sites 80 of a first connection type 88a and/or connection quality 100a. The third fibre 36 may be
connected to the fourth fibre 38 at one or more connection sites 80 of a second connection type
88b and/or connection quality 100b that may be different than the first connection type 88a
and/or connection quality 100a. For example, Figure 18 illustrates the connection sites 80 on
the outer regions of the first layer 62 having connection sites 80 of a first connection type 88a
and/or connection quality 100a represented by solid lines extending between the fibres 30, and
the inner portion of the first layer 62 having connection sites 80 having connection sites 80 of a
second connection type 88b and/or connection quality 100b represented by the dashed lines
extending between the fibres 30.
[0128] A composite structure 10 may include different connection types 88 patterned within a
given layer 30. The patterns of connection types 88 may be provided in any manner and are not
limited to the connection pattern illustrated in Figure 18. As discussed above, in any one of the
embodiments disclosed herein, connection types 88 may include adhesive bonding, fusing,

                                                  35
mechanical pinning, chemical bonding, and/or other means for interconnecting fibres 30 at
connection sites 80. As described above, connection quality 100 may be represented as the
connection strength at a connection site 80. Connection quality 100 may also be represented as
the connection failure strain at a connection site 80. As described above, connection failure
strain may represent the strain at which the connection between fibres 30 fails or breaks, and
may be characterized as a percentage (plus or minus) of the failure strain of the matrix 22 as
discussed above. In addition, connection quality 100 may be represented as the elastic modulus
or tensile modulus of a connection site 80 and may be characterized as the relative stiffness of
the connection site 80 as described above.
[0129] Figure 19 is a schematic illustration of a composite structure 10 having a first layer 62
having first fibres 30 connected to one another at a plurality of connection sites 80, and a second
layer 64 having second fibres 30 connected to one another at a plurality of connection sites 80.
The connection sites 80 coupling the first fibres 30 within the first layer 62 may be of a different
connection type 88 and/or connection quality 100 than the connection sites 80 coupling the
second fibres 30 within the second layer 64. For example, the first fibres 30 may be coupled
together at a plurality of connection sites 80 of a first connection type 88a and/or connection
quality 100a. The second fibres 30 may be coupled together at a plurality of connection sites 80
of a second connection type 88b and/or connection quality 100b that may be different than the
first connection type 88a and/or connection quality 100a. In addition, although not shown, one
or more of the first fibres 30 may be coupled to one or more of the second fibres 30 at a plurality
of connection sites 80 which may be of the same connection type 88 and/or connection quality
100 or a different connection type 88 and/or connection quality 100. The first and second layers
62, 64 may be provided in a unidirectional configuration, in a cross-ply configuration, or in
other arrangements wherein the fibres 30 in the first layer 62 are non-parallel to the fibres 30 in
the second layer 64.
[0130] Figure 20 is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of a composite structure 10
having a first, second, and third layer 62, 64, 65 and respective first fibres 30, second fibres 30,
and third fibres 36 coupled at respective first, second, and third connection sites 80a, 80b, 80c
having different connection types 88a, 88b, 88c and/or different connection qualities 100a,
100b, 100c. The connection sites 80 between the first fibres 30 in the first layer 62 are
represented as solid lines of a first connection type 88a and/or connection quality 100a. The
connection sites 80 between the second fibres 30 in the second layer 64 are represented as

                                                  36
dashed lines of a second connection type 88b and/or connection quality 100b. The connection
sites 80 between the third fibres 36 in the third layer 65 are represented as phantom lines of a
third connection type 88c and/or connection quality 100c. However, any one of the layers 60
may include any combination of first, and second, and/or third connection types 88a, 88b, 88c
and/or connection qualities 100a, 100b, 100c.
[0131] Figure 21 is a schematic illustration of a composite structure 10 having a first layer 62
and a third layer 65 each comprised of unidirectional fibres 30. The second layer 64 may be
configured as a planar element 78. At least one of the fibres 30 in at least one of the first and
third layers 62, 65 may be connected to the planar element 78 at one or more connection sites
80. The connection between the fibres 30 and the planar element 78 may increase the
interaction between the fibres 30 and the planar element 78 such as when the composite
structure 10 is impacted by a projectile. In this regard, the connection sites 80 between the
fibres 30 and the planar element 78 may restrict movement of the fibres 30 during a ballistic
event such as when a projectile impacts and/or is passing through the composite structure 10.
The connection sites 80 between the fibres 30 and the planar element 78 may reduce or prevent
wedging of the projectile between the fibres 30 as described above with regard to the coupling
of the fibres 30 in different layers 60. In addition, the connection sites 80 between the fibres 30
and the planar element 78 may increase the out-of-plane stiffness of the planar element 78 (e.g.,
normal to the planar element 78) which may improve the ability of the planar element 78 to
slowdown the projectile passing through the composite structure 10 during a ballistic event.
[0132] Figure 19 illustrates the fibres 30 in the first and third layer 62, 65 being coupled to the
planar element 78 at a plurality of connection sites 80. The connection sites 80 coupling the
fibres 30 to the planar element 78 may have the same or different connection type 88 and/or
connection quality 100. The planar element 78 may be a film, a sheet, or a plate. The film,
sheet, or plate may be formed of composite or non-composite material and may include non
fibrous material or fibrous material. The non-composite material may include stretched
polymeric material or films or unstretched polymeric films. The stretched polymeric films may
be unidirectionally stretched or bi-directionally stretched. The film may be intentionally
stretched during forming of the film or after forming of the film. The stretching of the film may
cause the film molecules to become substantially aligned which may increase the tensile
strength of the film. When embedded within a matrix material along with other fibre 30 layers
60, the stretched film may improve the specific performance of the composite structure 10. In

                                                  37
an embodiment, the planar element 78 may be formed of materials such as glasses, composite
material, ceramic material, metallic material such as metallic foil, and may further include
woven material or non-woven material including fabrics and felts.
[0133] Figure 22 is a schematic illustration of a composite structure 10 having a first layer 62 of
fibres 30 connected to a woven fibre fabric ply 74. In an embodiment, the woven fibre fabric
ply 74 may contain a plurality of fibres 30. The fibres 30 may be formed of any one of a variety
of different materials including, but not limited to, polymeric material, glass, ceramic material,
and/or metallic material. In an embodiment, the fibres 30 of the first layer 62 may be coupled to
the woven fibre fabric ply 74 of the second layer 64 at one or more locations where the fabric
fibres 30 intersect. The connection sites 80 coupling the fibres 30 to the woven fibre fabric ply
74 may have the same and/or different connection type 88 and/or connection quality 100.
[0134] Figure 23 is a schematic illustration of a first layer 62 that may be included in a
composite structure 10. The first layer 62 may be configured as a woven fibre fabric ply 74.
The fibres 30 in the woven fibre fabric ply 74 may be coupled to one another at connection sites
80 (e.g. nodes 76) where the fibres 30 intersect via in-plane coupling 82. The coupling of the
fibres 30 at the connection sites 80 may increase the interaction of the fibres 30 during an impact
such as during a ballistic event. The increased interaction of the fibres 30 may involve a greater
quantity of fibres 30 in the ballistic event than would otherwise be involved if the fibres 30 were
uncoupled. The increased interaction of the fibres 30 may reduce the speed of the projectile.
The connection sites 80 may have the same and/or different connection type 88 and/or
connection quality 100. The connection type 88 and/or connection quality 100 may be varied as
a means to tailor the ballistic performance and/or optical performance of a composite structure
10 containing the woven fibre fabric ply 74. The woven fibre fabric ply 74 may be formed of
any one of a variety of materials including polymers, metals, glass, ceramics, and/or other
materials.
[0135] Figures 24-33 are schematic illustrations of non-limiting examples of global connection
site patterns 110 that may be implemented in a composite structure 10 for connecting fibres 30
in individual layers 60, for connecting fibres 30 in different layers 60, and/or for connecting
fibres 30 to one or more planar elements 78. In general, the coupling of fibres 30, layers 60,
and/or planar elements 78 may increase the interaction between such coupled fibres 30, layers
60, and/or planar elements 78 which may increase the energy-absorbing ability of the connected

                                                  38
components in slowing a projectile impacting and/or passing through the composite structure
10.
[0136] By arranging the connection sites 80 in a global connection site pattern 110, instead of
detecting the fibres 30 uniformly throughout the composite structure 10, fabrication cost and
time is reduced. In addition, by arranging the connection sites 80 in a global connection site
pattern 110, the composite structure 10 may exhibit a specific ballistic performance when
impacted by a projectile. For example, by providing a global connection site pattern 110 as an
arrangement of open circles 118 (Figure 24) or closed circles 120 (Figure 25-26), fibres 30 that
are unconnected to other fibres 30 may stretch to a greater extent during a ballistic event than
fibres 30 connected to other fibres 30 in the regions represented by the circles 118, 120. The
increased stretching of uncoupled fibres 30 may allow such fibres 30 to absorb a greater amount
of energy of a projectile during a ballistic event than fibres 30 that are coupled to other fibres 30.
However, coupled fibres 30 may have improved resistance to deformation during a ballistic
event and therefore may help retain the original level of optical transparency of the composite
structure 10 in the regions of the circles 118, 120 relative to uncoupled fibres 30 which may
deform to a greater extent during a ballistic event resulting in a greater loss of optical
transparency in such regions following a ballistic event. The geometric shape, size, and spacing
of the localized connection regions 112 may be designed based on the physical environment of
the composite structure, the size of ballistic projectiles expected to be encountered, and a variety
of other factors.
[0137] In an embodiment, one or more global connection site patterns 110 may be implemented
in individual layers 60 for coupling fibres 30 within the layer 60. Alternatively, or in addition to
coupling fibres 30 within a layer 60, one or more global connection site patterns 110 may be
implemented for connecting fibres 30 in one or more layers 60 with the fibres 30 in other layers
60. One or more global connection site patterns 110 may also be implemented for coupling
fibres 30 in one or more layers 60 to a planar element 78 such as a film, a sheet, a plate, or a
woven fibre fabric ply.
[0138] For example, in Figure 24, the global connection site pattern 110 may be characterized
as a schematic top view of a layer 60 of unidirectional fibres 30 connected to one another at a
plurality of connection sites 80 arranged in the shape of a circle 118. The global connection site
pattern 110 shown in Figure 24 may also be characterized as a schematic side view of a stack of

                                                 39
layers 60 and illustrating the coupling of the layers 60 at localized connection regions 112
representing location of connection sites 80 arranged in a circular shape 118. In any
embodiment disclosed herein, one or more global connection site patterns 110 may be applied to
a substantial entirety of one or more layers 61, as viewed from above the layer(s) 61, or one or
more connection regions 112 or patterns may be applied to a localized portion(s) of one or more
layers 61 as viewed from above the layer(s) 61. For example, a global connection site pattern
110 may be locally applied along a perimeter edge 132 of a composite panel 14 to provide a
localized concentration of connections sites 80 between fibres 30 along a perimeter edge 132 of
the composite panel 14 to increase or decrease fibre 30 restraint along the perimeter edge 132.
In another example, one or more global connection site patterns 110 may be locally applied to a
composite panel 14 such as around or adjacent to features in a composite panel 14 to alter the
local mechanical properties of the composite panel 14. For example, a connection region 112
may be applied around a fastener hole 130 in a composite panel 14 to increase the concentration
of connection sites 80 coupling fibres 30 near the fastener hole 132. The coupling of fibres 30
around the fastener hole 132 may locally increase the stiffness, damage tolerance (e.g.,
delamination resistance), and other local properties (e.g., mechanical, ballistic) of the composite
panel 14 around the fastener hole 132. Similarly, one or more global connection site patterns
110 may be applied across a layer stack 66 of a composite structure 10 as viewed from the side,
or one or more connection regions may be applied to a localized portion of a layer stack 66 of a
composite structure 10 to locally alter the properties (e.g., mechanical, ballistic) of the
composite structure 10.
[0139] Figure 25 is a schematic view of a plurality of localized connection regions 112 each
having a closed circular shape 120 as part of a global connection site pattern 110. Fibres 30
and/or layers 60 may be coupled to one another within the area enclosed by the closed circular
shapes 120. The spacing between the localized connection regions 112 may represent
uncoupled fibres 30 within a layer 60 and/or uncoupled layers 61 within a composite structure
10. The uncoupled layers 61 may represent locations in the composite structure 10 where fibres
30 may be able to stretch longitudinally and/or fibres 30 may be able to spread apart laterally
such as during an impact event to absorb energy of a projectile.
[0140] Figure 26 is a schematic view of a plurality of localized connection regions 112 each
having a closed circular shape 120 and arranged in a higher density than the closed circular
shapes 120 shown in Figure 23. A higher density of closed circular shapes 120 may result in a

                                                  40
difference in ballistic performance and/or optical performance of the composite structure 10
relative to a lower density of the closed circular shapes 120. In any of the embodiments
disclosed herein, the connection type 88 and/or connection quality 100 may be the same in each
one of the localized connection regions 112. Alternatively, different localized connection
regions 112 may have different connection types 88 and/or connection qualities 100.
[0141] Figure 27 schematically illustrates a plurality of localized connection regions 112 each
having a sinusoidal shape 124 as part of a global connection site pattern 110. Although
generally aligned lengthwise relative to the lengthwise orientation of the fibres 30, the
sinusoidal shapes 124 may be oriented at any angle (e.g. 450 or other) relative to the fibres 30 to
achieve desired ballistic performance characteristics. Figure 28 is a schematic view of localized
connection regions 112 having sinusoidal shapes 124 of different thickness. The different
thicknesses of the sinusoidal shapes 124 in Figure 26 may contain a greater number of
connection sites 80 which may result in different performance characteristics for the composite
structure 10 relative to the arrangement shown in Figure 25.
[0142] Figure 29 is a schematic view of a plurality of localized connection regions 112 each
having a crescent shape 126 as part of a global connection site pattern 110. The crescent shapes
126 may be provided in any size, shape, density, and configuration. In this regard, the local
connection site 80 patterns illustrated in Figure 24-33 are several examples of any one of a wide
variety of different global connection site patterns 110 that may be implemented for connecting
fibres 30 and/or layers 60 of a composite structure 10.
[0143] Figure 30 is a schematic view of a plurality of localized connection regions 112 each
having an X-shape 122 as part of a further embodiment of a global connection site pattern 110.
The X-shapes 122 may be spaced apart from one another as shown in Figure 30 to allow for
controlled constraint of fibres 30 at regions located between the X-shapes 122. In addition, the
X-shapes 122 may be spaced apart from one another such that some of the fibres 30 in a given
layer 60 are uncoupled to other fibres 30 in the same layer 30, or such that some of the layers of
a composite structure 10 are uncoupled to other layers.
[0144] Figure 31 is schematic view of a plurality of X-shaped 122 localized connection regions
112 arranged in a higher density than the X-shaped 122 localized connection regions 112 shown
in Figure 30. The higher density may result in greater coupling and therefore increased

                                                  41
interaction of fibres 30 and/or layers 60 during an impact event. Figure 32 is schematic view of
further increased density of X-shaped 122 localized connection regions 112 relative to the
density of the localized connection regions 112 in Figure 30 or 31. In any composite structure
10 embodiment, different types of localized connection regions 112 may be implemented in a
single composite structure 10. For example, the composite structure 10 may include a
combination of X-shapes 122, closed circular shapes 120, and/or any other geometric shape or
size.
[0145] Figure 33 is a schematic view of a plurality of localized connection regions 112 each
having a bar shape 128 arranged in a global connection site pattern 110. Although the bar
shapes 128 are oriented generally perpendicularly relative to the direction of the fibres 30 and/or
layers 60, the bar shapes 128 may be arranged in any orientation or combination of orientations
relative to the fibres 30 or layers 60. For example, the bar shapes 128 may be oriented at a 450
angle or at other angles relative to the lengthwise direction the fibres 30 and/or relative to the
lengthwise direction of the layers 60.
[0146] Figure 34 is a cross-sectional view of a core-sheath fibre 56 which is a type of fibre 30
having a core 57 surrounded by a fusible sheath 58. Core-sheath fibres 56 may be included in
any embodiment of the composite structure 10. For example, one or more of the layers 60 of a
composite structure 10 may include unidirectional core-sheath fibres 56. In a further
embodiment, one or more layers 60 of a composite structure 10 may comprise a woven fibre
fabric ply 74 (Figure 21) made up of a plurality of core-sheath fibres 56 that may be woven
together. In an embodiment, the core 57 may have a higher strength than the sheath 58. In
some embodiments, the core 57 may be stretched during formation of the core 57 or after
formation of the core 57 to improve the tensile strength of the fibre 56. In some embodiments,
the core-sheath fibres 56 may be provided in a generally flattened cross-sectional shape to
provide improved optical performance of the composite structure 10. For example, Figure 34
illustrates the core-sheath fibre 56 having a parallelogram shape although other flattened shapes
may be provided such as a generally rectangular shape. In an embodiment, the core-sheath fibre
56 may have generally planar upper and lower surfaces 44, 46 that may be generally parallel to
one another. In this regard, flattened and/or substantially planar fibre 56 faces may reduce
optical distortion of the composite structure 10 by minimize the scattering of light that may
otherwise occur when light strikes or passes through a core-sheath fibre 56 having a generally
rounded cross-sectional shape. By minimizing the scattering of light passing through a

                                                  42
composite structure 10, optical distortion may be reduced which may improve the clarity of
objects observed through a transparent composite structure 10.
[0147] Figure 35 is a cross-sectional view of a pair of the core-sheath fibres 56 butted against
one another in side-by-side arrangement. The core-sheath fibres 56 may be included in a layer
60 of fibres 30 containing a plurality of the unidirectional core-sheath fibres 56. Alternatively,
the core-sheath fibres 56 may be included in a woven fibre fabric ply 74 made up of a plurality
of the unidirectional core-sheath fibres 56, as indicated above.
[0148] Figure 36 illustrates the core-sheath fibres 56 after fusing the sheaths 58 together at the
sides such as by locally heating the sheaths 58. The sheaths 58 of one or more of the core
sheath fibres 56 may also be fused to the matrix 22 at one or locations after the fibres 30 are
embedded in the matrix 22. In an embodiment, the sheath 58 may be formed of the same
material from which the matrix 22 is formed. For example, the fusible sheath 58 may be formed
of thermoplastic material which may be substantially similar to the thermoplastic material of the
matrix 22. However, the fusible sheath 58 may be formed of any type of material such as
metallic material, ceramic material, composite material (e.g., epoxy, thermoplastic material,
etc.). In a woven fibre fabric ply 74 made up of core-sheath fibres 56, the fusible sheaths 58
may be fused 92 together at locations where the fibres 30 intersect one another in the woven
fibre fabric ply 74. As indicated above, the fusible sheaths 58 may also be fused 92 or otherwise
connected to other layers 60 at one or more connection sites 80.
[0149] Figure 37 is an exploded schematic side view of a plurality of layers 60 of core-sheath
fibres 56 arranged in a cross-ply configuration 72. In the embodiment shown, each one of the
core-sheath fibres 56 may have a generally rectangular cross-sectional shape or other shape. As
indicated above, the core 57 may be formed of a relatively high-strength material. The fusible
sheath 58 may be formed of a thermoplastic material covering the core 57. The core-sheath
fibres 56 in one or more of the layers 60 may have gaps between the core-sheath fibres 56. In
the embodiment shown, the core-sheath fibres 56 in alternating layers 60 may be arranged in
staggered formation or similar formation such that the core-sheath fibres 56 in one layer 60 are
at least partially aligned with the gaps between the core-sheath fibres 56 in another layer 60
when the composite structure 10 is viewed along a direction normal or perpendicular to the
upper and/or lower surface of the core-sheath fibres 56. Although Figure 37 illustrates a cross-

                                                  43
ply configuration 72 of a composite structure 10, the core-sheath fibres 56 may be oriented in
any desired arrangement or pattern, without limitation.
[0150] Figure 38 is a schematic side view of the composite structure 10 of Figure 37 with the
layers 60 pressed together such that the fusible sheaths 58 of the core-sheath fibres 56 are in
contact with one another. Heat may be applied to fuse the sheaths 58 together. For example, for
an embodiment wherein the sheaths 58 are formed of thermoplastic material, Figure 38
illustrates thermoplastic fusing of upper and lower surfaces of the core-sheath fibres 56. Heat
may be locally applied using a laser or other heating mechanism to locally heat one or more
locations where the sheaths 58 of the core-sheath fibres 56 are in contact with one another.
Alternatively, the composite structure 10 may be heated such as in an oven or autoclave or using
other heating methods. In an embodiment, heat may be applied in a manner causing the sheaths
58 to fuse together. For example, the thermoplastic sheaths 58 may be heated up to the melting
temperature of the thermoplastic material to cause the contacting portions of the sheaths 58 to at
least partially melt and fuse together.
[0151] Figure 39 is a schematic side view of a composite structure 10 of Figure 38 following the
thermoplastic fusing of the fusible sheaths 58. The composite structure 10 may be infiltrated or
infused with matrix 22 material to fill the gaps or open spaces between the core-sheath fibres 56.
Heat and/or pressure may be applied to cure and/or solidify the composite structure 10.
[0152] Figure 40 is a perspective schematic illustration of a cross-ply configuration 72 of a first
layer 62 and a second layer 64. As indicated above, the first layer 62 and the second layer 64
may be located in any position within a layer stack 66. The first layer 62 may contain first
fibres 32 and the second layer 64 may contain second fibres 34. At least a portion of the first
fibres 32 may be provided as first-functional fibres 140. At least a portion of the second fibres
34 may be provided as second-functional fibres 142. The first-functional fibres 140 may be
chemically reactive with (e.g., chemically bonded to) the second-functional fibres 142 at
locations where the first-functional fibres 140 are in contact with the second-functional fibres
142. In this regard, the first-functional fibres 140 may be formed of any material, without
limitation, that reacts with and/or chemically bonds to the second-functional fibres 142 but does
not react with or chemically bond to itself. Likewise, the second-functional fibres 142 may be
formed of any material, without limitation, that reacts with and/or chemically bonds to the first
functional fibres 140 but does not react with or chemically bond to itself. More specifically, the

                                                  44
first-functional fibres 140 may be non-reactive with (e.g., non-chemically bonded to) other first
functional fibres 140. Likewise, the second-functional fibres 142 may be non-reactive with
(e.g., non-chemically bonded to) other second-functional fibres 142. The first-functional fibres
140 and second-functional fibres 142 are chemically reactive with each other as indicated above.
In contrast, as indicated above, core-sheath fibres 56 have a fusible sheath 58 that can be locally
fused (e.g., melted together) with the fusible sheath 58 of another core-sheath fibre 56 to form a
local connection between two core-sheath fibres 56.
[0153] In an embodiment, the first-functional fibres 140 may be provided as epoxy-functional
fibres 140a (see Figures 41-43) formed of any one of the above described fibre materials and
coated with an epoxy resin material or the epoxy-functional fibres 140a may be formed of solid
epoxy resin. In an embodiment, second-functional fibres 142 may comprise amine-functional
fibres 142a (see Figures 41-43). Amine-functional fibres 142a may be formed of an amine
chemical compound or other compound that is chemically reactive with epoxy resin when
placed in contact with the epoxy-functional fibres 140a. Contact between an epoxy-functional
fibre 140a and an amine-functional fibre 142a may result in cross-linking and/or at least partial
curing and chemical bonding 96 at the locations of contact between the epoxy-functional fibre
140a and the amine-functional fibre 142a.
[0154] In some embodiments of a composite structure 10, the first layer 62 may include epoxy
functional fibres 140a and amine-functional fibres 142a arranged in parallel relation to one
another although the epoxy-functional fibres 140a and amine-functional fibres 142a may be
oriented in non-parallel relation including, but not limited to, in a woven arrangement. The
amine-functional fibres 142a may be alternated with the epoxy-functional fibres 140a. For
example, in Figure 40, every third fibre in the first layer 62 may be an amine-functional fibre
142a, and the remaining fibres in the first layer 62 may be epoxy-functional fibre 140a. The
fibres 30 in the second layer 64 may be oriented perpendicular (or other angle) relative to the
fibres 30 in the first layer 62, and may also include every third fibre 30 being an amine
functional fibre 142a and the remaining fibres 30 being epoxy-functional fibres 140a.
[0155] Methods of functionalizing fibres 30 may include plasma treatment, corona treatment,
wet chemical methods, polymer blending, and/or other methods. In this regard, fibres 30 may
be functionalizing along an entire length of the fibres. Alternatively, fibres 30 may be
functionalized according to a pattern along the length of the fibres 30. In one embodiment, each

                                                   45
fibre 30 may be provided with a desired functionality in certain increments along the fibre 30
length. For example a fibre 30 may be provided with an epoxy functionality (e.g., an epoxy
coating) in one-half inch increments along the fibre 30 length, or any other uniform or non
uniform pattern along the fibre 30 length. Other fibres 30 may be provided with an amine
functionality in a desired increment along the fibre 30 length. Fibres may be functionalized in a
manner to provide a desired pattern of fibre 30 coupling within the composite structure 10.
[0156] In a further embodiment, the composite structure 10 may be provided with self
reactively-coated fibres (not shown). A self-reactively-coated fibre may have a self-reactive
coating (not shown) that chemically reacts (e.g., chemically bonds) when in contact with itself,
but does not chemically react with or bond with bare fibre (i.e., uncoated fibre). The self
reactive coating may or may not react with the matrix 22. In an embodiment, a composite
structure 10 may include fibres 30 arranged in a first layer 62 and in a second layer 64. The first
layer 62 and the second layer 64 may respectively contain first fibres 32 and second fibres 34.
[0157] At least a portion of the first fibres 32 may include self-reactively-coated fibres and the
remaining fibres in the first layer 62 may include non-coated fibres 30 or fibres 30 that are not
coated with the self-reactive coating. Likewise, at least a portion of the second fibres 34 may
include self-reactively-coated fibres and the remaining fibres 30 in the second layer 64 may
include non-coated fibres 30 or fibres 30 that are not coated with the self-reactive coating. In
such a composite structure 10, the self-reactively-coated fibres may be connected to other self
reactively-coated fibres at locations where the self-reactively-coated fibres are in contact with
one another. In some embodiments, the self-reactive coating may require the application of heat
and/or energy from an external reaction-initiating source (not shown) to initiate or cause the
self-reactive coating to react with and chemically bond to itself. For example, at locations
where the self-reactive coating of one fibre 30 is in contact with the self-reactive coating of
another fibre 30, heat, radiation, moisture, or other reaction-initiating mechanism may be
applied to the fibres 30 in a global pattern or a local pattern. The external reaction-initiating
source may comprise a laser that may apply heat in a localized pattern to couple self-reactively
coated fibres at locations where such fibres 30 are in contact with one another.
[0158] In some embodiments, coupling of fibres 30 may be controlled by applying the self
reactive coating in a desired pattern (e.g., every one-half inch) along the length of one or more
fibres 30. Furthermore, at least one layer 60 in a composite structure 10 may include self-

                                                  46
reactively-coated fibres 30 and uncoated fibres 30 or bare fibres 30 (e.g., non-self-reactively
coated fibres 30). For example, one layer 60 of a composite structure 10 may include
alternating self-reactively-coated fibres 30 and uncoated fibres 30. Even further, different layers
60 within a layer stack 66 may include different patterns of self-reactively-coated 30 fibres and
uncoated fibres 30 to provide different arrangements for coupling fibres 30 within the composite
structure 10. Certain layers 60 within a composite structure 10 may be comprised substantially
of self-reactively-coated fibres 30, while other layers 60 in the composite structure 10 may be
comprised substantially of uncoated fibres 30.
[0159] Selection of the chemical makeup and/or functionality of the first-functional 140,
second-functional 142, and other-functional fibres 30 may be based on the chemical
compatibility of the first-functional 140 and second-functional fibres 142 such that chemical
reactions (e.g., chemical bonding) between the fibres 30 will occur as desired. Selection of the
chemical makeup and/or functionality of the first-functional 140 and second-functional fibres
142 may also be based on the desired connection qualities 100 (e.g., strength, elastic modulus,
connection yield and/or failure strain, etc.). In addition, selection of the chemical makeup
and/or functionality of the first-functional 140 and second-functional fibres 142 may be based
on the desired optical properties of the composite structure 10. For example, the chemical
makeup or materials of the first-functional 140 and second-functional fibres 142 may be selected
based on the refractive indices and/or temperature coefficient of refractive indices of the fibre 30
materials and matrix for a given temperature change and wavelength of light to which the
composite structure 10 may be subjected during use. Selection of the chemical makeup and/or
material of the self-reactively-coated fibres 30 may also be based on chemical compatibility,
desired connection qualities 100, and/or desired optical properties (e.g., refractive index) to
appropriately match the fibre 30 material, the coating material, and the matrix material.
[0160] The presence, concentration, type, or quality of the functionalization/coating may also be
varied along the length of any individual fibre 30, fibre-to-fibre within a layer 60, and/or layer
to-layer. For example, as indicated above, the connection type 88 or connection quality 100 of
an epoxy-coating may be varied along the length of a fibre 30. As may be appreciated, the
fibres 30 in any layer 60 may be arranged in any orientation, without limitation, and are not
limited to the cross-ply configuration 72 shown in Figure 40. Furthermore, the fibres 30 in any
layer 60 may be comprised of any portion of amine-functional fibres 142a relative to the portion
of epoxy-functional fibres 140a in the layer 60. In addition, any one of the fibres 30 in a given

                                                 47
layer 60 may be non-epoxy-functional fibres 140a or non-amine-functional fibres 142a. For
example, the first layer 62 may be comprised of substantially all epoxy-functional fibres 140a
and may be substantially devoid of amine-functional fibres 142a. The second layer 64 may
include substantially all amine-functional fibres 142a and may be substantially devoid of epoxy
functional fibres 140a. For a layer 60 containing epoxy-functional fibres 140a and amine
functional fibres 142a, the fibres 30 may be alternated in any arrangement within the layer. For
example, the fibres 30 may alternate between epoxy-functional fibres 140a and amine-functional
fibres 142a. Any number of a variety of arrangements may be implemented for arranging the
epoxy-functional fibres 140a and amine-functional fibres 142a.
[0161] Figure 41 is an exploded schematic side view of a plurality of epoxy-functional fibres
140a and amine-functional fibres 142a arranged in layers 60. In the embodiment shown, each
one of the epoxy-functional fibres 140a and amine-functional fibres 142a may have a generally
rectangular cross-sectional shape although such fibres 140a, 142a may be provided in any cross
sectional shape, without limitation. The fibres 140a, 142a may be initially arranged in a desired
orientation such as the cross-ply configuration shown in Figure 41. In the embodiment shown,
the fibres 140a, 142a in alternating layers 60 may be arranged in staggered formation such that
the fibres 140a, 142a in one layer 60 are at least partially aligned with the gaps between the
fibres 140a, 142a in another layer 60 when the composite structure 10 is viewed along a
direction normal to the upper and/or lower surfaces of the fibres 140a, 142a to minimize the
scattering of light and thereby improve the optical performance of the composite structure 10.
[0162] Figure 42 is a schematic side view of the layers 60 of Figure 41 pressed together to place
the layers 60 of fibres 140a, 142a in contact with one another. In locations where the epoxy
functional fibres 140a contact the amine-functional fibres 142a, a chemical reaction may occur
between the epoxy resin and the amine compound. The chemical reaction may result in a
chemical bond 96 at locations where the amine-functional fibres 142a and the epoxy-functional
fibres 140a are in contact with one another. The chemical bond 96 may be characterized as a
localized curing and/or hardening of the epoxy resin and resulting in the formation of a
connection site between an epoxy-functional fibre 140a and an amine-functional fibre 142a.
Other cure methods such as moisture cure, ultraviolet-radiation cure, visible light cure, and other
radiation cure methods may be implemented for curing the chemical bond 96 between an epoxy
functional fibre 140a and an amine-functional fibre 142a. In some embodiments, the connection
quality 100 of the chemical bond 96 between an epoxy-functional fibre 140a and an amine-

                                                   48
functional fibre 142a may be altered by varying the chemistry of the amine compound or epoxy
compound. For example, altering the length of chain of the amine compound or epoxy
compound, and/or altering the chemistry of chain of the amine compound or epoxy compound
may provide a means for controlling the tensile strength, yield strain, failure strain, and/or
elastic modulus at the chemical bond 96 between an epoxy-functional fibre 140a and an amine
functional fibre 142a.
[0163] Figure 43 is a schematic side view of a composite structure 10 after infusing the
chemically-bonded layers 60 with matrix 22 material. In an embodiment, matrix 22 material
such as an epoxy matrix may be infused into the chemically-bonded layers 60 such that the
matrix 22 fills any gaps between epoxy-functional fibres 140a, amine-functional fibres 142a,
and/or other types of fibres 30 such as non-epoxy-functional fibres and non-amine-functional
fibres that may be included in the composite structure 10. Heat and/or pressure may be applied
to cure and/or harden the matrix 22.
[0164] The composite structure 10 may be provided in a complex three-dimensional
embodiment that may incorporate multiple aspects of connection type 88 and/or connection
quality 100 using any one or more of the arrangements and methods for coupling fibres 30 with
other fibres 30 and/or for coupling fibres 30 with planar elements 78 (Figure 21). In this regard,
such a complex three-dimensional embodiment may include specifically selecting a three
dimensional architecture of bond type and/or bond quality for a ballistic panel with the objective
of controlling the three-dimensional location of connection quality 100 and connection type 88
within the ballistic panel to achieve improved ballistic performance.
[0165] Figure 44 is a flowchart illustrating one or more operations that may be included in a
method 400 of manufacturing a composite structure 10. Step 402 of the method 400 may
include providing a plurality of fibres 30 which may include arranging at least a portion of the
fibres 30 in a first layer 62. The fibres 30 in the first layer 62 may be arranged in substantially
parallel relation to one another. However, the fibres 30 may be arranged in any angular
orientation relative to one another. The fibres 30 may also be arranged in two or more layers 60
of a layer stack 66. For example, the method may include arranging at least a portion of the
fibres 30 in a first layer 62 having first fibres 30, and arranging at least a portion of the fibres 30
in a second layer 64 having second fibres 30 as shown in Figure 17.

                                                   49
[0166] Step 404 of the method 400 may include connecting at least a portion of the fibres 30 to
one another at connection sites 80. Step 406 may include providing at least two of the
connection sites 80 with a different connection type 88 and/or a different connection quality
100. For example, the method may include connecting at least two of the fibres 30 in the first
layer 62 at at least two connection sites 80 of a different connection type 88 and/or a different
connection quality 100. In some embodiments, the connection quality 100 may include a high
strength/low-strain connection 106 at a first connection site 80a between the first and second
fibre 32, 34, and a low-strength/high-strain connection 108 at a second connection site 80b
between the first and second fibre 32, 34.
[0167] For composite structures 10 having two or more layers 60, the method 400 may include
connecting at least one of the first fibres 30 in the first layer 62 to at least one of the second
fibres 30 in the second layer 64 at a plurality of connection sites 80 which may have the same or
different connection type 88 and/or connection quality 100. In a further embodiment, the
method may include connecting at least two of the first fibres 30 in the first layer 62 at a
connection site 80 of a first connection type 88a and/or connection quality 100a, and connecting
at least two of the second fibres 30 in the second layer 64 at a connection site 80 of a second
connection type 88b and/or connection quality 100b that may be different than the first
connection type 88a and/or connection quality 100a.
[0168] In a further embodiment, the method 400 may include providing a first fibre 32, a second
fibre 34, a third fibre 36, and a fourth fibre 38 as shown in Figure 18. The first fibre 32 and the
second fibre 34 may be included in the same layer 60 or in different layers 60. Likewise, the
third fibre 36 and the fourth fibre 38 may be included in the same layer 60 or in different layers
60. For example, the third fibre 36 and the fourth fibre 38 may be included in the same layer 60
as the first fibre 32 and the second fibre 34 or in different layers 60 than the first fibre 32 and the
second fibre 34. The first fibre 32 may be connected to the second fibre 34 at one or more
connection sites 80 of a first connection type 88a and/or connection quality 100a, and the third
fibre 36 may be connected to the fourth fibre 38 at one or more connection sites 80 of a second
connection type 88b and/or connection quality 100b that may be different than the first
connection type 88a and/or connection quality 100a. In any of the embodiments, Step 408 of
the method 400 may include embedding the fibres 30 within the matrix 22 and allowing the
matrix 22 to cure.

                                                   50
[0169] In an embodiment, the method 400 may include providing a first layer 62 as a woven
fibre fabric ply 74 containing the plurality of fibres 30 as shown in Figure 21. At least a portion
of the fibres 30 in the woven fibre fabric ply 74 may be interconnected at locations where the
fibres 30 intersect which may be described as nodes 76. In an embodiment, the connection sites
80 may be configured such that the connection type 88 and/or connection quality 100 may vary
at different connection sites 80 at the intersection (i.e., nodes 76) of the fibres 30 in the woven
fibre fabric ply 74.
[0170] In a further embodiment, the method 400 may include providing at least a portion of the
fibres 30 as core-sheath fibres 56 as shown in Figures 34-36 or in Figures 37-39. Each one of
the core-sheath fibres 56 may be comprised of a core 57 surrounded by a sheath 58 formed of a
thermoplastic material. The core 57 may be formed of a high-strength material relative to the
strength of the sheath 58. In some embodiments, the sheath 58 may be formed of the same
material as the matrix 22 which may be a thermoplastic material. The method may include
arranging the core-sheath fibres 56 in side-by-side contacting relation to one another in a layer
60 as shown in Figures 34-36. In some embodiments, the method may include arranging layers
60 of core-sheath fibres 56 such that upper and lower surfaces of the core-sheath fibres 56 may
contact one another. For example, two or more layers 60 of core-sheath fibres 56 may be
arranged in a cross-ply configuration 72 as shown in Figure 37-39.
[0171] The method 400 may include pressing the layers 60 of core-sheath fibres 56 together and
applying heat to the sheaths 58. For example, heat may be applied at one or more locations
where the sheaths 58 are in contact with one another. The application of heat may result in
connecting at least a portion of the core-sheath fibres 56 to one another at one or more
connection sites 80 such as by thermoplastically fusing the sheaths 58 together at the connection
sites 80. Following the thermoplastic fusing of the sheaths 58, the core-sheath fibres 56 may be
infiltrated or infused with a matrix 22 material. The method may further include curing the
matrix 22 material to form a composite structure 10. In certain embodiments, the core-sheath
fibres 56 may be woven into a woven fibre fabric ply 74 (not shown). The sheaths 58 of the
core-sheath fibres 56 may be thermoplastically fused 92 together at locations (e.g. nodes 74)
where the fibres 30 intersect.
[0172] In a further embodiment illustrated in Figures 41-42, the method may include providing
a first layer 62 containing first fibres 32 and a second layer 64 containing second fibres 34. At

                                                  51
least a portion of the first fibres 32 may be epoxy-functional fibres 140a and/or amine-functional
fibres 142a (Figures 41-43). At least a portion of the second fibres 34 may also be epoxy
functional fibres 140a and/or amine-functional fibres 142a. As indicated above, the amine
functional fibres 142a may be formed of an amine compound. The amine-functional fibres 142a
and the epoxy-functional fibres 140a in each of the first layer 62 and the second layer 64 may be
arranged in alternating relation to one another. The first and second layer 62, 64 may be
arranged in desired configuration such as in the cross-ply configuration shown in Figure 41 or in
any other configuration.
[0173] The method may include placing the first layer 62 in contact with the second layer 64
such as by pressing the first and second layer 62, 64 together. As mentioned above, contact
between the and second layer 62, 64 may result in chemical bonding 96 at connection sites 80
where the amine-functional fibres 142a contact the epoxy-functional fibres 140a. The method
may additionally include infusing the and second layer 62, 64 with matrix 22 material. Heat
and/or pressure may be applied to cure the matrix 22 material to form a composite structure 10.
[0174] Figure 45 is a flowchart illustrating one or more operations that may be included in a
further method 500 of manufacturing a composite structure 10. Step 502 of the method 500 may
include arranging a plurality of fibres 30 in two or more layers 60 as shown in Figures 13A-17.
Step 504 of the method 500 may include connecting at least one of the fibres 30 in at least one
layer 60 to at least one of the fibres 30 in another layer 30. In an embodiment, the method 500
may include connecting at least one fibre 30 in one layer 60 to at least one fibre 30 in an
immediately adjacent layer 60. For example, Figures 13A-13C illustrate the coupling of the
fibres 30 in a unidirectional configuration 70 in a first and second layer 62, 64 along first
connection regions 114, and the coupling the fibres 30 in the second and third layer 64, 65 along
second connection regions 116.
[0175] In a further embodiment, Figure 14 illustrates the coupling of the fibres 30 in layers 1-2
while Figure 15 illustrates the coupling of the fibres 30 in alternate layers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. In
certain embodiments, the fibres 30 in at least one layer 60 may be unconnected to the fibres 30
in another layer 60. For example, in Figure 14, layers 3-10 may be unconnected to each other or
to any other layers 60. In Figure 15, layers 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 may be unconnected to each other
or to any other layers 60. As may be appreciated, the fibres 30 in any number of the layers 60 of
