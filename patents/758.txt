ABSTRACT
An automatic parking brake (210) is provided which includes a rail car brake beam (206)
and a housing (250) associated with the rail car brake beam. The automatic parking brake
includes a locking nut (256) positioned in the housing and having a post (208) that
extends out of the housing. A rail car brake lever (204) is secured to the post so that the
locking nut will rotate with the rail car brake lever. A locking sleeve (260) is moveable
between a locked position, where the locking sleeve engages the locking nut and prevents
from the nut from rotating, and a released position, where the locking sleeve is disengaged
from the locking nut and the locking nut is free to rotate. A spring (282) provides a force
biasing the locking nut into the locked position.

TITLE
AUTOMATIC PARKING BRAKE FOR TRUCK MOUNTED BRAKE CYLINDER
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001] The present invention relates to rail car parking brakes and, more specifically, to
an automatic parking brake cylinder for a truck mounted brake cylinder.
2. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART
[0002] Most rail vehicles have a manually-operated parking brake that applies the wheel
brakes. Unfortunately, this requires that an operator manually apply the brake on each rail
car in a train. As a result, an automatic parking brake, such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 7,163,090, has been developed that will retain the braking system of any rail car
equipped with the brake in the brakes applied position if brake pipe pressure is removed
from a locking mechanism position about the shaft of the truck mounted brake cylinder.
However, due to cylinder design, it is not always possible to position a locking
mechanism about the shaft of a truck mounted brake cylinder. According, there is a need
for an automatic parking brake that is not coupled to the shaft of the brake cylinder.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0003] A first aspect of the present invention provides an automatic parking brake,
comprising: a rail car brake beam; a housing associated with the rail car brake beam; a
locking nut positioned in the housing for rotation within the housing and having a post
that extends out of the housing; a rail car brake lever secured to the post of the locking nut
so that the locking nut will rotate with the rail car brake lever; and a locking sleeve
positioned in the housing and fixed against rotation within the housing, wherein the
locking sleeve is moveable axially within the housing between a first position where
locking sleeve is engaged with the locking nut to prevent rotation of the locking nut
within the housing and a second position where the locking sleeve is disengaged from the
locking nut so that the locking nut is allowed to rotate within the housing.
[0004] Another aspect of the present invention provides a brake cylinder, comprising: a
brake piston that is moveable from a brakes released position to a brakes applied position
in response to either a source of brake pipe pressure or a mechanical movement of a
parking brake lever via manual operation of a hand brake wheel; a parking brake cylinder
having a locking nut coupled via corresponding threads to a moveable rod that is
interconnected to the brake piston and a locking sleeve that can selectively engage the
                                                1

locking nut in response to a source of brake pipe pressure to prevent rotation of the
locking nut and, as a result, movement of the brake piston from the brakes applied
position to the brakes released position; a manual release associated with the locking
sleeve that can cause the locking sleeve to disengage the locking nut and free the brake
piston for movement from the brakes applied position to the brakes released position; and
a linkage interconnecting the manual release and the handbrake wheel so that movement
of the parking brake lever via the handbrake wheel that would move the brake piston from
the brakes releases position into the brakes applied position will cause the locking sleeve
to disengage the locking nut so that the parking brake cylinder does not prevent
movement of the brake piston from the brakes applied position to the brakes released
position.
[0005] There is disclosed herein an automatic parking brake for a truck mounted brake
cylinder that has a housing having a port for receiving brake pipe pressure. A locking nut
is positioned in the housing for rotational movement and a rod extends through the
locking nut and is interconnected to a piston of the brake cylinder. The rod is connected to
the locking nut via threads so that the locking nut will rotate if the rod moves axially
through the locking nut. A locking sleeve is positioned in the housing and moveable
between a locked position, where the locking sleeve engages the locking nut and prevents
from the nut from rotating, and a released position, where the locking sleeve is disengages
from the locking nut and the locking nut is free to rotate.
[0006] In one embodiment, a spring provides a force biasing the locking nut into the
locked position, and brake pipe pressure in a chamber in communication with the brake
pipe port biases the locking sleeve into the released position when the brake pipe pressure
overcomes the bias of the spring. The brake pipe pressure chamber may be coupled to a
shoulder of the locking sleeve so that brake pipe pressure applies a biasing force directly
to the locking sleeve. Alternatively, the brake pipe pressure chamber may be coupled to a
piston that is interconnected to the locking sleeve so that brake pipe pressure applies a
biasing force to the piston. The housing of the parking brake may be mounted to a non
pressure head of the brake cylinder with the rod connected directly to the piston. The
housing may alternatively mounted to a non-pressure head of the brake cylinder by a
trunnion with the rod is connected to the piston via a linkage, such as the existing hand
brake lever linkage.
                                               2

[0007] A manual release may be interconnected to the locking sleeve and rotatable from a
first position, where the locking sleeve is free to engage the locking nut, and a second
position where the locking sleeve is moved by the manual release into the released
position. The manual release may be interconnected to the hand brake lever so that the
manual release rotates from the first to the second position when the hand brake lever is
moved from a hand brake released position to a hand brake applied position. For example,
the manual release may be interconnected to the hand brake lever via a link having an
actuator that contacts a cam associated with the manual release, or by a post having an
actuator on one end that contacts a cam associated with the manual release when the hand
brake lever impacts an opposing end of the post.
[0008] The parking brake may include a second parking brake having the same structure
positioned on opposing side of the piston rod of the brake cylinder. In this example, the
brake pipe pressure ports may be connected to a single brake pipe pressure inlet. The
manual releases may also be interconnected to each other via a common linkage that is
response to a single manual input.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0030] Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts
throughout, there is seen in Fig. 1 an automatic parking brake system 10 having a parking
brake cylinder 12 internally coupled to a truck mounted brake cylinder 14. Brake cylinder
14 generally comprises a non-pressure head 16 mounted to a pressure cylinder 18 having
an inlet port 20 for receiving and venting the air pressure from a source of brake cylinder
pressure. Parking brake cylinder 12 is mounted to non-pressure head 16 and includes a
brake pipe port 22 for receiving and venting air pressure from a source of brake pipe
pressure. Brake cylinder 14 further comprises a mechanical parking brake lever 24 that is
interconnected to non-pressure head 16 via a slotted link 26. Parking brake cylinder 12
                                              4

includes a manual release 28 that allows for manual disengagement of parking brake
cylinder 22 via a chain 30.
[0031] Referring to Fig. 2, automatic parking brake system 10 is incorporated into a rail
car braking system 34 by mounting brake cylinder 14 to a rail car truck 36 in the
conventional manner. Hand brake lever 24 is interconnected by a chain 38 to a hand brake
40 having a user operable wheel 42 for manually taking up chain 38 and moving hand
brake lever 24 to manually apply the rail car brakes. One or more manual release handles
44 are coupled via a cable 46 to chain 30 of manual release 28. Alternatively, a hydraulic
cylinder may be used in lieu of hand brake 40 to hydraulically take up chain 38 and may
include a slow bleed to relieve the pressure used to apply the brakes.
[0032] As seen in Figs. 3 and 4, parking brake cylinder 12 comprises a housing 50 that is
mounted to non-pressure head 16 and supports brake pipe port 22. Housing 50 encloses a
locking mechanism 52 that is responsive to air pressure supplied to brake pipe port 22 to
selectively permit a telescoping of control rod 54. Locking mechanism 52 includes a
locking nut 56 that is held within housing 50 by a thrust bearing 58 and coupled to rod 54
by corresponding high helix threads so that locking nut 56 will rotate if rod 54 translates
through locking nut 56. Locking mechanism 52 further comprises a locking sleeve 60
positioned in housing 50 for axial, but not rotational, movement. For example, sleeve 60
may be held within housing 50 by one or more pins 62 seated in grooves 64 and 66 in
sleeve 60 and housing 50, respectively, so that sleeve 60 cannot rotate but can slide
axially within housing 50. Locking sleeve 60 may move axially within housing 50 from a
first position, where locking sleeve 60 is disengaged from locking nut 56 and a second
position, wherein locking sleeve 60 is engaged with locking nut 56. As seen in Fig. 1, the
leading edge of locking sleeve 60 includes teeth 70 that engage with corresponding teeth
72 on the trailing edge of locking nut. As a result, when locking sleeve 60 is engaged with
locking nut 56, locking sleeve 60 will prevent locking nut 56 from rotating. Similarly,
when locking sleeve 60 is disengaged from locking nut 56, locking nut 56 is free to rotate.
Thus, movement of locking sleeve 60 controls whether rod 54 is free to translate axially
within locking nut 56. One set of teeth 70 or 72 may be ratcheted so that nut 56 can only
rotate in one direction when engaged with locking sleeve, i.e., rod 54 is free to telescope
in one direction but not the other. Locking sleeve 60 is coupled to a piston 76 by a
connecting stem 78. Piston 76 is positioned on the other side of a brake pipe pressure
chamber 80 in fluid communication with brake pipe port 22 so that pressure in chamber
                                               5

80 will move sleeve 60 axially from the engaged position to the disengaged position. A
spring 82 in housing 50 biases locking sleeve 60 into the engaged position in the absence
of sufficient brake pipe pressure in chamber 80. Locking sleeve 60 is also coupled to a
manual release stem 84 that extends out of housing 50 to form manual release 28. Stem 84
includes an eccentric post 86 that, when rotated, engages a shoulder 88 on sleeve 60 to
move locking sleeve 60 out of engagement with locking nut 56 against the bias of spring
82.
[0033] Referring to Fig. 5, rod 54 of parking brake cylinder 12 extends through non
pressure head 16 of brake cylinder 14 into pressure cylinder 18 and is secured to one side
of the brake cylinder piston 90 in pressure cylinder 18. Piston 90 transmits the pressure
associated with a source of brake cylinder pressure supplied to inlet 20 to the braking
system via a push rod 94. When brake pipe pressure is removed from parking brake
cylinder 12, locking sleeve 60 will engage locking nut 56 under the bias of spring 82 so
that rod 54 is fixedly secured from translating through locking nut 56. Parking brake
cylinder 12 will thus prevent brake cylinder piston 90 from returning push rod 94 into a
brakes released position, and thus the rail car braking system, even if brake cylinder
pressure is exhausted from inlet port 20. When a threshold amount of brake pipe pressure
is supplied to chamber 80, locking sleeve 60 will be forced out of engagement with
locking nut 56 (against the bias of spring 82)so that rod 54 is free to move and brake
cylinder piston 90 can return to the brakes released position.
[0034] Referring to Figs. 6-8, two or more parking brake cylinders 12 may be coupled to
brake cylinder 14 if they are oriented symmetrically about the centerline of the push rod
54 of brake cylinder 14 to prevent piston 90 from tipping when under load. To
accommodate multiple parking brake cylinders 12, the manual releases 28 associated with
both parking brake cylinders 14 are interlinked via a connector 96 so that an operation of
a manual release handle by a user will be communicated via chain 30 to both manual
releases 28 simultaneously. As seen in Fig. 7, brake pipe ports 22 of both parking brake
cylinders 12 may also be interconnected so that a single inlet 98 may be used to connect
both parking brake cylinders 12 to a source of brake pipe pressure. As seen in Fig. 8, rods
54 of parking brake cylinders 12 are interconnected to brake cylinder piston 90 on
opposing sides of piston rod 54 to balance the forces on piston 90.
[0035] Referring to Figs. 9-13, an automatic parking brake system 110 may have an
externally coupled parking brake cylinder 112 that is pivotally mounted via a trunnion
                                               6

102 to non-pressure head 116 of brake cylinder 114. Instead of connecting directly to the
brake cylinder piston of brake cylinder 114, rod 154 of parking brake cylinder 112 is
coupled to mechanical parking brake lever 124 via a pivotal connection 104 and covered
by a boot 106. As seen in Fig. 10, mechanical parking brake lever 124 is connected to
brake cylinder piston 190 via links 126 on the outside of non-pressure head 116 that are
coupled to control rods 108 that extend into pressure cylinder 118 and are directly secured
to piston 190. Parking brake cylinder 112 thus locks piston 190 from releasing the brakes
by preventing hand brake lever 124 from pivoting and thus prevents piston 190 from
moving to a brakes released position as control 108 cannot move if parking brake lever
124 is unable to move.
[0036] Referring to Figs. 11 and 12, externally coupled parking brake cylinder 112
comprises a housing 150 having a brake pipe port 122 and enclosing a locking mechanism
152 that is responsive to air pressure supplied to brake pipe port 122. Locking mechanism
152 includes a locking nut 156 that is held within housing 150 by a pair of thrust bearings
158 and is capable of rotating within housing 150. Locking nut 156 is coupled to a rod
154 via corresponding high helix threads so that movement of rod 154 within locking nut
156 will cause locking nut 156 to rotate. Locking mechanism 152 further comprising a
locking sleeve 160 in housing 150 that cannot rotate due to a pair of pins 162 positioned
in corresponding grooves 164 and 166 formed in locking sleeve 160 and rod 154,
respectively. Locking sleeve 160 is free to move axially within housing 150 from a first
position, where locking sleeve 160 is disengaged from locking nut 156 and a second
position, wherein locking sleeve 160 is engaged with locking nut 156. The leading edge of
locking sleeve 160 includes teeth 170 that engage with corresponding teeth 162 on the
trailing edge of locking nut 156. As a result, when locking sleeve 160 is engaged with
locking nut 156, locking sleeve 160 will prevent locking nut 156 from rotating. Similarly,
when locking sleeve 160 is disengaged from locking nut 156, locking nut 156 is free to
rotate. Thus, movement of locking sleeve 160 controls whether rod 154 is free to translate
axially within locking nut 156. A pressure chamber 180 in fluid communication with
brake pipe port 122 is positioned adjacently to shoulder 176 of locking sleeve 160 so that
the introduction of brake pipe pressure into chamber 180 will move locking sleeve 160
axially within housing so that locking sleeve 160 is disengaged from locking nut 156.
Locking sleeve 160 is also coupled to a manual release stem 184 having an eccentric post
186 that, when rotated, will apply a force to a second shoulder 188 of locking sleeve 160
                                               7

to move locking sleeve 160 axially out of engagement with locking nut 156. A spring 182
in housing 150 biases locking sleeve 160 into the engaged position.
[0037] As seen in Fig. 13, teeth 172 of locking nut 156 may be ramped to allow for
ratcheting in one direction, thereby allowing rod 154 to translate through locking nut in
one direction, but not the other. As a result of the ratcheting, brake cylinder piston 190
can move into the brakes applied position even if locking sleeve 160 is engaged with
locking nut 156, but rod 154 cannot move in the opposition direction so any brake
application by piston 190 will be retained into the brakes applied position. When brake
pipe pressure is removed from parking brake cylinder 1 12, locking sleeve 160 will
engage locking nut 156 under the bias of spring 182 so that rod 154 is fixedly secured
from translating through locking nut 156. Parking brake cylinder 1 12 will thus prevent
brake cylinder piston 190 from returning the braking system to the brakes released
position even if brake cylinder pressure is exhausted from inlet port 120. When a
threshold amount of brake pipe pressure is supplied to chamber 180, locking sleeve 160
will be forced out of engagement with locking nut 156 against the bias of spring 182 so
that rod 154 is free to move and brake cylinder piston 190 can return to the brakes
released position.
[0038] Referring to Fig. 14 an automatic parking brake system 210 may comprise one or
more parking brake cylinders 212 coupled to the brake levers 204 and brake beam 206 of
a rail car braking system. As seen in Fig. 15, parking brake cylinder 212 comprises a
housing 250 mounted to or integrally formed with brake beam 206. A locking nut 256 is
positioned in housing 250 and includes a post 208 that extends from housing 250. Post
208 is fixedly secured to brake lever 204 so that post 208 and lever 204 rotate as a single
unit. Locking nut 256 and brake lever 204 will thus rotate as a single unit as brake lever
204 rotates during braking operations. A locking sleeve 260 positioned in housing 250 is
capable of moving from a first position, where locking sleeve 260 is disengage from
locking nut 256, to a second position, where locking sleeve 260 engages locking nut 256.
Locking sleeve 260 cannot rotate within housing 250 due to one or more pins 262
positioned within corresponding grooves 264 and 266 formed in locking sleeve 260 and
the interior surface of housing 250, respectively. The leading edge of locking nut 256
includes a set of teeth 272 that interlock with a corresponding set of teeth 272 on locking
sleeve 260. As described above, one set of teeth 270 or 272 are preferably ratcheted to
allow locking nut 256 to rotate in one direction, but not the other, so that lever 204 can
                                               8

move in one direction, but not the other, when locking nut 256 and locking sleeve 260 are
engaged. A brake pipe pressure chamber 280 in communication with a brake pipe
pressure port 222 is formed in housing 250 and positioned adjacently to a shoulder 276 of
locking sleeve 260 so that pressure in chamber 280 will cause sleeve 260 to move axially
away from locking nut 256. A spring 282 positioned in housing 250 biases sleeve 260
toward locking nut 256 when the pressure in chamber 280 falls below a predetermined
threshold. A manual release 228 at one end of housing 250 allows for manually
disengagement of locking sleeve 260 and locking nut 256 by allowing sleeve 260 to be
moved axially against the bias of spring 282 even in the absence of brake pipe pressure in
brake pipe pressure chamber 280.
[0039] Prior to a service brake or emergency brake operation, brake cylinder pressure will
nominally zero and the brake pipe pressure will be between 60 and 110 psig. Because of
the brake pipe pressure, the locking mechanism of any parking brake cylinder described
above will be disengaged. When the service brake or emergency brake is applied, the
brake cylinder will apply the brakes and the parking brake cylinder will remain
disengaged because the brake pipe pressure remains between 60 and 1 10 psig. If a
parking brake operation is not desired, the service brake or emergency brake may be
stopped by removing brake cylinder pressure, thus allowing the brake cylinder to return to
the brakes released position as locking mechanism remains disengaged. If a parking brake
operation is desired, brake pipe pressure is removed prior to removing brake cylinder
pressure. The removal of brake pipe pressure allows any locking sleeve described above
to move into engagement with the locking nut. If brake cylinder pressure is subsequently
removed, the braking system will not return to the brakes released position because
locking mechanism has engaged and parking brake cylinder prevents the brake cylinder
piston or brake lever from moving back to a brakes released position. A subsequent
application of brake pipe pressure will disengage the locking sleeve and locking nut,
thereby releasing the parking brake so that the brakes may return to the released position.
Alternatively, the parking brake may be manually released by using any of the manual
release connections discussed above. Notably, the manual release may not be manually
undone as only a brake application and the removal of brake pipe pressure can reset the
locking mechanism of parking brake cylinder. If locking mechanism is engaged due to the
absence of brake pipe pressure, but the brakes are in the released position, the brakes may
be still put into the applied position by an application of brake cylinder pressure because
                                               9

the ratcheted connection between the locking nut and the locking sleeve will allow the
brake cylinder to be pressurized and move from the brakes released position to brakes
applied (but not from brakes applied to brakes released). Table 1 below identifies the state
of the relevant components during the various operational states of the braking system.

[0040] Referring to Figs. 16-17, an automatic parking brake system 310 may be
configured to avoid undesirable high loading on a parking brake cylinder 312 and the
pressure needed to release parking brake cylinder 312 if hand brake forces are added via
mechanical parking brake lever 324. Mechanical parking brake lever 324 is pivotally
mounted to non-pressure head 316 of brake cylinder 314 and coupled at one end 400 to
brake cylinder piston inside pressure cylinder 318 via a pair of slotted links 402 on
opposing sides of non-pressure head 316. As previously seen in Fig. 2 with respect to
hand brake lever 24, the opposing end 404 of lever 324 may also be interconnected to a
conventional hand brake 40, such as by a chain 38, that when taken up by hand brake, will
pull the upper end of lever 324 toward the pressure cylinder 318 of brake cylinder 314 and
mechanically apply the brakes by pulling on piston rods attached to the piston of brake
cylinder 314. Mechanical parking brake lever 324 can thus move the braking system into
the brakes applied position in the absence of any brake cylinder pressure if a hand brake
40 is used to tension chain 38 and move hand brake lever 324. Hand brake lever 324 is
also interconnected at an intermediate point to manual release 328 via a parking brake link
406. One end of parking brake link 406 is pivotally attached to hand brake lever 324. The
opposing end of parking brake link 406 includes an actuator 414 that is positioned
proximately to a cam 416 that is associated with manual release 328 and capable of
rotating manual release 328 if contacted. Parking brake link 406 include a slot 420 formed
therethrough that is captured by a post 422 extending from a bracket 424 mounted to one
                                             10

side of parking brake cylinder 312. Bracket 424 and post 422 support link 406 in
proximity to cam 416 and allow link 406 to translate from a first position, where actuator
414 is spaced apart from or not applying a force to cam 416, into a second position, where
actuator 414 has contacted and applied a force to cam 416 such that manual release 328 is
rotated. Thus, when hand brake lever is moved 324, link 406 pushes cam 416 to rotate
manual release stem 328, thereby disengaging locking mechanism 352 of parking brake
cylinder 312.
[0041] As seen in Fig. 18, hand brake lever 324 could also contact and move cam 416 via
a push rod 430 that is contacted by a shoulder 434 on hand brake lever 324. Push rod 430
is biased by a spring 432 so that push rod 430 will move out of engagement with cam 416
if hand brake lever 324 moves to the released position. Alternatively, as seen in Fig. 19,
manual release 328 could include a parking brake chain lever 440 that is interconnected to
chain 38 via a spring so that when lever 440 is moved and manual release 328 is rotated
when chain 38 is taken up by a hand brake 40.
[0042] Referring to Fig. 20, parking brake cylinder 312 comprises a housing 350 that is
mounted to non-pressure head 316 and, internally of pressure cylinder 318, to brake
piston 390 and includes a brake pipe port 322. Housing 350 encloses a locking
mechanism 352 that is responsive to air pressure supplied to brake pipe port 322 to
selectively permit a control rod 354 to telescope into and out of control nut 356. As in
prior examples, rod 354 is mechanically connected to the piston of brake cylinder 314 and
thus rod 354 moves in combination with the piston. Locking mechanism 352 includes a
locking nut 356 that is held within housing 350 by a thrust bearing 358 and coupled to rod
354 by corresponding high helix threads to that nut 356 will rotate if rod 354 translates
through nut 356. Locking mechanism 352 further comprises a locking sleeve 360
positioned in housing 350 for axial, but not rotational, movement. For example, sleeve
360 may be held within housing 350 by one or more pins 362 seated in grooves 364 and
366 formed in sleeve 360 and housing 350, respectively, so that sleeve 360 cannot rotate
but can move axially within housing 350. Locking sleeve 360 may move axially within
housing 350 from a first position, where locking sleeve 360 is disengaged from locking
nut 356 and a second position, wherein locking sleeve 360 is engaged with locking nut
356. As discussed previously, the leading edge of locking sleeve 360 includes teeth 370
that engage with corresponding teeth 372 on the trailing edge of locking nut 356. As a
result, when locking sleeve 360 is engaged with locking nut 356, locking sleeve 360 will
                                              11

prevent locking nut 356 from rotating. Similarly, when locking sleeve 360 is disengaged
from locking nut 356, locking nut 356 is free to rotate. Thus, movement of locking sleeve
360 controls whether rod 354 is free to translate axially within locking nut 356. One set of
teeth 370 or 372 may be ratcheted so that nut 356 can only rotate in one direction when
engaged with locking sleeve, i.e., rod 354 is free to telescope in one direction but not the
other. Locking sleeve 360 is coupled to a piston assembly 376 by a connecting stem 378.
Piston assembly 376 is positioned on the other side of a brake pipe pressure chamber 380
in fluid communication with brake pipe port 322 so that pressure in chamber assembly
380 will move sleeve 360 axially from the engaged position to the disengaged position. A
spring 382 in housing 350 biases locking sleeve 360 into the engaged position in the
absence of sufficient brake pipe pressure in chamber assembly 380. Locking sleeve 360 is
also coupled to a manual release stem 384 that extends out of housing 350 to form manual
release 328. Stem 384 includes an eccentric post 386 that, when rotated, will engage a
shoulder 388 on sleeve 360 to move locking sleeve 360 out of engagement with locking
nut 356 against the bias of spring 382. Parking brake cylinder 312 will thus prevent brake
cylinder 314 from returning to the brakes released position even if brake cylinder pressure
is exhausted from inlet port 320. When a threshold amount of brake pipe pressure is
supplied to chamber assembly 380, however, locking sleeve 360 will be forced against the
bias of spring 382 and out of engagement with locking nut 356 so that rod 354 is free to
move and brake cylinder 314 can return to the brakes released position.
[0043] When installed in a truck mounted brake system, automatic parking brake system
310 will be automatically be deactivated when the hand brake is applied, unlocking
allowing the brake rigging to release at or below a predetermined control pressure. For
example, Table 2 below identifies the maximum release pressures achievable by
automatic parking brake system 310 at various initial brake pipe charges.
Table 2
Initial Brake Pipe Charge              Maximum Parking Brake Release Pressure
70 psi                                 45 psi
80 psi                                 60 psi
90 psi                                 70 psi
110psi                                 90 psi
[0044] The release pressure threshold may be verified by initiating an emergency brake
application from the initial brake pipe charge as indicated in Table 2. The hand brake may
                                              12

then be fully applied so that 3,350 lbs. of force has been generated in the vertical chain.
The hand brake may then be released and, using the manual release feature of a brake
control valve, the pneumatic brake application may be released. The brake pipe may then
be recharged to ensure that the automatic parking brake system at or below the listed
value.
