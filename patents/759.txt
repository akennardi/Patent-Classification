               An improved column forming apparatus and process
Field of the Invention
[1]      This invention relates generally to column forming within the building industry. More
particularly, this invention relates to improved column forming apparatus which may be preassembled
off-site and a process for column forming utilising the apparatus which reduces on-site handling.
Background of the Invention
[2]      Confirmation typically entails erecting an encasing quadrant of wooden panels around a
reinforcement bar (rebar) cage and providing bracing therearound which may include supportive
strutting.
[3]      Concrete isthen poured via the upper open end thereof whereafter, once the concrete is set,
the bracing and panelling is removed, leaving the column in place.
[4]      The present invention seeks to provide an improved way in which to form columns, which will
overcome or substantially ameliorate at least some of the deficiencies of the prior art, or to at least
provide an alternative.
[5]      It is to be understood that, if any prior art information is referred to herein, such reference
does not constitute an admission that the information forms part of the common general knowledge
in the art, in Australia or any other country.

Description of Embodiments
[21]     Figure 1 shows a top perspective view of column forming apparatus 100 standing upright
between floors 101. The column forming apparatus 100 comprises a rectangular encasement 102
having rebar caging 101 therein.
[22]    The lower peripheral edge and, in embodiments, the upper peripheral edge at the soffit may
be temporarily sealed with timber batons 103 when pouring concrete.
[23]    Concrete may be poured via the upper open end of the apparatus 100 and allow to set. Once
the concrete is set, the apparatus 100 may be left in place and finished with paint, render or other
suitable finishing such as plasterboard.
[24]     Figure 2 shows a top plan view of the apparatus 100 and Figure 3 shows a top plan view of the
apparatus comprising the rebar 101 located therein.
[25]    The encasement 102 to be manufactured from sheeting, preferably 2.5 mm thick minimum
300 MPa steel sheeting conforming to AS NZ S1594.
                                                     2

[26]      Bracing 105 is connected to inner surfaces of the encasement 102 to provide structural
rigidity, including resisting against outward bowing when pouring concrete.
[27]      In a preferred embodiments, the bracing 105 comprises a plurality of vertically orientated C
channel sections.
[28]      In embodiments, the bracing 105 is connected to the inner surfaces of the encasement 102,
such as by welding
[29]      In embodiments, each or at least a subset of the bracing 105 may span between sections of
sheeting sections, joining the sheeting sections together. In embodiments as will be described in
further detail below, the sheeting sections may meet and join at the central bracing 105.
[30]      In a preferred embodiment, the bracing 105 is located a maximum of 190 mm apart and
extends into the interior of the encasement 102 by a maximum of 30 mm.
[31]      In embodiments, bracing 105 of differing dimensions may be utilised including those
substantially provided in figures 4 - 6.
[32]      Specifically, Figure 6 illustrates central bracing 105 comprising a width of 100 mm and a depth
of 30 mm. As is illustrated in Figure 2, the central bracing 105 may be located centrally along the long
sections of the encasement 102, thereby providing an effective connection area of greater than 60
mm wide x the full height of the apparatus 100.
[33]      Figure 5 illustrates corner bracing which, with reference to Figure 2 may be located at the
corners of the encasement 102. As can be seen, the corner bracing 105 may comprise a width of
approximately 75 mm and a short edge having a depth of 30 mm and a long edge having a depth of
50 mm. With reference to Figure 2, the width wise surface of the corner bracing 105 is connected to
the respective long section of the encasement 102 and the long edge depth wise surface of the corner
bracing 105 is located to the short section of the encasement, thereby similarly providing an effective
connection area of greater than 60 mm x the full height of the apparatus 100.
[34]      Figure 4 illustrates the smaller bracing 105 which may be equidistantly spaced between the
central bracing 105 on the corner bracing 105 as is illustrated in Figure 2.
[35]      Figure 3 illustrates the rebar cage 101 located within the encasement 102. As can be seen, the
bracing 105 cooperates so as to stand off and contact the rebar cage 101 by 30 mm from all sides.
[36]      With the reference to the magnified view of Figure 3, the stirrups 106 of the rebar cage 101
may be spot welded 108 to certain of the bracing 105 using pegs 107.
[37]      Figure 7 shows an elevation view illustrating the interconnection between the rebar cage 101
and the bracing 105 by tack welding. As can be seen, the stirrups of the rebar cage 101 are spot welded
to the bracing 105, preferably at both sides thereof. In the embodiments shown, each stirrup 106 is
welded to both sides of each brace 105.
                                                        3

[38]     In embodiments, the rebar cage 101 may be manufactured according to the structural
engineering requirements wherein, for example, upper spacing between the stirrups 106 may be
space by a maximum of 300 mm or 325 mm as is represented. Towards the lower end of the rebar
cage 101, such as to within 1200 mm from the base thereof, the stirrups 106 may be located a
maximum of 225 mm apart.
[39]     As is also shown in Figure 7, the encasement 102 and the bracing 105 may comprise a
maximum height of 6500 mm for a floor to ceiling height of 6000 mm, thereby extending
approximately 20 mm beyond the soffit.
[40]     Figure 8 illustrates a column forming process 109 comprising off-site preassembly and on-site
column forming in accordance with an exemplary embodiment
[41]     The exemplary process 109 may comprise forming three sides of the encasement 102, being
the long side and the two short sides. The bracing 105 may be installed thereafter by welding.
Alternatively, the bracing 105 may be connected prior the assembly of the sections.
[42]     Each long side may be formed from two sheets joining at the central bracing 105.
[43]     At step 112 the rebar cage 101 is then inserted via the open end thereof and spot welded to
the channels 105 using the pegs 107 in the aforedescribed manner at step 113.
[44]     Thereafter, at step 114 the remaining sheet may close off the open long edge and encase the
rebar 101 therein. The remaining sheet may be attached using plug welding thereby providing a
relatively smooth exterior surface for the encasement 102.
[45]     At step 115, the preassembled assembly 100 may be delivered to a construction site.
[46]     On-site, the preassembled assembly 100 may be stood upright 116 at step 116 in the manner
substantially provided in Figure 1. At step 117, the lower periphery and, in embodiments, the upper
periphery of the soffit may be sealed utilising the timber battens 103.
[47]     At step 118, concrete is poured within the upper open end of the assembly 100, preferably in
two stages. As alluded to above, the interior bracing 105 prevents the encasement 101 from flexing
outwardly during the concrete pouring process.
[48]     At step 119, the concrete within the apparatus 100 is allowed to set.
[49]     Finally, at step 120, the apparatus 100 with the set concrete therein is left in place and
preferably finished using a coat of paint, render or overlaid with structural panelling, such as
plasterboard or the like.
