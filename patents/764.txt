                                                    BACKGROUND
[00021     It is known in the art to include an oxygen scavenger in the packaging structure for the
protection of oxygen sensitive materials. Such scavengers are believed to react with oxygen that is
trapped in the package or that permeates from outside of the package, thus extending to life of package
contents. These packages include films, bottles, containers, and the like. Food, beverages (such as beer
and fruit juices), cosmetics, medicines, and the like are particularly sensitive to oxygen exposure and
require high barrier properties to oxygen to preserve the freshness of the package contents and avoid
changes in flavour, texture and color.
[00031     Use of certain polyamides in combination with a transition metal is known to be useful as the
oxygen scavenging material. One particularly useful polyamide is MXD6 which contains meta-xylene
residues in the polymer chain. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,639,815; 5,049,624; and 5,021,515.
[00041     Other oxygen scavengers include potassium sulphite (U.S. Pat. No. 4,536,409), unsaturated
hydrocarbons (U.S. Pat. No. 5,211,875), and ascorbic acid derivatives (U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,362).
[00051     In barrier layers of packaging walls that are made from blends of oxygen scavenging materials
with base polymer resins such as PET, haze can result due to such factors as the immiscibility of the
scavenging materials with the base polymer resins and the inability to create by mechanical blending
means disperse-phase domains that are so small as not to interfere with the passage of light therethrough;
and the adverse influence of the scavenging material on the crystallization behaviour of PET base resin.
One approach to minimizing such haze is careful selection of base resin to improve dispersibility of the
scavenger material and, thus, reduce, but not substantially eliminate, haze; and to minimize
                                                             1

 the adverse crystallization effect. This approach may undesirably narrowly restrict the
 choice of base polymer resin. Another approach is to use compositions that serve as
 compatibilizers to reduce haze. These approaches add cost to the layer and the
 compatibilizer adds an additional material that must be evaluated for its suitability for
 contact with food. Thus, there is a need in the art for improved materials which provide high
 oxygen scavenging capability and are substantially transparent.

  such carriers, and the like.
  [0015]      "Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or
 circumstance can or cannot occur, and that the description includes instances where the
 event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.
  [0016]     Ranges may be expressed herein as from "about" one particular value, and/or to
 "about" another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another aspect includes
 from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values
 are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent "about," it will be understood that
 the particular value forms another aspect. It will be further understood that the endpoints of
 each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently
 of the other endpoint.
 [0017]      A weight percent of a component, unless specifically stated to the contrary, is
 based on the total weight of the formulation or composition in which the component is
 included.
 [0018]      As used herein, "master batch" refers to a mixture of base polymer, oxidizable
 organic component, and transition metal that will be diluted, typically with at least
additional base polymer, prior to forming an article. As such, the concentrations of
oxidizable organic component and transition metal are higher than in the formed article.

 [0023]       The following chemical hierarchy is used throughout the specification to
 describe and enable the scope of the present disclosure and to particularly point out and
 distinctly claim the units which comprise the compounds of the present disclosure, however,
 unless otherwise specifically defined, the terms used herein are the same as those of the
 artisan of ordinary skill. The term "hydrocarbyl" stands for any carbon atom-based unit
 (organic molecule), said units optionally containing one or more organic functional group,
 including inorganic atom comprising salts, inter alia, carboxylate salts, quaternary
 ammonium salts. Within the broad meaning of the term "hydrocarbyl" are the classes
 "acyclic hydrocarbyl" and "cyclic hydrocarbyl" which terms are used to divide hydrocarbyl
units into cyclic and non-cyclic classes.
 [0024]      As it relates to the following definitions, "cyclic hydrocarbyl" units can
comprise only carbon atoms in the ring (carbocyclic and aryl rings) or can comprise one or
more heteroatoms in the ring (heterocyclic and heteroaryl). For "carbocyclic" rings the
lowest number of carbon atoms in a ring are 3 carbon atoms; cyclopropyl. For "aryl" rings
the lowest number of carbon atoms in a ring are 6 carbon atoms; phenyl. For "heterocyclic"
rings the lowest number of carbon atoms in a ring is 1 carbon atom; diazirinyl. Ethylene
oxide comprises 2 carbon atoms and is a C2 heterocycle. For "heteroaryl" rings the lowest
number of carbon atoms in a ring is 1 carbon atom; 1,2,3,4-tetrazolyl. The following is a
non-limiting description of the terms "acyclic hydrocarbyl" and "cyclic hydrocarbyl" as
used herein.

  [00281           For the purposes of the present disclosure, and to provide consistency in
 defining the present disclosure, fused ring units, as well as spirocyclic rings, bicyclic rings
 and the like, which comprise a single heteroatom will be characterized and referred to
 herein as being encompassed by the cyclic family corresponding to the heteroatom
 containing ring, although the artisan can have alternative characterizations. For example,
  1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline having the formula:
                                                      N
                                                      H

 5H-cyclopentapyrimidine having the formula:
                                               N
 is, for the purposes of the present disclosure, considered a heteroaryl unit. When a fused
ring unit contains heteroatoms in both a saturated ring (heterocyclic ring) and an aryl ring
(heteroaryl ring), the aryl ring will predominate and determine the type of category to which
                                                 12

  the ring is assigned herein for the purposes of describing the disclosure. For example,
   1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,8]naphthyridine having the formula:
                                                     H

  is, for the purposes of the present disclosure, considered a heteroaryl unit.
  [0029]       The term "substituted" is used throughout the specification. The term
  "substituted" is applied to the units described herein as "substituted unit or moiety is a
  hydrocarbyl unit or moiety, whether acyclic or cyclic, which has one or more hydrogen
  atoms replaced by a substituent or several substituents as defined herein below." The units,
  when substituting for hydrogen atoms are capable of replacing one hydrogen atom, two
  hydrogen atoms, or three hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbyl moiety at a time. In addition,
  these substituents can replace two hydrogen atoms on two adjacent carbons to form said
  substituent, new moiety, or unit. For example, a substituted unit that requires a single
 hydrogen atom replacement includes halogen, hydroxyl, and the like. A two hydrogen atom
 replacement includes carbonyl, oximino, and the like. A two hydrogen atom replacement
 from adjacent carbon atoms includes epoxy, and the like. Three hydrogen replacement
 includes cyano, and the like. The term substituted is used throughout the present
 specification to indicate that a hydrocarbyl moiety, inter alia, aromatic ring, alkyl chain; can
 have one or more of the hydrogen atoms replaced by a substituent. When a moiety is
 described as "substituted" any number of the hydrogen atoms can be replaced. For
 example, 4-hydroxyphenyl is a "substituted aromatic carbocyclic ring (aryl ring)", (N,N
 dimethyl-5-amino)octanyl is a " substituted C8 linear alkyl unit, 3-guanidinopropyl is a
 "substituted C3 linear alkyl unit," and 2-carboxypyridinyl is a "substituted heteroaryl unit."
 Polymer Composition
 [0030]       Disclosed herein are polymer compositions comprising one or more oxygen
 scavengers. The oxygen scavengers can be added during the formation of the polymer
composition or the oxygen scavengers can be formed in situ during the formulation of the
composition, during the formation of an article of manufacture comprising the composition,
or upon curing or other process step chosen by the formulator. The end product oxygen
scavenger can be formed in situ by the degradation of a precursor or, alternatively, the
oxygen scavenger can result from the break down of an oxygen scavenger in the course of
the first scavenger successfully scavenging oxygen.

  blended with hot, dry PET resin (Heatwave CF746 from Eastman Chemicals) and a PET
  based Cobalt Neodecanoate Masterbatch. The Heatwave CF746 PET resin was dried in
  Matsui dryer at 3 10*F for ~ 6 hrs with air dew point of -40"F. The final compositions were
  melt-blended in a BOY 22 S injection molder as follows: PET = 95.6% (w/w), compound n
  metaxylylene-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-lone = 1.4% (w/w) and PET based Cobalt
 Neodecanoate Masterbatch = 3% (w/w) (160 ppm Co). The BOY 22 S injection molder
  barrel temperatures during injection molding was   -   270"C for both zones, the injection
 pressure was ~ 600 psi, nozzle heater and sprue heater temperatures were ~ 275"C. The
 mold was water cooled.
  [0061]       Plaques formed from the above composition were collected and tested for
  oxygen scavenging ability using Oxysense'm. The plaques were ground to fine powder,
 placed in a sealed glass vial, with a photoluminescent window on the wall. The intensity of
  light reflected from the photoluminescent window is proportional to the oxygen content in
 the vial. The Oxysensem data for the above composition and a control composition
 comprised of Constar International's DC-100 is shown in Figure 1. As seen from the data of
 Figure 1, the compound n-metaxylylene-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-lone does scavenge
 oxygen when melt-blended with cobalt catalyst in a PET matrix.

  1.4 weight % of this compound (lot number LP 081710, prepared by Cymer LLC, Decatur,
 TN) was mixed with dried Eastlon CB-651S PET resin (lot number 0104896, manufactured
 by Far Eastern Textiles) and 80 ppm cobalt catalyst (added as a solid masterbatch of Cobalt
 Neodecanoate in PET). The PET resin was dried in a Piovan dryer at 170"C for 4 hours
 before being used for mixing. The mixture was fed into the BOY 22 S injection molding
 machine to mold plaques. The BOY 22 S injection molder barrel temperatures during
 injection molding was    - 275"C for both heating zones, the injection pressure was - 700 psi,

 nozzle heater and sprue heater temperatures were ~ 280"C. The mold was water cooled.
 [0063]       Plaques formed from the above composition were collected and tested for
 oxygen scavenging ability using OxysenseJ.        The plaques were ground to fine powder,
 placed in a sealed glass vial, with a photoluminescent window on the wall. The intensity of
 light reflected from the photoluminescent window is proportional to the oxygen content in
 the vial. The Oxysensem data for the above composition, a similar composition comprised
 of Constar International's DC-300 as the oxygen scavenger, and a control composition
 comprised of Constar International's DC-100 are shown in Figure 2. As seen from the data
 of Figure 2, the compound 2-benzyl-l-isoindolinone (DCX-300-1) does scavenge oxygen
 when melt-blended with cobalt catalyst in a PET matrix.
 [0064]       In addition to preparing the disclosed oxygen scavenger encompassed within this
 aspect, the formulator can purchase the compounds from one or more suppliers when
 available. The compounds can also be formed in situ. For example, the addition of 2,2'
 [1,3-pehenylenebis(methylene)]diisoindolin-1-one having the formula:

 Thermoplastic Polymers
 [0067]      Non-limiting examples of suitable thermoplastic polymers that can be used alone
 or with other polymers include both homopolymers and copolymers, of olefinically
 unsaturated monomers, for example, polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene,
 polybutadiene, poly-halohydrocarbons such as polyvinyl chloride, polychloroprene,
 polyvinylidene chloride, polyfluoro olefins, natural and synthetic rubbers such as
 copolymers of olefinically unsaturated monomers including styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR
 rubber), ethylenepropylene copolymers, ethylene-propylenediene terpolymers such as the
 terpolymer of ethylene, propylene and cyclopentadiene or 1,4-cyclooctadiene,
 polybutadiene rubbers such as cis-polybutadiene rubber, poly-2-chloro-1,3-butadiene
 (neoprene) and poly-2-methyl- 1,3-butadiene (isoprene rubber) , acrylonitrile-butadiene
 styrene (ABS) resins, ethylenevinyl acetate copolymers, butene-methylacrylate copolymers,
 nitrogen-containing polymers such as polyurethanes, nitrile rubber, and lauryl acrylate
 vinyl-pyrrolidone copolymers.
 Antioxidant Protection by the Disclosed Oxygen Scavengers
 [0068]      The disclosed oxygen scavengers can also protect other compounds and
 compositions that are susceptible to damage by oxygen. The following are non-limiting
 examples.
 [0069]      Petroleum oils such as solvent-refined, midcontinent lubricating oil and
 Gulfcoast lubricating oils are effectively stabilized. In hydrocarbon lubricating oils, both
 mineral and synthetic, the present additives are particularly effective when used in
                                                29

WO 2011/060304                                                            PCT/US2010/056594
 combination with a zinc dihydrocarbyldithiophosphate, e.g. zinc dialkyldithiophosphate or
 zinc dialkaryldithiophosphate.
 [0070]      Synthetic ester lubricants such as those used in turbines and turbojet engines are
 given a high degree of stabilization. Typical synthetic ester lubricants include di-2
 ethylhexyl sebacate, trimethylolpropane tripelargonate, C5 -C9 aliphatic monocarboxylic
 esters of pentaerythritol, complex esters formed by condensing under esterifying conditions,
 mixtures of polyols, polycarboxylic acids, and aliphatic monocarboxylic acids and/or
 monohydric alkanols. An example of these complex esters is the condensation product
 formed from adipic acid, ethyleneglycol and a mixture of C5-C9 aliphatic monocarboxylic
 acids. Plasticizers such as dioctyl phthalate are effectively protected. Heavy petroleum
 fractions such as tar and asphalt can also be protected should the need arise.
 [0071]      Polyamides such as adipic acid-1,6-diaminohexane condensates and poly-6
 aminohexanoic acid (nylon) are effectively stabilized. Polyalkylene oxides such as
 copolymers of phenol with ethylene oxide or propylene oxide are stabilized. Polyphenyl
 ethers such as poly-2,6-dimethylphenyl ether formed by polymerization of 2,6
 dimethylphenol using a copper-pyridine catalyst are stabilized. Polycarbonate plastics and
 other polyformaldehydes are also protected.
 [0072]      Linear polyesters such as phthalic anhydride-glycol condensates are given a high
 degree of protection. Polyesters such as those derived from terephthalic acid and alkylene
 glycols are also given a high degree of protection. Other polyesters such as trimellitic acid
 glycerol condensates are also protected. Polyacrylates such as polymethylacrylate and
 polymethylmethacrylate are effectively stabilized. Polyacrylonitriles and copolymers of
 acrylonitriles with other olefinically unsaturated monomers such as methylmeth-acrylates
 are also effectively stabilized.
 [0073]      The additives can be used to protect any of the many organic substrates to which
 an antioxidant is normally added. It can be used where economics permit to protect such
 substrates as asphalt, paper, fluorocarbons such as Teflon@, polyvinyl acetate,
 polyvinylidene chloride, coumarone-indene resins, polyvinyl ethers, polyvinylidene
 bromide, polyvinyl bromide, acrylonitrile, vinyl bromide copolymer, vinyl butyral resins,
 silicones such as dimethylsilicone lubricants, phosphate lubricants such as
 tricresylphosphate, and the like.
                                                3V

WO 2011/060304                                                                 PCT/US2010/056594
 [0074]       One embodiment disclosed herein is the incorporation of the disclosed oxygen
 scavenger into polyethylene terephthalate formulations which further include a transition
 metal catalyst. The oxygen scavenger works particularly well in the presence of the
 transition metal catalyst.
 [0075]       In combination with the composition components, compositions disclosed herein
 can include a transition metal salt, compound or complex, as an oxygen scavenger catalyst.
 The transition metal can be selected from the first, second, or third transition series of the
 Periodic Table. The metal can be Rh, Ru, or one of the elements in the series of Sc to Zn
 (i.e., Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). Suitable anions for the salts include, but
 are not limited to, chloride, acetate, oleate, stearate, palmitate, 2-ethylhexanoate,
 neodecanoate, and naphthenate. Representative salts include cobalt (II) 2-ethylhexanoate,
 cobalt oleate, and cobalt (II) neodecanoate. The metal salt also can be an ionomer, in which
 case a polymeric counter ion can be employed.
 [0076]       The amounts of the components used in the oxygen scavenging formulations of
 the present disclosure can affect the use and effectiveness of this composition. Thus, the
 amounts of polymer, transition metal catalyst, antioxidant, polymeric diluents, additives,
 etc., can vary depending on the desired article and its end use. For example, one of the
 primary functions of the antioxidant or oxygen scavenging molecules described above is to
 react irreversibly with oxygen during the scavenging process, while a primary function of
 the transition metal catalyst is to facilitate this process. Thus, to a large extent, the amount
 of antioxidant (or oxygen scavenging molecules) present affects the oxygen scavenging
 capacity of the composition, i.e., the amount of oxygen that the composition can consume,
 while the amount of transition metal catalyst affects the rate at which oxygen is consumed
 as well as the induction period.
 [0077]       Methods of incorporating the additive into the substrate are well known. For
 example, if the substrate is liquid the additive can be merely mixed into the substrate.
 Frequently the organic substrate is in solution and the additive is added to the solution and
 the solvent removed. Solid organic substrates can be merely sprayed with a solution of the
 additive in a volatile solvent. For example, stabilized grain products result from spraying
 the grain with a toluene solution of the additive. In the case of rubbery polymers the
 additive can be added following the polymerization stage by mixing it with the final
 emulsion or solution polymerization mixture and then coagulating or removing solvent to
                                                   31

WO 2011/060304                                                                PCT/US2010/056594
 recover the stabilized polymer. It can also be added at the compounding stage by merely
 mixing the additive with the rubbery polymer in commercial mixing equipment such as a
 Banbury blender. In this manner, rubbery polymers such as styrene-butadiene rubber,
 cispolybutadiene or isoprene polymers are blended with the antioxidant together with the
 other ingredients normally added such as carbon black, oil, sulfur, zinc oxide, stearic acid,
 vulcanization accelerators, and the like. Following mastication, the resultant mixture is
 fabricated and molded into a finished form and vulcanized.
 [0078]       The oxygen scavenger composition of the present disclosure can be incorporated
 in packaging articles having various forms. Suitable articles include, but are not limited to,
 flexible sheet films, flexible bags, pouches, semi-rigid and rigid containers such as bottles
 (e.g. PET bottles) or metal cans, or combinations thereof.
 [0079]      Typical flexible films and bags include those used to package various food items
 and can be made up of one or a multiplicity of layers to form the overall film or bag-like
 packaging material. The oxygen scavenger composition of the present disclosure can be
 used in one, some or all of the layers of such packaging material.
 [0080]      Typical rigid or semi-rigid articles include plastic, paper or cardboard containers,
 such as those utilized for juices, soft drinks, as well as thermoformed trays or cups normally
 having thickness in the range of from 100 to 1000 micrometers. The walls of such articles
 can comprise single or multiple layers of materials. The articles can also take the form of a
bottle or metal can, or a crown, cap, crown or cap liner, plastisol or gasket. The oxygen
 scavenger composition of the present disclosure can be used as an integral layer or portion
 of, or as an external or internal coating or liner of, the formed semi-rigid or rigid packaging
 article. As a liner, the oxygen scavenger composition can be extruded as a film along with
the rigid article itself, in e.g. a coextrusion, extrusion coating, or extrusion lamination
process, so as to form the liner in situ during article production; or alternatively can be
adhered by heat and/or pressure, by adhesive, or by any other suitable method to an outer
surface of the article after the article has been produced.
 [0081]      Although it can be preferable from the standpoint of packaging convenience
and/or scavenging effectiveness to employ the present disclosure as an integral or discrete
part of the packaging wall, the disclosure can also be used as a non-integral component of a
packaging article such as, for example, a bottle cap liner, adhesive or non-adhesive sheet
insert, sealant, sachet, fibrous mat insert or the like.

  [0082]      Besides articles applicable for packaging food and beverage, articles for
 packaging other oxygen-sensitive products can also benefit from the present disclosure.
  Such products would include pharmaceuticals, oxygen sensitive medical products,
 corrodible metals or products, electronic devices and the like.
  [0083]      In some embodiments of the disclosure, the base polymer in the composition is a
 polyester. In certain embodiments, the polyester polymers of the disclosure are
 thermoplastic and, thus, the form of the compositions are not limited and can include a
 composition in the melt phase polymerization, as an amorphous pellet, as a solid stated
 polymer, as a semi-crystalline particle, as a composition of matter in a melt processing zone,
 as a bottle preform, or in the form of a stretch blow molded bottle or other articles. In
 certain preferred embodiments, the polyester is polyethylene terephthalate (PET).
  [0084]      Examples of suitable polyester polymers include polyethylene terephthalate
 homopolymers and copolymers modified with one or more polycarboxylic acid modifiers in
 a cumulative amount of less than about 15 mole %, or about 10 mole % or less, or about 8
 mole % or less, or one or more hydroxyl compound modifiers in an amount of less than
 about 60 mol %, or less than about 50 mole %, or less than about 40 mole %, or less than
 about 15 mole %, or about 10 mole % or less, or about 8 mole % or less (collectively
 referred to for brevity as "PET") and polyethylene naphthalate homopolymers and
 copolymers modified with a cumulative amount of with less than about 15 mole %, or about
  10 mole % or less, or about 8 mole % or less, of one or more polycarboxylic acid modifiers
 or modified less than about 60 mol %, or less than about 50 mole %, or less than about 40
 mole %, or less than about 15 mole %, or about 10 mole % or less, or about 8 mole % or
 less of one or more hydroxyl compound modifiers (collectively referred to herein as
 "PEN"), and blends of PET and PEN. A modifier polycarboxylic acid compound or
 hydroxyl compound is a compound other than the compound contained in an amount of at
 least about 85 mole %. The preferred polyester polymer is polyalkylene terephthalate, and
 most preferred is PET.
 [0085]      In some embodiments, the polyester polymer contains at least about 90 mole %
 ethylene terephthalate repeat units, and in other embodiments, at least about 92 mole %, and
 in yet other embodiments, or at least about 94 mole %, based on the moles of all repeat units
 in the polyester polymers.
 [0086]      In addition to a diacid component of terephthalic acid, derivates of terephthalic
                                                33

 acid, naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, derivatives of naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid,
 or mixtures thereof, the polycarboxylic acid component(s) of the present polyester can
 include one or more additional modifier polycarboxylic acids. Such additional modifier
 polycarboxylic acids include aromatic dicarboxylic acids preferably having about 8 to about
  14 carbon atoms, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids preferably having about 4 to about 12 carbon
 atoms, or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids preferably having about 8 to about 12 carbon
 atoms. Examples of modifier dicarboxylic acids useful as an acid component(s) are phthalic
 acid, isophthalic acid, naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid,
 cyclohexanediacetic acid, diphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid,
 adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, and the like, with isophthalic acid, naphthalene-2,6
 dicarboxylic acid, and cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid being most preferable. It should be
 understood that use of the corresponding acid anhydrides, esters, and acid chlorides of these
 acids is included in the term "polycarboxylic acid." It is also possible for trifunctional and
 higher order polycarboxylic acids to modify the polyester.
 [0087]      The hydroxyl component is made from compounds containing 2 or more
 hydroxyl groups capable of reacting with a carboxylic acid group. In some preferred
 embodiments, preferred hydroxyl compounds contain 2 or 3 hydroxyl groups. Certain
 preferred embodiments, have 2 hydroxyl groups. These hydroxyl compounds include C2 -C4
 alkane diols, such as ethylene glycol, propane diol, and butane diol, among which ethylene
 glycol is most preferred for container applications. In addition to these diols, other modifier
 hydroxyl compound component(s) can include diols such as cycloaliphatic diols preferably
 having 6 to 20 carbon atoms and/or aliphatic diols preferably having about 3 to about 20
 carbon atoms. Examples of such diols include diethylene glycol; triethylene glycol; 1,4
 cyclohexanedimethanol; propane-1,3-diol and butane-1,4-diol (which are considered
 modifier diols if ethylene glycol residues are present in the polymer in an amount of at least
 85 mole % based on the moles of all hydroxyl compound residues); pentane-1,5-diol;
 hexane-1,6-diol; 3-methylpentanediol-(2,4); neopentyl glycol; 2-methylpentanediol-(1,4);
 2,2,4-trimethylpentane-diol-(1,3); 2,5-ethylhexanediol-(1,3); 2,2-diethyl propane-diol-(1,3);
 hexanediol-(1,3); 1,4-di-(hydroxyethoxy)-benzene; 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-propane;
 2,4-dihydroxy-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-cyclobutane; 2,2-bis-(3-hydroxyethoxyphenyl)-propane;
 and 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxypropoxyphenyl)-propane. Typically, polyesters such as polyethylene
 terephthalate are made by reacting a glycol with a dicarboxylic acid as the free acid or its
 dimethyl ester to produce an ester monomer and/or oligomers, which are then
 polycondensed to produce the polyester.

WO 2011/060304                                                                PCT/US2010/056594
  [0088]      In some preferred embodiments, modifiers include isoplithalic acid, naphthalenic
  dicarboxylic acid, trimellitic anhydride, pyromellitic dianhydride, 1,4-cyclohexane
  dimethanol, and diethylene glycol. The amount of the polyester polymer in the formulated
 polyester polymer composition ranges from greater than about 50.0 wt. %, or from about
  80.0 wt. %, or from about 90.0 wt. %, or from about 95.0 wt. %, or from about 96.0 wt. %,
 or from about 97 wt. %, and up to about 99.90 wt. %, based on the combined weight of all
 polyester polymers and all polyamide polymers. The formulated polyester polymer
 compositions can also include blends of formulated polyester polymer compositions with
 other thermoplastic polymers such as polycarbonate. In some preferred compositions, the
 polyester comprises a majority of the composition of the disclosures, and in some
 embodiments the polyester is present in an amount of at least about 80 wt. %, or at least
 about 90 wt. %, based on the weight of the composition (excluding fillers, inorganic
 compounds or particles, fibers, impact modifiers, or other polymers serve as impact
 modifiers or which form a discontinuous phase such as can be found in cold storage food
 trays).
 [0089]       The polyester compositions can be prepared by polymerization procedures
 known in the art sufficient to effect esterification and polycondensation. Polyester melt
 phase manufacturing processes include direct condensation of a dicarboxylic acid with the
 diol, optionally in the presence of esterification catalysts, in the esterification zone, followed
 by polycondensation in the prepolymer and finishing zones in the presence of a
 polycondensation catalyst; or ester exchange usually in the presence of a transesterification
 catalyst in the ester exchange zone, followed by prepolymerization and finishing in the
 presence of a polycondensation catalyst, and each can optionally be solid stated according
 to known methods.
 [0090]      The transition metal used in the instant compositions is a metal in the positive
 oxidation state. It should be noted that it is contemplated that one or more such metals can
 be used. In some embodiments, cobalt is added in +2 or +3 oxidation state. In some
 embodiments, it is preferred to use cobalt in the +2 oxidation state. In certain embodiments,
 copper in the +2 oxidation state is utilized. In some embodiments, rhodium in the +2
 oxidation state is used. In certain embodiments, zinc can also be added to the composition.
 Preferred zinc compounds include those in a positive oxidation state.
 [0091]      Suitable counter-ions to the transition metal cations include carboxylates, such as
                                                 35

WO 2011/060304                                                               PCT/US2010/056594
 neodecanoates, octanoates, acetates, lactates, naphthalates, malates, stearates,
 acetylacetonates, linoleates, oleates, palmitates, 2-ethylhexanoates, or ethylene glycolates;
 or as their oxides, borates, carbonates, chlorides, dioxides, hydroxides, nitrates, phosphates,
 sulfates, or silicates among others.
  [0092]       In some embodiments, levels of at least about 10 ppm, or at least about 50 ppm,
 or at least about 100 ppm of metal can achieve suitable oxygen scavenging levels. The exact
 amount of transition metal used in an application can be determined by trials that are well
 within the skill level of one skilled in the art. In some embodiments involving wall
 applications (as opposed to master batch applications where more catalyst is used), it is
 preferred to keep the level of metal below about 300 ppm and, in other embodiments,
 preferably below about 250 ppm.
 [0093]       The transition metal or metals can be added neat or in a carrier (such as a liquid
 or wax) to an extruder or other device for making the article, or the metal can be present in a
 concentrate or carrier with the oxidizable organic component, in a concentrate or carrier
 with a base polymer, or in a concentrate or carrier with a base polymer/oxidizable organic
 component blend. Alternatively, at least a portion of the transition metal can be added as a
 polymerization catalyst to the melt phase reaction for making the base polymer (a polyester
 polymer in some embodiments) and be present as residual metals when the polymer is fed to
 the melting zone (e.g. the extrusion or injection molding zone) for making the article such
 as a preform or sheet. It is desirable that the addition of the transition metal does not
 substantially increase the intrinsic viscosity (I.V) of the melt in the melt processing zone.
 Thus, transition metal or metals can be added in two or more stages, such as once during the
 melt phase for the production of the polyester polymer and again once more to the melting
 zone for making the article.
 [0094]       The composition can also include other components such as colorants, pigments,
 fillers, crystallization aids, impact modifiers, surface lubricants, denesting agents,
 stabilizers, ultraviolet light absorbing agents, metal deactivators, nucleating agents such as
 polyethylene and polypropylene, phosphate stabilizers and dyestuffs. Other additional
 components are well known to those skilled in the art and can be added to the existing
 composition so long as they do not negatively impact the performance of the compositions.
 Typically, the total quantity of such components will be less than about 10% by weight

 components is less than about 5%, by weight relative to the total composition.
 [0095]      A common additive used in the manufacture of polyester polymer compositions
 used to make stretch blow molded bottles is a reheat additive because the preforms made
 from the composition must be reheated prior to entering the mold for stretch blowing into a
 bottle. Any of the conventional reheat additives can be used, such additives include various
 forms of black particles, e.g. carbon black, activated carbon, black iron oxide, glassy
 carbon, and silicon carbide; the gray particles such as antimony, and other reheat additives
 such as silicas, red iron oxide, and so forth.
 [0096]      Other typical additives, depending on the application, are impact modifiers.
 Examples of typical commercially available impact modifiers well-known in the art and
 useful in this disclosure include ethylene/acrylate/glycidyl terpolymers and
 ethylene/acrylate copolymers in which the acrylate is a methyl or ethyl acrylate or methyl or
 ethyl methacrylate or the corresponding butyl acrylates, styrene based block copolymers,
 and various acrylic core/shell type impact modifiers. The impact modifiers can be used in
 conventional amounts from about 0.1 to about 25 weight percent of the overall composition
 and, in some embodiments, preferably in amounts from about 0.1 to about 10 weight
 percent of the composition.
 [0097]      In many applications, not only are the packaging contents sensitive to the ingress
 of oxygen, but the contents can also be affected by UV light. Fruit juices and
 pharmaceuticals are two examples of such contents. Accordingly, in some embodiments, it
 is desirable to incorporate into the polyester composition any one of the known UV
 absorbing compounds in amounts effective to protect the packaged contents.
 [0098]      The instant compositions can be made by mixing a base polymer (PET, for
 example) with the oxidizable organic component and the transition metal composition. Such
 compositions can be made by any method known to those skilled in the art. In certain
 embodiments, some or part of the transition metal can exist in the base polymer prior to
 mixing. This residual metal, for example, can exist from the manufacturing process of the
 base polymer. In some embodiments, the base polymer, the oxidizable organic component
 and the transition metal are mixed by tumbling in a hopper. Other optional ingredients can
 be added during this mixing process or added to the mixture after the aforementioned
 mixing or to an individual component prior to the aforementioned mixing step.

WO 2011/060304                                                              PCT/US2010/056594
 [0099]      The instant composition can also be made by adding each ingredient separately
 and mixing the ingredients prior melt processing the composition to form an article. In some
 embodiments, the mixing can be just prior to the melt process zone. In other embodiments,
 one or more ingredients can be premixed in a separate step prior to bringing all of the
 ingredients together.
 [00100]         In some embodiments, the disclosure concerns use of the compositions
 described herein as a component of a wall that is used in a package for oxygen sensitive
 materials. The necessary scavenging capacity of a package will generally have to be greater
 for walls that have a greater permeance in the absence of scavenging additives.
 Accordingly, a good effect is harder to achieve with inherently higher permeance materials
 are used.
 [00101]         The wall can be a rigid one, a flexible sheet, or a clinging film. It can be
 homogenous or a laminate or coated with other polymers. If it is laminated or coated, then
 the scavenging property can reside in a layer of the wall the permeance of which is
 relatively high in the absence of scavenging and which alone would not perform very
 satisfactorily but which performs satisfactorily in combination with one or more other layers
 which have a relatively low permeance but negligible or insufficient oxygen-scavenging
 properties. A single such layer could be used on the outside of the package since this is the
 side from which oxygen primarily comes when the package is filled and sealed. However,
 such a layer to either side of the scavenging layer would reduce consumption of scavenging
 capacity prior to filling and sealing.
  [00102]        When the instant compositions are used in a wall or as a layer of a wall, the
 permeability of the composition for oxygen is advantageously not more than about 3.0, or
 about 1.7, or about 0.7, or about 0.2, or about 0.03 cm3 mm/(m 2 atm day). The permeability
 of the composition provided by the present disclosure is advantageously not more than
 about three-quarters of that in the absence of oxygen-scavenging properties. In some
 embodiments, the permeability is not more than about one half, one-tenth in certain
 embodiments, one twenty-fifth in other embodiments, and not more than one-hundredth in
 yet other embodiments of that in the absence of oxygen-scavenging properties. The
 permeability in the absence of oxygen-scavenging properties is advantageously not more
 than about 17 cm3 mm/(m 2 atm day), or about 10, and or about 6. A particularly good effect
  can be achieved for such permeabilities in the range from about 0.5, or about 1.0, to 10, or
                                                3F

WO 2011/060304                                                              PCT/US2010/056594
 about 6.0, cm 3 mm/(m2 atm day). Measurements of oxygen permeation can be made by
 methods described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,815, the contents of which are
 incorporated herein in its entirety.
 [00103]         In another aspect, the instant composition can be used as a master batch for
 blending with a polymer or a polymer containing component. In such compositions, the
 concentration of the oxidizable organic component and the transition metal will be higher to
 allow for the final blended product to have suitable amounts of these components. The
 master batch can also contain an amount of the polymer to which the master batch is to be
 blended with. In other embodiments, the master batch can contain a polymer that is
 compatible with the polymer that the master batch is to be blended with.
 [00104]          In yet another aspect, the compositions of the instant disclosure can be used
 for forming a layer of a wall which primarily provides oxygen-scavenging (another layer
 including polymer providing gas barrier without significant scavenging), or as a head-space
 scavenger (completely enclosed, together with the package contents, by a package wall).
 Such techniques are well know to those skilled in the art. Persons familiar with oxygen
 scavenging technology and products will understand how to implement the structures
 disclosed in this paragraph.
 [00105]          The time period for which the permeability is maintained can be extended by
 storing the articles in sealed containers or under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen prior
 to use with oxygen sensitive materials.
 [00106]          In another aspect, the disclosure provides a package, whether rigid, semi
 rigid, collapsible, lidded, or flexible or a combination of these, comprising a wall as formed
 from the compositions described herein. Such packages can be formed by methods well
 known to those skilled in the art.
  [00107]         Among the techniques that can be used to make articles are moulding
 generally, injection moulding, stretch blow moulding, extrusion, thermoforming, extrusion
 blow moulding, and (specifically for multilayer structures) co-extrusion and lamination
 using adhesive tie layers. Orientation, e.g. by stretch blow moulding, of the polymer is
 especially attractive with phthalate polyesters because of the known mechanical advantages
 that result.
  [00108]         The melt processing zone for making the article can be operated under
                                                 39

 customary conditions effective for making the intended articles, such as preforms, bottles,
 trays, and other articles mentioned below. In one embodiment, such conditions are effective
 to process the melt without substantially increasing the I.V. of the melt and which are
 ineffective to promote transesterification reactions. In some preferred embodiments, suitable
 operating conditions effective to establish a physical blend of the polyester polymer,
 oxidizable organic component, and transition metal are temperatures in the melt processing
 zone within a range of about 250 0 C. to about 300*C at a total cycle time of less than about 6
 minutes, and typically without the application of vacuum and under a positive pressure
 ranging from about 0 psig to about 900 psig. In some embodiments, the residence time of
 the melt on the screw can range from about 1 to about 4 minutes.
 [00109]           Specific articles include preforms, containers and films for packaging of
 food, beverages, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products where a high
 oxygen barrier is needed. Examples of beverage containers are bottles for holding water and
 carbonated soft drinks, and the disclosure is particularly useful in bottle applications
 containing juices, sport drinks, beer or any other beverage where oxygen detrimentally
 affects the flavor, fragrance, performance (prevent vitamin degradation), or color of the
 drink. The compositions of the instant disclosure are also particularly useful as a sheet for
 thermoforming into rigid packages and films for flexible structures. Rigid packages include
 food trays and lids. Examples of food tray applications include dual ovenable food trays, or
 cold storage food trays, both in the base container and in the lidding (whether a
 thermoformed lid or a film), where the freshness of the food contents can decay with the
 ingress of oxygen. The compositions of the instant disclosure also find use in the
 manufacture of cosmetic containers and containers for pharmaceuticals or medical devices.
 [00110]          The package walls of the instant disclosure can be a single layer or a
 multilayer constructions. In some embodiments using multilayer walls, the outer and inner
 layers can be structural layers with one or more protective layers containing the oxygen
 scavenging material positioned there between. In some embodiments, the outer and inner
 layers comprise and polyolefin or a polyester. In certain embodiments, a single layer design
 is preferred. Such a layer can have advantages in simplicity of manufacture and cost.
 [00111]          Unless otherwise indicated, the disclosure is not limited to specific molecular
 structures, substituents, synthetic methods, reaction conditions, or the like, as such can vary.
 It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing
