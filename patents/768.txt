                                     GOVERNMENT SUPPORT
10          This invention was made with government support under Grant No. RO1 Al 054193
   awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The United States Government has certain
   rights in the invention.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
15          The battle against tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis (Mtb), has raged for millennia. Throughout history, TB has claimed the lives of
   over one billion people and currently infects one third of the world's population. With 3.1
   million deaths a year, TB, as a single causative agent, is the leading killer among infectious
   diseases. The spread of TB was significantly affected with the advent of several
20 chemotherapy agents during the mid-1900s. However, since the 1980s, TB has been on the
   rise. Presently, 8 million new cases are added annually.
           The increase in cases of TB/HIV co-infection and the spread of multiple-drug
   resistant TB (MDR-TB, strains that are resistant to first line drugs isoniazid and rifampin)
   and extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB, strains that are resistant to isoniazid and
25 rifampin, as well as any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line
   drugs, such as amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin) are making matters worse. More than
   ever, there is an urgent need to develop new anti-TB drugs to combat the spread of TB,
   particularly in its hard-to-kill multidrug-resistant and latent forms.
30                                            SUMMARY

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   Definitions
            As used herein, the recited terms have the following meanings. All other terms and
   phrases used in this specification have their ordinary meanings as one of skill in the art would
 5 understand. Such ordinary meanings may be obtained by reference to technical dictionaries,
   such as Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary 14t Edition, by R.J. Lewis, John Wiley &
   Sons, New York, N.Y., 2001.
            References in the specification to "one embodiment", "an embodiment", etc., indicate
   that the embodiment described may include a particular aspect, feature, structure, moiety, or
10 characteristic, but not every embodiment necessarily includes that aspect, feature, structure,
   moiety, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases may, but do not necessarily, refer to the
   same embodiment referred to in other portions of the specification. Further, when a
   particular aspect, feature, structure, moiety, or characteristic is described in connection with
   an embodiment, it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to affect or connect such
15 aspect, feature, structure, moiety, or characteristic with other embodiments, whether or not
   explicitly described.
            The singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural reference unless the context
   clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, a reference to "a compound" includes a
   plurality of such compounds, so that a compound X includes a plurality of compounds X. It
20 is further noted that the claims may be drafted to exclude any optional element. As such, this
   statement is intended to serve as antecedent basis for the use of exclusive terminology, such
   as "solely," "only," and the like, in connection with any element described herein, and/or the
   recitation of claim elements or use of "negative" limitations.
            The term "and/or" means any one of the items, any combination of the items, or all of
25 the items with which this term is associated. The phrase "one or more" is readily understood
   by one of skill in the art, particularly when read in context of its usage. For example, one or
   more substituents on a phenyl ring refers to one to five, or one to four, for example if the
   phenyl ring is disubstituted.
            The term "about" can refer to a variation of ± 5%, ± 10%, ± 20%, or ± 25% of the
30 value specified. For example, "about 50" percent can in some embodiments carry a variation
   from 45 to 55 percent. For integer ranges, the term "about" can include one or two integers
   greater than and/or less than a recited integer at each end of the range. Unless indicated
   otherwise herein, the term "about" is intended to include values, e.g., weight percentages,
   proximate to the recited range that are equivalent in terms of the functionality of the
                                                    7

    WO 2014/015167                                                                  PCT/US2013/051125
   individual ingredient, the composition, or the embodiment. The term about can also modify
   the end-points of a recited range as discuss above in this paragraph.
            As will be understood by the skilled artisan, all numbers, including those expressing
   quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so
 5 forth, are approximations and are understood as being optionally modified in all instances by
   the term "about." These values can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be
   obtained by those skilled in the art utilizing the teachings of the descriptions herein. It is also
   understood that such values inherently contain variability necessarily resulting from the
   standard deviations found in their respective testing measurements.
10          Various operations may be described as multiple discrete operations in turn, in a
   manner that may be helpful in understanding embodiments. However, the order of
   description should not be construed to imply that these operations are order dependent.
            The description may use the terms "embodiment" or "embodiments", which may each
   refer to one or more of the same or different embodiments. Furthermore, the terms
15 "comprising", "including", "having", and the like, as used with respect to embodiments, are
   synonymous.
            As will be understood by one skilled in the art, for any and all purposes, particularly
   in terms of providing a written description, all ranges recited herein also encompass any and
   all possible sub-ranges and combinations of sub-ranges thereof, as well as the individual
20 values making up the range, particularly integer values. A recited range (e.g., weight
   percentages or carbon groups) includes each specific value, integer, decimal, or identity
   within the range. Any listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing and
   enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal halves, thirds, quarters, fifths,
   or tenths. As a non-limiting example, each range discussed herein can be readily broken
25 down into a lower third, middle third and upper third, etc. As will also be understood by one
   skilled in the art, all language such as "up to", "at least", "greater than", "less than", "more
   than", "or more", and the like, include the number recited and such terms refer to ranges that
   can be subsequently broken down into sub-ranges as discussed above. In the same manner,
   all ratios recited herein also include all sub-ratios falling within the broader ratio.
30 Accordingly, specific values recited for radicals, substituents, and ranges, are for illustration
   only; they do not exclude other defined values or other values within defined ranges for
   radicals and substituents.
            One skilled in the art will also readily recognize that where members are grouped
   together in a common manner, such as in a Markush group, the invention encompasses not
                                                      8

    WO 2014/015167                                                                PCT/US2013/051125
   only the entire group listed as a whole, but each member of the group individually and all
   possible subgroups of the main group. Additionally, for all purposes, the invention
   encompasses not only the main group, but also the main group absent one or more of the
   group members. The invention therefore envisages the explicit exclusion of any one or more
 5 of members of a recited group. Accordingly, provisos may apply to any of the disclosed
   categories or embodiments whereby any one or more of the recited elements, species, or
   embodiments, may be excluded from such categories or embodiments, for example, for use in
   an explicit negative limitation.
            The term "contacting" refers to the act of touching, making contact, or of bringing to
10 immediate or close proximity, including at the cellular or molecular level, for example, to
   bring about a physiological reaction, a chemical reaction, or a physical change, e.g., in a
   solution, in a reaction mixture, in vitro, or in vivo.
           An "effective amount" refers to an amount effective to treat a disease, disorder, and/or
   condition, or to bring about a recited effect. For example, an effective amount can be an
15 amount effective to reduce the progression or severity of the condition or symptoms being
   treated. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capacity of
   persons skilled in the art, especially in light of the disclosure provided herein. The term
   "effective amount" is intended to include an amount of a compound described herein, or an
   amount of a combination of compounds described herein, e.g., that is effective to treat or
20 prevent a disease or disorder, or to treat the symptoms of the disease or disorder, in a host.
   Thus, an "effective amount" generally means an amount that provides the desired effect.
           The terms "treating", "treat" and "treatment" include (i) preventing a disease,
   pathologic or medical condition from occurring (e.g., prophylaxis); (ii) inhibiting the disease,
   pathologic or medical condition or arresting its development; (iii) relieving the disease,
25 pathologic or medical condition; and/or (iv) diminishing symptoms associated with the
   disease, pathologic or medical condition. Thus, the terms "treat", "treatment", and "treating"
   can extend to prophylaxis and can include prevent, prevention, preventing, lowering,
   stopping or reversing the progression or severity of the condition or symptoms being treated.
   As such, the term "treatment" can include medical, therapeutic, and/or prophylactic
30 administration, as appropriate.
           The terms "inhibit", "inhibiting", and "inhibition" refer to the slowing, halting, or
   reversing the growth or progression of a disease, infection, condition, or group of cells. The
   inhibition can be greater than about 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 99%, for example,
                                                     9

    WO 2014/015167                                                               PCT/US2013/051125
   compared to the growth or progression that occurs in the absence of the treatment or
   contacting.
           The term "halogen" or "halo" refers to fluoro, bromo, chloro, or iodo substituents.
           The term "alkyl" refers to a cyclic, branched, or straight chain alkyl group containing
 5 only carbon and hydrogen, and unless otherwise mentioned contains one to twelve carbon
   atoms. This term may be further exemplified by groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,
   isopropyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, pentyl, pivalyl, heptyl, adamantyl, and cyclopentyl. Alkyl groups
   can either be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents, for instance, halogen,
   alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, trifluoromethyl, acyloxy, hydroxy, mercapto, carboxy, aryloxy, aryl,
10 arylalkyl, heteroaryl, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, morpholino, piperidino, pyrrolidin-1
   yl, piperazin-1-yl, or other functionality to form a "substituted alkyl" or "functionalized
   alkyl".
           Thus, an alkyl can be a branched or unbranched hydrocarbon having, for example,
   from 1-20 carbon atoms, and often 1-12, 1-10, 1-8, 1-6, or 1-4 carbon atoms. Examples
15 include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl (iso-propyl), 1-butyl, 2
   methyl-1-propyl (isobutyl), 2-butyl (sec-butyl), 2-methyl-2-propyl (t-butyl), 1-pentyl, 2
   pentyl, 3-pentyl, 2-methyl-2-butyl, 3-methyl-2-butyl, 3-methyl-1-butyl, 2-methyl-1-butyl, 1
   hexyl, 2-hexyl, 3-hexyl, 2-methyl-2-pentyl, 3-methyl-2-pentyl, 4-methyl-2-pentyl, 3-methyl
   3-pentyl, 2-methyl-3-pentyl, 2,3-dimethyl-2-butyl, 3,3-dimethyl-2-butyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl,
20 dodecyl, and the like. The alkyl can be unsubstituted or substituted, for example, with a
   substituent as described for a compound or formula herein, or a substituent as described
   below. The alkyl can also be optionally partially or fully unsaturated. As such, the recitation
   of an alkyl group can include both alkenyl and alkynyl groups. The alkyl can be a
   monovalent hydrocarbon radical, as described and exemplified above, or it can be a divalent
25 hydrocarbon radical (i.e., an alkylene).
           The term "substituted" indicates that one or more hydrogen atoms on the group
   indicated in the expression using "substituted" is replaced with a "substituent". The number
   referred to by 'one or more' can be apparent from the moiety on which the substituents reside.
   For example, one or more can refer to, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6; in some embodiments 1, 2, or 3;
30 and in other embodiments 1 or 2, and if the substituent is an oxo group, two hydrogen atoms
   are replace by the presence of the substituent. The substituent can be one of a selection of
   indicated groups, or it can be a suitable group recited below or known to those of skill in the
   art, provided that the substituted atom's normal valency is not exceeded, and that the
   substitution results in a stable compound. Suitable substituent groups include, e.g., alkyl,
                                                    10

   alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, halo, haloalkyl, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, aryl, aroyl, (aryl)alkyl (e.g.,
   benzyl or phenylethyl), heteroaryl, heterocycle, cycloalkyl, alkanoyl, alkoxycarbonyl,

   heteroarylsulfonyl, heterocyclesulfinyl, heterocyclesulfonyl, phosphate, sulfate, hydroxyl
   amine, hydroxyl (alkyl)amine, and cyano, as well as the moieties illustrated in the schemes
   and Figures of this disclosure, and combinations thereof. Additionally, suitable substituent
   groups can be, e.g., -X, -R, -0-, -OR, -SR, -S-, -NR 2, -NR 3, =NR, -CX 3 , -CN, -OCN, -SCN,
10 N=C=O, -NCS, -NO, -NO 2 , =N 2 , -N3 , -NC(=O)R, -C(=O)R, -C(=O)NRR, -S(=0)20-,

   where each X is independently a halogen ("halo"): F, Cl, Br, or I; and each R is independently
15 H, alkyl, aryl, (aryl)alkyl (e.g., benzyl), heteroaryl, (heteroaryl)alkyl, heterocycle,
   heterocycle(alkyl), or a protecting group. As would be readily understood by one skilled in
   the art, when a substituent is keto (=0) or thioxo (=S), or the like, then two hydrogen atoms
   on the substituted atom are replaced. In some embodiments, one or more of the substituents
   above can be excluded from the group of potential values for substituents on the substituted
20 group. The various R groups in the schemes and figures of this disclosure can be one or more
   of the substituents recited above, thus the listing of certain variables for such R groups
   (including R1, R2 , R3 , etc.) are representative and not exhaustive, and can be supplemented
   with one or more of the substituents above.
            Alkyl chains can be optionally interrupted, for example, with one or more heteroatoms.
25 The term "interrupted" indicates that another group is inserted between two adjacent carbon
   atoms, and the hydrogen atoms to which they are attached (e.g., methyl (CH 3 ), methylene
   (CH 2) or methine (CH)), of a particular carbon chain being referred to in the expression using
   the term "interrupted", provided that each of the indicated atom's normal valency is not
   exceeded, and that the interruption results in a stable compound. Suitable groups that can
30 interrupt a carbon chain include, e.g., with one or more non-peroxide oxy (-0-), thio (-S-),
   imino (-N(H)-), methylenedioxy (-OCH 2 0-), carbonyl (-C(=O)-), carboxy (-C(=O)O-),
   carbonyldioxy (-OC(=O)O-), carboxylato (-OC(=O)-), imine (C=NH), sulfinyl (SO) and
   sulfonyl  (SO 2). Alkyl groups can be interrupted by one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or about 6)
   of the aforementioned suitable groups. The site of interruption can also be between a carbon
                                                     11

    WO 2014/015167                                                                      PCT/US2013/051125
   atom of an alkyl group and a carbon atom to which the alkyl group is attached. An alkyl
   group that is interrupted by a heteroatom therefor forms a heteroalkyl group.
           When an alkyl group can be substituted, it can thus be a "substituted allyl". The term
   "substituted alkyl" refers to an alkyl moiety that can include 1-4 substituents selected from
 5 halogen, het, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, amino, cyano, nitro, -OQio, -SQ 1 o, -S(O) 2 Q10 ,
   S(O)Q10, -OS(O) 2 Q10 , -C(=NQ1 o)Q        10 , -C(=NOQ1 o)Q 10 , -S(O) 2 -N=S(O)(Q 10 )2 , -S(O) 2

10 NQ 1 oS(O)Q 10 , -NQ 1 oSQ 1 o, and -SNQ 1 oQ1 o. Each of the het, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and
   aryl can be optionally substituted with 1-4 substituents independently selected from halogen
   and Q15.
            The term "cycloalkyl" refers to a cyclic alkyl moiety. Unless otherwise stated,
   cycloalkyl moieties include about 3 to about 8, 9, or 10 carbon atoms. Thus, the term
15 "cycloalkyl" refers to cyclic alkyl groups of, for example, from 3 to 10 carbon atoms having a
   single cyclic ring or multiple condensed rings. Cycloalkyl groups include, by way of example,
   single ring structures such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclooctyl, and the like, or
   multiple ring structures such as adamantyl, and the like. The cycloalkyl can be unsubstituted
   or substituted. The cycloalkyl group can be monovalent or divalent (e.g., linking two groups
20 together), and can be optionally substituted as described for alkyl groups. The cycloalkyl
   group can optionally include one or more cites of unsaturation, for example, the cycloalkyl
   group can include one or more carbon-carbon double bonds, such as, for example, 1
   cyclopent-1-enyl, 1-cyclopent-2-enyl, 1-cyclopent-3-enyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohex-1-enyl, 1
   cyclohex-2-enyl, 1-cyclohex-3-enyl, and the like.

   corresponding to carbon chains with a triple carbon-carbon bond included.
           The term "alkoxy" refers to the group -0-alkyl, where alkyl is as defined herein.
30 Examples of alkoxy groups include, but are not limited to, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, iso
   propoxy, n-butoxy, tert-butoxy, sec-butoxy, n-pentoxy, n-hexoxy, 1,2-dimethylbutoxy, and
   the like. The alkoxy can be unsubstituted or substituted.

   simple acyclic alcohols is CH2+OH.
            The term "epoxide" refers to any of a class of organic compound, cyclic ethers,
 5 having a three-member ring.
            The term "ketone" refers to an organic compound containing the carbonyl group,
   >C=O, to which other carbon atoms are attached.
            The term "ester" refers to the product of the reaction between a carboxylic acid and an
   alcohol.
10          The term "ether" refers to an organic compound containing the functional group RO
   R' where R and R' are the organic groups such as alkyl or aryl.
            The term "aldehyde" refers to an organic compound containing a -CHO group.
            The term "nitrile" refers to any of a class of organic compounds containing the cyano
   radical -CN.
15          The term "thiol" refers to a molecular group that includes a bonded sulfur and
   hydrogen atom (-SH).
            The term "thioester" refers to a compound resulting from the bonding of sulfur with
   an acyl group with the general formula R-S-CO-R'. Thioesters are the product of
   esterification between a carboxylic acid and a thiol (as opposed to an alcohol in regular
20 esters).
            The term "sulfide" refers to an organic compound containing sulfur bonded to carbon.
   The term "disulfide" refers to the structural unit composed of a linked pair of sulfur atoms.
            The term "sulfone" refers to a chemical compound containing a sulfonyl functional
   group attached to two carbon atoms. The central sulfur atom is twice double bonded to
25 oxygen and has two further hydrocarbon substituents. The general structural formula is R
   S(=0) 2R' where R and R' are the organic groups such as alkyl or aryl, or a portion of a
   formula described herein. For example, a methylsulfone group is a -S(=0) 2 Me group.
            The term "sulfoxide" refers to a chemical compound containing a sulfonyl functional
   group attached to two carbon atoms. Sulfoxides can be considered oxidized sulfides.
30          The term "amine" refers to NH 2, NHR, or NR 2 . Unless otherwise stated R can be
   alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, het or aryl.

           The term "urea" refers to an organic compound with the chemical formula (NH 2 ) 2 CO
   or RNHCONHR' where R and R' are the organic groups such as alkyl or aryl, or a portion of
   a formula described herein.
           The term "carbamate" refers to any of a group of organic compounds sharing a
 5 common functional group with the general structure -NH(CO)O-. Carbamates are esters of
   carbamic acid, NH 2COOH. Since carbamic acid contains nitrogen attached to a carboxyl
   group, it is also an amide. Therefore, carbamate esters may have alkyl or aryl groups
   substituted on the nitrogen, or the amide function. For example, ethyl carbamate is
   unsubstituted, whereas ethyl N-methylcarbamate has a methyl group attached to the nitrogen.
10         The term "aryl" refers to an aromatic hydrocarbon group derived from the removal of at
   least one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of a parent aromatic ring system. The
   radical attachment site can be at a saturated or unsaturated carbon atom of the parent ring system.
   The aryl group can have from 6 to 30 carbon atoms, for example, about 6-10 carbon atoms.
   The aryl group can have a single ring (e.g., phenyl) or multiple condensed (fused) rings,
15 wherein at least one ring is aromatic (e.g., naphthyl, dihydrophenanthrenyl, fluorenyl, or
   anthryl). Typical aryl groups include, but are not limited to, radicals derived from benzene,
   naphthalene, anthracene, biphenyl, and the like. The aryl can be unsubstituted or optionally
   substituted, as described for alkyl groups. Thus, the term "aryl" can refer to phenyl,
   substituted phenyl, naphthyl, and substituted naphthyl.
20         The term "heterocycle" refers to a saturated or partially unsaturated ring system,
   containing at least one heteroatom selected from the group oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and
   sulfur, and optionally substituted with one or more groups as defined for the term
   "substituted". A heterocycle can be a monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic group. A heterocycle
   group also can contain an oxo group (=0) or a thioxo (=S) group attached to the ring. Non
25 limiting examples of heterocycle groups include 1,3-dihydrobenzofuran, 1,3-dioxolane,
   1,4-dioxane, 1,4-dithiane, 2H-pyran, 2-pyrazoline, 4H-pyran, chromanyl, imidazolidinyl,

            The terms "heterocyclic," "heterocycle," and "het" are used interchangeably and thus
   refer to organic compounds containing at least one atom of carbon, and at least one element
   other than carbon, such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen within a ring structure. These structures
   may comprise either simple aromatic rings or non-aromatic rings. Each monocyclic ring may
 5 be aromatic, saturated or partially unsaturated. A bicyclic ring system may include a mono
   cyclic ring containing one or more heteroatom fused with a cycloalkyl or aryl group. A
   bicyclic ring system may also include a monocyclic ring containing one or more heteroatom
   fused with another monocyclic ring system.
            The term "heteroaryl" refers to a monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic ring system
10 containing one, two, or three aromatic rings and containing at least one nitrogen, oxygen, or
   sulfur atom in an aromatic ring. The heteroaryl can be unsubstituted or substituted, for
   example, with one or more, and in particular one to three, substituents, as described in the
   definition of "substituted". Typical heteroaryl groups contain 2-20 carbon atoms in the ring
   skeleton in addition to the one or more heteroatoms. Examples of heteroaryl groups include,
15 but are not limited to, 2H-pyrrolyl, 3H-indolyl, 4H-quinolizinyl, acridinyl, benzo[b]thienyl,

   requirements of the patient, the severity of the infection, the particular mycobacterial species,
   whether the infection is latent or active, the drug resistance of the strain, the duration of the
   infection being treated, and the particular compound being used. Also, it is to be understood
25 that the initial dosage administered may be increased beyond the above upper level in order
   to rapidly achieve the desired blood-level or the initial dosage may be smaller than the
   optimum and the daily dosage may be progressively increased during the course of treatment
   depending on the particular situation. If desired, the daily dose also may be divided into
   multiple doses for administration, for instance, two to four times per day.
30          In an embodiment, an initial 5,5-heteroaromatic compound was provided and tested as
   an exemplary member of the new 5,5-heteroaromatic class of anti-mycobacterial agents
   disclosed herein. This initial compound is identified below as compound ND-010081, and
   the compound's structure is shown below in Table 1, along with a series of other exemplary
   5,5-heteroaromatic compounds. The 5,5-heteroaromatic class of molecules is unrepresented

  cost of starting materials and the ease with which potent (<1 pg/mL) anti-mycobacterial
  compounds are synthesized therefrom.

          Many of the existing clinical candidates for TB therapeutics are derivatives of existing
  scaffolds (for instance, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin), which results in drugs that are much
  more prone to emerging resistance. Other clinical candidates are complex compounds that
5 are difficult and costly to manufacture (for example anti-TB candidates TMC207, PA-824,
  OPC-67683, and LL-3858). The compounds described herein provide novel and effective
  alternatives for killing bacteria, inhibiting bacterial growth, and for treating bacterial
  infections, including TB.

   General Synthetic Methods
             The invention relates to various 5,5 heteroaryl compounds and methods of making
   then. The compounds can be prepared either racemically or in enantioenriched form. Certain
   individual synthetic transformations for their preparation and modification are well known in
 5 the art. Many of these known techniques are elaborated in the Compendium of Organic
   Synthetic Methods (John Wiley & Sons, New York), Vol. 1, Ian T. Harrison and Shuyen
   Harrison, 1971; Vol. 2, Ian T. Harrison and Shuyen Harrison, 1974; Vol. 3, Louis S. Hegedus
   and Leroy Wade, 1977; Vol. 4, Leroy G. Wade, Jr., 1980; Vol. 5, Leroy G. Wade, Jr., 1984;
   and Vol. 6; as well as standard organic reference texts such as March'sAdvanced Organic
10 Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, 5h Ed., by M.B. Smith and J. March (John
   Wiley & Sons, New York, 2001); Comprehensive Organic Synthesis. Selectivity, Strategy &
   Efficiency in Modern Organic Chemistry. In 9 Volumes, Barry M. Trost, Editor-in-Chief

             A number of exemplary methods for the preparation of the compounds and
   compositions of the invention are provided herein. These methods are intended to illustrate
20 the nature of such preparations are not intended to limit the scope of applicable methods.
             Generally, the reaction conditions such as temperature, reaction time, solvents, work
   up procedures, and the like, will be those common in the art for the particular reaction to be
   performed. The cited reference material, together with material cited therein, contains
   detailed descriptions of such conditions. Typically the temperatures will be -100'C to 200'C,
25 as necessary for the reaction of interest, solvents will be aprotic or protic depending on the
   conditions required, and reaction times can be about 1 minute to about 2 days. Work-up
   typically consists of quenching any unreacted reagents followed by partition between a water
   / organic layer system (extraction) and separation of the layer containing the product of
   interest.
30           Oxidation and reduction reactions are typically carried out at temperatures near room
   temperature (about 23 C), although for metal hydride reductions frequently the temperature
   is reduced to 0 'C to -100 'C. Heating can also be used when appropriate. Solvents are
   typically aprotic for reductions and may be either protic or aprotic for oxidations. Reaction
   times are adjusted to achieve desired conversions.
                                                    36

    WO 2014/015167                                                                 PCT/US2013/051125
           Condensation reactions are typically carried out at temperatures near room
   temperature, although for non-equilibrating, kinetically controlled condensations reduced
   temperatures (0 'C to -100 C) are also common. Solvents can be either protic (common in
   equilibrating reactions) or aprotic (common in kinetically controlled reactions). Standard
 5 synthetic techniques such as azeotropic removal of reaction by-products and use of anhydrous
   reaction conditions (e.g. inert gas environments) are common in the art and can be applied
   when applicable.
           Protecting Groups. The term "protecting group", "blocking group", or "PG"refers to
   any group which, when bound to a hydroxy or other heteroatom prevents undesired reactions
10 from occurring at this group and which can be removed by conventional chemical or
   enzymatic steps to reestablish the hydroxyl group or heteroatom. The particular removable
   blocking group employed is not always critical and preferred removable hydroxyl blocking
   groups include conventional groups such as, for example, allyl, benzyl, acetyl, chloroacetyl,
   thiobenzyl, benzylidene, phenacyl, methyl methoxy, silyl ethers (e.g., trimethylsilyl (TMS), t
15 butyl-diphenylsilyl (TBDPS), or t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS)) and any other group that can be
   introduced chemically onto a hydroxyl functionality and later selectively removed either by
   chemical or enzymatic methods in mild conditions compatible with the nature of the product.
   The R groups of various schemes and formulas herein can also be protecting groups, such as
   the protecting groups described above and in various literature cited herein.
20         Suitable protecting groups are known to those skilled in the art and disclosed in more
   detail by T.W. Greene, Protecting Groups In Organic Synthesis; Wiley: New York, 1981
   ("Greene") and the references cited therein, and by Kocienski, Philip J.; Protecting Groups
   (Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, 1994), both of which are incorporated herein by
   reference.
25         Protecting groups are available, commonly known and used, and are optionally used
   to prevent side reactions with the protected group during synthetic procedures, i.e. routes or
   methods to prepare various compounds by the methods described herein. For the most part
   the decision as to which groups to protect, when to install and remove the protecting groups,
   and the nature of the chemical protecting group "PG" will be dependent upon the chemistry
30 of the reaction to be protected against (e.g., acidic, basic, oxidative, reductive or other
   conditions) and the intended product of the synthesis.
           Protecting groups do not need to be, and generally are not, the same if the compound
   is substituted with multiple PGs. In general, PG will be used to protect functional groups
   such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, thio, or amino groups and to thus prevent side reactions or to
                                                    37

    WO 2014/015167                                                                PCT/US2013/051125
   otherwise facilitate the synthetic efficiency. The order of deprotection to yield free,
   deprotected groups can be dependent upon the intended products of the synthesis and the
   reaction conditions to be encountered, and may occur in any order as determined by the
   artisan.
 5          Various functional groups of the compounds of the invention may be protected. For
   example, protecting groups for -OH groups (whether hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, or other
   functions) include "ether- or ester-forming groups". Many ether- or ester-forming groups are
   capable of functioning as chemical protecting groups in the synthetic schemes set forth herein.
   However, some hydroxyl and thio protecting groups are neither ether- nor ester-forming
10 groups, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. For further detail regarding
   carboxylic acid protecting groups and other protecting groups for acids, see Greene, cited
   above. Such groups include by way of example and not limitation, amides, hydrazides, and
   the like.
            As to any of the compounds and formulas described herein, which contain one or
15 more substituents, it is understood, of course, that such groups do not contain any substitution
   or substitution patterns that are sterically impractical and/or synthetically non-feasible. It will
   be appreciated that the compounds on may contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms
   and thus may be prepared and isolated in either optically active or racemic forms. All chiral,
   diastereomeric, and racemic forms and all geometric isomeric forms of the compounds
20 described herein, individually and/or collectively, are part of this invention.
            One diastereomer may display superior activity compared to another. When required,
   separation of racemic materials can be achieved by high performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) using a chiral column or by a resolution using a resolving agent such as camphonic
   chloride, as in Thomas J. Tucker et al., J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 2437-2444. A chiral
25 compound may also be directly synthesized using a chiral catalyst or a chiral ligand (see, for
   example, Mark A. Huffman, et al., J. Org. Chem. 1995, 60, 1590-1594) or by the techniques
   described herein.
            In general, modifications to the compounds and formulas described herein can be
   made according to organic synthesis techniques known to those of skill in the art and/or
30 according to the synthetic schemes provided herein. Where desired, synthesis of a subject
   compound can begin with commercially available chemicals, from compounds described in
   the chemical literature, or from products of the reactions and methods described herein.

   Pharmaceutical Formulations
            The compounds described herein can be used to prepare therapeutic pharmaceutical
   compositions, for example, by combining the compounds with a pharmaceutically acceptable
   diluent, excipient, or carrier. The compounds may be added to a carrier in the form of a salt
10 or solvate. For example, in cases where compounds are sufficiently basic or acidic to form
   stable nontoxic acid or base salts, administration of the compounds as salts may be
   appropriate. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts
   formed with acids that form a physiological acceptable anion, for example, tosylate,
   methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartrate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, a
15 ketoglutarate, and P-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed,
   including hydrochloride, halide, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts.
            Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well
   known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine
   with a suitable acid to provide a physiologically acceptable ionic compound. Alkali metal
20 (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example, calcium)
   salts of carboxylic acids can also be prepared by analogous methods.
            The compounds of the formulas described herein can be formulated as pharmaceutical
   compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient, in a variety of
   forms. The forms can be specifically adapted to a chosen route of administration, e.g., oral or
25 parenteral administration, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes.
            The compounds described herein may be systemically administered in combination
   with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible
   carrier. For oral administration, compounds can be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin
   capsules, compressed into tablets, or incorporated directly into the food of a patient's diet.
30 Compounds may also be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of
   ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and
   the like. Such compositions and preparations typically contain at least 0.1% of active
   compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations can vary and may
   conveniently be from about 0.5% to about 60%, about 1% to about 25%, or about 2% to
                                                    39

   about 10%, of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in
   such therapeutically useful compositions can be such that an effective dosage level can be
   obtained.
            The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain one or more of the
 5 following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as
   dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid
   and the like; and a lubricant such as magnesium stearate. A sweetening agent such as
   sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of
   wintergreen, or cherry flavoring, may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it
10 may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable
   oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to
   otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills,
   or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir
   may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and
15 propyl parabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Any
   material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and
   substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be
   incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.
            The active compound may be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by
20 infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water,
   optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can be prepared in glycerol, liquid
   polyethylene glycols, triacetin, or mixtures thereof, or in a pharmaceutically acceptable oil.
   Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, preparations may contain a preservative to
   prevent the growth of microorganisms.
25          Pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile
   aqueous solutions, dispersions, or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient adapted
   for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions,
   optionally encapsulated in liposomes. The ultimate dosage form should be sterile, fluid and
   stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a
30 solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for
   example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils,
   nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be
   maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required
   particle size in the case of dispersions, or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the

   action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and/or antifungal
   agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In
   many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers, or
   sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about
 5 by agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and/or gelatin.
            Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in
   the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients enumerated
   above, as required, optionally followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders
   for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, methods of preparation can include vacuum
10 drying and freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any
   additional desired ingredient present in the solution.
           For topical administration, compounds may be applied in pure form, e.g., when they
   are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer the active agent to the skin
   as a composition or formulation, for example, in combination with a dermatologically
15 acceptable carrier, which may be a solid, a liquid, a gel, or the like.
           Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline
   cellulose, silica, alumina, and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, dimethyl
   sulfoxide (DMSO), alcohols, glycols, or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which a compound
   can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic
20 surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to
   optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied
   from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the
   affected area using a pump-type or aerosol sprayer.
           Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty
25 alcohols, modified celluloses, or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid
   carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly
   to the skin of the user.
           Examples of dermatological compositions for delivering active agents to the skin are
   known to the art; for example, see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,992,478 (Geria), 4,820,508
30 (Wortzman), 4,608,392 (Jacquet et al.), and 4,559,157 (Smith et al.). Such dermatological
   compositions can be used in combinations with the compounds described herein where an
   ingredient of such compositions can optionally be replaced by a compound described herein,
   or a compound described herein can be added to the composition

            Useful dosages of the compounds described herein can be determined by comparing
   their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of
   effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example,
   see U.S. Patent No. 4,938,949 (Borch et al.). The amount of a compound, or an active salt or
 5 derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular
   compound or salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the
   condition being treated, and the age and condition of the patient, and will be ultimately at the
   discretion of an attendant physician or clinician.
            The compound can be conveniently administered in a unit dosage form, for example,
10 containing 5 to 1000 mg/m 2 , conveniently 10 to 750 mg/m 2 , most conveniently, 50 to 500
   mg/m 2 of active ingredient per unit dosage form. The desired dose may conveniently be
   presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for
   example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further
   divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations.
15          The compounds described herein can be effective antimicrobial agents, for example,
   against various microbes that cause TB. The invention provides therapeutic methods of
   treating bacterial and/or TB infections in a mammal, which involve administering to a
   mammal having an infection an effective amount of a compound or composition described
   herein. A mammal includes a primate, human, rodent, canine, feline, bovine, ovine, equine,
20 swine, caprine, bovine and the like.
            The ability of a compound of the invention to kill a microbe or bacteria, to inhibit its
   growth, and/or to treat a related infection may be determined by using assays well known to
   the art. For example, the design of treatment protocols, toxicity evaluation, data analysis,
   quantification of cell kill, and the biological significance of the use of various screens are
25 known. In addition, ability of a compound to treat an infection may be determined using the
   Tests described below.
            The following Examples are intended to illustrate the above invention and should not
   be construed as to narrow its scope. One skilled in the art will readily recognize that the
30 Examples suggest many other ways in which the invention could be practiced. It should be
   understood that numerous variations and modifications may be made while remaining within
   the scope of the invention.

   generalized structure shown. These compounds were easily made in straightforward two
   step syntheses in good overall yields. First, reaction of the appropriately substituted amino
10 heterocycle (B, C, D, E, F, or H) with ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate (or any reagent of structure
   A) in an appropriate solvent like 1,2-dimethoxyethane or ethanol followed by saponification
   with sodium hydroxide and acidic work up gave the free acids (IT-OH, TO-OH, ITD-OH,
   IOD-OH, PA-OH, IPY-OH). Then these carboxylic acid intermediates were all readily
   converted to various amide analogs (ITA, IOA, ITDA, IODA, PIA and IPYA) through
15 classical EDC-mediated coupling reactions in good yields

 5          The 4-chlorophenol (173.4 mmol) and KOH (173.4 mmol) were dissolved in 22 mL
   DMSO and 100 mL toluene with a dean-stark trap. The reaction was heated to reflux
   (- 120'C) to drive off the water for 3 hours followed by collection of residual toluene. Once
   all water was collected the remaining toluene was removed and reaction temperature adjusted
   to 100'C. The 4-fluorobenzaldehyde (165.2 mmol) was added dropwise at 100'C where it
10 stirred for 12 h. At which time, the reaction mixture was cooled and poured over ice to
   precipitate product. Collect precipitate by filtration to collect 50.5 grams of 4-(4
   chlorophenoxy)benzaldehyde.
            4-(4-chlorophenoxy)benzaldehyde (3.2 mmol) and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (3.8
   mmol) were combined in ethanol (7 mL). Then the sodium bicarbonate was added carefully
15 (267 mg, 3.2 mmol) and the reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 2 h or upon completion
   by TLC. Reaction mixture was filtered hot to remove inorganic salts and filtrate liquor was
   concentrated to 1/3 volume. Upon standing solids formed and were collected by filtration to
   give 4-(4-chlorophenoxy)benzaldehyde oxime.
            The 4-(4-chlorophenoxy)benzaldehyde oxime (20.2 mmol) was dissolved in acetic
20 acid (40 mL) and then the zinc powder was added slowly (80.8 mmol) were it stirred at room
   temperature overnight. Reaction mixture was filtered to remove inorganic salts then
   evaporated to near dryness. The residue was suspending in dichloromethane and washed
   with aqueous NaOH solution until basic. The organic layer was filtered to collect the
   precipitate. Collected solids was dried over KOH under vacuum to give (4-(4
25 chlorophenoxy)phenyl)methanamine.

 5           Amino-thiazole B (4.5 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml of DCE (anhydrous) and cooled
   to 00 C with an ice bath. Oxalyl chloride (5.8 mmol) in 3 mL of DCE (dry) was slowly added
   by addition funnel over 1 hour. Reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature where it
   stirred for 4 h. Triethylamine (5.8 mmol) in 5 mL DCE was slowly added over 15 mins and
   reaction stirred for 2.5 hours at 35 0 C. Then desired amine (5.4 mmol) was added and reaction
10 remained at 35 0 C overnight. Reaction concentrated down and then re-dissolved in DCM and
   washed with sat. NaHCO 3 sol (2x), acetic acid (2x), brine and then organics were dried over
   Na 2SO 4, filtered and concentrated to a brown semi-solid. Product (IT-0-A) was isolated by
   silica gel column with 30% EtOAC:DCM to collect major lower spot.
             Reagents of formula I can also be prepared by the methods used for the synthesis of
15 reagents of structure A but many are commercially available like ethyl chloroacetate or ethyl
   bromoacetate.

            Alternatively, the oxoacetic acid (IT-0-OH) can be isolated prior to coupling with
   desired benzyl amines derivates to give desired products (IT-0-A). This is done by
   quenching with water and making basic with 25% NaOH, followed by extraction with DCE
   and adjusting the pH to 4-5 with acetic acid rather than just adding the desired amine for
 5 coupling. These methods were described in US 8,183,377 B2 (Process for the preparation of
   imidazopyridines).
            Additionally, the oxoacetic acid (IT-0-OH) can also be reduced by hydrazine hydrate
   and potassium hydroxide to give the acetic acid derivative (IT-CH2-OH) by the methods
   described in US 8,183,377 B2 (Process for the preparation of imidazopyridines). The acetic
10 acid derivative (IT-CH2-OH) can be reacted with benzyl amines by EDC mediated coupling
   to give the corresponding products of general structure IT-CH2-A.

            The test compound MICs against Mtb H37Rv (ATCC# 27294) were assessed by the
   MABA using rifampin and PA-824 as positive controls. Compound stock solutions were
   prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 128 1jM, and the final test concentrations ranged
   from 128 pM to 0.5 pM. Two fold dilutions of compounds were prepared in glycerol
 5 alanine-salt media in a volume of 100 pL in 96-well microplates (BD OptiluxTM, 96-well
   Microplates, black/clear flat bottom) for the GAS assay, in an iron deficient glycerol-alanine
   salt media with 20% Tween 80 added in the GAST assay and in Middlebrook 7H12 medium
   (7H9 broth containing 0.1% w/v casitone, 5.6 pg/mL palmitic acid, 5 mg/mL bovine serum
   albumin, 4 mg/mL catalase) in a volume of 100 pL in 96-well microplates (BD OptiluxTM,
10 96-well Microplates, black/clear flat bottom) for the 7H12 assay. The TB cultures (100 pL
   inoculums of 2 x105 cfu/mL) were added to the media, yielding a final testing volume of 200
   pL. The plates were incubated at 37 'C. On the seventh day of incubation, 12.5 pL of 20%
   Tween 80, and 20 pL of Alamar Blue (Invitrogen BioSourceTM) were added to the wells of
   test plate. After incubation at 37 'C for 16-24 h, fluorescence of the wells was measured at
15 530 nm (excitation) and 590 nm (emmision). The MICs are defined as the lowest
   concentration effecting a reduction in fluorescence of > 90% relative to the mean of replicate
   bacteria-only controls.
