 COMPOSITION AND USE OF LACTOBACILLUS FERMENTUM GMNL-296
       TO PRODUCE COMPOSITION FOR IMPROVING SYMPTOMS OF
                       CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTION
                                    TECHNICAL FIELD
      [0001]      The present invention relates to a composition including Lactobacillus
Fermentum GMNL-296 and a use of the Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296 to
produce the composition for improving infection symptoms of Clostridium Difficile,
and in particular relates to a composition including Lactobacillus Fermentum
GMNL-296 and a use of the Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296 to produce the
composition for treating or preventing from infection symptoms of Clostridium
Difficile.
                                      BACKGROUND
      [0002]      Clostridium Difficile is a main pathogenic bacterium which causes
diarrhea in patients due to antibiotic use. The symptoms comprise slight diarrhea and
serious    intestinal   inflammation,    such    as pseudomembranous      enteritis,   toxic
megacolon, and bacteriemia, which may cause death if the symptoms become serious
enough. Clostridium Difficile can be spread in spore form. In past studies, it was
found that the Clostridium difficile infection (C. difficile infection; CDI) rate has
gradually increasing tendency in Taiwan (Px Zheng, Genome Announc. 2013.
1:e00149-12.). According to statistics by the United States Disease Control Agency,
100,000 American patients die from nosocomial infections and the resulting mortality
rate is climbing each year (MF Shih., Int.J. Immunopathol. Pharmacol. 2012.
25:39-48.2). The current clinical treatment of Clostridium Difficile is that if the use of
antibiotics induces the CDI symptoms, it is recommended to stop the current use of
antibiotics, and then use metronidazole and vancomycin in accordance with the
severity of the disease. However, the two drugs are ineffective treatments for certain
patients or have a high recurrence rate (YC Lin, 2011 . Antimicrob. Agents
Chemother. 55: 1701-5.).
      [0003]      In addition to the drug resistance of the Clostridium Difficile, a current
difficulty of treatment is that the patient cannot generate a proper protective immune
response, and this may cause repetitive infection problems. Because the CDI rate in
                                               1

medical care institutions is gradually increasing, and there is a possible recurrence during
treatment, the search for non-antibiotic treatment and the improvement for the CDI have
become more important problems requiring more attention.
      [0004]   Although it has been found in the past that certain strains of Lactobacillus
have a strong bacteriostatic ability against Clostridium Difficile, which improves the
symptoms of mice infected with Clostridium Difficile, it has not reported that the lactic
acid bacteria can enhance the inflammatory symptoms of CDI through immune
regulation.
      [0005]    It is therefore necessary to provide an anti-inflammatory Lactobacillus
Fermentum strain and a composition thereof, and a use of the Lactobacillus Fermentum
strain to produce the composition for improving the symptoms of Clostridium Difficile
infection, in order to solve the problems existing in the conventional technology as
described above.
                                        SUMMARY
      [0006]    The invention provides      for a composition comprising Lactobacillus
Fermentum GMNL-296 and a use of the Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296 to
produce the composition for improving symptoms of Clostridium Difficile infection so as
to stimulate an immune response by the Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296, in order to
improve weight loss and intestinal abnormalities which the Clostridium difficile caused.
The LactobacillusFermentum can be administrated through the esophagus and then enters
the digestive system to stimulate the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Interleukin-10)
secretion and increase the function of the regulatory T cells (Treg), thereby inhibiting and
reducing an intestinal inflammation.
      [0007]   According     to  one   embodiment,    the present    invention   provides  a
composition when used to improve symptoms of Clostridium Difficile infection,

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
     [0019]      The structure and the technical means adopted by the present invention
to achieve the above and other objects can be best understood by referring to the
following detailed description of the preferred embodiments. Furthermore, if there is
no specific description in the invention, singular terms such as "a", "one", and "the"
include the plural number. For example, "a compound" or "at least one compound"
may include a plurality of compounds, and the mixtures thereof. If there is no specific
description in the invention, "%" means "weight percentage (wt%)", and the
numerical range (e.g. 10%-11% of A) contains the upper and lower limit (i.e. 10% 5
A 5 11%). If the lower limit is not defined in the range (e.g. less than, or below 0.2%
of B), it means that the lower limit may be 0 (i.e. 0%        B   0.2%). The proportion of
"weight percent" of each component can be replaced by the proportion of "weight
portion" thereof. The abovementioned terms are used to describe and understand the
present invention, but the present invention is not limited thereto.
     [0020]      One embodiment of the present invention provides a Lactobacillus
Fermentum strain for improving symptoms of Clostridium Difficile infection. The
Lactobacillus Fermentum strain is referred            to   as   Lactobacillus Fermentum
GMNL-296, which is deposited in the China Center for Type Culture Collection with
an accession number of CCTCC M2016225 and dated 25 April 2016.
     [0021]      One embodiment of the present invention provides a composition,
comprising the abovementioned Lactobacillus Fermentum strain, which can improve
the symptoms of Clostridium Difficile infection. Preferably, the composition can be a
pharmaceutical composition, a nutritional supplement, a health food, a medical food,
or the combination thereof. The composition can be formed in various form based on
the   effectivity  or   convenience.   In  addition,    the    composition  is preferably
administrated by means of food to enter the digestive system, and can stimulate an
immune response to inhibit the intestinal inflammation.
     [0022]      One   embodiment of the present invention provides             a use of
Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296 to produce a composition for improving
infection symptoms of Clostridium difficile, comprising the following steps of: using
the abovementioned Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296 viable strain to promote
the mRNA expression of Treg related transcription factors, FoxP3 and GATA3, and
                                            4

 anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, so that the symptoms, such as weight loss or
 intestinal abnormalities caused by the Clostridium Difficile, can be improved. The
 intestinal abnormalities means a general inflammation of the rectum, colon to cecum
 segment, and the appearance thereof show a shortened length or a thickened diameter.
       [0023]    The     Lactobacillus   Fermentum       strain GMNL-296       in  the
 abovementioned embodiments is one of a plurality of isolates mainly isolated from
 human intestines. The primers (SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2) listed in Table 1
 are used to perform PCR to reproduce 16S rDNA segments of each isolate, and then
 sequencing the 16S rDNA segment of each isolate. After sequencing, a 16S rDNA
 gene sequence of one of the isolates can be obtained as below (SEQ ID NO: 3);
 subsequently, from the comparison results on the NCBI website, it shows that the 16S
 rDNA sequences of the isolates are similar to that of the Lactobacillus Fermentum
 strains with identities all over 99%, so that the strain GMNL-296 indeed belongs to
 the LactobacillusFermentum genus.

      [0037]    The experiment results are shown in Fig. 1. From Fig. 1, it can be seen
that the species 2 (#1, i.e. the viable strain solution of L. fermentum GMNL-296) has
no obvious inhibition to the growth of Clostridium VP110463, and the control group
(MRS, pH=4.0) also shows no inhibition zone.          Therefore, it can be understood that
the Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296 cannot directly inhibit the growth of
ClostridiumDifficile.
      [0038]    Experiment 2:
                                              8

      [0039]     Bacteria broth culture:
      [0040]     Inoculating the Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296 from a frozen
tube to 1 ml of MRS broth, and standing under 37'C for aerobically incubating for 20
hours. The next day, adding 15         1 culture solution into 1.5 ml of MRS broth (1%
secondary activation), and then standing under 37'C for aerobically incubating for 20
hours.
      [0041]     Cell culture:
      [0042]     Adjusting the cell number of macrophage cells (RAW 264.7) to 8 x 105
cells/ml. Adding 0.5 ml of cell solution (with a final cell number of 4x10 5 cells/well)
into a 24-well plate, and standing at 37'C overnight. Next, using phosphate buffer
saline (called PBS hereinafter) to clean the 24-well plate one time, and then replacing
the culture medium with 0.4 ml/well culture medium without serum (DMEM) to
execute starvation for 2 hours.
      [0043]     Co-culture of bacteria and cell:
      [0044]     Taking the bacteria solution, which was incubated the previous night,
to centrifugate for 1 minute (13000 rpm), and carrying out PBS washing twice. After
removing the supernatant again, having 20         1 of PBS suspension of bacteria to mix
with 980    1 of PBS (dilute 50 fold). Measuring OD 600, estimating back to adjust the
bacteria concentration to 1x10 10 CFU/ml. Having 0.2 ml of the adjusted bacterial
solution to mix with 0.8 ml of DMEM (without serum), so that the final number of the
bacteria comes to 2x10 9 CFU/ml. The final concentration was previously adjusted in
the sequence of 2 x 109, 1 x 109, 5 x 10', 1          x  108 , 5 x 107 CFU/ml. After cell
starvation is executed for 2 hours, adding 100          1 of the bacteria solutions having
different diluting folds for treating the cells for 2 hours.
      [0045]     Continuously adding 0.5 ml DMEM, including 200 ng/ml of LPS, into
each hole after the co-culture of the bacteria solution and the cells are executed for 2
hours; and the control group (mock) is provided by adding 0.5 ml DMEM. Culturing
together again for 20 hours, collecting the supernatant for measuring NO (nitric oxide)
content of each group.
      [0046]     Mixing NO reagent (80       1 Griess reagent A + 80    1 Griess reagent B)
with 80    1 cell supernatant to react together under room temperature for 5 minutes.
Next, using an ELISA reader to determine absorbance value of OD 550 nm. The
                                               9

results are shown in Fig. 2. It can be found that LPS can effectively promote the
generation of NO which is the inflammatory substance of RAW264.7 cells. In
addition, after   pre-treating with different doses of GMNL-296, with the increase of
the dose of GMNL-296, the content of NO is gradually reduced, especially for the
doses from 5 x 107 CFU/ml to 2 x 108 CFU/ml, there is found a significant decline
compared to the group without GMNL-296 but only with LPS, and which means that
the Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296 is capable of inhibiting the inflammation
within a specific range of doses, and is a strain having anti-inflammatory ability.
Therefore, the Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296 can effectively inhibit the
inflammation generated by stimulating RAW264.7 cells by LPS.
      [0047]    Experiment 3:
      [0048]    Experiment     Material:    7-8   weeks-old    mice    (C57BL/6)      and
LactobacillusFermentum GMNL-296 live bacteria powder.
      [0049]    Experiment process:
      [0050]    Pipe-feeding the 7-8 weeks-old mice (C57BL/6) every day with
GMNL-296 bacteria solution (4*108 CFU/kg). Continuously feeding for 10 days,
performing disease animal model at the fifth day, and administrating 0.4 mg/ml of
kanamycin, 0.057 mg/ml of gentamycin, 0.057 mg/ml of colistin, 0.215 mg/ml of
metronidazole, 0.045 mg/ml of vancomycin for 5 days. Moreover, pipe-feeding 40
mg/kg/day of proton pump inhibitor (PPI), Esomeprazole (Nexium), per 12 hours
starting from the fourth day of administrating the antibiotics. In addition, the bacteria
solution of GMNL-296 is replaced with PBS as being the control group to performing
the abovementioned process.
      [0051]    On the fifth day, removing metronidazole and vancomycin. On the day
of infection, 4mg/kg of clindamycin is administrated by intraperitoneal injection, and
each mice is fed with Clostridium Difficile (Clostridium VPI10463) in an amount of
lx108 cfu. During this process, keeping pipe-feeding the mice with the GMNL-296.
      [0052]    The changes of body weight are observed and the length of the
intestines is dissected. The Treg-related transcription factors FoxP3 and GATA3 and
the mRNAs that can inhibit the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-10 are
analyzed by real-time PCR and the RNA is extracted from the mouse intestinal tissue
and purified.
                                             10

      [0053]     From Experiment 3, it can be found that the mice infected with
Clostridium Difficile will indeed cause intestinal inflammatory, including weight loss
and shortened length of cecum to colon segment. Referring to Figs. 3A and 3B, the
group fed with GMNL-296 is effective in protecting the mice from the symptoms of
weight loss (Fig. 3A) and shortened length of the cecum to colon segment (Fig. 3B)
caused by Clostridium Difficile infection. From the above results, it can be shown that
Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296 can improve cecum and colon segment
abnormalities caused by Clostridium Difficile infection.
      [0054]     Furthermore, refer to Fig. 4, which shows mRNA expression of
transcription factors FoxP3 and GATA3 and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. It can
also be found from Fig. 4 that the administration of Lactobacillus Fermentum
GMNL-296 can promote FoxP3 genes in the mice intestinal tissue; and promote the
secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These two molecules are most related
to the activation of Treg. GMNL-296 can activate the generation of regulatory T cells
through increasing these molecules to achieve immune regulation. In addition, it is
also found that GMNL-296 has the ability to increase the expression of GATA3
(Trans-acting T-cell-specific transcription factor 3) gene which is an important
transcription factor associated with the regulatory T cells, through this molecule,
GMNL-296       can improve the immune disorders caused by acute infection of
Clostridium Difficile. From this result, the Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296 can
improve intestinal abnormalities caused by Clostridium Difficile infection mainly by
increasing the expression of FoxP3, IL:-10, and GATA3 gene in the intestine tissue to
regulate the immune response, rather than by inhibiting the growth of Clostridium
difficile.
      [0055]     In summary, it can be confirmed that the Lactobacillus Fermentum
GMNL-296 and the use thereof to produce a composition for improving Clostridium
Difficile infection are successful constructions in an animal model. The infected mice
have disease characterizations close to that of humans, such as severe diarrhea, weight
loss, ulcers of cecum and large intestine, or even death. From the experiment results,
it can be found that the Lactobacillus Fermentum (GMNL-296)                 indeed has
improvements of the weight loss and shortened intestine length caused by Clostridium
Difficile. That is, the Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296 can prevent and treat
malignant symptoms due to Clostridium difficile infection. In addition, through
                                            11

promoting the expression of the Treg related molecules FoxP3 and IL-10, as well as a
few increase of GATA3, the Lactobacillus Fermentum GMNL-296 improves the
symptoms of Clostridium Difficile infection that is significantly different from the
direct inhibition to the growth of Clostridium Difficile. Thus, the improvement
mechanism of Clostridium Difficile infection is obviously different from the past.
