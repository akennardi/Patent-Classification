 5 CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
           This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/679,999 filed
   on August 6, 2012, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety.
10 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           Sexual Dysfunction (SD) is described as a disorder of or an interruption in sexual
   functioning. In women, the most common type of sexual disorder is generalized, acquired
   HSDD defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4f Edition, Text Revision (American
   Psychiatric Association, 2000; DSM-IV-TR) as: "The persistent lack (or absence) of sexual
15 fantasies or desire for any form of sexual activity marked by distress or interpersonal difficulty
   and not better accounted for by another disorder (except another sexual dysfunction) direct
   physiological effects of a substance (including medications) or a general medical condition." The
   presence of distress or interpersonal difficulty is an integral part of sexual disorders and is central
   to the diagnosis of the condition. Approximately 1 in 10 women reported low sexual desire with
20 associated distress, which may be HSDD.
           Synonyms for HSDD include sexual aversion, i.e., extreme aversion to, absence of, and
   avoidance of all, or almost all, sexual contact with a partner; inhibited sexual desire; sexual
   apathy; loss of libido; decreased sexual desire; distressing loss of sexual desire; and sexual
   anorexia. HSDD occurs in both sexes. It is considered to be the most common of all female
25 sexual disorders, possibly occurring in as many as 10% of women in the United States.
           In women, a majority of HSDD cases are generalized in subtype, though a substantial
   minority of cases may relate to dissatisfaction or loss of interest in the sexual partner. Either
   subtype of HSDD can lead to general feelings of dissatisfaction in the person and/or discord in
   their personal relationships, including for example marital discord. Sexual disorders, whether
30 generalized or situational, often do not respond to counseling therapy, and frequently culminate
   in separation, finding a new sexual partner, and divorce.
                                                    I

            The other phases of sexual function, sexual arousal and orgasm, are also subject to
   impairment. In women, dysfunctions in these sexual phases, if sufficiently distressing, are
   known, respectively, as Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD) and Female Orgasmic Disorder
   (FOD) in DSM-IV-TR. Collectively, they impair sexual function in almost as many women as
 5 does HSDD (Shifren JL et al, Sexual problems and distress in United States women: prevalence
   and correlates. Obstet Gynecol. 2008 Nov; 112(5):970-8]. Women in the peri- and post
   menopause are the most affected subpopulation with such problems. In the US, in the age group
   45-64 years, the prevalence of FSAD is about 3.1 million; of FOD, 2.4 million. Little overlap of
   these disorders was found in the largest, most representative survey of women's sexual function
10 (the PRESIDE study, Shifren et al, ibid.), so the overall number of US women affected with
   FSAD or FOD is over 5 million.
            In men, dysfunction in arousal (in erection) is well recognized; dysfunctional delay in, or
   absence of, orgasm (ejaculation) also occurs with some frequency. If it causes significant sexual
   distress, the disorder is called Male Orgasmic Disorder (MOD; delayed ejaculation). Male
15 dysfunctionally premature ejaculation (PE) is much more frequent than any of these problems,
   occurring in up to 30% of younger men (Laumann et al., Sexual dysfunction in the United States:
   Prevalence and predictors, JAMA, 1999;281:537-44).
            Sexual dysfunction may also be manifested as a significant burden in the course of
   physical diseases. Sexual dysfunction is frequent in women with chronic, fatiguing medical
20 illness, especially Female HSDD or FSAD due to breast cancer, diabetes mellitus, or irritable
   bowel syndrome or due to combined factors including one of these medical diseases. These
   conditions occur mainly in middle-aged to older patients. Collectively, these conditions cause
   sexual dysfunction, mainly desire disorder, in over 7.8 million women age 45-64 in the US
   (breast or gynecologic cancer, 1.5 million; diabetes, at least 3.4 million; irritable bowel, at least
25 2.9 million). SD in Men with chronic diseases is little studied but can be presumed from the
   ample evidence on women to be another large set of clinically and epidemiologically significant
   health problems. The most authoritative arbiter of diagnostic names and criteria on sexual
   dysfunction, the DSM-IV-TR, recognizes eight kinds of sexual disorders due to chronic physical
   disease: Sexual Dysfunction due to General Medical Conditions (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome,
30 diabetes, cancer); Female HSDD due to General Medical Conditions (e.g., irritable bowel
   syndrome, diabetes, cancer); Male HSDD due to General Medical Conditions (e.g., irritable
   bowel syndrome, diabetes, cancer); Male Erectile Disorder due to General Medical Conditions
   (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, cancer); Female Dyspareunia due to General Medical
                                                      2

   Conditions (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, cancer); Male Dyspareunia due to General
   Medical Conditions (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, cancer); Other Female Sexual
   Dysfunction due to General Medical Conditions (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, cancer)
   if some other feature is predominant (e.g., Orgasmic Disorder) or no feature predominates; and
 5 Other Male Sexual Dysfunction due to General Medical Conditions (e.g., irritable bowel
   syndrome, diabetes, cancer) if some other feature is predominant (e.g., Orgasmic Disorder) or no
   feature predominates.
            Collectively, in this document, all of the sexual dysfunctions and disorders described
   above are called sexual dysfunctions, sexual disorders, or SD.
10          As there is no currently approved treatment for HSDD or any other sexual disorder except
   (male) erectile dysfunction in the United States, a therapeutic composition and methods for
   ameliorating sexual disorders is an unmet need for a significant portion of the population and
   their quality of life. Delineated herein are compositions and methods of treatment that may be
   useful to address this unmet need based on heretofore unexpected properties possessed by the
15 subject compositions.
            Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is the only male sexual dysfunction for which
   pharmacotherapies are broadly available. Sexual disorders other than ED, e.g., HSDD, are also
   common in men, although research on non-ED male sexual disorders has lagged compared to
   that in women. However, the cross-national US survey published in 1999 by Laumann et al.
20 showed that male lack of interest in sex, at 15% of men aged 18-59, was about as frequent as
   erectile dysfunction (18%). In March (Derogatis et al, J Sex Med 2012;9:812-820), a research
   group applied a battery of validated scales to men with HSDD vs. those with no sexual
   dysfunction. The men with HSDD had dramatic impairments on all rating scales relating to
   HSDD: on the Sexual Concerns Index-Male, a measure of male sexual distress; the UCLA
25 Psychosexual Diary's measure of sexual activity; and the Male Desire Scale, a measure of sexual
   desire; but did not have ED: [International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 median score] or
   depression [Beck Depression scale] or low testosterone: men with low or low-normal
   testosterone levels (<300 ng/dL) were excluded. Their data show that male HSDD is a real
   problem of clinical magnitude.     *p<0.0001 for each variable; sample sizes were about 100
                                                       3

       No pharmacologic treatment is available in most countries including the US for either men or
   women with sexual disorders other than for men with ED, although a testosterone transdermal
   system was approved for women with postmenopausal HSDD in Europe in 2005.
       Yet another male sexual dysfunction is frequent, though not the subject of a DSM-IV-TR
 5 diagnosis: Male sexual performance anxiety was a problem for 17% of US men age 18-59 in the
   cross-national survey published by Laumann in 1999 in JAMA, about the same incidence as for
   erectile dysfunction (ED) and male lack of sexual interest. Male sexual performance anxiety was
   about twice as prevalent as ED in US men under age 50. It is little studied but can cause
   significant distress, especially in male patients in infertility clinics. Peterson BD, Newton CR,
10 and Feingold T. in "Anxiety and sexual stress in men and women undergoing infertility
   treatment," in Fertility and Sterility 2007 Oct;88(4):911-4, Epub 2007 Apr 11, found in a
   prospective study at a University-affiliated teaching hospital for in vitro fertilization and
   intrauterine insemination (306 women, 295 men) a strong linkage between anxiety and sexual
   stress in men and concluded that sexual stress among infertile men may be more closely tied to
15 performance anxiety rather than to a more general deterioration in sexual satisfaction associated
   with infertility.
       Male sexual performance anxiety, while not a disorder recognized in DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10,
   is recognized as a necessary focus in the recommended clinical evaluation of men with sexual
   dysfunction according to the Third International Consultation on Sexual Medicine (Paris, July
20 2009). Hatzichristou D, Rosen RC, Derogatis LR, et al, Recommendations for the Clinical
   Evaluation of Men and Women with Sexual Dysfunction, J Sex Med 2010;7:337-348. These
   experts recommend diagnostic workup for male sexual performance anxiety because it may
   cause or result from the recognized male sexual disorders such as ED (psychogenic impotence)
   and premature ejaculation.
25     The model of sexual functioning that is most accepted is one in which sexual desire leads to
   arousal, and eventually orgasm. Even ED, currently the most treatable of sexual dysfunctions, is
   unlikely to be aided by pharmacotherapy unless desire can be restored. Thus, loss of desire is of
   primary concern for treating all disorders of sexual function.
        The current invention relates to combinations of a 5-HTIA receptor agonist and/or 5-HT2A
30 receptor antagonist (e.g., trazodone, nefazodone, mirtazapine, flibanserin), a norepinephrine
   dopamine reuptake inhibitor (e.g., bupropion), and/or an oxytocin receptor (OXTR) agonist (e.g.,
   carbetocin, oxytocin, Syntocinon@) and their use to augment sexual desire, arousal, and orgasm.
                                                      4

   Their ability to help men feel desire will also aid male sexual performance anxiety. These
   combinations will be particularly effective for each of these disorders in men and women
   because they will allow the corrective effects of the individual agents to become manifest
   without being masked by the side effects of either drug, and in particular it will allow rapid relief
 5 of symptoms because the effective dose can be given immediately due to the low expected side
   effects, instead of requiring weeks of up-titration to overcome side effects over time. This makes
   Lorexys*, a fixed combination of bupropion and trazodone, of special value for male HSDD and
   sexual performance anxiety as disorders that cause distress and disrupt quality of life on the days
   when a man is to have sex with a partner.
10     The current invention relates to combinations of a 5-HTIA receptor agonist and/or 5-HT2A
   receptor antagonist (e.g., trazodone, nefazodone, mirtazapine, flibanserin ketanserin, ritanserin,
   clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, asenapine, MDL-100,907, cyproheptadine,
   aripiprazole, and the general class of 2-alkyl-4-aryl-tetrahydro-pyrimido-azepines), a
   norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (e.g., bupropion), and/or an oxytocin receptor
15 (OXTR) agonist (e.g., carbetocin, oxytocin, Syntocinon@) and their use to augment sexual
   desire, arousal, and orgasm. Their ability to help men feel desire will also aid male sexual
   performance anxiety. These combinations will be particularly effective for each of these
   disorders in men and women because they will allow the corrective effects of the individual
   agents to become manifest without being masked by the side effects of either drug, and in
20 particular it will allow rapid relief of symptoms because the effective dose can be given
   immediately due to the low expected side effects, instead of requiring weeks of up-titration to
   overcome side effects over time. This makes Lorexys*, a fixed combination of bupropion and
   trazodone, of special value for male HSDD and sexual performance anxiety as disorders that
   cause distress and disrupt quality of life on the days when a man is to have sex with a partner.
25     The current invention also relates to combinations of a 5-HTIA receptor agonist and/or 5
   HT2A   receptor antagonist (e.g., trazodone, nefazodone, mirtazapine, flibanserin ketanserin,
   ritanserin, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, asenapine, MDL-100,907,
   cyproheptadine, aripiprazole, and the general class of 2-alkyl-4-aryl-tetrahydro-pyrimido
   azepines), and/or a 5-HT 2c receptor antagonist, and/or a 5HT-2c receptor agonist, (e.g.,
30 lorcaserin, vabicaserin, PRX-00933, YM348, and metachlorophenylpiperazine, mCPP), a
   norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (e.g., bupropion), and/or other non-abusable agents
   (agents not scheduled by the DEA) that augment dopamine and/or norepinephrine in the brain,
                                                      5

   e.g., atomoxetine, reboxetine, amedalin, CP-39,332, daledalin, edivoxetine, esreboxetine,
   lortalamine, mazindol, nisoxetine, talopram, talsupram, tandamine, viloxazine, maprotiline,
   ciclazindol, manifaxine, radafaxine, tapentadol, teniloxazine, St. John's wort, ginkgo biloba),
   and/or an oxytocin receptor (OXTR) agonist (e.g., carbetocin, oxytocin, Syntocinon@) and their
 5 use to augment sexual desire, arousal, and orgasm. Their ability to help men feel desire will also
   aid male sexual performance anxiety. These combinations will be particularly effective for each
   of these disorders in men and women because they will allow the corrective effects of the
   individual agents to become manifest without being masked by the side effects of either drug,
   and in particular it will allow rapid relief of symptoms because the effective dose can be given
10 immediately due to the low expected side effects, instead of requiring weeks of up-titration to
   overcome side effects over time. This makes Lorexys*, a fixed combination of bupropion and
   trazodone, of special value for male HSDD and sexual performance anxiety as disorders that
   cause distress and disrupt quality of life on the days when a man is to have sex with a partner.
        Disorders of cognition are also frequent, and are of particular concern because of their high
15 prevalence in older patients (an enlarging segment of the population), the disability they cause,
   and their intractability to current treatments. Improvement in cognition as augmentation of
   cognition for therapeutic purposes is also of interest, e.g., in the circumstances of subjects whose
   cognitive skills are limiting for tasks that require learning or vigilance. The invention provides a
   method of treating a subject suffering from or susceptible to a cognitive disorder or otherwise in
20 need of improvement in cognition with a composition comprising a 5-HTIA agonist, a 5-HT2A
   antagonist, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, an oxytocin receptor (OXTR) agonist,
   and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
            Depressive disorders are also frequent (lifetime risk in women, 10-25%; in men, 5-12%,)
   and are of particular concern because of the disability they cause, the high likelihood of failure
25 with initial treatment (only about 50% of patients with Major Depressive Disorder respond to any
   one antidepressant, the high frequency of incomplete response to currently available treatments
   (only about 30% of patients achieve full remission with a given antidepressant), their increasing
   frequency of treatment-resistance, and especially because they often lead to suicide, in about
   15% of patients (DSM-IV-TR). The invention provides a method of treating a subject suffering
30 from or susceptible to a depressive disorder comprising administering to a subject in need thereof
   a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising a 5-HTIA agonist, a 5-HT2A
                                                       6

   antagonist, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, an oxytocin receptor (OXTR) agonist,
   and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
           It is not readily apparent from published literature reports that oxytocin (OT) can relieve
   human sexual dysfunction. Though a case report of pro-sexual effects of transnasal OT has been
 5 published for each of three very different patients [a postpartum woman without sexual
   dysfunction: Anderson-Hunt and Dennerstein, Brit Med J. 1994;309:929; an elderly man with
   orgasmic disorder: IsHak et al., J Sex Med. 2008;5:1022-4., and a complex psychiatric patient
   without sexual dysfunction: MacDonald and Feifel, J Sex Med 2012;9:1407-1410], the only
   published placebo-controlled study showed no significant advantage for oxytocin: 24
10 International Units (IU) of intranasal OT failed to increase arousal or orgasm in men on the
   primary outcome scale, the "Acute Sexual Experiences Scale (ASES)." The authors concluded
   that "the effects of OT on sexual behavior were equivocal..." [Burri et al,
   Psychoneuroendocrinology. 2008;33:591-600.] Also, in the most recent review of the side
   effects of transnasal OT, in which almost a thousand subjects were treated with OT
15 (Syntocinon@ in almost all studies) in controlled studies to investigate non-sexual effects, no
   events of any type of increase in sexual function were reported [MacDonald et al,
   Psychoneuroendocrinology. 2011 Sep;36(8):1114-26].
           However, OT mediates pro-social and anti-anxiety effects, doing so through effects on
   the amygdala in a placebo-controlled study. [Kirsch et al., J. Neuroscience 2005;25(49):11489
20 11493]. It is a novel aspect of the invention that these properties will specifically aid all DSM
   IV-TR-recognized sexual dysfunction disorders listed as having the DSM-IV-TR subtype "due to
   situational factors," i.e., in men or women who are in a relationship in which sexual activity has
   deteriorated in frequency and/or satisfaction because of increasing loss of trust and/or anxiety
   about performance, avoidance patterns etc., that occur as a consequence of any of the recognized
25 sexual dysfunction disorders: in the male partner, HSDD, ED, PE, MOD, and dyspareunia, and in
   (the epidemiologically frequent but not DSM-IV-recognized condition of) male sexual
   performance anxiety; in the female partner, HSDD, FSAD, FOD, and dyspareunia. It is a novel
   aspect of the invention that the same properties of oxytocin, aiding trust and reducing social
   anxiety, will aid most of the other subtypes of each of these disorders of sexual function, i.e., the
30 subtypes "due to psychological factors and "due to combined factors." "Situational" is defined
   in DSM-IV-TR as applying "if the sexual dysfunction is limited to certain types of stimulation,
   situations, or partners," which is the opposite of the Generalized type. "Due to Psychological
                                                      7

   Factors" applies "when psychological factors are judged to have the major role in the onset,
   severity, exacerbation, or maintenance of the Sexual Dysfunction...." "Due to Combined
   Factors" is defined as applying "when psychological factors are judged to have a role in the
   onset, severity, exacerbation, or maintenance of the Sexual Dysfunction...."
 5         It is a novel aspect of the invention that oxytocin is useful to treat the aforementioned
   subtypes of every diagnostic category of sexual dysfunction. Drawing on clinical experience in
   couples having a long-term partnered relationship, sexual dysfunction in one partner ordinarily
   worsens because of the other partner's reaction over time to that sexual dysfunction, and can
   cause sexual dysfunction in the partner, too. For example, generalized HSDD in a woman is
10 likely to lead her to non-receptivity, which may lead her to a psychosocially destructive pattern
   of avoidance behavior regarding potential sexual situations. The male partner learns to avoid
   sexual frustration, anger, arguments etc. by also practicing avoidance behavior. At first this may
   simply be sublimation, but the likely result over time is atrophy of all sexual aspects of the union,
   including sexual dysfunction in the male partner-performance anxiety likely occurring first,
15 then HSDD, ED, and/or PE. That leads to further decline in the sexual relationship. The
   woman's HSDD was originally, and logically remains, generalized. But both partners' sexual
   disorders may then alternatively be subtyped as situational, due to psychological factors, or due
   to combined factors.
           Similarly, it is another aspect of the invention that oxytocin specifically aids all
20 additionally proposed DSM-5 sexual dysfunction disorders (Male HSDD, Erectile Disorder,
   Delayed Ejaculation, Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder, Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration
   Disorder, Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction, and Sexual Dysfunction Not
   Elsewhere Classified) with the proposed Specifiers of Situational, Partner factors (e.g., partner's
   sexual problems, partner's health status), and Relationship factors (e.g., poor communication,
25 discrepancies in desire for sexual activity). [www.dsm5.org, August 2, 2012].
           The current invention relates to combinations of a 5-HTIA receptor agonist, 5-HT2A
   receptor antagonist, 5-HT 2c receptor antagonist, or combinations thereof (e.g., trazodone). The
   current invention also relates to combinations of a 5-HTIA receptor agonist, 5-HT2A receptor
   antagonist, 5-HT 2c receptor antagonist, or combinations thereof (e.g., trazodone), and a
30 norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (e.g. bupropion), and/or an oxytocin receptor
   (OXTR) agonist (e.g., carbetocin, oxytocin, Syntocinon@) to augment cognition, improve failing
   mental processes in cognitive disorders, and improve mood and the depressive symptoms that
                                                       8

   accompany mood disorders. The current invention also relates to combinations of a 5-HTIA
   receptor agonist, 5-HT2A receptor antagonist (e.g., trazodone, nefazodone, mirtazapine,
   flibanserin), a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (e.g. bupropion), and/or an oxytocin
   receptor (OXTR) agonist (e.g., carbetocin, oxytocin, Syntocinon@) to augment cognition,
 5 improve failing mental processes in cognitive disorders, and improve mood and the depressive
   symptoms that accompany mood disorders. These combinations are particularly effective for
   each of these disorders as they allow the corrective effects of the individual agents to become
   manifest without being masked by the side effects of either drug, and in particular it allow rapid
   relief of symptoms because the effective dose can be given immediately due to the low expected
10 side effects, instead of requiring weeks of up-titration to overcome side effects over time.
   Reduced toxicity is provided by a compound of the invention when administered in vivo, e.g.,
   formulating bupropion, by itself a mild stimulant, with trazodone, by itself a moderate sedative,
   in the proprietary ratio of Lorexys, will neutralize the main side effects of each of the two drugs.
   This makes Lorexys @, a fixed combination of bupropion and trazodone, of special value for
15 treating acute symptoms such as suicidality, disabling symptoms such as inability to work or
   otherwise function, especially for older patients who generally are more prone to side effects and
   for whom adverse effects cause more risk, and especially because such a combination can be
   prescribed by a health provider with less specialized expertise in pharmacologic treatment of
   neuro-psychiatric disorders.
20          The current invention relates to combinations of a 5-HTIA receptor agonist, 5-HT 2A
   receptor antagonist, 5-HT 2c receptor antagonist, or combinations thereof (e.g., trazodone,
   nefazodone, mirtazapine, flibanserin ketanserin, ritanserin, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine,
   risperidone, asenapine, MDL-100,907, cyproheptadine, aripiprazole, and the general class of 2
   alkyl-4-aryl-tetrahydro-pyrimido-azepines). The current invention also relates to combinations of
25 a 5-HTIA receptor agonist, 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, 5-HT 2c receptor antagonist, or
   combinations thereof (e.g., trazodone), and a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (e.g.
   bupropion), and/or an oxytocin receptor (OXTR) agonist (e.g., carbetocin, oxytocin,
   Syntocinon@) to augment cognition, improve failing mental processes in cognitive disorders, and
   improve mood and the depressive symptoms that accompany mood disorders. The current
30 invention also relates to combinations of a 5-HTIA receptor agonist, 5-HT2A receptor antagonist
   (e.g., trazodone, nefazodone, mirtazapine, flibanserin), a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake
   inhibitor (e.g. bupropion), and/or an oxytocin receptor (OXTR) agonist (e.g., carbetocin,

   oxytocin, Syntocinon@) to augment cognition, improve failing mental processes in cognitive
   disorders, and improve mood and the depressive symptoms that accompany mood disorders.
   These combinations are particularly effective for each of these disorders as they allow the
   corrective effects of the individual agents to become manifest without being masked by the side
 5 effects of either drug, and in particular it allow rapid relief of symptoms because the effective
   dose can be given immediately due to the low expected side effects, instead of requiring weeks
   of up-titration to overcome side effects over time. Reduced toxicity is provided by a compound
   of the invention when administered in vivo, e.g., formulating bupropion, by itself a mild

   Syntocinon@) to augment cognition, improve failing mental processes in cognitive disorders, and
   improve mood and the depressive symptoms that accompany mood disorders. These
   combinations are particularly effective for each of these disorders as they allow the corrective
   effects of the individual agents to become manifest without being masked by the side effects of
 5 either drug, and in particular it allow rapid relief of symptoms because the effective dose can be
   given immediately due to the low expected side effects, instead of requiring weeks of up-titration
   to overcome side effects over time. Reduced toxicity is provided by a compound of the
   invention when administered in vivo, e.g., formulating bupropion, by itself a mild stimulant, with
   trazodone, by itself a moderate sedative, in the proprietary ratio of Lorexys, will neutralize the
10 main side effects of each of the two drugs. This makes Lorexys @, a fixed combination of
   bupropion and trazodone, of special value for treating acute symptoms such as suicidality,
   disabling symptoms such as inability to work or otherwise function, especially for older patients
   who generally are more prone to side effects and for whom adverse effects cause more risk, and
   especially because such a combination can be prescribed by a health provider with less
15 specialized expertise in pharmacologic treatment of neuro-psychiatric disorders.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
15          The present inventors have now discovered a therapeutic strategy that addresses sexual
   disorders, cognitive disorders, or offers cognition enhancement in a subject.
            The present invention relates, at least in part, to the discovery that a combination of a 5
   HT2A    antagonist (which is optionally a 5-HTIA receptor agonist) (e.g., trazodone, nefazodone,
   mirtazapine, flibanserin), a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (e.g., bupropion), and
20 oxytocin receptor (OXTR) agonist (e.g., carbetocin, oxytocin, Syntocinon@), (and optionally an
   endocrine active agent) provides unexpected superior and synergistic results in addressing sexual
   disorders, cognitive disorders, or offers cognition enhancement in a subject.
   1.       DEFINITIONS
25          Before further description of the present invention, and in order that the invention may be
   more readily understood, certain terms are first defined and collected here for convenience.
            The term "administration" or "administering" includes routes of introducing the
   compound of the invention(s) to a subject to perform their intended function. Examples of routes
   of administration that may be used include injection (subcutaneous, intravenous, parenterally,
30 intraperitoneally, intrathecal), oral, buccal, sublingual, inhalation, rectal and transdermal. The
                                                      113

   pharmaceutical preparations may be given by forms suitable for each administration route. For
   example, these preparations are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, inhalation,
   eye lotion, ointment, suppository, etc. administration by injection, infusion or inhalation; topical
   by lotion or ointment; and rectal by suppositories. Oral administration is preferred. The
 5 injection can be bolus or can be continuous infusion. Depending on the route of administration,
   the compound of the invention can be coated with or disposed in a selected material to protect it
   from natural conditions which may detrimentally effect its ability to perform its intended
   function. The compound of the invention can be administered alone, or in conjunction with
   either another agent as described above or with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, or both.
10 The compound of the invention can be administered prior to the administration of the other
   agent, simultaneously with the agent, or after the administration of the agent. Furthermore, the
   compound of the invention can also be administered in a pro-drug form which is converted into
   its active metabolite, or more active metabolite in vivo.
            The term "alkyl" refers to the radical of saturated aliphatic groups, including straight
15 chain alkyl groups, branched-chain alkyl groups, cycloalkyl (alicyclic) groups, alkyl substituted
   cycloalkyl groups, and cycloalkyl substituted alkyl groups. The term alkyl further includes alkyl
   groups, which can further include oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur or phosphorous atoms replacing one
   or more carbons of the hydrocarbon backbone, e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur or phosphorous
   atoms. In preferred embodiments, a straight chain or branched chain alkyl has 30 or fewer
20 carbon atoms in its backbone (e.g., C1-C30 for straight chain, C3 -C 3 0 for branched chain),
   preferably 26 or fewer, and more preferably 20 or fewer, and still more preferably 4 or fewer.
   Likewise, preferred cycloalkyls have from 3-10 carbon atoms in their ring structure, and more
   preferably have 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 carbons in the ring structure.
            Moreover, the term alkyl as used throughout the specification and sentences is intended to
25 include both "unsubstituted alkyls" and "substituted alkyls," the latter of which refers to alkyl
   moieties having substituents replacing a hydrogen on one or more carbons of the hydrocarbon
   backbone. Such substituents can include, for example, halogen, hydroxyl, alkylcarbonyloxy,
   arylcarbonyloxy, alkoxycarbonyloxy, aryloxycarbonyloxy, carboxylate, alkylcarbonyl,
   alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, alkylthiocarbonyl, alkoxyl, phosphate, phosphonato,

   sulfamoyl, sulfonamido, nitro, trifluoromethyl, cyano, azido, heterocyclyl, alkylaryl, or an
   aromatic or heteroaromatic moiety. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the
   moieties substituted on the hydrocarbon chain can themselves be substituted, if appropriate.
   Cycloalkyls can be further substituted, e.g., with the substituents described above. An
 5 "alkylaryl" moiety is an alkyl substituted with an aryl (e.g., phenylmethyl (benzyl)). The term
   "alkyl" also includes unsaturated aliphatic groups analogous in length and possible substitution
   to the alkyls described above, but that contain at least one double or triple bond respectively.
            Unless the number of carbons is otherwise specified, "lower alkyl" as used herein means
   an alkyl group, as defined above, but having from one to ten carbons, more preferably from one
10 to six, and still more preferably from one to four carbon atoms in its backbone structure, which
   may be straight or branched-chain. Examples of lower alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n
   propyl, i-propyl, tert-butyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl and so forth. In preferred embodiment, the term
   "lower alkyl" includes a straight chain alkyl having 4 or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone, e.g.,
   C1-C4 alkyl.
15          The terms "alkoxyalkyl," "polyaminoalkyl" and "thioalkoxyalkyl" refer to alkyl groups,
   as described above, which further include oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atoms replacing one or more
   carbons of the hydrocarbon backbone, e.g., oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atoms.
            The terms "alkenyl" and "alkynyl" refer to unsaturated aliphatic groups analogous in
   length and possible substitution to the alkyls described above, but that contain at least one double
20 or triple bond, respectively. For example, the invention contemplates cyano and propargyl
   groups.

25 tetrazole, pyrazole, pyridine, pyrazine, pyridazine and pyrimidine, and the like. Aryl groups also
   include polycyclic fused aromatic groups such as naphthyl, quinolyl, indolyl, and the like. Those
   aryl groups having heteroatoms in the ring structure may also be referred to as "aryl
   heterocycles," "heteroaryls" or "heteroaromatics." The aromatic ring can be substituted at one or
   more ring positions with such substituents as described above, as for example, halogen,
30 hydroxyl, alkoxy, alkylcarbonyloxy, arylcarbonyloxy, alkoxycarbonyloxy, aryloxycarbonyloxy,
   carboxylate, alkylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, alkylthiocarbonyl, phosphate,
   phosphonato, phosphinato, cyano, amino (including alkyl amino, dialkylamino, arylamino,

 5 or heterocyclic rings which are not aromatic so as to form a polycycle (e.g., tetralin).
            The term "associating with" refers to a condition of proximity between a chemical entity
   or compound, or portions thereof, and a binding pocket or binding site on a protein. The
   association may be non-covalent (wherein the juxtaposition is energetically favored by hydrogen
   bonding or van der Waals or electrostatic interactions) or it may be covalent.
10          The language "biological activities" of a compound of the invention includes all activities
   elicited by compound of the inventions in a responsive cell. It includes genomic and non
   genomic activities elicited by these compounds.
            "Biological composition" or "biological sample" refers to a composition containing or
   derived from cells or biopolymers. Cell-containing compositions include, for example,
15 mammalian blood, red cell concentrates, platelet concentrates, leukocyte concentrates, blood cell
   proteins, blood plasma, platelet-rich plasma, a plasma concentrate, a precipitate from any
   fractionation of the plasma, a supernatant from any fractionation of the plasma, blood plasma
   protein fractions, purified or partially purified blood proteins or other components, serum, semen,

   can be cell-free. In a preferred embodiment, a suitable biological composition or biological
   sample is a red blood cell suspension. In some embodiments, the blood cell suspension includes
25 mammalian blood cells. Preferably, the blood cells are obtained from a human, a non-human
   primate, a dog, a cat, a horse, a cow, a goat, a sheep or a pig. In preferred embodiments, the
   blood cell suspension includes red blood cells and/or platelets and/or leukocytes and/or bone
   marrow cells.
            The term "chiral" refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability
30 of the mirror image partner, while the term "achiral" refers to molecules which are
   superimposable on their mirror image partner.
                                                      116

           The term "diastereomers" refers to stereoisomers with two or more centers of
   dissymmetry and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another.
           The term "effective amount" includes an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of
   time necessary, to achieve the desired result, e.g., sufficient to treat a sexual disorder or
 5 hypoactive sexual desire disorder in a subject. An effective amount of compound of the invention
   may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, and weight of the subject, and the
   ability of the compound of the invention to elicit a desired response in the subject. Dosage
   regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. An effective amount is
   also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects (e.g., side effects) of the compound of the
10 invention are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.
           A therapeutically effective amount of compound of the invention (i.e., an effective
   dosage) may range from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25
   mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more
   preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body
15 weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage required
   to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder,
   previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present.
   Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the
   invention can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In one
20 example, a subject is treated with a compound of the invention in the range of between about 0.1
   to 20 mg/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably
   between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for

10 and Hall, New York (1989)). Enantiomers can also be separated by classical resolution
   techniques. For example, formation of diastereomeric salts and fractional crystallization can be
   used to separate enantiomers. For the separation of enantiomers of carboxylic acids, the
   diastereomeric salts can be formed by addition of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as
   brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, and the like. Alternatively, diastereomeric esters can be
15 formed with enantiomerically pure chiral alcohols such as menthol, followed by separation of the
   diastereomeric esters and hydrolysis to yield the free, enantiomerically enriched carboxylic acid.
   For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or
   sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result
   in formation of the diastereomeric salts.

     3.    USES OF THE COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION
           In one embodiment, the invention provides methods of treating a disease or disorder in a
   subject comprising administering to the subject a composition delineated herein. In one
   embodiment, the invention provides methods of treating sexual disorder in a subject comprising
25 administering to the subject a composition delineated herein. In certain embodiments, the
   subject is a mammal, e.g., a primate, e.g., a human. In aspect, the disease, disorder or symptom
   thereof in which the compounds, compositions, and methods of treatment relate to is one
   described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4f edition - Text
   Revision, (DSM-I-TRV), American Psychiatric Association.
30         In certain embodiments, the methods of the invention include administering to a subject a
   therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention in combination with another
                                                     123

   pharmaceutically active compound. Examples of pharmaceutically active compounds include
   compounds known to treat sexual disorder in a subject. Other pharmaceutically active
   compounds that may be used can be found in Harrison'sPrinciplesof Internal Medicine,
   Thirteenth Edition, Eds. T.R. Harrison et al. McGraw-Hill N.Y., NY; and the Physicians Desk
 5 Reference 50th Edition 1997, Oradell New Jersey, Medical Economics Co., the complete
   contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. The compound of the
   invention and the pharmaceutically active compound may be administered to the subject in the
   same pharmaceutical composition or in different pharmaceutical compositions (at the same time
   or at different times).
10          Determination of a therapeutically effective sexual disorder effective amount, a
   prophylactically effective sexual disorder or hypoactive sexual desire disorder amount of the
   compound of the invention, can be readily made by the physician or veterinarian (the "attending
   clinician"), as one skilled in the art, by the use of known techniques and by observing results
   obtained under analogous circumstances. The dosages may be varied depending upon the
15 requirements of the patient in the judgment of the attending clinician; the severity of the
   condition being treated and the particular compound being employed. In determining the
   therapeutically effective sexual disorder or hypoactive sexual desire disorder amount or dose,
   and the prophylactically effective sexual disorder or hypoactive sexual desire disorder amount or
   dose, a number of factors are considered by the attending clinician, including, but not limited to:
20 the specific sexual disorder or hypoactive sexual desire disorder involved; pharmacodynamic
   characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the desired time
   course of treatment; the species of mammal; its size, age, and general health; the specific disease
   involved; the degree of or involvement or the severity of the disease; the response of the
   individual patient; the particular compound administered; the mode of administration; the
25 bioavailability characteristics of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the
   kind of concurrent treatment (i.e., the interaction of the compound of the invention with other co
   administered therapeutics); and other relevant circumstances.
            The dosage administration can be in a single dosage form or multiple dosage forms. The
   dosages can be administered concurrently, simultaneously, or sequentially. The dosages can be a
30 single dosage immediately prior to sexual activity, or can be one or more doses daily without
   regard to timing prior to sexual activity. Treatment can be initiated with smaller dosages, which
   are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage may be increased by
                                                      124

   small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience,
   the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. A
   therapeutically effective amount and a prophylactically effective amount of a compound of the
   invention of the invention is expected to vary from about 0.1 milligram per kilogram of body
 5 weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 100 mg/kg/day.
           The identification of those patients who are in need of prophylactic treatment for sexual
   disorder or hypoactive sexual desire disorder is well within the ability and knowledge of one
   skilled in the art. Certain of the methods for identification of patients which are at risk of
   developing sexual disorder or hypoactive sexual desire disorder which can be treated by the
10 subject method are appreciated in the medical arts, such as family history, and the presence of
   risk factors associated with the development of that disease state in the subject patient (e.g., use
   of antidepressant drugs, hormonal contraceptives, antihormonal and/or cytotoxic chemotherapies,
   sedatives, antipsychotic drugs, antiepileptic drugs, mood stabilizer drugs, opioid drugs, alcohol,
   or narcotic drugs). A clinician skilled in the art can readily identify such candidate patients, by
15 the use of, for example, clinical tests, physical examination and medical/family history.
           As used herein, "obtaining a biological sample from a subject," includes obtaining a
   sample for use in the methods described herein. A biological sample is described above.
           In another aspect, a compound of the invention is packaged in a therapeutically effective
   amount with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The composition may be
20 formulated for treating a subject suffering from or susceptible to a sexual disorder or hypoactive
   sexual desire disorder, and packaged with instructions to treat a subject suffering from or
   susceptible to a sexual disorder or hypoactive sexual desire disorder.
           The subject may be at risk of a sexual disorder or hypoactive sexual desire disorder, may
   be exhibiting symptoms of a sexual disorder or hypoactive sexual desire disorder, may be
25 susceptible to a sexual disorder or hypoactive sexual desire disorder and/or may have been
   diagnosed with a sexual desire disorder.
           If the modulation of the status indicates that the subject may have a favorable clinical
   response to the treatment, the subject may be treated with the compound. For example, the
   subject can be administered therapeutically effective dose or doses of the compound.
30         Kits of the invention include kits for treating a sexual disorder or hypoactive sexual desire
   disorder in a subject. The kit may include a compound of the invention, for example, a
                                                     125

   compound described herein, pharmaceutically acceptable esters, salts, and prodrugs thereof, and
   instructions for use. The instructions for use may include information on dosage, method of
   delivery, storage of the kit, etc. In aspects, the kits (and methods of using them) comprise
   instructions indicating that the compositions and/or treatment methods are contraindicated for (or
 5 not to be administered to) subjects that: (i) require and/or are taking CYP3A4, CYP 2B6-, or
   CYP 2D6-metabolized drugs; (ii) take any sex hormone other than an approved hormonal
   contraceptive; (iii) drink more than one alcoholic drink per day (e.g., 12-oz beer, 4-oz wine, etc).
            Alternatively, the effects of compound of the invention can be characterized in vivo using
   animals models.

   therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention in combination with another
   pharmaceutically active compound. Examples of pharmaceutically active compounds include
   compounds known to treat cognitive disorder in a subject. Other pharmaceutically active
20 compounds that may be used can be found in Harrison'sPrinciplesof Internal Medicine,
   Thirteenth Edition, Eds. T.R. Harrison et al. McGraw-Hill N.Y., NY; and the Physicians Desk
   Reference 50th Edition 1997, Oradell New Jersey, Medical Economics Co., the complete
   contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. The compound of the
   invention and the pharmaceutically active compound may be administered to the subject in the
25 same pharmaceutical composition or in different pharmaceutical compositions (at the same time
   or at different times).
            Determination of a therapeutically effective cognitive disorder effective amount , a
   prophylactically effective cognitive disorder amount of the compound of the invention, can be
   readily made by the physician or veterinarian (the "attending clinician"), as one skilled in the art,
30 by the use of known techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous
   circumstances. The dosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient in the
   judgment of the attending clinician; the severity of the condition being treated and the particular
                                                     126

   compound being employed. In determining the therapeutically effective cognitive disorder
   amount or dose, and the prophylactically effective cognitive disorder amount or dose, a number
   of factors are considered by the attending clinician, including, but not limited to: the specific
   cognitive disorder involved; pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its
 5 mode and route of administration; the desired time course of treatment; the species of mammal;
   its size, age, and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree of or involvement or
   the severity of the disease; the response of the individual patient; the particular compound
   administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of the preparation
   administered; the dose regimen selected; the kind of concurrent treatment (i.e., the interaction of
10 the compound of the invention with other co-administered therapeutics); and other relevant
   circumstances.
            The dosage administration can be in a single dosage form or multiple dosage forms. The
   dosages can be administered concurrently, simultaneously, or sequentially. The dosages can be a
   single dosage, or can be one or more doses daily. Treatment can be initiated with smaller
15 dosages, which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage may be
   increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For
   convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if
   desired. A therapeutically effective amount and a prophylactically effective amount of a
   compound of the invention of the invention is expected to vary from about 0.1 milligram per
20 kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 100 mg/kg/day.
            The identification of those patients who are in need of prophylactic treatment for
   cognitive disorder is well within the ability and knowledge of one skilled in the art. Certain of
   the methods for identification of patients which are at risk of developing cognitive disorder
   which can be treated by the subject method are appreciated in the medical arts, such as family
25 history, and the presence of risk factors associated with the development of that disease state in
   the subject patient. A clinician skilled in the art can readily identify such candidate patients, by
   the use of, for example, clinical tests, physical examination and medical/family history.
            As used herein, "obtaining a biological sample from a subject," includes obtaining a
   sample for use in the methods described herein. A biological sample is described above.

   amount with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The composition may be
                                                      127

   formulated for treating a subject suffering from or susceptible to a cognition disorder, and
   packaged with instructions to treat a subject suffering from or susceptible to a cognitiondisorder.
            The subject may be at risk of a cognition disorder, may be exhibiting symptoms of a
   cognition disorder, may be susceptible to a cognitive disorder and/or may have been diagnosed
 5 with a cognition disorder.
            If the modulation of the status indicates that the subject may have a favorable clinical
   response to the treatment, the subject may be treated with the compound. For example, the
   subject can be administered therapeutically effective dose or doses of the compound.
            Kits of the invention include kits for treating a cognitive disorder in a subject. The kit
10 may include a compound of the invention, for example, a compound described herein,
   pharmaceutically acceptable esters, salts, and prodrugs thereof, and instructions for use. The
   instructions for use may include information on dosage, method of delivery, storage of the kit,
   etc. In aspects, the kits (and methods of using them) comprise instructions indicating that the
   compositions and/or treatment methods are contraindicated for (or not to be administered to)
15 subjects that: (i) require and/or are taking CYP3A4, CYP 2B6-, or CYP 2D6-metabolized drugs;
   (ii) drink more than one alcoholic drink per day (e.g., 12-oz beer, 4-oz wine, etc).
            Alternatively, the effects of compound of the invention can be characterized in vivo using
   animals models.
            In another embodiment, the invention provides methods of enhancing cognition in a
20 subject comprising administering to the subject a composition delineated herein. In certain
   embodiments, the subject is a mammal, e.g., a primate, e.g., a human. In aspect, the disease,
   disorder or symptom thereof in which the compounds, compositions, and methods of treatment
   relate to is one described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders     4 th
   edition - Text Revision, (DSM-I-TRV), American Psychiatric Association.
25          In certain embodiments, the methods of the invention include administering to a subject a
   therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention in combination with another
   pharmaceutically active compound. Examples of pharmaceutically active compounds include
   compounds known to enhance cognition in a subject. Other pharmaceutically active compounds
   that may be used can be found in Harrison'sPrinciplesof Internal Medicine, Thirteenth Edition,
30 Eds. T.R. Harrison et al. McGraw-Hill N.Y., NY; and the Physicians Desk Reference 50th
   Edition 1997, Oradell New Jersey, Medical Economics Co., the complete contents of which are
                                                      128

   expressly incorporated herein by reference. The compound of the invention and the
   pharmaceutically active compound may be administered to the subject in the same
   pharmaceutical composition or in different pharmaceutical compositions (at the same time or at
   different times).
 5          Determination of a therapeutically effective cognition enhancing effective amount, a
   prophylactically effective cognition enhancement amount of the compound of the invention, can
   be readily made by the physician or veterinarian (the "attending clinician"), as one skilled in the
   art, by the use of known techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous
   circumstances. The dosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient in the
10 judgment of the attending clinician; the severity of the condition being treated and the particular
   compound being employed. In determining the therapeutically effective cognition enhancement
   amount or dose, and the prophylactically effective cognition enhancing amount or dose, a
   number of factors are considered by the attending clinician, including, but not limited to: the
   specific cognition enhancement needed; pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent
15 and its mode and route of administration; the desired time course of treatment; the species of
   mammal; its size, age, and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree of or
   involvement or the severity of the disease; the response of the individual patient; the particular
   compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of the
   preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the kind of concurrent treatment (i.e., the
20 interaction of the compound of the invention with other co-administered therapeutics); and other
   relevant circumstances.
            The dosage administration can be in a single dosage form or multiple dosage forms. The
   dosages can be administered concurrently, simultaneously, or sequentially. The dosages can be a
   single dosage, or can be one or more doses daily. Treatment can be initiated with smaller
25 dosages, which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage may be
   increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For
   convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if
   desired. A therapeutically effective amount and a prophylactically effective amount of a
   compound of the invention of the invention is expected to vary from about 0.1 milligram per
30 kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 100 mg/kg/day.
            The identification of those patients who are in need of prophylactic treatment for
   cognition enhancement is well within the ability and knowledge of one skilled in the art. Certain
                                                    129

   of the methods for identification of patients which are at risk of needing cognition enhancement
   which can be treated by the subject method are appreciated in the medical arts, such as family
   history, and the presence of risk factors associated with the development of that disease state in
   the subject patient. A clinician skilled in the art can readily identify such candidate patients, by
 5 the use of, for example, clinical tests, physical examination and medical/family history.
            As used herein, "obtaining a biological sample from a subject," includes obtaining a
   sample for use in the methods described herein. A biological sample is described above.
            In another aspect, a compound of the invention is packaged in a therapeutically effective
   amount with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The composition may be
10 formulated for treating a subject requiring or susceptible to requiring cognition enhancement, and
   packaged with instructions to treat a subject requiring or susceptible to requiring cognition
   enhancement.
            The subject may be at risk requiring cognition enhancement, may be exhibiting
   symptoms of requiring cognition enhancement, may be susceptible to requiring cognition
15 enhancement and/or may have been diagnosed with requiring cognition enhancement.
            If the modulation of the status indicates that the subject may have a favorable clinical
   response to the treatment, the subject may be treated with the compound. For example, the
   subject can be administered therapeutically effective dose or doses of the compound.
            Kits of the invention include kits for enhancing cognition in a subject. The kit may
20 include a compound of the invention, for example, a compound described herein,
   pharmaceutically acceptable esters, salts, and prodrugs thereof, and instructions for use. The
   instructions for use may include information on dosage, method of delivery, storage of the kit,
   etc. In aspects, the kits (and methods of using them) comprise instructions indicating that the
   compositions and/or treatment methods are contraindicated for (or not to be administered to)
25 subjects that: (i) require and/or are taking CYP3A4, CYP 2B6-, or CYP 2D6-metabolized drugs;
   (ii) drink more than one alcoholic drink per day (e.g., 12-oz beer, 4-oz wine, etc).
            Alternatively, the effects of compound of the invention can be characterized in vivo using
   animals models.
30 4.       PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS
                                                     130

           The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition, comprising an effective
   amount of a compound described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a further
   embodiment, the effective amount is effective to treat a sexual disorder or hypoactive sexual
   desire disorder, as described previously.
 5         In an embodiment, the compound of the invention is administered to the subject using a
   pharmaceutically-acceptable formulation, e.g., a pharmaceutically-acceptable formulation that
   provides sustained delivery of the compound of the invention to a subject for at least 12 hours, 24
   hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, one week, two weeks, three weeks, or four weeks after the
   pharmaceutically-acceptable formulation is administered to the subject.
10         In certain embodiments, these pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for topical or
   oral, buccal or sublingual administration to a subject. In other embodiments, as described in
   detail below, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be specially
   formulated for administration in solid or liquid form, including those adapted for the following:
   (1) oral administration, for example, drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or
15 suspensions), tablets, boluses, powders, granules, pastes; (2) parenteral administration, for
   example, by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection as, for example, a sterile
   solution or suspension; (3) topical application, for example, as a cream, ointment or spray
   applied to the skin; (4) intravaginally or intrarectally, for example, as a pessary, cream or foam;
   or (5) aerosol, for example, as an aqueous aerosol, liposomal preparation or solid particles
20 containing the compound or composition herein.
           The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to those compound of the inventions of
   the present invention, compositions containing such compounds, and/or dosage forms which are,
   within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human
   beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or
25 complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
           The phrase "pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier" includes pharmaceutically-acceptable
   material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent or
   encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting the subject chemical from one organ,
   or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier is "acceptable" in
30 the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to
   the patient. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers
   include: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and
                                                     131

   potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl
   cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8)
   excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed
   oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene
 5 glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters,
   such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium
   hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic
   saline; (18) Ringer's solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) phosphate buffer solutions; and (21) other
   non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations.
10          Wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium
   stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and
   perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions.
            Examples of pharmaceutically-acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble
   antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium
15 metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate,
   butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate,
   alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid,
   ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.
            Compositions containing a compound of the invention(s) include those suitable for oral,
20 nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal, aerosol and/or parenteral
   administration. The compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be
   prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient
   which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary
   depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration. The amount of
25 active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form
   will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally,
   out of one hundred per cent, this amount will range from about 1 per cent to about ninety-nine
   percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 per cent to about 70 per cent, more
   preferably from about 10 per cent to about 30 per cent.
30          Methods of preparing these compositions include the step of bringing into association a
   compound of the invention(s) with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients.
                                                      132

   In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a
   compound of the invention with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then,
   if necessary, shaping the product.
            Compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of
 5 capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or
   tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous
   liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles
   (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouth washes
   and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the invention(s) as an
10 active ingredient. A compound may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.
            In solid dosage forms of the invention for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills,
   dragees, powders, granules and the like), the active ingredient is mixed with one or more
   pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any
   of the following: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol,
15 and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin,
   polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating
   agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain
   silicates, and sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption
   accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; (7) wetting agents, such as, for
20 example, acetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite
   clay; (9) lubricants, such a talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols,
   sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and (10) coloring agents. In the case of capsules,
   tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid
   compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin
25 capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight
   polyethylene glycols and the like.
            A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory
   ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or
   hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example,
30 sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or
   dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the
   powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent.
                                                     133

            The tablets, and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the
   present invention, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or
   prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the
   pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled
 5 release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in
   varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes
   and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria
   retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions
   which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately
10 before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a
   composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion
   of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding
   compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient
   can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described
15 excipients.
            Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compound of the invention(s) include
   pharmaceutically-acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and
   elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents
   commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and
20 emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl
   alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed,
   groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol,
   polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.
            In addition to inert diluents, the oral compositions can include adjuvants such as wetting
25 agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and
   preservative agents.
            Suspensions, in addition to the active compound of the invention(s) may contain
   suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and
   sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and
30 tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.
            Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be
   presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more compound of the
                                                      134

   invention(s) with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for
   example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, and which is solid
   at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or
   vaginal cavity and release the active agent.
 5          Compositions of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also
   include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such
   carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.
            Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of the
   invention(s) include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches
10 and inhalants. The active compound of the invention(s) may be mixed under sterile conditions
   with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants
   which may be required.
            The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to compound of the
   invention(s) of the present invention, excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes,
15 paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites,
   silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof.
            Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to a compound of the invention(s), excipients
   such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder,
   or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as
20 chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane.
            The compound of the invention(s) can be alternatively administered by aerosol. This is
   accomplished by preparing an aqueous aerosol, liposomal preparation or solid particles
   containing the compound. A nonaqueous (e.g., fluorocarbon propellant) suspension could be
   used. Sonic nebulizers are preferred because they minimize exposing the agent to shear, which
25 can result in degradation of the compound.
            Ordinarily, an aqueous aerosol is made by formulating an aqueous solution or suspension
   of the agent together with conventional pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and stabilizers. The
   carriers and stabilizers vary with the requirements of the particular compound, but typically
   include nonionic surfactants (Tweens, Pluronics, or polyethylene glycol), innocuous proteins like
30 serum albumin, sorbitan esters, oleic acid, lecithin, amino acids such as glycine, buffers, salts,
   sugars or sugar alcohols. Aerosols generally are prepared from isotonic solutions.
                                                     135

            Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a
   compound of the invention(s) to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or
   dispersing the agent in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase
   the flux of the active ingredient across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either
 5 providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the active ingredient in a polymer matrix or
   gel.
            Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also
   contemplated as being within the scope of the invention.
            Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for parenteral administration
10 comprise one or more compound of the invention(s) in combination with one or more
   pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions,
   suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable
   solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats,
   solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or
15 suspending or thickening agents.
            Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, which may be employed in the
   pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol,
   propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable
   oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be
20 maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of
   the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.
            These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents,
   emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be
   ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben,
25 chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic
   agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition,
   prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the
   inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
            In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the
30 absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished
   by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water
                                                     136

   solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in
   turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a
   parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an
   oil vehicle.
 5         Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of compound of the
   invention(s) in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the
   ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug
   release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters)
   and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in
10 liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue.
           When the compound of the invention(s) are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans
   and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for
   example, 0.1 to 99.5% (more preferably, 0.5 to 90%) of active ingredient in combination with a
   pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier.
15         Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compound of the invention(s),
   which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the
   present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically-acceptable dosage forms by conventional
   methods known to those of skill in the art.
           Actual dosage levels and time course of administration of the active ingredients in the
20 pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the
   active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular
   patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. An
   exemplary dose range is from 0.1 to 10 mg per day.
           A preferred dose of the compound of the invention for the present invention is the
25 maximum that a patient can tolerate and not develop serious side effects. Preferably, the
   compound of the invention of the present invention is administered at a concentration of about
   0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight, about 0.001 - about 10 mg/kg or about
   0.001 mg - about 100 mg/kg of body weight. Ranges intermediate to the above-recited values
   are also intended to be part of the invention.

   MATERIALS
 5 Small-Molecule Compounds - bupropion, trazodone, oxytocin, and testosterone (and their salt,
   solvates, hydrates, isomers, enantiomers, diasteriomers, racemates; all of which are included
   herein) are available from commercial sources and/or readily synthesized using methods and
   reagents know in the art. Bupropion is also known as, i.e.,   p-Keto-3-chloro-N-tert
   butylamphetamine, i.e., ()-2-(tert-Butylamino)- 1-(3-chlorophenyl)propan- 1-one; trazodone is
10 also known as, i.e., 2-{3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]propyl }I[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3
   a]pyridin-3(2H)-one; oxytocin is also known as, i.e., 1-({ (4R,7S, 1OS, 13S,16S, 19R)-19-amino
   7-(2-amino-2-oxoethyl)- 10-(3 -amino-3-oxopropyl)- 16-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)- 13-[(1S)- 1

   EXAMPLE 1
            Clinical protocol - subjects in a single blind, sequential study are administered bupropion
   and trazodone in increasing dosages @ 3 - 4 weeks each, that is, from a 3 (or 4) -week placebo
   baseline, to an intermediate dose (@ another 3-4 weeks), to a maximum dose (@ a final 3-4
20 weeks). The subjects' feedback/reports on subjective (e.g., feelings, sensations, general
   response) and objective (e.g., response time, performance measures, partner response) is collated
   and analyzed against dosage. Each study also includes one or more patient(s) serving as a control
   (in demonstrating the synergistic effect between the two actives) would receive only bupropion,
   while the second and third will each be given a different fixed dose combination products having
25 a defined ratio of active ingredients (e.g., bupropion and trazodone).
   EXAMPLE 2
            Method. A 36 year-old healthy male volunteer in a stable marital relationship for two
   years with no current sexual disorders, exposed himself sequentially to four treatments, each for
30 4 weeks: (1) Treatment B: Instant-release (IR) Bupropion(Bup) 150 mg in the morning and 100
   mg in the evening; (2) Treatment T: IR trazodone (Trz) 50 mg t.i.d.; (3) Treatment Liew, IR Trz
   25 mg b.i.d. plus IR Bup 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening; and (4) Treatment
                                                      138

   High, IR Trz 50 mg t.i.d. plus IR Bup 75 mg t.i.d. A washout of 1-4 weeks occurred between
   each treatment. Level and frequency of sexual desire was scored daily, as not improved (0),
   somewhat improved (1), or markedly improved (2). Sexual events were counted, and three
   domains (sexual arousal, orgasm, and overall satisfaction with the event) were scored. Each of
 5 the sexual event variables was converted to a simple patient's global impression of improvement
   (PGI; improved or not improved today compared to pre-treatment baseline).         The 3 domains of
   sexual event improvements were summed for analysis. Bup is already recommended as a
   treatment for HSDD; Trz is not. Thus, Fisher's exact test was applied post-hoc to the PGls for
   Treatment B vs. Treatment Liew (Liew) and vs. Treatment Lhigh (Lhigh).
10         Results. For sexual desire, the mean score with Liew and Lhigh was about twice that with
   Treatment B (two-tailed paired t-test, p<0.0001), and Treatment B was superior to Treatment T.
   For arousal, orgasm, and overall satisfaction with a sexual event, Liew was associated with
   somewhat more improvements than with Treatment B in the third and fourth weeks of use. Lhigh
   was associated with significantly more improvements than with Treatment B in the third and
15 fourth weeks of use and in the total for all four weeks. Fisher's exact test, two-tailed, showed the
   combination of bupropion plus trazodone superior, p<0.05, for the 3-domain sum of sexual event
   improvement. This study conducted with the combination of bupropion plus trazodone showed
   increased benefits in sexual arousal, orgasm, and event satisfaction, after exposure for 4 weeks,
   compared to either bupropion alone or trazodone alone. The effects occurred at or below the
20 target dosage of bupropion or trazodone in their current (antidepressant) labeling.
           An independent researcher then scored the desire results as unimproved = 0, somewhat
   improved = 1, and markedly improved = 2. Upon the advice of the independent researcher the
   subject dichotomized his sexual event results in a simple daily patient's global impression of
   improvement: improved or not improved today (compared to pre-treatment baseline). The
25 independent researcher, when told that the results were positive for the subject but before seeing
   any of the data, decided to apply categorical tests to the most obvious comparisons between
   treatments: for the first two weeks, the second two weeks, and for all four weeks of treatment,
   low-dose combination of bupropion plus trazodone vs. corresponding dose of bupropion; and
   high-dose the combination of bupropion plus trazodone vs. same dose of trazodone. The test
30 used for the desire score was a two-tailed paired t test, using all scores within a given treatment
   as repeated measures. The test used for the two-category variables was an online two-tailed
   Fisher's exact test using all scores within a given treatment as repeated measures. Both were
   from the website graphpad.com. *

            B or Bup is bupropion alone, T or Trz is trazodone alone, Liew is the lower dose of
            Bup/Trz combination, Lhigh is the higher dose of Bup/Trz combination.
   For sexual desire, the response to T (Treatment T) was low, to B (Treatment B) was
15 intermediate, and to Liew and Lhigh was sometimes strong in the first two weeks and uniformly
   strong (improvement rated as marked every day) in the second two weeks of treatment. The
   differences between each dose of L vs. B were highly statistically significant, p<0.0001.
   B was markedly superior to T, p<0.05 for all comparisons.
20
   For the sum of improvements in arousal, orgasm, and overall satisfaction with a sexual event,
   L,0 showed significantly more improvements than with B in the third and fourth weeks of use,
                                                             140

   52% vs. 20%, p<0.0 5 .   Lhigh was associated with significantly more improvements than with B in
   the third and fourth weeks of use (72% vs. 13%) and in the total for all four weeks (61% vs.
   20%). Fisher's exact test, two-tailed, showed the combination of bupropion plus trazodone
   superior, p<0.05, for each of these 3-domain sums of sexual event improvement.
 5
   For improvements in orgasm or overall satisfaction for a sexual event, the numbers appeared too
   small and the numerical trends were generally too weak to show statistically significant
   differences. For arousal, however,     Lhigh was associated with significantly more improvements
   than with B in the third and fourth weeks of use (100% vs. 0%) and in the total for all four weeks
10 (91% vs. 20%). Fisher's exact test, two-tailed, showed the combination of bupropion plus
   trazodone superior, p<0.05, for each of these 3-domain sums of sexual event improvement. A
   numerical trend also favored   Lhigh  in weeks 1-2 by 4/5 vs. 2/5 (80% vs. 40%).
   The applicability of these male results to female subjects with HSDD is possible given the
15 similarities of desire dysfunction in men and women [Laumann 1999], and is to be tested next.
