         filed June 21, 2013, the disclosure of each of which is incorporated by reference
        herein in its entirety.
                                              BACKGROUND
  10                     Plastic containers, used for filling with juices, sauces etc., often are hot
        filled and then cooled to room temperature or below for distribution to sell. During
        the process of hot filling and quenching, the container is subjected to different thermal
        and pressure scenarios that can cause deformation, which may make the container
        non-functional or visually unappealing. Typically, functional improvements are
 15    added to the container design to accommodate the different thermal effects and
       pressures (positive and negative) that can control, reduce or eliminate unwanted
       deformation, making the package both visually appealing and functional for
       downstream situations. Functional improvements can include typical industry
       standard items such as vacuum panels and bottle bases to achieve the desired results.
 20    However, it is often desirable that these functional improvements, such as vacuum
       panels, are minimal or hidden to achieve a specific shape, look or feel that is more
       appealing to the consumer. Additional requirements may also include the ability to
       make the container lighter in weight but maintain an equivalent level of functionality
       and performance through the entire hot fill and distribution process.
25                      Existing or current technologies such as vacuum panels in the side wall
      of the container may be unappealing from a look and feel perspective. Vacuum
      panels rely on different components to function efficiently and effectively. One of the
      major components of the efficiency includes the area in which the deformation to
      internal positive or negative pressure is controlled and/or hidden. Technologies that
30    include a vacuum panel in the base portion are limited by surface area of the container
      and therefore the efficiency and effectiveness of the panel are likewise limited.
      Because of this, the shape and surface geometry that define the bottle's appearance,
                                                    -I-

    WO 2014/113371                                                          PCT/US2014/011433
       along with the potential to make the bottle lighter, are limited. In addition to surface
      area, another major factor in the performance of a vacuum panel can be its thickness
      distribution. Material thickness can play a vital role in how the panel responds to both
      positive and negative internal pressure. Through surface geometry however, the
  5   impact of material distribution can be greatly reduced providing a functional panel
      that performs consistently as it is intended with a wide process window. Thus there is
      a need to develop a base with specific surface geometries that utilize the limited base
      area to address the inconsistencies that are presented during the blow process specific
      to material distribution and the varying dynamics the container will be exposed to
 10   through the product lifecycle, as well as to expand the limits of the containers shape
      and/or weight while maintaining the functionality needed to perform as intended.
                       Furthermore, an additional factor for consideration in designing a
      container for use in a hot-fill application is the rate of cooling. For example, a hot-fill
      container filled at 180' F generally must be cooled to at least about 900 F in about 12
 15   16 minutes for commercial applications. Therefore, a need exists for a container that
      can accommodate different rates of cooling. Preferably, such a container is capable of
      accommodating both negative pressures relative to the atmosphere due to such
      cooling as well as positive pressures due to changes in altitude or the like, internal
     pressure exerted during the hot-fill and capping process, as well as flexing to retain
20    overall bottle integrity and shape during the cooling process.
                                             SUMMARY

                                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                         The apparatus and methods presented herein may be used for
  10    containers, including plastic containers, such as plastic containers for liquids. The
        containers and bases described herein can be formed from materials including, but not
        limited to, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) and
        PEN-blends, polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and can also
       include monolayer blended scavengers or other catalytic scavengers as well as multi
 15    layer structures including discrete layers of a barrier material, such as nylon or
       ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) or other oxygen scavengers. The disclosed subject
       matter is particularly suited for hot-fillable containers having a base design that is
       reactive to internal and external pressure due to pressure filling and/or due to thermal
       expansion from hot filling to provide controlled deformation that preserves the
 20    structure, shape and functionality of the container. The container base can also
      provide substantially uniform controlled deformation when vacuum pressure is
      applied, for example due to product contraction from product cooling.
                        In accordance with the disclosed subject matter herein, the disclosed
      subject matter includes a base for a container having a sidewall. The base includes a
25    support surface defining a reference plane, an inner wall extending upwardly from the
      support surface, a first radiused portion extending radially inward from the inner wall
      and concave relative to the reference plane, a second radiused portion extending
      radially inward from the first radiused portion and convex relative to the reference
      plane, an intermediate surface extending radially inward from the second radiused
30    portion and substantially parallel to the reference plane, a third radiused portion
      extending radially inward from the inner surface and convex relative to the reference
      plane, and an inner core disposed proximate the third radiused portion to define a
      central portion of the base. The base can also include an outer support wall, which
                                                   -6-

     WO 2014/113371                                                            PCT/US2014/011433
         can be an extension of the container side. In additional embodiments in accordance
         with the disclosed subject matter, the base further includes a fourth radiused portion
         disposed between the support surface and the inner support wall, and/or a fifth
         radiused portion disposed between the support surface and the outer support wall. As
   5     described further below, each radiused portion defines a hinge for relative movement
         therebetween, such that at least a portion of the base acts as a diaphragm.
                          Reference will now be made in detail to the various exemplary
         embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, exemplary embodiments of which are
        illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The structure of the base for the container
 10     of the disclosed subject matter will be described in conjunction with the detailed
        description of the system.
                         The accompanying figures, where like reference numerals refer to
        identical or functionally similar elements throughout the separate views, serve to
        further illustrate various embodiments and to explain various principles and
 15     advantages all in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. For purpose of
        explanation and illustration, and not limitation, exemplary embodiments of the base
        and container with the disclosed subject matter are shown in the accompanying
        figures. The base is suitable for the manufacture of containers such as, bottles, jars
       and the like. Such containers incorporating the base can be used with a wide variety
20     of perishable and nonperishable goods. However, for purpose of understanding,
       reference will be made to the use of the base for a container disclosed herein with
       liquid or semi-liquid products such as sodas, juices, sports drinks, energy drinks, teas,
       coffees, sauces, dips, jams and the like, wherein the container can be pressure filled
       with a hot liquid or non-contact (i.e., direct drop) filler, such as a non-pressurized
25     filler, and further used for transporting, serving, storing, and/or re-using such products
       while maintaining a desired shape, including providing a support surface for standing
      the container on a table or other substantially flat surface. Containers having a base
      described herein can be further utilized for sterilization, such as retort sterilization,
      and pasteurization of products contained therein. As described in further detail below,
30    the container can have a base configuration to provide improved sensitivity and
      controlled deformation from applied forces, for example resulting from pressurized
      filling, sterilization or pasteurization and resulting thermal expansion due to hot liquid
      contents and/or vacuum deformation due to cooling of a liquid product filled therein.

         The base configuration can influence controlled deformation from positive container
         pressure, for example resulting from expansion of liquid at increased temperatures or
         elevations. For purpose of illustration, and not limitation, reference will be made
         herein to a base and a container incorporating a base that is intended to be hot-filled

        product.
                         FIGS. 1-3 illustrate exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject
        matter. With reference to FIG. 1, the base 100 generally defines a diaphragm
        including a series of radiused portions. The multiple radiused portions can allow the
  10    base 100 to deform in a desired manner from circumferential stress concentrations.
        As shown in FIG. 2A-3, the base 100 generally can include any number of radial
        segments between the radiused portions to proportionally distribute the force
        differential between the inside and outside of the container to provide a low spring
        rate, that is change in resistance due to pressure change.
 15                      As shown for example in FIGS. 1-3, the base 100 can include an outer
        support wall 102, a support surface 104 extending inwardly from the outer support
        wall 102 and defining a reference plane P, and an inner support wall 106 extending
        upwardly from the support surface 104. In accordance with the disclosed subject
       matter, a first radiused portion 108 extends radially inward from the inner support
 20    wall 106 and concave relative to the reference plane P. A second radiused portion
        110 extends radially inward from the first radiused portion 108 and convex relative to
       the reference plane P. An intermediate surface 112 extends radially inward from the
       second radiused portion 110 and substantially parallel to the reference plane P. A
       third internal radiused portion 114 extends radially inward from the intermediate
25     surface 112 and convex to the reference plane P to a central portion 116. The
       intermediate surface 112 can be substantially flat or linear in shape, and can extend at
      an angle substantially parallel (i.e., +/- 10 degrees) relative to the reference plane P.
                        The central portion 116 can be configured to form a variety of suitable
      shapes and profiles. For example, and as depicted, the central portion 116 can be
30    provided with an inner core 118. The inner core 118 can have a generally
      frustoconical shape or the like and can be shallow or deep as desired. By way of
      example, the inner core 118 can comprise a sidewall 120 and a top surface 122
                                                   -8-

    WO 2014/113371                                                           PCT/US2014/011433
        extending from the sidewall 120, the top surface 122 having a convex portion 124
        relative to the reference plane P.
                         As further defined herein, the radiused portions generally function as
       hinges to control at least in part the dynamic movement of the base 100. For example,
  5    the first radiused portion 108 can be configured as a primary contributor to both the
       ease with which the base 100 deforms and the amount of deformation. With reference
       to the exemplary embodiments disclosed in FIG. 1, the second and third radiused
       portions 110, 114 can cooperate with the first radiused portion 108 and provide for
       additional deformation, such as approximately 10-20% or more of total base
 10    displacement.
                        Each radiused portion can be configured to deform in conjunction with
       the other. For example, a change to the geometry and/or relative location of either of
       the third radiused portion 114 or second radiused portion 110 can affect the
       deformation response of the first radiused portion 108. As described further below, a
 15   transition portion 126 between the first radiused portion 108 and the second radiused
      portion 110 can also be configured to affect the efficiency or response of the base
      deformation. Furthermore, the length of the intermediate surface 112 can be selected
      to affect such deformation based upon its relationship with the second and third
      radiused portions 110, 114. In this manner a diaphragm can be designed and tailored
20    based upon the interactions of these base portions to provide a desired performance
      and affect.
                       In addition to the profile of the base 100 as defined by the radiused
     portion locations, the radius of the transition portion 126 between the inner core 118
      and the third radiused portion 114, as well as the conical shape of the inner core 118,
25   can be modified to increase or decrease the spring rate or response to pressure
     differentials, which can accommodate a range of thermodynamic environments, such
     as variations in hot-fill filling lines. The base profile can also allow the base 100 to be
     scaled to containers of different overall shapes such as oval, square or rectangular
     shapes and different sizes while maintaining consistent thermal and pressure
30   performance characteristics.
                       The overall design and contour of the base profile, or a portion thereof,
     can act as a diaphragm responsive to negative internal pressure or vacuum as well as
     positive internal pressure. The diaphragm can aid in concentrating and distributing
                                                   -9-

    WO 2014/113371                                                          PCT/US2014/011433
       axial stress. With reference to the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1-3, the effective
       area of the diaphragm can be measured as the portion of the base extending
       diametrically from the top of the inner support wall 106 on one side of the container
       to the top of the inner support wall 106 on the opposite side. The differential in
  5    pressure between the inside of the container and outside of the container can flex the
       base 100 in a controlled manner. The concentration of stress can be rapidly
       distributed to radiate outwardly from the center of the base 100 in a uniform
       circumferential manner. The stress concentrations in the base thus can be directed
       circumferentially at or around the radiused portions in the diaphragm plane and
 10    extend out in a wave manner.
                       FIGS. 2A-2B show a bottom left perspective and bottom right
       perspective view, respectively, of the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1. FIG. 2C
       shows a bottom plan view of the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1. FIG. 3 shows a
      bottom view of the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1, illustrating the thickness of the
 15   base 100 at various points. With reference to FIGS. 2A-3, the base design can further
      include ribs 128 to form base segments 130 that can cooperate with the radial radiused
      portions to improve strength and resistance to deformation or roll out from positive
      pressure. The geometry of the ribs 128 that divide the segments 130 can provide
      support to the base 100 as it radiates out to the support surface 104. The base 100 can
20    deform more efficiently without the segments 130 when only internal vacuum is
      considered. However through testing it was determined that the use of the segments
      130 can further prevent the base 100 from deforming in an uncontrolled manner
      and/or to an unrecoverable state, and thus provides a structural support response to
      internal positive pressure caused by thermal expansion during the filling and capping
25   process which ultimately results in predicted/controlled and improved response to
     vacuum. Thus, while typical prior art container base vacuum panel technology
     focuses on the performance of the panel in response to a vacuum (i.e., negative
     pressure), embodiments disclosed herein can further address performance of the panel
     in response to the positive pressure exerted during filling and capping.
30                    Further in accordance with the disclosed subject matter, the base, and
     thus the container, can be configured with any of a variety of different shapes, such as
     a faceted shape, a square shape, oval shape (see FIG. 4) or any other suitable shape.
     In this manner, each segment 130, if provided, can be formed as a wedge and can
                                                 -10-

     WO 2014/113371                                                         PCT/US2014/011433
         serve as a discrete segment of the base. The segment can have a profile that matches
        the base profile of FIG. 1 when viewed in that direction. When viewing the cross
        section of the segment as it extends radially out from the center longitudinal axis,
        each segment can have a convex or concave shape relative to the reference plane P as
   5    in FIG. 26. A segment 130 that is convex-shaped when referring to the reference
        plane P can create small regions that can invert displacing volume in the presence of
        vacuum. As such, volume displacement can be reduced relative to the entire base or
        diaphragm structure movement. A segment 130 that is concave-shaped relative to the
        reference plane P can improve control of deformation from internal pressure. The
 10     concave shape can further control total base movement. The ribs 128 dividing the
        base 100 can further support or tie the base together circumferentially. The ribs 128
        can be formed continuously along the base 100 from the inner core 118 to the support
        surface 104. Alternatively, the ribs 128 can be formed with discontinuities, for
        example having discontinuities along the base 100 at the points where any or all of the
 15    radiused portions are formed. In addition, the rib cross section as viewed in FIG. 26
       can have varying shapes and sizes as defined in FIG. 26.
                        The base segments 130 can each function independently to provide
       variable movement of the base 100 and can result in displacement in response to small
       changes in internal or external changes in container pressure. The combined structure
20     of the individual segments 130 and the ribs 128 dividing the segments 130 can reduce
       the reaction or displacement to positive pressure while increasing or maintaining
       sensitivity to negative internal pressure. The base segments 130 can move
       independently in response to the force or rate of pressure change. Thus, each base
       segment 130 or area within the segment can provide a secondary finite response to
25    vacuum deformation and product displacement. As such, the combination of
      segments 130 and dividing ribs 128 can adapt or compensate to variations in wall
      thicknesses and gate locations among containers formed using base 100 that would
      otherwise cause inconsistent or incomplete base movement as found in the control.
      The movement of the segments can be secondary to primary movement or deflection
30    of the overall base diaphragm structure, which can be affected by the base geometry
      and radiused portions, as described herein.
                       Current and earlier base technologies have also used mechanical
      actuation as a method to compensate for product contraction. These technologies
                                                  -11-

     WO 2014/113371                                                           PCT/US2014/011433
         have incorporated segments or scallops as part of the design of the base, and in these
         particular instances, the segments -- and specifically the area in between the segments
         -- were needed to provide uniform base movement as the base was mechanically
         inverted. To achieve this, the area between the segments flex or deform to maintain
   5     the shape of the segment and maximize the volume displaced by inversion as all the
         segments around the circumference of the base invert consistently. Without these
         breaks in the geometry, the base could invert in an uneven and uncontrolled manner.
         In the case of the present variable displacement base, the segments 130, either
         concave or convex in shape when viewing the cross section from the central
 10      longitudinal axis out to the major diameter, can react individually as a response to
        either internal positive or negative pressure. The deformation that occurs reacts in the
        actual segment surface as opposed to the area in between the segment. It is through
        this action that the segments 130 can respond individually such that base 100 can
        respond dynamically to multiple forces and maintain consistent total base
 15     deformation.
                         In this manner, base 100 can respond or deform in a controlled manner
        from the positive internal pressure. The controlled deformation can prevent the base
        diaphragm region from extending down past the standing ring, which may define
       reference plane P or support surface 104, while providing a geometry that can respond
20     dynamically to internal vacuum pressure. Base 100 can exhibit a small degree of
       relaxation or thermal creep due to hot fill temperatures and the resulting positive
       pressure from thermal expansion within the container. The environmental effect of
       temperature, pressure and time can interact with base 100 to provide a controlled
       deformation shape. Due at least in part to the response of the material to heat and
25     pressure, some elastic hysteresis can prevent base 100 from returning to its original
       molded shape when all forces are removed. It was discovered through analysis and
      physical testing that the design of the base profile, segments 130 and ribs 128 would
       lead to an initial surface geometry that, when subjected to the positive pressure of hot
      filling and capping, results in a shape that also responds efficiently to internal vacuum
30    pressures. Thus, after hot filling and capping, the resulting shape of base 100 can be
      considered a preloaded condition from which the bottle base can be designed to
      respond to vacuum deformation from the negative internal pressure created by
      product contraction during cooling.

         the known current base.
                        In accordance with another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, a
        further modification is provided of the base for a container as defined above. That is,
   5    the base generally, comprises an outer support wall, a support surface extending
        inwardly from the outer support wall and defining a reference plane, an inner support
        wall extending upwardly from the support surface, a first radiused portion extending
        radially inward from the inner support wall and concave relative to the reference
        plane, a second radiused portion extending radially inward from the first radiused
 10     portion and convex relative to the reference plane, an intermediate surface extending
        radially inward from the second radiused portion and substantially parallel to the
        reference plane, a third radiused portion extending radially inward from the
        intermediate surface and convex relative to the reference plane, and a central portion
       disposed proximate the third radiused portion as defined in detail above. As disclosed
 15    herein, the base further includes a fourth radiused portion disposed between the
       support surface and the inner support wall and/or a fifth radiused portion disposed
       between the support surface and the outer support wall. As with the radiused portions
       previously defined, the fourth radiused portion and the fifth radiused portion herein
       each generally functions as a hinge for further deformation of the base. Hence, the
20     portion of the base acting as a diaphragm can extend inwardly from the fourth
       radiused portion to include the inner support wall or inwardly from the fifth radiused
      portion to further include the support surface.
                       For purpose of illustration and not limitation, reference is now made to
      the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 27. Particularly, FIG. 27 depicts in cross-section
25    the profile of a base 700 having fourth and fifth radiused portions. As depicted in
      cross-section, the base profile embodied herein generally comprises the various
      features as described in detail above, including the three radiused portions 708, 710,
      714 and intermediate surface 712. Furthermore, a fourth radiused portion 750 is
      disposed between the support surface 704 and the inner support wall 706 for relative
30    movement therebetween. Additionally or alternatively, a fifth radiused portion 752
      can be provided between the support surface 704 and the outer support wall 702.
      Each of the additional radiused portions can be formed in a variety of ways. As
      depicted in FIG. 27, the fourth radiused portion 750 is convex when viewed from the
                                                  -16-

     WO 2014/113371                                                           PCT/US2014/011433
         bottom, and the inner support wall 706 is configured to extend upward and radially
         inward from the support surface 704. For example, but not limitation, the inner
         support wall 706 can be configured such that at least an upper portion thereof extends
         at an angle of between about 15 degrees and about 85 degrees relative to the reference
   5     plane P. Furthermore, and as compared with the embodiment of FIG. 1-3, the support
         surface 704 can be provided with an increased width in relation to the cross dimension
        of the base as a whole to enhance the performance of the fifth radiused portion 752 to
        act as a hinge relative to the outer support wall 702. For example, the support surface
        704 can have a width of between about 4% to about 10% of the maximum cross
 10     dimension of the base 700.
                        In this manner, and as previously described, the radiused portions will
        function as hinges and can cooperate for dynamic movement of the base as a whole.
        That is, by providing the fourth radiused portion 750 at the inner edge of the support
        surface 704, the portion of the base 700 extending inwardly from the fourth radiused
 15     portion 750 will act as a diaphragm. Similarly, by providing a fifth radiused portion
        752 at the outer support wall 702, the portion of the base 700 extending inwardly from
       the fifth radiused portion 752 will act as a diaphragm. Depending upon the
       dimensions of the support surface 704, the diaphragm therefore can comprise at least
       about 90% of the surface area of the base 700, or even at least about 95% of the
20     surface area.
                        Furthermore, and as described above, the dimensions and angles of the
       various features can be selected to tailor the overall performance of the base as
       desired. For example, the radius and angle of curvature of the various radiused
       portions, the distances therebetween, and the lengths of the support walls and surfaces
25     can be modified to increase or decrease the spring rate or response to pressure
      differentials to accommodate a range of thermodynamic environments, such as
      variations in hot-fill filling lines. Additionally, the angle of curvature of the inner
      support wall 706 relative to the reference plane P defined by the support surface 704
      can be selected for the desired response to pressure differentials to affect the
30    efficiency of the base deformation.
                       Operation of an exemplary base 700 further having fourth and fifth
      radiused portions 750, 752 is illustrated schematically with reference to FIGS. 28 and
      29. As depicted, operation of base designs having fourth and fifth radiused portions
                                                  -17-

     WO 2014/113371                                                             PCT/US2014/011433
          750, 752 can exhibit base deformation in response to pressure differentials between
         the container and the environment at the fifth radiused portion 752 proximate the
         outer wall of the container. Accordingly, in response to a positive pressure
         differential in the container relative to the environment, the support surface 704 of
   5     the base 700 itself can rotate downwards relative to outer support wall 702, and
         conversely, in response to a negative pressure differential in the container relative to
         the environment, the support surface 704 can rotate upwards relative to the outer
         support wall 702.
                          For example, and as depicted generally in FIG. 28 for purpose of
 10      illustration, an increase in pressure within the container will deform the base 700 in a
         controlled manner such that the fifth radius portion 752 rotates downward relative to
        the reference plane P (i.e., defined by the support surface when not deflected). That
        is, and as embodied herein in its initial state, the fifth radiused portion 752 generally
        defines a right angle or 900 between the support surface 704 and outer support wall
 15     702. Upon an increase in internal pressure, the fifth radiused portion 752 will rotate
        or open to define an obtuse angle (i.e., greater than 90*). In this manner, as the fifth
        radiused portion 752 rotates, the standing surface for the container shifts to the inner
        edge of the support surface 704. As used herein, "standing surface" is the surface that
        would be in contact with a horizontal surface upon which the base is placed. As
20      shown, however, the radii of the radiused portions 708, 710, 714, 750, 752 and the
       length of the intermediate surface 712 are selected to cooperate such that the central
       portion 716 or core does not reside below the standing surface when the maximum
       desired pressure differential is reached. In a similar fashion, and as shown in FIG. 29,
       a negative pressure within the container relative the surrounding environment or
25     atmosphere will result in the fifth radiused portion 752 rotating upwardly from the
       reference plane P to define an acute angle (i.e. less than 90'). As such, the standing
       surface of the container will shift toward the outer edge of the support surface 704
      proximate the outer support wall 702. With reference to the further embodiment
       disclosed in FIG. 28, the radius portions disposed inwardly of the fifth radius portion
30     752 can provide additional deformation, which can be approximately 10-20% or more
      of total base displacement. Hence, and as disclosed herein, the base 700 can be
      configured such that the support surface 704 can rotate to shift the standing surface
      toward the inner edge of the support surface 704 proximate the fourth radiused
                                                    -18-

     WO 2014/113371                                                          PCT/US2014/011433
        portion 750 when there is a positive pressure differential in the container, and rotate to
        shift the standing surface to the outer edge of the support surface 704 proximate the
        fifth radiused portion 752 when there is a negative pressure differential in the
        container. Throughout operation, the standing surface remains preferably below the
   5    remaining portions of the base 700 disposed inwardly of the standing surface.
                         Particularly, FIGS. 28 and 29 illustrate simulated deformations of base
        700 when subject to a range of pressure differentials. FIG. 28 illustrates simulated
        deformation of base 700 in response to a positive pressures of 1.2 psi. FIG. 29
        illustrates simulated deformation of base 700 in response to a negative pressures of
 10     1.8 psi. As shown in FIGS. 28 and 29, the embodiments of the disclosed subject
        matter exhibit a relatively uniform, linear displacement under applied vacuum
       pressure compared to the known current base. Additionally, as illustrated, significant
       displacement occurs at the fifth radiused portion 752, while the portions disposed
       inwardly of the fourth radiused portion remain 750 above the standing surface.
 15                     In accordance with another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, a
       container is provided having a base as described in detail above. The container
       generally comprises a sidewall and a base, the base comprising an outer support wall,
       a support surface extending inwardly from the outer support wall and defining a
       reference plane, an inner support wall extending upwardly from the support surface, a
20     first radiused portion extending radially inward from the inner support wall and
      concave relative to the reference plane, a second radiused portion extending radially
      inward from the first radiused portion and convex relative to the reference plane, an
      intermediate surface extending radially inward from the second radiused portion and
      substantially parallel to the reference plane, a third radiused portion extending radially
25    inward from the intermediate surface and convex relative to the reference plane, and a
      central portion disposed proximate the third radiused portion. As embodied herein, the
      container sidewall can be coextensive and/or integral with the outer support wall of
      the base. Other modifications and feature as described above or otherwise known can
      also be employed.
30                     The various embodiments of the base and of the container as disclosed
      herein can be formed by conventional molding techniques as known in the industry.
      For example, the base can be formed by blow-molding with or without a movable
      cylinder.
