                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0069]         For purposes of description herein, the terms "upper," "lower," "right," "left,"
       "rear,"  "front," "vertical," "horizontal," and derivatives thereof shall relate to the
       invention as oriented in Figs. 1 and 2. However, it is to be understood that the invention
       may assume various alternative orientations and step sequences, except where expressly
       specified to the contrary.      It is also to be understood that the specific devices and
       processes illustrated in the attached drawings,            and described     in the following
       specification are exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the
                                                       6

       appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating
       to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the
       claims expressly state otherwise.
[0070]          The reference numeral 10 (Figs. 1 and 2) generally designates a chair assembly
       embodying the present invention.         In the illustrated example, the chair assembly 10
       includes a castered base assembly 12 abutting a supporting floor surface 13, a control or
       support assembly 14 supported by the castered base assembly 12, a seat assembly 16
       and back assembly 18 each operably coupled with the control assembly 14, and a pair of
       arm assemblies 20. The control assembly 14 (Fig. 3) is operably coupled to the base
       assembly 12 such that the seat assembly 16, the back assembly 18 and the arm
       assemblies 20 may be vertically adjusted between a fully lowered position A and a fully
       raised position B, and pivoted about a vertical axis 21 in a direction 22.          The seat
       assembly 16 is operably coupled to the control assembly 14 such that the seat assembly
       16 (Fig. 4) is longitudinally adjustable with respect to the control assembly 14 between a
       fully retracted position C and a fully extended position D. The seat assembly 16 and the
       back assembly 18 are operably coupled with the control assembly 14 and with one
       another such that the back assembly 18 is movable between a fully upright position E and
       a fully reclined position F, and further such that the seat assembly 16 is movable between
       a fully upright position G and a fully reclined position H corresponding to the fully upright
       position E and the fully reclined position Fof the back assembly 18, respectively.
[0071]          The base assembly 12 includes a plurality of pedestal arms 24 radially extending
       and spaced about a hollow central column 26 that receives a pneumatic cylinder 28
       therein. Each pedestal arm 24 is supported above the floor surface 13 by an associated
       caster assembly 30. Although the base assembly 12 is illustrated as including a multiple
       arm pedestal assembly, it is noted that other suitable supporting structures maybe
       utilized, including but not limited to fixed columns, multiple leg arrangements, vehicle
       seat support assemblies, and the like.
[0072]          The seat assembly 16 (Fig. 5) includes a relatively rigid seat support plate 32
       having a forward edge 34, a rearward edge 36, and a pair of C-shaped guide rails 38
       defining the side edges of the seat support plate 32 and extending between the forward
       edge 34 and the rearward edge 36. The seat assembly 16 further includes a flexibly
       resilient outer seat shell 40 having a pair of upwardly turned side portions 42 each
                                                      7

terminating in a side edge 43, a forward edge 45, and an upwardly turned rear portion 44
that terminates in a rear edge 47 and includes a flap portion 49, wherein the side
portions 42 and rear portion 44 cooperate to form a three-dimensional upwardly
disposed generally concave shape.        In the illustrated example, the seat shell 40 is
comprised of a relatively flexible material such as a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) and is
molded as a single integral piece. In assembly, described in further detail below, the
outer seat shell 40 is secured and sandwiched between the seat support plate 32 and a
plastic, flexibly resilient seat pan 46 which is secured to the seat support plate 32 by a
plurality of mechanical fasteners.      The seat pan 46 includes a forward edge 48, a
rearward edge 50, side edges 52 extending between the forward edge 48 and the
rearward edge 50, a top surface 54 and a bottom surface 56 that cooperate to form an
upwardly disposed generally concave shape. In the illustrated example, the seat pan 46
includes a plurality of longitudinally extending slots 58 extending forwardly from the
rearward edge 50. The slots 58 cooperate to define a plurality of fingers 60
therebetween, each finger 60 being individually flexibly resilient. The seat pan 46 further
includes a plurality of laterally oriented, elongated apertures 62 located proximate the
forward edge 48. The apertures 62 cooperate to increase the overall flexibility of the
seat pan 46 in the area thereof, and specifically allow a forward portion 64 of the seat
pan 46 to flex in a vertical direction 66 with respect to a rearward portion 68 of the seat
pan 46, as discussed further below.        The seat assembly 16 further includes a foam
cushion member 70 that rests upon the top surface 54 of the seat pan 46 and is cradled
within the outer seat shell 40, a fabric seat cover 72, and an upper surface 76 of the
cushion members 70. In the illustrated example, the cover 72 includes a forward edge
73, a rearward edge 75 and a pair of side edges 77 extending therebetween. A spring
support assembly 78 (Figs. 5 and 6) is secured to the seat 16 and is adapted to flexibly
support the forward portion 64 of the seat pan 46 for flexure in the vertical direction 66.
In the illustrated example, the spring support assembly 78 includes a support housing 80
comprising a foam and having side portions 82 defining an upwardly concave arcuate
shape. The spring support assembly 78 further includes a relatively rigid attachment
member 84 that extends laterally between the side portions 82 of the support housing 80
and is located between the support housing 80 and the forward portion 64 of the seat
pan 46. A plurality of mechanical fasteners 86 secure the support housing 80 and the
                                              8

       attachment member 84 to the forward portion 64 of the seat pan 46. The spring support
       assembly 78 further includes a pair of cantilever springs 88 each having a distal end 90
       received through a corresponding aperture 92 of the attachment member 84, and a
       proximate end 94 secured to the seat support plate 32 such that the distal end 90 of each
       cantilever spring 88 may flex in the vertical direction 66. A pair of linear bearings 96 are
       fixedly attached to the attachment member 84 and aligned with the apertures 92
       thereof, such that the linear bearing 96 slidably receives the distal ends 90 of a
       corresponding cantilever springs 88. In operation, the cantilever springs 88 cooperate to
       allow the forward portion 64 of the seat pan 46, and more generally the entire forward
       portion of seat assembly 16 to flex in the vertical direction 66 when a seated user rotates
       forward on the seat assembly 16 and exerts a downward force on the forward edge
       thereof.
[0073]         As best illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7, the flexible resilient seat shell 40 and the fabric
       seat cover 72 cooperate to form an upholstery cover assembly or cover 100. Specifically,
       the side edges 43 of the seat shell 40 and the side edges 77 of the seat cover 72, the
       forward edge 45 of the seat shell 40 and the forward edge 73 of the seat cover 72, and
       the rear edge 47 of the seat shell 40 and the rear edge 75 of the seat cover 72 are
       respectively attached to one another to form the cover 100 and to define an interior
       space 102 therein.
[0074]         The flap portion 49 of the seat shell 40 includes a pair of corner edges 104 each
       extending along a corner 106 of the seat shell 40 located between the rear portion 44
       and respective side portions 42, such that the flap portion 49 is movable between an
       open position I and a closed position J. In the illustrated example, each corner edge 104
       of the flap portion 49 includes a plurality of tabs 108 spaced along the corner edge 104
       and each including an aperture 110 extending therethrough. The tabs 108 of the corner
       edge 104 are interspaced with a plurality of tabs 112 spaced along a corner edge 114 of
       each side portion 42.      Each of the tabs 112 includes an aperture 116 that extends
       therethrough.
[0075]         The seat shell 40 also includes a plurality of integrally-molded coupling tabs 118
       spaced about an inner edge 121 of the seat shell 40 and each having a Z-shaped, cross
       section configuration.
                                                       9

[0076]         In assembly, the upholstery cover assembly 100 (Fig. 8) is constructed from the
       seat shell 40 and seat cover 72 as described above.        The seat pan 46, the cushion
       member 70 and the spring support assembly 78 are then arranged with respect to one
       another and positioned within the interior space 102 of the upholstery cover assembly
       100 by positioning the flap 49 in the open position I, after which the flap 49 is moved to
       the closed position J. A pair of quick-connect fasteners 120 each include a plurality of
       snap couplers 122 spaced along the length of an L-shaped body portion 124.              In
       assembly, the snap couplers 122 are extended through the apertures 110, 116 of the tabs
       108, 112, and are snapably received within corresponding apertures 126 of the seat pan
       46, thereby securing the corner edges 104, 114 to the seat pan 46 and the flap portion 49
       in the closed position J.
[0077]         Further in assembly, the coupling tabs 118 (Fig. 9) are positioned within
       corresponding apertures 130 of the seat pan 46, such that the cover assembly 100 is
       temporarily secured to the seat pan 46, thereby allowing further manipulation of the
       over seat assembly 16 during assembly while maintaining connection and alignment of
       the cover assembly 100 with the seat pan 46. As used herein, "temporarily securing" is
       defined as a securing not expected to maintain the securement of the cover assembly
       100 to the seat pan 46 by itself during normal use of the chair assembly 10 throughout
       the normal useful life of the chair assembly 10. The support plate 32 is then secured to
       an underside of the seat pan 46 by a plurality of screws 132, thereby sandwiching the
       coupling tabs 118 between the support plate 32 and the seat pan 46, and permanently
       securing the cover assembly 100 to the seat pan 46. As used herein, "permanently
       securing" is defined as a securing expected to maintain the securement of the cover
       assembly 100 to the seat pan 46 during normal use of the chair assembly throughout the
       normal useful life of the chair assembly.
[0078]         The back assembly 18 (Figs. 10-12B) includes a back frame assembly 150 and a
       back support assembly 151 supported thereby. The back frame assembly 150 is generally
       comprised of a substantially rigid material such as metal, and includes a laterally
       extending top frame portion 152, a laterally extending bottom frame portion 154, and a
       pair of curved side frame portion 156 extending between the top frame portion 152 and
       the bottom frame portion 154 and cooperating therewith to define an opening 158
                                                   10

       having a relatively large upper dimension 160 and a relatively narrow lower dimension
       162.
[0079]         The back assembly 18 further includes a flexibly resilient, plastic back shell 164
       having an upper portion 166, a lower portion 168, a pair of side edges 170 extending
       between the upper portion 166 and a lower portion 168, a forwardly facing surface 172
       and a rearwardly facing surface 174, wherein the width of the upper portion 166 is
       generally greater than the width of the lower portion 168, and the lower portion 168 is
       downwardly tapered to generally follow the rear elevational configuration of the frame
       assembly 150. A lower reinforcement member 176 attaches to hooks 177 (Fig. 12A) of
       lower portion 168 of back shell 164. Reinforcement member 176 includes a plurality of
       protrusions 179 that engage reinforcement ribs 180 to prevent side-to-side movement of
       lower reinforcement member 176 relative to back shell 164.            As discussed below,
       reinforcement member 176 pivotably interconnects a back control link 600 (Fig. 42) to
       the lower portion 168 of the back shell 164 at pivot points or axis 602.
[0080]         The back shell 164 also includes a plurality of integrally molded, forwardly and
       upwardly extending hooks 177 (Fig. 13) spaced about the periphery of the upper portion
       166 thereof. An intermediate or lumbar portion 182 is located vertically between the
       upper portion 166 and the lower portion 168 of the back shell 164, and includes a
       plurality of laterally extending slots 184 that cooperate to form a plurality of laterally
       extending ribs 186 located therebetween. The slots 184 cooperate to provide additional
       flexure to the back shell 164 in the location thereof. Pairings of lateral ribs 186 are
       coupled by vertically extending ribs 188 integrally formed therewith and located at an
       approximate lateral midpoint thereof. The vertical ribs 188 function to tie the lateral ribs
       186 together and reduce vertical spreading therebetween as the back shell 164 is flexed
       at the intermediate portion 182 thereof when the back assembly 18 is moved from the
       upright position E to the reclined position F. The back shell 164 further includes a
       plurality of laterally-spaced reinforcement ribs 190 extending longitudinally along the
       vertical length of the back shell 164 between the lower portion 168 and the intermediate
       portion 182. It is noted that the depth of each of the ribs 190 increases the further along
       each of the ribs 190 from the intermediate portion 182, such that the overall rigidity of
       the back shell 164 increases along the length of the ribs 190 from the intermediate
       portion 182 toward the lower portion 168.
                                                    11

[0081]         The back shell 164 further includes a pair of rearwardly extending, integrally
       molded pivot bosses 192 forming part an upper back pivot assembly 194. The back pivot
       assembly 194 (Figs. 14-16B) includes the pivot bosses 192 of the back shell 164, a pair of
       shroud members 196 that encompass respective pivot bosses 192, a race member 198,
       and a mechanical fastening assembly 200. Each pivot boss 192 includes a pair of side
       walls 202 and a rearwardly-facing concave seating surface 204 having a vertically
       elongated pivot slot 206 extending therethrough. Each shroud member 196 is shaped so
       as to closely house the corresponding pivot boss 192, and includes a plurality of side
       walls 210 corresponding to side walls 202, and a rearwardly-facing concave bearing
       surface 212 that includes a vertically elongated slot pivot slot 214 extending
       therethrough, and which is adapted to align with the slot 206 of a corresponding pivot
       boss 192. The race member 198 includes a center portion 216 extending laterally along
       and abutting the top frame portion 152 of the back frame assembly 150, and a pair of
       arcuately-shaped bearing surfaces 218 located at the ends thereof.          Specifically, the
       center portion 216 includes a first portion 220, and a second portion 222, wherein the
       first portion 220 abuts a front surface of the top frame portion 152 and second portion
       222 abuts a top surface of the top frame portion 152. Each bearing surface 218 includes
       an aperture 224 extending therethrough and which aligns with a corresponding boss
       member 226 integral with the back frame assembly 150.
[0082]         In assembly, the shroud members 196 are positioned about the corresponding
       pivot bosses 192 of the back shell 164 and operably positioned between the back shell
       164 and race member 198 such that the bearing surface 212 is sandwiched between the
       seating surface 204 of a corresponding pivot boss 192 and a bearing surface 218. The
       mechanical fastening assemblies 200 each include a bolt 230 that secures a rounded
       abutment surface 232 of the bearing washer 234 in sliding engagement with an inner
       surface 236 of the corresponding pivot boss 192, and threadably engages the
       corresponding boss member 226 of the back shell 164.        In operation, the upper back
       pivot assembly 194 allows the back support assembly 151 to pivot with respect to the
       back frame assembly in a direction 240 (Fig. 11) about a pivot axis 242 (Fig. 10).
[0083]         The back support assembly 151 further includes a flexibly resilient comfort
       member 244 attached to the back shell 164 and slidably supporting a lumbar assembly
       246. The comfort member 244 includes an upper portion 248, a lower portion 250, a pair
                                                    12

       of side portions 252, a forward surface 254 and a rearward surface 256, wherein the
       upper portion 248, the lower portion 250 and the side portions cooperate to form an
       aperture 258 that receives the lumbar assembly 246 therein. As best illustrated in Figs.
       12B and 17, the comfort member 244 includes a plurality of box-shaped couplers 260
       spaced about the periphery of the upper portion 248 and extending rearwardly from the
       rearward surface 256. Each box-shaped coupler 260 includes a pair of side walls 262 and
       a top wall 264 that cooperate to form an interior space 266. A bar 268 extends between
       the side walls 262 and is spaced from the rearward surface 256. In assembly, the comfort
       member 244 is secured to the back shell 164 by aligning and vertically inserting the hooks
       180 of the back shell 164 into the interior space 266 of each of the box-shaped couplers
       260 until the hooks 180 engage a corresponding bar 268. It is noted that the forward
       surface 172 of the back shell 164 and the rearward surface 256 of the comfort member
       244 are free from holes or apertures proximate the hooks 180 and box-shaped couplers
       260, thereby providing a smooth forward surface 254 and increasing the comfort to a
       seated user.
[0084]         The comfort member 244 (Figs. 18A and 18B) includes an integrally molded,
       longitudinally extending sleeve 270 extending rearwardly from the rearward surface 256
       and having a rectangularly-shaped cross-sectional configuration. The lumbar assembly
       246 includes a forwardly laterally concave and forwardly vertically convex, flexibly
       resilient body portion 272, and an integral support portion 274 extending upwardly from
       the body portion 272. In the illustrated example, the body portion 272 is shaped such
       that the body portion vertically tapers along the height thereof so as to generally follow
       the contours and shape of the aperture 258 of the comfort member 244. The support
       portion 274 is slidably received within the sleeve 270 of the comfort member 244 such
       that the lumbar assembly 246 is vertically adjustable with respect to the remainder of the
       back support assembly 151 between a fully lowered position L and a fully raised position
       M. A pawl member 276 selectively engages a plurality of apertures 288 spaced along the
       length of support portion 274, thereby releasably securing the lumbar assembly 246 at
       selected vertical positions between the fully lowered position I and the fully raised
       position J. The pawl member 276 (Figs. 19A and 19B) includes a housing portion 278
       having engagement tabs 280 located at the ends thereof and rearwardly offset from an
                                                    13

       outer surface 282 of the housing portion 280. A flexibly resilient finger 284 is centrally
       disposed within the housing portion 280 and includes a rearwardly-extending pawl 286.
[0085]          In assembly, the pawl member 276 (Fig. 20) is positioned within an aperture 288
       located within the upper portion 248 of the comfort member 244 such that the outer
       surface 282 of the housing portion 278 of the pawl member 276 is coplanar with the
       forward surface 254 of the comfort member 244, and such that the engagement tabs 280
       of the housing portion 278 abut the rearward surface 256 of the comfort member 244.
       The support portion 274 of the lumbar assembly 246 is then positioned within the sleeve
       270 of the comfort member 244 such that the sleeve 270 is slidable therein and the pawl
       286 is selectively engageable with the apertures 278, thereby allowing the user to
       optimize the position of the lumbar assembly 246 with respect to the overall back
       support assembly 151. Specifically, the body portion 272 of the lumbar assembly 246
       includes a pair of outwardly extending integral handle portions 290 each having a C
       shaped cross-sectional configuration that wraps about and guides along the respective
       side edge 252 of the back shell 164.
[0086]          In operation, a user adjusts the relative vertical position of the lumbar assembly
       246 with respect to the back shell 244 by grasping one or both of the handle portions 290
       and sliding the handle assembly 290 along the back shell 244 in a vertical direction. A
       stop tab 292 is integrally formed within a distal end 294 and is offset therefrom so as to
       engage an end wall of the sleeve 270 of the comfort member 244, thereby limiting the
       vertical downward travel of the support portion 274 of the lumbar assembly 246 with
       respect to the sleeve 270 of the comfort member 244.
[0087]          The back assembly 151 further includes a cushion member 296 having an upper
       portion 297 and a lower portion 298, wherein the lower portion 298 tapers along the
       vertical length thereof to correspond to the overall shape and taper of the back shell 164
       and the comfort member 244.
[0088]          The back assembly 151 further includes an upholstery cover assembly 300 (Figs.
       12A and 12B) that houses the back shell 244, the lumbar support assembly 246 and the
       cushion member 296 therein. In the illustrated example, the cover assembly 300 (Fig. 21)
       comprises a fabric material and includes a front side 302 and a rear side 304 that are
       sewn together along the respective side edges thereof to form a first pocket 306 having a
       first interior or inner space 308 that receives the back shell 244 and the cushion member
                                                     14

       296 therein, and a flap portion 310 that is sewn to the rear side 304 and cooperates
       therewith to form a second pocket 312 having a second interior or inner space 308 that
       receives the lumbar support assembly 246 therein.
[0089]         In assembly, the first pocket 306 (Fig. 22A) is formed by attaching the respective
       side edges of the front side 302 and the rear side 304 to one another such as by sewing
       or other means suitable for the material for which the cover assembly 300 is comprised,
       and to define the first interior space 308. An edge of the flap portion 310 is then secured
       to the rear side 304 proximate a midsection 312 thereof. In the illustrated example, the
       combination of the back shell 164 and the cushion member 296 are then inserted into
       the interior space 308 of the first pocket 306 via an aperture 314 located of the rear side
       304 (Fig. 22B).    The upholstery cover assembly 300 is stretched about the cushion
       member 296 and the comfort member 244, and is secured to the comfort member 244
       by a plurality of apertures 320 that receive upwardly extending hook members 324 (Fig.
       23) therethrough. Alternatively, the cover assembly 300 may be configured such that
       apertures 320 are positioned to also receive T-shaped attachment members 322
       therethrough. In the illustrated example, the attachment members 322 and the hook
       members 324 are integrally formed with the comfort member 244.            Each attachment
       member 322 is provided with a T-shaped cross-section or boat-cleat configuration having
       a first portion 328 extending perpendicularly rearward from within a recess 329 of the
       rear surface 256 of the comfort member 244, and a pair of second portions 330 located
       at a distal end of the first portion 328 and extending outwardly therefrom in opposite
       relation to one another.      One of the second portions 330 cooperates with the first
       portion 328 to form an angled engagement surface 332. The recess 329 defines an edge
       334 about the perimeter thereof.
[0090]         The cover assembly 300 is further secured to the comfort member 244 by a
       drawstring 336 that extends through a drawstring tunnel 338 of the cover assembly 300,
       and is secured to the attachment members 322. Specifically, and as best illustrated in
       Figs. 24A - 24H, each free end of the drawstring 336 is secured to an associated
       attachment member 322 in a knot-free manner and without the use of a mechanical
       fastener that is separate from the comfort member 244. In assembly, the drawstring 336
       and drawstring tunnel 338 guide about a plurality of guide hooks 339 (Fig. 18B) located
       about a periphery of and integrally formed with the back shell 344. The drawstring 336 is
                                                    15

       wrapped about the associated attachment member 322 such that the tension in the
       drawstring 336 about the attachment member 322 forces the drawstring 366 against the
       engagement surface 332 that angles towards the recess 329, thereby forcing a portion of
       the drawstring 336 into the recess 329 and into engagement with at least a portion of the
       edge 334 of the recess 329 resulting in an increased frictional engagement between the
       drawstring 336 and the comfort member 244.
[0091]          The lumbar assembly 246 is then aligned with the assembly of the cover assembly
       300, the cushion member 296 and the comfort member 244 such that the body portion
       272 of the lumbar assembly 246 is located near the midsection 312 of the cover assembly
       300, and the support portion 274 of the lumbar assembly 246 is coupled with the
       comfort member 244 as described above. The flap portion 310 is then folded over the
       lumbar assembly 246, thereby creating a second pocket 348 having an interior space 350.
       A distally located edge 352 of the flap portion 310 is attached to the comfort member
       244 by a plurality of apertures 354 with the flap portion 310 that receive the hooks 324
       therethrough. The distal edge 352 may also be sewn to the rear side 304 of the cover
       assembly 300. In the illustrated example, the side edges 356 of the flap portion 310 are
       not attached to the remainder of the cover assembly 300, such that the side edges 356
       cooperate with the remainder of the cover assembly 300 to form slots 360 through with
       the handle portions 290 of the lumbar assembly 246.           The second pocket 348 is
       configured such that the lumbar assembly 246 is vertically adjustable therein.          The
       assembly of the cover assembly 300, the cushion member 296, the comfort member 244
       and the lumbar assembly 246 are then attached to the back shell 164.
[0092]          The reference numeral 18a generally designates an alternative embodiment of
       the back assembly. Since back assembly 18a is similar to the previously described back
       assembly 18, similar parts appearing in Figs. 12A and 12B and Figs. 25 - 30 are
       represented respectively by the same corresponding reference numeral, except for the
       suffix "a" in the numerals of the latter. The back assembly 18a includes a back frame
       assembly 150a, a back shell 164a, and an upholstery cover assembly 300a.             In the
       illustrated example, the back shell 164a includes a substantially flexible outer peripheral
       portion 400 and a substantially less flexible rear portion 402 to which the peripheral
       portion 400 is attached. The rear portion 402 includes a plurality of laterally extending,
       vertically spaced slots 405 that cooperate to define slats 404 therebetween.       As best
                                                   16

       illustrated in Figs. 26 and 27, the peripheral portion 400 and the rear portion 402
       cooperate to form an outwardly facing opening 408 extending about a periphery of the
       back shell 164a. The rear portion 402 includes a plurality of ribs 410 spaced about the
       groove 408 and are utilized to secure the cover assembly 300a to the back shell 164a as
       described below.
[0093]          The cover assembly 300a includes a fabric cover 412 and a stay-member 414
       extending about a peripheral edge 416 fabric cover 412. The fabric cover 412 includes a
       front surface 418 and a rear surface 420 and preferably comprises a material flexible in at
       least one of a longitudinal direction and a lateral direction. As best illustrated in Fig. 28,
       the stay member 414 is ring-shaped and includes a plurality of widened portions 422
       each having a rectangularly-shaped cross-sectional configuration interspaced with a
       plurality of narrowed corner portions 424 each having a circularly-shaped cross-sectional
       configuration.   Each of the widened portions 422 include a plurality of apertures 426
       spaced along the length thereof and adapted to engage with the ribs 410 of the back
       shell 164a, as described below. The stay member 414 is comprised of a relatively flexible
       plastic such that the stay member 414 may be turned inside-out, as illustrated in Fig. 29.
[0094]          In assembly, the stay member 414 is secured to the rear surface 420 of the cover
       412 such that the cover 412 is fixed for rotation with the widened portions 422, and such
       that the cover 412 is not fixed for rotation with the narrowed corner portions 424 along a
       line tangential to a longitudinal axis of the narrowed corner portions 424. In the present
       example, the stay member 414 (Fig. 30) is sewn about the peripheral edge 416 of the
       cover 412 by a stitch pattern that extends through the widened portions 422 and about
       the narrowed corner portions 424. The cover assembly 300a of the cover 412 and the
       stay member 414 are aligned with the back shell 164a, and the peripheral edge 416 of
       the cover 412 is wrapped about the back shell 164a such that the stay member 414 is
       turned inside-out. The stay member 414 is the inserted into the groove 408, such that
       the tension of the fabric cover 412 being stretched about the back shell 164a causes the
       stay member 414 to remain positively engaged within the groove 408. The ribs 410 of
       the back shell 164 engage the corresponding apertures 426 of the stay member 414,
       thereby further securing the stay member 414 within the groove 408. It is noted that the
       stitch pattern attaching the cover 412 to the stay member 414 allows the narrowed
       corner portions 424 of the stay member 414 to rotate freely with respect to the cover
                                                     17

       412, thereby reducing the occurrence of aesthetic anomalies near the corners of the
       cover 412, such as bunching or over-stretch of a given fabric pattern.
[0095]          The reference numeral 10b (Figs. 31 and 32) generally designates another
       embodiment of the present invention.           Since chair assembly 10b is similar to the
       previously described chair assembly 10, similar parts appearing in Figs. 1-30 and Figs. 31
       34 respectfully are representative of the same, corresponding reference numeral, except
       for the suffix "b" in the numerals of the latter. The chair assembly 10b is similar in
       construction and assembly to the chair assembly 10 as previously described, with the
       most notable exception being the configuration of the back assembly 18b.
[0096]          As best illustrated in Figs. 31-34, the back assembly 18b includes back frame
       assembly 150b, a back shell member 500, a cross member 502, and a mesh fabric
       upholstery cover 504. The back shell member 500 includes a laterally extending top
       portion 508, a laterally extending bottom portion 510, and a pair of longitudinally
       extending side portions 512 that extend between the top portion 508 and the bottom
       portion 510 and cooperate therewith to define an open space 514 therebetween. In the
       illustrated example, the back shell member 500 comprises a molded plastic, and is
       configured such that the side portions 512 and overall back shell member 500 are
       substantially rigid in a lateral direction 516 and relatively flexible in fore-and-aft direction
       518. The back shell member 500 further includes a lateral portion 520 that extends
       between the side portions 512 at a position spaced between the top portion 508 and the
       bottom portion 510. The lateral portion 520 includes integrally molded pivot bosses
       192b.    In the illustrated example, the back shell member 500 is molded as a single,
       integral piece.
[0097]          The cross member 502 extends laterally across and is secured to the back frame
       assembly 150b.      In the illustrated example, the cross member 502 includes arcuately
       shaped bearing surfaces 218b that cooperate with the pivot bosses 192b in a similar
       manner to as previously described bearing surfaces 218 and pivot bosses 192 of chair
       assembly 10, such that the lumbar area of the back shell member 500 is flexed in the
       fore-and-aft direction 518 as the back frame assembly 150b is moved between the
       upright and reclined positions in a similar manner to as described herein with respect to
       the back shell 164.
                                                      18

[0098]         The cover 504 comprises a thermoelastic knit or woven fabric material that is
       substantially less compliant in a lateral direction 524 than in a longitudinal direction 526.
       Preferably, the cover 504 has a longitudinal direction compliance to lateral direction
       compliance of at least 3:1, and more preferably of at least 10:1. In assembly, the ring or
       stay member 414b (Fig. 35) is attached to a rear surface 528 of the cover 504, opposite
       the front surface 530 and proximate the outer edge 532. The ring 414b and the outer
       edge 532 of the cover 504 are then wrapped about the back shell member 500 and
       inserted into a channel 534 that opens peripherally outward and extends longitudinally
       along the top portion 508, the bottom portion 510 and the side portions 512 of the back
       shell member 500. In the illustrated example, the ring member 414b includes a plurality
       of peripherally-spaced tabs 550 and reliefs 552, while the channel 534 includes a plurality
       of peripherally-spaced reliefs 554 and tabs 556 that interspaced and engage one another,
       respectively, thereby cooperating to provide the back support assembly 151b with a
       rounded-edge aesthetic appearance.         It is noted that in the illustrated example, an
       inwardly extending peripheral lip portion 535 of the cover 504 extends 180* to the main
       user-supporting portion 537 of the cover 504. The lip portion 535 preferably extends
       between 90* and 180* of the user-supporting portion 537.
[0099]         The seat assembly 16 and the back assembly 18 are operably coupled to and
       controlled by the control assembly 14 (Fig. 36) and a control input assembly 604. The
       control assembly 14 (Figs. 37-39) includes a housing or base structure or ground
       structure 606 that includes a front wall 608, a rear wall 610, a pair of side walls 612 and a
       bottom wall 614 integrally formed with one another and that cooperate to form an
       upwardly opening interior space 616. The bottom wall 614 includes an aperture 618
       centrally disposed therein for receiving the cylinder assembly 28 (Fig. 3) therethrough.
       The base structure 606 further defines an upper and forward pivot point 620, a lower and
       forward pivot point 622, and an upper and rearward pivot point 624, wherein the control
       assembly 14 further includes a seat support structure 626 that supports the seat
       assembly 16. In the illustrated example, the seat support structure 626 has a generally
       U-shaped plan form configuration that includes a pair of forwardly extending arm
       portions 628 each including a forwardly located pivot aperture 630 pivotably secured to
       the base structure 606 by a pivot shaft 632 for pivoting movement about the upper and
       forward pivot point 620. The seat support structure 626 further includes a rear portion
                                                      19

        634 extending laterally between the arm portions 628 and cooperating therewith to form
        an interior space 636 within which the base structure 606 is received. The rear portion
        634 includes a pair of rearwardly extending arm mounting portions 638 to which the arm
        assemblies 20. The seat support structure 626 further includes a control input assembly
        mounting portion 640 to which the control input assembly 604 is mounted. The seat
        support structure 626 further includes a pair of bushing assemblies 642 that cooperate to
        define a pivot point 644.
[00100]          The control assembly 14 further includes a back support structure 646 having a
        generally U-shaped plan view configuration and including a pair of forwardly extending
        arm portions 648 each including a pivot aperture 650 and pivotably coupled to the base
        structure 606 by a pivot shaft 652 such that the back support structure 646 pivots about
        the lower and forward pivot point 672. The back support structure 646 includes a rear
        portion 654 that cooperates with the arm portions 648 to define an interior space 656
        which receives the base structure 606 therein. The back support structure 646 further
        includes a pair of pivot apertures 658 located along the length thereof and cooperating
        to define a pivot point 660. It is noted that in certain instances, at least a portion of the
        back frame assembly 150 may be included as part of the back support structure 646.
[00101]          The control assembly 14 further includes a plurality of control links 642 each
        having a first end 644 pivotably coupled to the seat support structure 626 by a pair of
        pivot pins 668 for pivoting about the pivot point 644, and a second end 670 pivotably
        coupled to corresponding pivot apertures 658 of the back support structure 646 by a pair
        of pivot pins 672 for pivoting about the pivot point 660. In operation, the control links
        642 control the motion, and specifically the recline rate of the seat support structure 626
        with respect to the back support structure 646 as the chair assembly is moved to the
        recline position, as described below.
[00102]          As best illustrated in Figs. 40A and 40B, a bottom frame portion 154 of the back
        frame assembly 150 is configured to connect to the back support structure 646 via a
        quick connect arrangement 674. Each arm portion 648 of the back support structure 646
        includes a mounting aperture 676 located at a proximate end 678 thereof.               In the
        illustrated example, the quick connect arrangement 674 includes a configuration of the
        bottom frame portion 154 of the back frame assembly 150 to include a pair of forwardly
        extending coupler portions 680 that cooperate to define a channel 682 therebetween
                                                      20

        that receives the rear portion 654 and the proximate ends 678 of the arm portions 648
        therein. Each coupler portion 680 includes a downwardly extending boss 684 that aligns
        with and is received within a corresponding aperture 676. Mechanical fasteners, such as
        screws 686 are then threaded into the bosses 684, thereby allowing a quick connection
        of the back frame assembly 150 to the control assembly 14.
[00103]          As best illustrated in Fig. 41, the base structure 606, the seat support structure
        626, the back support structure 646 and the control links 662 cooperate to form a 4-bar
        linkage assembly that supports the seat assembly 16, the back assembly 18, and the arm
        assemblies 20. For ease of reference, the associated pivot assemblies associated with
        the 4-bar linkage assembly of the control assembly 14 are referred to as follows: the
        upper and forward pivot point 620 between the base structure 606 and the base support
        structure 626 as the first pivot point 620; the lower and forward pivot point 622 between
        the base structure 606 and the back support structure 646 as the second pivot point 622;
        the pivot point 644 between the first end 664 of the control link 662 and the seat support
        structure 626 as the third pivot point 644; and, the pivot point 660 between the second
        end 670 of the control link 662 and the back support structure 646 as the fourth pivot
        point 660. Further, Figure 41 illustrates the component of the chair assembly 10 shown
        in a reclined position in dashed lines, wherein the reference numerals of the chair in the
        reclined position are designated with a     ' "
[00104]          In operation, the 4-bar linkage assembly of the control assembly 14 cooperates to
        recline the seat assembly 16 from the upright position G to the reclined position H as the
        back assembly 18 is moved from the upright position E to the reclined position F.
        Specifically, the control link 662 is configured and coupled to the seat support structure
        626 and the back support structure 646 to cause the seat support structure 626 to rotate
        about the first pivot point 620 as the back support structure 646 is pivoted about the
        second pivot point 622. Preferably, the seat support structure 646 is rotated about the
        first pivot point 620 at between about 1/3 and about 2/3 the rate of rotation of the back
        support structure 646 about the second pivot point 620, more preferably the seat
        support structure rotates about the first pivot point 612 at about half the rate of rotation
        of the back support structure 646 about the second pivot point 620, and most preferable
        the seat assembly 16 reclines to an angle     P of about 9* from the fully upright position G
                                                        21

        to the fully reclined position H, while the back assembly 18 reclines to an angle a of
        about 18* from the fully upright position Eto the fully reclined position F.
[00105]          As best illustrated in Fig. 41, the first pivot point 612 is located above and forward
        of the second pivot point 620 when the chair assembly 10 is at the fully upright position,
        and when the chair assembly 10 is at the fully reclined position as the base structure 606
        remains fixed with respect to the supporting floor surface 13 as the chair assembly 10 is
        reclined. The third pivot point 644 remains behind and below the relative vertical height
        of the first pivot point 612 throughout the reclining movement of the chair assembly 10.
        It is further noted that the distance between the first pivot point 612 and the second
        pivot point 620 is greater than the distance between the third pivot point 644 and fourth
        pivot point 660 throughout the reclining movement of the chair assembly 10. As best
        illustrated in Fig. 42, a longitudinally extending center line axis 688 of the control link 662
        forms an acute angle a with the seat support structure 626 when the chair assembly 10 is
        in the fully upright position and an acute angle a' when the chair assembly 10 is in the
        fully reclined position. It is noted that the center line axis 688 of the control link 662
        does not rotate past an orthogonal alignment with the seat support structure 626 as the
        chair assembly 10 is moved between the fully upright and fully reclined positions thereof.
[00106]          With further reference to Fig. 43, the back control link 600 includes a forward end
        687 that is pivotably connected to seat support structure 626 at a fifth pivot point 689. A
        rearward end 690 of back control link 600 is connected to lower portion 168 of back shell
        164 at a sixth pivot point 692. Sixth pivot point 692 is optional, and back control link 600
        and back shell 164 may be rigidly fixed to one another. Also, pivot point 692 may include
        a stop feature that limits rotation of back control link 600 relative to back shell 164 in a
        first and/or second rotational direction. For example, with reference to Fig. 43, pivot 692
        may include a stop feature that permits clockwise rotation of lower portion 168 of back
        shell 164 relative to control link 600. This permits the lumbar to become flatter if a
        rearward/horizontal force tending to reduce dimension D1 is applied to the lumbar
        portion of back shell 164.       However, the stop feature may be configured to prevent
        rotation of lower portion 168 of back shell 164 in a counter clockwise direction (Fig. 43)
        relative to control link 600. This causes link 600 and lower portion 168 of back shell 164
                                                          22

        to rotate at the same angular rate as a user reclines in the chair by pushing against an
        upper portion of back assembly 18.
[00107]          A cam link 694 is also pivotably connected to seat support structure 626 for
        rotation about pivot point or axis 689. Cam link 694 has a curved lower cam surface 696
        that slidably engages an upwardly facing cam surface 698 formed in back support
        structure 646. A pair of torsion springs 700 (Fig. 48) rotatably bias the back control link
        600 and the cam link 694 in a manner that tends to increase the angle          0 (Fig. 43). The
        torsion springs 700 generate a force tending to rotate control link 600 in a counter
        clockwise direction (Fig. 43), and simultaneously rotate cam link 694 in a clockwise
        direction (Fig. 43). Thus, torsion springs 700 tend to increase the angle      0 between back
        control link 600 and cam link 694.      A stop 702 on seat support structure 626 limits
        counter clockwise rotation of back control link 600 to the position shown in Fig. 43. This
        force may also bias control link 600 in a counter clockwise direction into the stop feature.
[00108]          As discussed above, the back shell 164 is flexible, particularly in comparison to the
        rigid back frame structure 150. As also discussed above, the back frame structure 150 is
        rigidly connected to the back support structure 646, and therefore pivots with the back
        support structure 646.      The forces generated by torsion springs 700 push upwardly
        against lower portion 168 of back shell 164. The slots 184 in back shell structure 164
        create additional flexibility at lumbar support portion 182 of back shell 164. The force
        generated by torsion springs 700 also tend to cause the lumbar portion 182 of the back
        shell 164 to bend forwardly such that the lumbar portion 182 has a higher curvature than
        the regions adjacent lumbar portion 182.
[00109]          As discussed above, the position of lumbar assembly 246 is vertically adjustable.
        Vertical adjustment of the lumbar assembly 246 also adjusts the way in which the back
        shell 164 flexes/curves during recline of the chair back. In Fig. 43, the lumbar assembly
        182 is adjusted to an intermediate or neutral position, such that the curvature of lumbar
        portion 182 of back shell 164 is also intermediate or neutral. With further reference to
        Fig. 44, if the vertical position of the lumbar assembly 246 is adjusted, the angle         0 is
        reduced, and the curvature of lumbar region 182 is reduced. As shown in Fig. 44, this
        also causes angle 01 to become greater, and the overall shape of the back shell 164 to
        become relatively flat.
                                                     23

[00110]          With further reference to Fig. 45, if the height of lumbar assembly 246 is set at an
        intermediate level (i.e., the same as Fig. 43), and a user leans back, the 4-bar linkage
        defined by links and structures 606, 626, 646, 662, and pivot points 620, 622, 644, 660
        will shift (as described above) from the configuration of Fig. 43 to the configuration of Fig
        45. This, in turn, causes an increase in the distance between pivot point 688 and cam
        surface 698. This causes an increase in the angle 0 from about 49.5* (Fig. 43) to about
        59.9* (Fig. 45).    As the spring rotates towards an open position, some of the energy
        stored in the spring is transferred into the back shell 164, thereby causing the degree of
        curvature of lumbar portion 168 of back shell 164 to become greater. In this way, back
        control link 600, cam link 694, and a torsion springs 700 provide for greater curvature of
        lumbar portion 182 to reduce curvature of a user's back as the user leans back in the
        chair.
[00111]          Also, as the chair tilts from the position of Fig. 43 to the position of Fig. 45, the
        distance D between the lumbar portion 182 and the seat 16 increases from 174mm to
        234mm.      A dimension D' between the lumbar portion 182 of back shell 164 and back
        frame structure 150 also increases as the back tilts from the position of Fig. 43 to the
        position of Fig. 45. Thus, although the distance D increases somewhat, the increase in
        the dimension D' reduces the increase in dimension D because the lumbar portion 182 of
        back shell 164 is shifted forward relative to the back frame 150 during recline.
[00112]          Referring again to Fig. 43, a spine 704 of a seated user 706 tends to curve
        forwardly in the lumbar region 708 by a first amount when a user is seated in an upright
        position. As a user leans back from the position of Fig. 43 to the position of Fig. 45, the
        curvature of the lumbar region 708 tends to increase, and the user's spine 704 will also
        rotate somewhat about hip joint 710 relative to a user's femur 712. The increase in the
        dimension D and the increase in curvature of lumbar region or portion 182 of back shell
        112 simultaneously ensure that a user's hip joint 710 and femur 712 do not slide on the
        seat 16, and also accommodate curvature of the lumbar region 708 of a user's spine 704.
[00113]          As discussed above, Fig. 44 shows the back of the chair in an upright position with
        the lumbar region 182 of shell 164 adjusted to a flat position. If the chair back is tilted
        from the position of Fig. 44 to the position of Fig. 46, the back control link 700 and the
        cam link 694 both rotate in a clockwise direction. However, the cam link 694 rotates at a
        somewhat higher rate, and the angle        0   therefore changes from 31.4* to 35.9*.      The
                                                        24

        distance D changes from 202mm to 265mm, and the angle 0 changes from 24.2* to
        24.1*.
[00114]         With further reference to Fig. 47, if the chair back is reclined, and the lumbar
        adjustment is set high, the angle   0 is 93.6*, and the distance D is 202mm.
[00115]         Thus, the back shell 164 curves as the seat back is tilted rearwardly. However, the
        increase in curvature in the lumbar region 182 from the upright to the reclined position is
        significantly greater if the curvature is initially adjusted to a higher level. This accounts
        for the fact that the curvature of a user's back does not increase as much when a user
        reclines if the user's back is initially in a relatively flat condition when seated upright.
        Restated, if a user's back is relatively straight when in an upright position, the user's back
        will remain relatively flat even when reclined, even though the degree of curvature will
        increase somewhat from the upright position to the reclined position. Conversely, if a
        user's back is curved significantly when in the upright position, the curvature of the
        lumbar region will increase by a greater degree as the user reclines relative to the
        increase in curvature if a user's back is initially relatively flat.
[00116]         A pair of spring assemblies 714 (Figs. 37-39) bias the back assembly 18 from the
        reclined position F towards the upright position E. As best illustrated in Fig. 39, each
        spring assembly 714 includes a cylindrically-shaped housing 716 having a first end 718
        and a second end 720.       Each spring assembly 714 further includes a compression coil
        spring 722, a first coupler 724 and a second coupler 726. In the illustrated example, the
        first coupler is secured to the first end 718 of the housing 716, while the second coupler
        726 is secured to a rod member 728 that extends through the coil spring 722. A washer
        730 is secured to a distal end of the rod member 728 and abuts an end of the coil spring
        722, while the opposite end of the coil spring 722 abuts the second end 720 of the
        housing 716. The first coupler 724 is pivotably secured to the back support structure 446
        by a pivot pin 732 for pivoting movement about a pivot point 734, wherein the pivot pin
        732 is received within pivot apertures 736 of the back support structure 646, while the
        second coupler 726 is pivotably coupled to a moment arm shift assembly 738 by a shaft
        740 for pivoting about a pivot point 742. The moment arm shift assembly 738 is adapted
        to move the biasing or spring assembly 714 from a low tension setting to a high tension
        setting wherein the force exerted by the biasing assembly 714 on the back assembly 18 is
        increased relative to the low-tension setting.
