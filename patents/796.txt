    RELATED APPLICATION
     [0001]           This application claims the benefit of New Zealand provisional
 5  application NZ 600847 filed 22 June 2012, the entirety of which is incorporated herein
    by reference.
    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
     [00021           The present disclosure relates to anti-inflammatory proteins and
    peptides, their uses, and methods of their detection.
10  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
     [00031           Honey has been used for centuries by cultures through the world for its
    multiple health benefits. Two of the most important health benefits of honey are its
    anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Manuka honey, which is produced by
    bees that collect nectar from Leptospermum scoparium, a plant native to New Zealand
15  and southern Australia, has been identified as being a variety of honey that exhibits
    particularly effective anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Jelly Bush honey,
    which is produced by bees that collect nectar from Leptospermum polygalifolium, a
    plant native to Australia, has also been identified as being a variety of honey that
    exhibits particularly effective anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.
20   [00041          Recently, it was discovered that the chemical, methylglyoxal (MGO,
    also called 2-oxopropanal and pyruvaldehyde), is a major component of the anti
    bacterial activity of Leptospermum derived honey, such as manuka honey and jelly
    bush honey. Manuka honey and jelly bush honey samples contain greater
    concentrations of MGO, and have a higher amount of anti-bacterial activity as
25  compared to honey samples with lower concentrations of MGO. MGO is believed to
    confer antibacterial properties on honey because MGO is a highly chemically reactive
    compound, and MGO can readily react with cellular molecules. The chemical reactions
    between MGO and cellular molecules in bacteria damage bacterial molecules that are
    important for viability. In this way, MGO functions as an antibacterial agent.

   WO 2013/191569                                                           PCT/NZ2013/000110
                                               2
    [00051            The presence of high levels of MGO in the honey is a feature that
    distinguishes manuka honey and jelly bush honey from other varieties of honey. While
    most varieties of honey exhibit some anti-bacterial activity, the anti-bacterial activity in
    most varieties of honey is primarily a result of the presence of hydrogen peroxide in the
 5  honey. Leptospermum derived honey, in contrast, exhibits anti-bacterial activity
    primarily because of the presence of MGO in the honey.
    [00061           In 2004, Kohno et. al. examined the anti-inflammatory effects or actions
    of royal jelly at a cytokine level. The results suggest that royal jelly has anti
    inflammatory actions brought about by an inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine
10  production, such as TNF-ca, IL-6 and IL-1, by activated macrophages. The study
    further suggests that the active fractions or components from the royal jelly extracts are
    sized between 5 kDa and 30 kDa. Thus, most honeys may have a weak anti
    inflammatory effect due to royal jelly proteins that occur in the honey.
    [00071            While multiple mechanisms of action of the anti-bacterial activity of
15  manuka honey have been elucidated, the mechanisms whereby manuka honey functions
    as an anti-inflammatory agent have remained unknown. There is a need to develop
    anti-inflammatory agents based on honey, as many anti-inflammatory agents currently
    available have major drawbacks to their use. For example, COX-2 inhibitors, a form of
    non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), may increase the risk of heart attack
20  and stroke in patients, and aspirin may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
    Additionally, corticosteroids are reported to inhibit the growth of epithelial cells and
    NSAIDs are reported as being cytotoxic so both of these classes of anti-inflammatory
    agents are unsuitable for use in wound care. Anti-inflammatory agents derived from
    honey may have fewer toxic side effects in one or more areas than drugs currently
25  available, and may also offer different possible uses than anti-inflammatory drugs
    currently available.
    [00081           Described in the co-pending application PCT/NZ/2011/000271 is a
    modified apalbumin of approximately 55 - 75 kDa from manuka honey that results
    from the high levels of methylglyoxal found in manuka honey. The inventors have
30  identified that the modified apalbumin or major royal jelly protein has significantly
    greater anti-inflammatory properties than an unmodified apalbumin or major royal jelly
    protein.

    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
     [00361          The following description sets forth numerous exemplary
    configurations, parameters, and the like. It should be recognized, however, that such
    description is not intended as a limitation on the scope of the present invention, but is
20  instead provided as a description of exemplary embodiments.
    Definitions
    [0037]           In each instance herein, in descriptions, embodiments, and examples of
    the present invention, the terms "comprising", "including", etc., are to be read
    expansively, without limitation. Thus, unless the context clearly requires otherwise,
25  throughout the description and the claims, the words "comprise", "comprising", and the
    like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as to opposed to an exclusive sense, that is
    to say in the sense of "including but not limited to".
    [00381           "Royal jelly" is a honey bee secretion that is secreted from the glands in
    the hypopharynx of worker bees. Aside from water, protein is the major component of
30  royal jelly and comprises the Major Royal Jelly proteins.

   WO 2013/191569                                                          PCT/NZ2013/000110
                                                 11
     [0039]            An "apalbumin protein" is a glycoprotein found in honey and in royal
    jelly.   The major apalbumin found in honey is Apalbumin 1 (Apal) also known as
     Major Royal Jelly Protein 1 (MRJP1) or royalactin. While the specification focuses on
    the major apalbumins found in honey, it is to be appreciated that the other apalbumins
 5   found in honey may also exhibit similar modification potential and similar anti
     inflammatory capacity because they are all glycoproteins with a high mannose type of
     glycosylation as reported in 2000 by Kimura et. al. in Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem.
     There are approximately nine major royal jelly proteins and the sequences of major
    royal jelly proteins 1-9 are shown in the Sequence Listing.
10   [0040]            It should be understood that the terms "MRJP" (e.g., any one of
    MRJP1-9), "peptide" (e.g., peptide derived from any one of MRJP1-9), and "SEQ ID
    NO:" (e.g., any one of SEQ ID NO: 1-145, and other such terms, for simplicity, are
    used to identify the molecules described herein and not to provide their complete
    characterization. Thus, a protein or peptide may be characterized herein as having a
15  particular amino acid sequence, a particular 2-dimensional representation of the
     structure, but it is understood that the actual molecule claimed has other features,
    including 3-dimensional structure, mobility about certain bonds and other properties of
    the molecule as a whole. It is the molecules themselves and their properties as a whole
    that are encompassed by this disclosure.
20   [0041]            "Modification" of a primary amino acid sequence is understood to
    include "deletions" (that is, polypeptides in which one or more amino acid residues are
    absent), "additions" (that is, a polypeptide which has one or more additional amino acid
    residues as compared to the specified polypeptide), "substitutions" (that is, a
    polypeptide which results from the replacement of one or more amino acid residues),
25  and "fragments" (that is, a primary amino acid sequence which is identical to a portion
    of the primary sequence of the specified polypeptide).
     [0042]            "Modified apalbumin" is to be understood to include any apalbumin or
    major royal jelly protein or fragment thereof that has been modified by the chemical
    reaction of methylglyoxal on the amino acids or the chemical reaction of methylglyoxal
30  on the side chains of the amino group that make up the protein. Methylglyoxal
    modifications occur at free amino groups of lysine, arginine and/or cysteine amino acid
    moieties within the apalbumin, including the terminal amino acid, and such MGO

    WO 2013/191569                                                            PCT/NZ2013/000110
                                                12
      modifications may occur on approximately 1-40 sites within the protein. For example,
      modified apalbuminI means Apal modified at one or more sites on its amino acid
      sequences to provide a MGO-modified Apal.
      [00431           As described herein, MRJP "fragments" (i.e., fragments derived from
  5   one or more MRJP) will be taken to include peptides obtained from any source, e.g.,
      isolated naturally occurring peptides, recombinant peptides, and synthetic peptides.
      These include peptides having the naturally occurring sequences as well as modified
     peptide sequences. Of particular interest are functional fragments of MRJPs, i.e.,
      fragments that retain one or more of the activities of the starting protein, or analogues
 10  thereof. Such activities are described in detail herein. Thus, it will be understood that a
     "fragment" is not limited to a peptide obtained directly from a polypeptide, for
     example, by digestion of the original polypeptide by a peptidase.
      [0044]           As used herein, the term "analogue" of a protein or peptide means a
     protein or peptide that includes a modification as described herein, or a peptide or
15   fragment thereof that includes one or more non-amino acid substituents replacing
     amino acids, while the analogue still provides the necessary activity and respective
     stability of the peptide or peptide fragment. The analogues of the invention may
     include an acetylated N-terminus (Ac) and/or an amidated C-terminus (NH 2), as well as
     a C-terminal hydroxyl residue (OH). Other analogues are also possible, including those
20   that stabilize the domain necessary for Cathepsin B inhibition. Functional analogue are
     specifically encompassed by the present invention, i.e., analogues that retain one or
     more of the activities of the starting sequence. It will be understood that where a
     peptide analogue is specifically noted (e.g., Ac-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-OH; 5), the amino acid
     sequence itself is also considered to be disclosed (e.g., Xaa-Xaa-Xaa). Similarly, where
25   an unmodified peptide is specifically noted (e.g., Xaa-Xaa-Xaa), the analogue is also
     considered to be disclosed (e.g., Ac-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-OH).
     [0045]            "C-terminus" or "C-terminal region" is to be understood to be the
     amino acid region that is proximate the end of an amino acid chain carrying the free
     alpha carboxyl group of the last amino acid.
30   [0046]           "Lysine modified by MGO" is to be understood as a lysine amino acid
    covalently bound to MGO. "Arginine modified by MGO" is understood as an arginine
    amino acid covalently bound to MGO.

   WO 2013/191569                                                          PCT/NZ2013/000110
                                              13
    [00471           Amino acid "sequence similarity" or "sequence identity" refers to the
    amino acid to amino acid comparison of two or more polypeptides at the appropriate
    place, where amino acids are identical or possess similar chemical and/or physical
    properties such as charge or hydrophobicity. Sequence similarity and identity are
 5  typically determined by sequence alignments at the regions of highest homology.
    Sequence alignment algorithms are well known and widely used in the art. Based on
    the sequence comparison, a "percent identity" can be determined between the compared
    polypeptide sequences.
    [0048]           Tissue that is "inflamed" is defined as tissue in which an immune
10  response has occurred in response to injury or infection in the tissue, and in which the
    tissue has one or more symptoms of pain, swelling, heat, sensitivity, and redness.
    [0049]           As used herein, "anti-inflammatory capacity" is defined as the capacity
    to clinically reduce inflammation or the symptoms of inflammation in cellular tissue.
    Anti-inflammatory capacity may be determined using the phagocytosis inhibition assay
15  (PIA) described in PCT/NZ PCT/NZ/2011/000271 or the DCFDA assay also described
    in PCT/NZ/2011/000271 or the anti-inflammatory capacity may also be determined by
    the inhibition of Cathepsin B as described in detail below.

   WO 2013/191569                                                          PCT/NZ2013/000110
                                               15
     MGO-modified major royal jelly proteins
     [00611            Methylglyoxal or MGO is a highly chemically reactive compound with
    the formula C3 1-140 2 . MGO is formed by multiple metabolic pathways in living
     organisms. Certain preparations of manuka honey, which are referred to as "active"
 5   manuka honey, contain much higher concentrations of MGO than other varieties of
    honey. Active manuka honey has been determined to contain MGO concentrations up
    to 1000-fold greater than the MGO concentration in other varieties of honey (E. Mavric
     et al, 2008).
10   [00621            MGO can participate in a variety of chemical reactions in living
     organisms, including the formation process of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs).
     MGO can modify proteins by reacting with the free amino groups of the amino acids
     arginine, lysine, and /or cysteine and the terminal amino group, and thereby can
     chemically modify proteins that contain arginine and/or lysine.
15   [00631            MGO-modified major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) and fragments
    thereof can be derived by isolation of the molecules from active manuka honey. The
     modified proteins and fragments can be isolated from honey and/or enriched from
    honey by biochemical techniques. These techniques include but are not limited to
     filtration, centrifugation, and chromatography, such as ion-exchange, affinity,
20  hydrophobic interaction, size exclusion, and reverse-phase chromatography. MGO
    modified MRJP and fragments can also be purified from various sources or chemically
     synthesized by addition of MGO to royal jelly. In another approach, the major royal
    jelly may be added to honey derived from the Leptospermum genus, such as manuka
    honey and jelly bush honey to achieve enrichment of MGO-modified MRJP and
25   fragments in the honey.
     [0064]            A MGO-modified MRJP or a fragment thereof may also be derived by
    obtaining a sequence coding for the amino acid sequences of SEQ IDs NO: 1-145,
    cloning the coding sequence into an appropriate vector, transforming a cell line with the
    vector, causing the polypeptide or peptide to be expressed, purifying the polypeptide or
30  peptide, mixing the polypeptide or peptide with MGO to allow for chemical reaction
    between MGO and the polypeptide or peptide, and purifying the MGO-modified
    polypeptide or peptide.

   WO 2013/191569                                                           PCT/NZ2013/000110
                                               16
    [0065]           Expression systems may contain control sequences, such as promoters,
    enhancers, and termination controls such as are known in the art for a variety of hosts
    (See e.g. Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A LaboratoryManual, Second Ed., Cold
    Spring Harbor Press (1989) which is incorporated herein in its entirety). The
 5  expression systems may also contain signal peptide and prep-pro-protein sequences that
    facilitate expression of the coding sequence and/or folding of the protein.
    [0066]           Synthetic production or peptides may be carried out using the solid
    phase synthetic method described by Goodman M. (ed.), "Synthesis of Peptides and
    Peptidomimetics" in Methods of organic chemistry (Houben-Weyl) (Workbench
10  Edition, 2004; Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, New York). This technique is well
    understood and is a common method for preparation of peptides. Peptides may also be
    synthesized using standard solution peptide synthesis methodologies, involving either
    stepwise or block coupling of amino acids or peptide fragments using chemical or
    enzymatic methods of amide bond formation. These solution synthesis methods are
15  well known in the art. See, e.g. H. D. Jakubke in The Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis,
    Biology, Academic Press, New York, 1987, p. 103-165; J. D. Glass, ibid., pp. 167-184;
    and EP 0324659 A2, describing enzymatic peptide synthesis methods. Commercial
    peptide synthesizers, such as the Applied Biosystems Model 430A, may also be used.
    [0067]           MGO-modified forms of amino acid variants of MRJPs and their
20  fragments may also exhibit anti-inflammatory capacity. As would be understood by
    one of ordinary skill in the art, minor modification of the primary amino acid sequence
    of SEQ ID NO: 1 may result in a polypeptide which has substantially equivalent or
    enhanced anti-inflammatory activity as compared to SEQ ID NO: 1. A peptide may be
    also modified to provide substantially equivalent or enhanced anti-inflammatory
25  activity as the original peptide. When modification includes one or more substitutions,
    preferred substitutions are those that are of a conservative nature, i.e., wherein the
    residue is replaced by another of the same general type.
    [00681           In making modifications to the protein or peptide, the hydropathic index
    of amino acids may be considered (See, e.g., Kyte. et al., J. Mol. Biol. 157, 105-132

    certain amino acids may be substituted by other amino acids having a similar

   WO 2013/191569                                                           PCT/NZ2013/000110

     hydropathic index or score and still result in a molecule having similar biological
     activity.
     [00691           In particular aspects, the MGO-modified MRJP variant or fragment
     variant exhibits at least about 75% sequence identity to the non-variant sequence,
 5   preferably at least about 80% identity, more preferably at least about 85%, 90%, 91%,
     92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to any wild
     type or reference sequence described herein. It is of particular interest where the MGO
     modified MRJP variant or fragment variant exhibits anti-inflammatory capacity
     substantially comparable to or increased over that of non-variant molecule.
10   100701          In certain aspects, the MRJP fragment is derived from the C-terminal
     sequence of the protein. The fragment may be derived from the last 20 amino acids,
     last 18 amino acids, last 16 amino acids, last 14 amino acids, last 12 amino acids, last
     10 amino acids, last 8 amino acids, last 6 amino acids, last 4 amino acids, or last 2
     amino acids of the C-terminal sequence of the protein. The functional fragment may
15   comprise 2 to 20 amino acids, 2 to 18 amino acids, 2 to 16 amino acids, 2 to 14 amino
     acids, 2 to 12 amino acids, 2 to 10 amino acids, 2 to 8 amino acids, 2 to 6 amino acids,
     2 to 4 amino acids, or 2 amino acids of this C-terminal region. Thus, the MRJP
     fragment may be 20 amino acids, 18 amino acids, 16 amino acids, 14 amino acids, 12
     amino acids, 10 amino acids, 8 amino acids, 6 amino acids, 4 amino acids, or 2 amino
20   acids in length. Longer fragments may also be useful. In particular aspects, the MGO
     modified lysine is at least three residues from the C-terminus, or no more than six
    residues from the C-terminus of the protein.
     [00711          Of particular interest are functional fragments of the C-terminus of
     MRJPs as described in detail herein. However, other fragment of MRJPs may also be
25   obtained, for example, fragments corresponding to internal amino acid sequences of the
    protein. In some aspects, a fragment may include a MRJP-derived amino acid sequence
    which is fused to (i.e., contiguous with) one or more heterologous amino acid
     sequences. Thus, an MRJP fragment may be presented as a portion of a major royal
    jelly protein that is included as part of a larger peptide or polypeptide. This may
30  provide better stability and or expression capabilities, or provide options for cleavage or
    tagging. In certain aspects, the MRJP fragment may be chemically linked to other
    molecules, for example, one or more chemical moieties. While MGO-modified

   WO 2013/191569                                                           PCT/NZ2013/000110
                                                18
     fragments are specifically embraced, other chemical modifications of are also possible.
     The MRJP fragment may also be linked to a substrate such as beads, catheters, needles,
     sutures, stents, implantable medical devices, contact lenses, root canal fillers, wound
    dressings, bum dressings, tissue culture plates, fibers, and paper. The fragment may be
 5  prepared as a peptide conjugate in accordance with known methods.
     [0072]            The formation of MGO-modified MRJP or its fragments in honey can
    be stimulated by (i) prolonged storage at ambient temperature, or (ii) incubation of
    honey at elevated temperatures (30-40 Celsius), thereby increasing the anti
    inflammatory capacity of a sample of honey. Addition of MGO or an MGO precursor,
10  such as dihydroxyacetone (DHA) to a sample of honey, along with sufficient time
    and/or heating to convert the MGO precursor to MGO, may also stimulate the
    formation of MGO-modified MRJP or fragments thereof in that sample of honey, and
    may also increase the anti-inflammatory capacity of the sample of honey, by the
    generation of MGO-modified MRJP in the honey sample.
15
     [00731            MRJP1 and MRJP3 with enhanced anti-inflammatory properties can
    also be formed outside of honey. Completely or partially purified MRJP has been
    found to be treatable with MGO, in order to yield MGO-modified MRJP. The MGO
    modified MRJP1 and MRJP3 exhibits enhanced anti-inflammatory properties when
20  compared to the unmodified MRJP1 and MRJP3.
     [0074]           MGO-modified MRJP, fragments thereof, and variants thereof may be
    included in therapeutically-effective amounts in pharmaceutical compositions. It is also
    to be appreciated that a peptide having MGO-modified lysine and/or arginine may be
    prepared synthetically for use in the compositions.
25  [0075]            The pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure may be
    specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form, including those adapted
    for the following: oral administration, for example, drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous
    solutions or suspensions), tablets, e.g., those targeted for buccal, sublingual, and
    systemic absorption, boluses, powders, granules, pastes for application to the tongue;
30  parenteral administration, for example, by subcutaneous, intravitreal, intramuscular,
    intravenous or epidural injection as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension, or
    sustained release formulation.

      as a cream, ointment, or a controlled release patch or spray applied to the skin; as well
      as administration intravaginally or intrarectally, for example, as a pessary, cream or
      foam; administration sublingually; administration ocularly; administration
  5   transdermally; administration pulmonarily, or nasally.
      [00771           When the compounds of the present invention are administered as
      pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a
      pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, about 0.1 to 99%, or about 1 to
      50%, or about 10 to 40%, or about 10 to 30, or about 10 to 20%, or about 10 to 15% of
 10   active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or
      excipient.
      [00781           Wetting agents, emulsifiers, and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl
      sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating
      agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can
 15   also be present in the pharmaceutical compositions described herein. These
      compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents,
      emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents.
      [0079]          Prevention of the action of microorganisms upon the compounds of the
     present invention may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and
20   antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like.
     It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and
     the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable
     pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents that delay
     absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
25   Methods of use for MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments thereof
     [0080]           Cysteine proteases such as Cathepsin B are involved in the normal
     lysosomal degradation and processing of proteins. The increased expression or
     enhanced activation of cysteine proteases is associated with a number of medical
     conditions. The MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments, or a MGO-modified MRJP- or
30   fragment-containing composition may thereby be used in the prevention, delay,
     mitigation, or treatment of the following disorders.

  5  disorders such as house dust mite allergy, transplant rejection, graft verses host disease,
     Type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroiditis, psoriasis, dermatitis (e.g., contact

10   alcohol hepatitis, prostate hypertrophy, trauma, cutaneous mastocytosis, radiation- and
     HIV-induced diarrhea, cachexia (including accompanying cancer and malnutrition),
     and inflammation associated with wounds, e.g., puncture wounds, diabetic ulcers,
     fungating wounds, cuts, bites, and surgical wounds.
      [00851          Indications of note include: rheumatoid arthritis, polyarthritis,
15   Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, especially relapsing-remitting multiple
     sclerosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), asthma, bronchitis, adult
     respiratory distress syndrome, Wegeneres granulomatosis, emphysema, and COPD,

20   gastroenteritis, uveitis, psoriasis, dermatitis, and various wounds.
     [00861           In a specific aspect, the MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments thereof
     may be formulated as a wound dressing. This includes any covering that can be applied
     to a lesion. This encompasses infected and non-infected abrasions, cuts, bites, bums,
     wounds, ulcers, abscesses, surgical wounds, fungating tumors, and pressure sores. The
25   lesion is preferably external, for example resulting from damage or injury to the skin.
     [00871           The MGO-modified MRJP or fragment, or the MGO-modified MRJP
     or fragment-containing composition may be posited on a surface of a substrate, such as
     a wound dressing substrate. The composition may include water and optionally another
     solvent. For such compositions, the water and optional solvent may be allowed to
30   evaporate. The MGO-modified MRJP or fragment, or the MGO-modified MRJP- or
     fragment-containing composition may be incorporated into a natural or synthetic fiber.
     For example, the polypeptide or peptide may be incorporated on or into fibers used for

   WO 2013/191569                                                           PCT/NZ2013/000110
                                               22
    cloth, synthetic or paper dressings. Paper may be used as part of a temporary wound
    dressing.
    [0088]            The treated substrate may include natural or synthetic materials, and
    implantable devices. The biocompatibility of the substrate may be evaluated by any
 5  suitable methodology known in the art, including one or more viability/cytotoxicity
    assays known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The treated substrate may be in
    contact with an aqueous environment, such as water or the inside of a patient.
    Alternatively, the treated substrate may be contact with air or air and/or air borne
    bacteria in an external environment or an enclosed bodily organ, such as a lung.
10  [0089]            Thus, inflammation in tissue may be reduced by administering one or
    more purified MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments, or a MGO-modified MRJP- or
    fragment-containing composition to inflamed tissue. Inflammation from various
    injuries, infections, and medical diseases may be treated. Included are acute and
    chronic inflammatory diseases as noted above.
15  [00901            Regarding rheumatoid arthritis, it is noted that peptidyl fluoromethyl
    ketones with the amino acid sequence Phe-Ala held constant but with variable N
    terminal groups were effective in inhibiting Cathepsin B activity in vitro and also
    inhibiting the severity of inflammation and the extent of cartilage and bone damage in
    adjuvant-induced arthritis. See Ahmed et al., 1992. It is considered that the MGO
20  modified MRJP peptides or fragments or a MGO-modified MRJP-containing
    composition of the invention can be used in similar treatments for rheumatoid arthritis.
    [0091]            MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments, or a MGO-modified MRJP- or
    fragment-containing composition may reduce inflammation in tissue by reducing the
    rate of phagocytosis by immune cells, and by blocking the mannose receptor or other
25  receptors on immune cells, which trigger phagocytosis. Immune cells include
    macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, and granulocytes.
    [0092]            Phagocytosis is a cellular response or process of engulfing solid
    particles and cellular uptake in the immune system. It is a major mechanism used to
    remove pathogens and cell debris. Bacteria, dead tissue cells, and small mineral
30  particles are all examples of objects that may be phagocytosed or engulfed by a cell.
    Phagocytosis occurs at the beginning of the inflammatory response of leukocytes to a

   WO 2013/191569                                                          PCT/NZ2013/000110
                                              23
    trigger of inflammation. Reactive oxygen species and cytokines are produced by cells
    after phagocytosis to recruit and activate more phagocytes as part of a cascade of
    cellular events which start with phagocytosis. Thus, inhibition of phagocytosis stops
    the inflammatory response at the start of the cascade.
 5  [0093]           MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments, or an MGO-modified MRJP- or
    fragment-containing composition may be administered to inflamed tissue in various
    different forms. The MGO-modified molecule may be purified from other components.
    For administration, it may be desirable to include one or more other types of
    compounds such as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, or other
10  therapeutic molecules. Other anti-inflammatory agents may be used for co
    administration with the MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments, or an MGO-modified
    MRJP- or fragment-containing composition.
    [00941           MGO-modified MRJPs or functional fragments thereof may be isolated
    from active manuka honey, or from manuka honey, or any other type of honey to which
15  MGO or an MGO precursor has been added to modify the apalbumin, or it may be
    purified from royal jelly or a system in which apalbumin is recombinantly expressed
    and then treated with MGO.
    [00951           MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments may be included in a composition
    containing one or more other types of compounds. This includes MGO-modified
20  MRJPs or fragments contained in honey or a honey extract that has been enriched for
    MGO-modified components, and MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments in extracts from
    the recombinant production of an apalbumin or its peptides, and the chemical
    modification of the apalbumin or its peptides with MGO.
    [00961           MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments or an MGO-modified MRJP- or
25  fragment-containing composition may be administered to inflamed tissue in various
    different forms, including but not limited to: creams, lotions, liquid solutions, or
    poultices. MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments may also be administered to inflamed
    tissue as by inclusion of MGO-modified MRJP peptides or fragments in an edible
    product. Such products include but are not limited to beverages, candies, syrups,
30  lozenges, pills, and foods.

   WO 2013/191569                                                          PCT/NZ2013/000110

     Methods of detecting MGO-modified MRJPs or MRJP fragments, and
     characterizing properties of honey
     [00971          The anti-inflammatory capacity of a sample of honey may be
     determined through detection of MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments thereof. The
 5   chemical modification of MRJPs by MGO generates molecules that exhibit Cathepsin
    B inhibition activity. Because MRJPs are present in honey, by measuring the Cathepsin
    B inhibition activity of a sample of honey, a measurement of the relative concentration
    of MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments in the honey sample can be obtained. A
    measurement of the concentration of MGO-modified MRJPs or fragments in a sample
10  of honey directly relates to the anti-inflammatory capacity of the sample of honey.
     [00981          Because high MGO concentration is a feature unique to manuka honey
    among all honey varieties, honey producers may try to simulate active manuka honey
    by adding MGO to samples of honey that do not naturally contain a desired
    concentration of MGO. Consumers prefer naturally occurring honeys over treated
15  honeys. Purified, active MGO is readily available from commercial chemical
    producers (e.g. Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, sells a solution of - 40% methylglyoxal
    in water), and honey producers may add MGO to a sample of honey that does not
    naturally contain a desired concentration of MGO, in order to raise the concentration of
    MGO in the honey sample to a desired level.
20   [00991          In particular aspects, the MGO-modified MRJPs or functional
    fragments thereof are obtained by one or more processes independent from natural
    honey formation. A process independent from natural honey formation includes any
    activity not performed by bees, and it therefore includes activities such as addition of
    purified MGO to a honey sample. A process independent from natural honey formation
25  does not include activities such as bees collecting nectars, pollens, or other plant
    products that contain high levels of MGO or MGO-precursor molecules.
    [001001          The Cathepsin B inhibition activity of honey may also be used to
    determine an appropriate time to harvest honey from a hive or to store harvested honey
    in order to obtain honey with desired anti-inflammatory properties. Because the
30  modification of MRJPs by MGO in honey may occur over a period of time, a honey
    producer may choose to keep honey in the hive until it contains a desired anti
    inflammatory capacity and concentration of MGO-modified MRJPs. By measuring the

   WO 2013/191569                                                          PCT/NZ2013/000110
                                               25
    Cathepsin B inhibition activity of samples of honey from the hive at different time
    intervals, a honey producer can use the measurement of the Cathepsin B inhibition
    activity of the honey as a method for determining the optimal time to harvest honey
    from the hive in order to obtain a honey having desired anti-inflammatory properties in
 5  the honey.
    [00101]          Similarly, a honey producer may also measure the Cathepsin B
    inhibition activity of honey stored outside of the hive, in order to determine if the honey
    sample has a desired level of anti-inflammatory properties. By measuring the
    Cathepsin B inhibition activity of honey samples, a honey producer seeking to obtain a
10  honey sample containing a desired anti-inflammatory capacity can store honey until it
    has developed a desired level of anti-inflammatory capacity by the formation of MGO
    modified MRJPs.
    EXAMPLES
    The examples described herein are provided for the purpose of illustrating specific
15  embodiments of the invention and are not intended to limit the invention in any way.
    Persons of ordinary skill can utilize the disclosures and teachings herein to produce
    other embodiments and variations without undue experimentation. All such
    embodiments and variations are considered to be part of this invention.
    Example 1: Preparation and analysis of MGO-modified MRJP proteins 1 and 3
20  [001021          Royal jelly obtained from Watson & Son/ManukaMed, was dissolved at
    50 mg/mL in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 or in 100 mM disodium hydrogen
    phosphate pH 9.4. The pH value of the final solutions was 3.5-4.0 when PBS was used,
    or pH 7.4 when 100 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate pH 9.4 was used.
    [00103]          The protein solution was mixed for 10 minutes before centrifugation of
25  the solution at 10,000 rpm in SS34 rotor at 4 'C. The supernatant was passed through a
    0.45 micron filter and then further fractionated using ion exchange chromatography and
    heparin SepharoseTM to purify MRJP 1. Alternatively the crude mixture was

     reactions with respect of MGO coupling were performed over the following time
     periods: 1 day, 2 day, 3 day, 4 day, 5 day, 6 days, 7 days, 8 days, 9 days and 14 days.
     [00105]          Analysis of the MGO-modified proteins was performed using native

     absorbance at 330 nm (Arg-MGO adduct formation), size exclusion chromatography
     (SEC) on SephadexTM G75, HiTrapTM desalting column and reactions with

     [001061          SDS PAGE analysis was performed on a Bolt@ 4-12% Bis-Tris Plus
    gel. A 10 well system (BGO4412BOX, Life technologies, NZ) was used in the gel
    electrophoresis analysis of samples following the manufacturer's protocol. 2
    mercaptoethanol (M3148, Sigma Aldrich, NZ) was used as a reducing agent instead of
15  DTT. The protein marker was SeeBlue Plus2 Pre-stained Standard (LC5925, Life
    Technologies, NZ). Further SDS PAGE analysis was performed using NuPAGE@
    Novex@ 4-12% Bis-Tris gels, 1.0 mm, 10 well (NP0321BOX, Life technologies, NZ).
    Gel electrophoresis analysis was carried out for samples dissolved in 6M urea followed
    by manufacturer's protocol. As before, 2-mercaptoethanol (M3148, Sigma Aldrich,
20  NZ) was used as a reducing agent instead of DTT, and the protein marker was SeeBlue
    Plus2 Pre-stained Standard (LC5925, Life Technologies, NZ). This analysis revealed
    the presence of two major royal jelly proteins MRJP1 and MRJP3 (Figures 1A and 1B).
    [00107]           MGO modification reactions were carried out at different pH conditions
    for a total of 9 days, as detailed above. Samples were collected every 24 hours and
25  analyzed on 4-16% Native PAGE          Novex@ Bis-Tris gels 1.0 mm, 15 well
    (BNI004BOX, Life Technologies, NZ) following instructions provided in the manual.
    Typically, 4 ptL of NuPAGETM LDS sample buffer (4X) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad USA
    Cat. No. NP0007) was mixed with 11 1iof protein sample plus 1 ptl of Native PAGETM
    5%G-250 sample additive. Then, 12 jA of this sample mix was loaded into native
30  PAGE gels. Gels were run at 150 V for 120 minutes following manufacturer's
    protocols. Protein bands were visualized after de-staining for 2-4 hours following

    Gel-doc system.
    [001081          The native PAGE results are presented in Figures 2-5. At pH 4.0 but
    not at pH 7.0, the formation of MRJP high molecular weight adducts is seen after 24
 5  hours of MGO treatment (Figure 2, Lane 7). At day 9, it is apparent that the majority of
    the 300 kDa hexamer is the likely source for the higher molecular weight adducts
    (Figure 5, Lane 13).
    [001091          Changes in the lower molecular weight species are less apparent, but it
    is expected that MGO modification on the royalactin monomeric form of MRJP1 has
10  also occurred. It may not be as readily apparent due to preclusion of higher molecular
    weight adducts from the gel. Visible precipitate was observed on the bottom of the
    micro centrifuge tube upon the centrifugation.
    Example 2: Incubation of major royal jelly proteins in the presence of MGO and
    resulting inhibitory activity
15  [001101          After partial thawing, the MRJP mixture was dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4)
    at a concentration of 50 mg/ml. This mixture was stirred for 30 to 60 minutes. The
    resulting cloudy solution was clarified by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 minutes).
    The protein content was determined as 5.0 ± 0.5 mg/ml. The pH of the solution was
    3.8.
20  [001111          For the modification with MGO, 900 pl protein solution was mixed
    with 100 pl aqueous MGO solution (5 %) The 5% MGO stock solution was produced
    by adding 125 iL of 40% MGO to 875 ptL of water. To obtain the final MGO
    concentration of 0.15% reaction, 30 p.L of 5%MGO was added to 970 pL of protein
    solution and incubated at 22*C (set temperature) or allowed to sit out at ambient room
25  temperature (RT) for 1 to 10 days. The set temperature of 22*C was maintained using a
    water bath.
    [001121          After each incubation interval, unreacted MGO was removed on a
    HiTrapTM desalting column (5 ml, GE healthcare). The protein was eluted with PBS
    buffer (25 mM, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Eluting compounds were detected
30  by UV absorbance at 214, 280 and 330 nm. Alternatively, the elution was carried out

   WO 2013/191569                                                         PCT/NZ2013/000110

    in sodium acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 4.0). The chromatography was carried out on an
    Akta-90OTM system (GE-healthcare) under the control of UNICORN software.
    [001131          To test for activity, MGO was removed by passing 500 pl of reaction
    mixture (MRJP + MGO) through a 5 ml HiTrapTM desalting column. 1 ml fractions
 5  were collected and tested in the DCFDA oxidation assay (see Carter WO, Narayanan
    PK, Robinson JP. Intracellular hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion detection in
    endothelial cells. J Leukoc Biol. 1994 Feb;55(2):253-8) and in the Cathepsin B assay
    (see below) to determine for the presence of reactive species as well as Cathepsin B
    inhibitors.
10  [001141          The desalting fractions 1-3 containing the high molecular weight
    proteins were also analyzed for the presence of free amines using TNBS and
    absorbance at 280 and 330 nm determined as well as fluorescence profile. The
    numbers were normalized to protein concentration and difference between the starting
    MRJP and MGO-modified MRJP determined to identify amino acids involved in the
15  activity associated with Cathepsin B inhibition.
    [001151          Activity is observed after overnight treatment under the following
    conditions: 0.5% MGO, room temperature incubation at pH 3.8, with 5 mg/ml MRJP
    (Figure 6A). Such treatment produces the most rapid production of Cathepsin B
    inhibitory activity. Inhibition of Cathepsin B is also found using modification with
20  0.15% MGO and 0.5% MGO at room temperature. See Figure 6B. When the lower
    MGO concentration of 0.15% is used for MRJP modification, activity is only apparent
    after longer incubation periods . The reaction products were separated using GE
    Healthcare desalting column and the high MW fractions that were free of MGO were
    tested for cathepsin B activity. The gel filtration was performed either at pH 7.5 in PBS
25  or at pH 4.5 in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer. Fractionation was performed under
    conditions that corresponded to the conditions used for MGO modification either at pH
    7.5 or at pH 3.5. This is in contrast to the higher MGO concentration. A similar trend
    was observed for pH, whereby acidic pH produced inhibitory activity at a faster rate by
    comparison to pH 7.4. See Figure 6B.

    Example 3: Assay for Cathepsin B activity
    1001161         Cathepsin B was obtained from Sigma (C6286-25UN Cathepsin B from
    bovine spleen). The enzyme was prepared by adding 1 mL of 100 mM sodium acetate
    pH 4.5 containing 2 mM EDTA and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol to the enzyme vial. This
 5  activated the Cathepsin B. For assays, 50 pl of activated Cathepsin B was diluted with
    5 mL of the assay buffer (100 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 containing 2 mM EDTA and
    2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). 50 pl was used per well in a 96 well plate.
    [00117]         Assays were performed in duplicate and repeated in replicates of four
    for active material. To each well of a 96 well plate, 100 pl of assay buffer was added,
10  followed by 50 pl of sample and 50 pl of Cathepsin B (stock 5.25 mg/mL having 12.5
    U/mg) diluted 1:100 to 52.5 pg/mL for use in the assay. Total amount of cathepsin B
    in the assay was 2.625 pg. The plate was allowed to incubate at 37 'C for up to 10
    minutes. However, routine analysis was performed with 2-5 minutes of incubation.
    [00118]         The addition of the substrate was used to initiate the reaction, Na-CBZ
15  L-lysine p-nitrophenyl ester (CLN) (Sigma C 3637) (Z-Lys-pNP). The protocol was
    performed similar to that described by O'Neil et al., 1996. 27 mg of substrate was
    dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO and then 50 pl of the stock substrate solution was mixed
    with 5 mL of assay buffer (100 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 containing 2 mM EDTA
    and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). 50 pl of the substrate was added to each well of a 96
20  well plate. A row of eight wells of the 96 well plate was assayed during each run.
    [001191         The plate was read in a SpectraMax@ M4 plate reader incubated at 37
    'C. The plate was agitated for 10 seconds and for 3 seconds between each read. The
    Vmax rate change in absorbance at 330 nm was read over 2 minutes with 10 s interval
    between reads. A delay of 30 seconds was used for the analysis. The linear portion of
25  the curve was used to calculate the Vmax (milli units/min). The average of duplicate
    readings was performed. Active fractions were tested again to confirm activity.
    Example 4: Identification of amino acid residues involved in Cathepsin B
    inhibition
    [00120]         The following methods were employed to demonstrate which amino
30  acids residues were important for Cathepsin B inhibition. The MRJP were either
    treated with MGO (product 77), acetic anhydride (blocking lysine residues) (product
    83) or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (product 81). These last two samples were then further

                                               30
    treated with MGO (yielding products 89 and 82, respectively). A sample of the
    acetylated MRJP (product 83) was taken and further reacted with NEM (yielding
    product 84). This sample was then further treated with MGO (yielding product 85).
    See reaction schematic in Figure 7.
 5  Modification of MRJP mixture with MGO to give product 77
    [00121]          After partially thawing, the MRJP mixture was dissolved in PBS (pH
    7.4) at a concentration of 50 mg/ml by stirring for 30 to 60 minutes. The resulting
    cloudy solution was clarified by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 minutes). The
    protein content was determined as 5.0 + 0.5 mg/ml. The pH of the solution was 3.8.
10  [00122]          For the modification with MGO, 900 ptl protein solution was mixed
    with 100 ptl aqueous MGO solution (5 %)and incubated at 22*C for 1 to 10 days. The
    temperature was maintained by incubation in a water bath.
    [00123]          After each incubation interval, unreacted MGO was removed on a
    HiTrapTM desalting column (5 ml, GE healthcare). The protein was eluted with PBS
15  buffer (25 mM, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Eluting compounds were detected
    by UV absorbance at 214, 280 and 330 nm. Alternatively, the elution was carried out in
    sodium acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 4.0). The chromatography was carried out on an
    Akta-900TM system (GE-healthcare) under the control of the UNICORN software.
    Modification of MRJP mixture with NEM to give product 81
20  [00124]          The MRJP mixture was dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 9.6)
    at a concentration of 50 mg/ml by stirring for 30 to 60 minutes. The resulting slightly
    cloudy solution was clarified by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 minutes). The
    protein content was determined as 5.0 ± 0.5 mg/ml. The pH of the solution was 7.5.
    [00125]          To 1 ml of the protein solution 53 pl of NEM solution (200 mM in
25  PBS) were added and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour at room temperature.
    Unreacted NEM was removed on a HiTrapTM desalting column (5 ml, GE healthcare).
    The protein was eluted with sodium acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 4.0) at a flow rate of 2
    ml/min. Eluting compounds were detected by UV absorbance at 214, 280 and 330 nm.

    Modification of NEM-treated MRJP with MGO to give product 82
     [001261         Protein containing fraction from the desalting column (fraction 2) was
    modified with MGO as described above. Briefly, 900 il of fraction 2 were reacted with
     100 pl MGO (5 %) at 22*C overnight. Unreacted MGO was removed on a HiTrapTM
 5  desalting column (5 ml, GE healthcare). The protein was eluted with PBS buffer (25
    mM, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Eluting compounds were detected by UV
    absorbance at 214, 280 and 330 nm. Alternatively, the elution was carried out in
    sodium acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 4.0).
    Acetylation of MRJP mixture to give product 83
10  [001271          1.2814 g of defrosted RJP mixture was dissolved in 50 mL of Tris/HCl
    (0.1 M, pH 8.5) containing 6 M urea. The solution was cooled down on an ice water
    bath. Acetic anhydride was added every 20 minutes in aliquots of 0.5 ml over a period
    of 2 hours. The pH of the solution was determined before every addition and adjusted
    to a pH above 7.5 using Tris/HCl buffer (1 M, pH 8.5).
15  [00128]          The sample was transferred to a dialysis tubing (molecular weight cut
    off 10 kDa) and dialysed over night against 1.6 litres of water with three changes of
    dialysate. The content of the dialysis tubing was frozen and freeze dried. 239.9 mg of a
    white slightly sticky material was recovered.
    Modification of acetylated MRJP mixture with NEM to give product 84
20  [001291          The concentrated protein solution (500 pl) was diluted with 500 pl PBS
    (25 mM, pH 7.4), 53 pl of NEM solution (200 mM in PBS) were added and the mixture
    was stirred for 1 hour at room temperature. Unreacted NEM was removed on a
    HiTrapTM desalting column (5 ml, GE healthcare). The protein was eluted with sodium
    acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 4.0) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Eluting compounds were

    Modification of NEM-treated acetylated MRJP with MGO to give product 85
    [001301          Protein containing fraction from the desalting column (fraction 2) was
    modified with MGO as described above. Briefly, 900 p1 of fraction 2 were reacted with
    100 [tl MGO (5 %) at 22 *C overnight. Unreacted MGO was removed on a HiTrapTM
30  desalting column (5 ml, GE healthcare). The protein was eluted with PBS buffer (25

   WO 2013/191569                                                          PCT/NZ2013/000110

    mM, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Eluting compounds were detected by UV
    absorbance at 214, 280 and 330 nm. Alternatively, the elution was carried out in
    sodium acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 4.0).
    Results from NEM, acetylation, and MGO modifications
 5  [001311          The samples after treatment with MGO were desalted with a 5 mL
    HiTrap TM desalting column and fraction 2 containing the high molecular weight
    proteins were analysed for their ability to inhibit Cathepsin B. The assay for Cathepsin
    B activity is detailed further above.
    1001321          MRJP treated with MGO produced inhibitory activity (Figure 8).
10  Inhibitory activity was also observed for the NEM plus MGO treated MRJP sample.
    However, upon acetylating MRJP and treating with MGO (product 89; see schematic in
    Figure 7), all inhibitory activity was lost, providing evidence that MGO modification of
    lysine residues is important for Cathepsin B inhibitory activity (Figure 8). After
    acetylation of the lysine residues of MRJP, the proteins appeared to stimulate rather
15  than inhibit Cathepsin B activity (Figure 8).
    [001331          It is noted that NEM is also a cysteine protease inhibitor. Our results
    showed that NEM modification followed by MGO modification produced greater
    inhibition of Cathepsin B. This was attributed to residual NEM remaining in the
    samples of MGO-modified protein, allowing the NEM to act in combination with the
20  MGO-modified protein and to further inhibit Cathepsin B activity.
    [00134]          Thus, in summary, MGO reaction with MRJP produces a Cathepsin B
    inhibitor. Blocking thiol groups with NEM followed by MGO treatment also produces
    an active inhibitor of Cathepsin B. Acetylation of MRJP followed by reaction with
    MGO prevented the production of the Cathepsin B inhibitory activity. Acetylation
25  followed by NEM treatment to block both lysine and cysteine residues on MRJPs
    followed by MGO treatment also failed to produce an active Cathepsin B inhibitor.
    [001351          It has been demonstrated in PCT/NZ/2011/000271 that acetylation
    selectively blocks lysine residues. As noted above, the acetylated MRJP sample was
    found to lack activity after addition of MGO. This indicated that the MGO
30  modification of lysine residues is important for the functional activity seen by modified

   WO 2013/191569                                                          PCT/NZ2013/000110

    MRJP in relation to the formation of a reactive form of MGO on the surface of the
    protein.
     [001361         To confirm these results, another sample prepared in an identical
    fashion was tested for its ability to inhibit Cathepsin B. The acetylated proteins from
 5  royal jelly were unable to inhibit Cathepsin B, even after optimal MGO treatment, i.e.,
    0.5% MGO at pH 3.5, 22 *C overnight. The speed by which this could be done making
    it preferred over the other methods outlined in Figure 6B which took from 3-7 days to
    generate similar levels of cathepsin B inhibitory activity. It was concluded that MGO
    modification of lysine is a key factor in Cathepsin B inhibitory activity.
10  Example 5: Cathepsin B digestion of MGO-modified MRJP
    [00137]          Cathepsin B working reagent solution was prepared (1:50) from
    Cathepsin B stock solution in the buffer system containing 100 mM sodium acetate, 2
    mM EDTA and 2.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 5.0.
    [001381          Cathepsin digestion was performed on selected samples of SEC
15  fractions. Typically, 10 pl of Cathepsin B working solution was mixed with 20 pl of
    protein sample and digested at 37 C for overnight. After hydrolysis, the digests were
    prepared for native PAGE analysis. The gel was stained with Coomassie@ G250 as
    shown in Figure 9, see Lanes 7-10.
    [00139]          Samples used in the Cathepsin B digestion were: 1) Crude MRJP
20  protein; 2) Desalted fraction (first big peak) of MGO-modified MRJP at pH 4.0 for 9
    days sample; 3) Desalted fraction (first big peak) of MGO-modified MRJP in PBS (pH
    7.5) for 9 days sample; 4) SEC fractions of pH 5.0 fractions; 5) SEC fractions of
    reaction 221.
    [001401         Results are depicted in Figure 9. Lane 1 shows native PAGE molecular
25  weight markers, Lane 7 shows the undigested MGO-modified MRJP at pH 4.0, Lane 8
    shows the Cathepsin B digested MGO-modified MRJP at pH 4.0, Lane 9 shows
    undigested MGO-modified MRJP at pH 7.0, and Lane 10 shows Cathepsin B digested
    MGO-modified MRJP at pH 7.0.

30  adducts (>480 kDa) of MRJPs are formed (see Figure 9, Lane 7 and Figure 2, Lane 5).

    These bands are not evident when the MGO modification is performed at pH 7.0 (see
    Figure 9, Lanes 9-10). Thus, Cathepsin B is unable to hydrolyze the protein at pH 7.0
    but was able to hydrolyze the lower molecular weight species produced at pH 4.0. The
    higher molecular weight species at pH 4.0 appeared to be more resistant to proteolysis
 5  than the lower molecular weight species. However, the species produced by MGO
    modification of the MRJP at pH 7.0 appeared also to be resistant to hydrolysis.
     100142]         Without wishing to be limited by theory, the inability of Cathepsin B to
    hydrolyze MRJP is proposed to be due to inhibition of this enzyme. We refer to Figure
    9. In contrast, the native hexamer form of MRJP1 and the monomeric form of
10  royalactin were readily degraded by this enzyme (data not shown).
    [00143]          Notably, the level of protein loaded in the gel varied where 25% less
    protein was loaded for the hydrolyzed samples. For hydrolysis, 10 pL of a 1 mg/mL
    solution (10 ptg) of Cathepsin B was used. Thus, a very high level of enzyme activity
    was employed for these experiments. Moreover, the reaction was performed over two
15  days at 37*C. Under these conditions, we expected to see complete or near complete
    hydrolysis of the MRJP proteins.
    [001441          As Cathepsin B has an exopeptidase activity at pH 4.0, it was expected
    that dipeptides would be generated from the hydrolysis that cannot be seen by native
    PAGE analysis. The incomplete hydrolysis we observed suggests that some Cathepsin
20  B inhibition occurred, and/or the length of time and concentration of Cathepsin B was
    higher than the inhibitory activity of the MGO-modified MRJP proteins. This may
    have allowed partial hydrolysis of the 58 kDa protein (MRJP1) and the band present
    around 242 kDa.
    [001451          By comparison, the larger cross-linked complexes did not appear to be
25  susceptible to Cathepsin B cleavage at pH 4.0. Cross-linking of proteins with MGO
    occurs between lysine residues or lysine and Arg residues. At pH 7.0, the hydrolysis of
    the oligomeric complex of MRJP proteins was not hydrolyzed by Cathepsin B. This
    was attributed to the substrate specificity of Cathepsin B at this pH being limited to
    cleavage at Arg-Arg IXaa sequences within the MRJP proteins, i.e., endopeptidase
30  activity.

   WO 2013/191569                                                           PCT/NZ2013/000110

    [001461          Yet, this site within MRJPs does not appear to be available for
    cleavage. The protein level observed on the gel after substantial hydrolysis with
    Cathepsin B is essentially the same as that observed without the addition of Cathepsin
    B. It is possible that Cathepsin B was completely inhibited under these conditions.
 5  MGO modification of Arg residues is also likely. This would prevent recognition of
    the MRJP cleavage site for Cathepsin B at pH 7.0. It is also possible that the native gel
    electrophoresis failed to separate the protein fragments sufficiently.
    Example 6: Proposed mechanism of Cathepsin B inhibition
    [00147]          Cathepsin B is a thiol protease that participates in intracellular
10  degradation and turnover of proteins. It is an important enzyme in the phagocytosis
    process and it has also been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis.
    1001481          The primary specificity of Cathepsin B is for cleavage sites Arg-Arg-
    Xaa (where I indicates the point of cleavage). The MRJPs would be predicted to be
    suitable substrates for this enzyme due to the presence of an Arg-Arg peptide sequence
15  in MRJP 1-5. However, the significance of this cleavage site has been questioned by
    our results. In particular, MGO-modified bovine serine albumin that has the same Arg
    Arg peptide sequence shows no anti-inflammatory activity, in contrast to the MGO
    modified MRJP1 and MRJP3 proteins (results not shown). The results indicate that
    Arg-Arg cleavage may only be relevant for plasma membrane bound Cathepsin B at
20  optimal conditions of pH 7 (data not shown).
    [001491          Cathepsin B also has some C-terminal dipeptidase activity (Br6mme et
    al., 1987 and Chapman et al., 1994). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is
    proposed that the C-terminal peptide regions of MGO-modified MRJPI and MGO
    modified MRJP3 are inhibiting the activity of Cathepsin B. It is proposed that the
25  MGO-modified lysine, which can be involved in thiol lysine cross-links, is in close
    proximity to the thiol active site of Cathepsin B. In this way, the MGO on the lysine is
    reacting with the thiol active site of Cathepsin B, and inhibiting its action.
    [001501          Notably, MRJP1 has a lysine (see SEQ ID NO: 1 at 427) that is 3
    cleavage sites from the C-terminus end. MRJP3 has a lysine residue at the first
30  cleavage site at 542 (see SEQ ID NO: 3). Similarly, MRJP2 has a lysine residue at the
    fourth cleavage site at 445 (see SEQ ID NO: 2) and MRJP 4 has a lysine residue at the

   WO 2013/191569                                                          PCT/NZ2013/000110
                                              36
    fifth cleavage site at 455 (see SEQ ID NO: 4). MRJP 5 has a lysine residue at the
    second cleavage site at 595 (SEQ ID NO: 5). MRJP6 has a lysine residue at the 3rd
    cleavage site at 431 (see SEQ ID NO: 6). MRJP8 has a lysine at the 4th cleavage site at
    409 (see SEQ ID NO: 8) and MRJP 9 has a lysine at the fourth cleavage site at 415 (see
 5  SEQ ID NO: 9).
    [001511          Bovine serum albumin does not have a lysine at the C-terminus until the
    fifth cleavage point of Cathepsin B. In this way, the lysine residue in MGO-modified
    BSA may be too far away to inhibit Cathepsin B. Moreover, the lysine residue at 573
    in BSA is involved in an alpha helical structure and not readily available for cleavage
10  by Cathepsin B. It is therefore postulated that the inhibitory activity of MGO-modified
    MRJP 1 and MRJP3 is seen because of the relatively close proximity of the lysine to the
    C-terminus end of the peptide. It is anticipated also that MGO-modified MRJP2,
    MRJP4, MRJP5, MRJP6, MRJP8, and MRJP9 will also show Cathepsin B inhibitory
    activity.
15  [001521          The presence of a reactive MGO species on the surface of the protein
    was also detected using DCFDA oxidation to fluorescein (data not shown). The
    reaction of hydrogen peroxide with MGO led to a reaction in the level of DCFDA
    oxidized and therefore leads to a reduction in the level of fluorescence detected (data
    not shown). Isolation of high molecular weight proteins using gel filtration or
20  HiTrapTM desalting led to the identification of a highly reactive species on the surface
    of the protein. This species as seen by DCFDA analysis correlates to the Cathepsin B
    inhibitory activity (data not shown).
    [001531          It is known that the Arg-MGO adduct formation is favored under lower
    MGO concentrations and this leads to an irreversible adduct that can be detected with
25  absorbance at 330 nm or fluorescence Ex330nm and Em4l0nm. The reaction with Cys
    residues forms a hemiacetyl that is reversible and unstable leading to release of MGO
    off the surface of the protein. The reaction with lysine can form both reversible and
    irreversible reactions with MGO.
    [001541          The initial adduct formed is slowly rearranged to form a stabilized
30  covalently linked MGO attached to the epsilon amino group of lysine. Further
    rearrangements can occur, leading to the generation of various chemical functionality
    including N(E)-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL) acid group, hydroxyl group, aldehyde or

   WO 2013/191569                                                         PCT/NZ2013/000110
                                                37
    ketone functionality as well as the irreversible reactions with other protein to form
    cross-links.
     [001551         MGO modification can lead to reactive species such as aldehydes
    bound to the protein, and aldehydes can react with the thiol of the Cathepsin B active
 5  site. From this, it is possible that inhibition of Cathepsin B may occur between MGO
    modified lysine residues with an aldehyde functionality. Lysines are also of interest in
    Cathepsin B inhibition, as bound MGO can undergo a cannizzaro rearrangement
    forming CEL and a hydroxyl group, which has carboxylic acid functionality. Two
    aldehydes react, where one aldehyde is reduced to a corresponding alcohol, while the
10  second aldehyde is oxidized to carboxylic acid.
    [001561          At pH 4.0, Cathepsin B has a C-terminal exodipeptidase activity. It is
    hypothesized that the acid functionality present in the CEL, carboxylic acid moiety may
    be recognized by Cathepsin B as a C-terminus. This would place the peptide in an
    orientation that prevents cleavage. Both structures are potentially formed by MGO
15  upon reaction with lysine. Various reaction pathways are likely to be favored under
    various conditions.
    [001571          The chemical reactivity of MGO under acidic conditions, as present in
    Manuka honey, appears to enable formation of high molecular weight cross-links. This
    would appear to favor aldehyde formation, which, in turn, continues to react to form
20  protein cross-links. The cannizzaro rearrangement is favored under basic conditions,
    which is more likely to occur when MRJP proteins are reacted at neutral pH 7.0. The
    cannizzaro rearrangement prevents further cross-linking between proteins. The
    aldehyde functional group that is involved in cross-linking is replaced with an acid
    group and a hydroxyl group. The hydroxyl provides further diversification of the
25  chemistry on the surface of lysine residues after MGO modification and this can
    provide changes in inhibitory selectivity and affinity.
    [00158]          As noted above, we observed that blocking lysine residues with acetic
    anhydride followed by MGO-modification blocks Cathepsin B inhibition. This
    highlights the importance of lysines in producing inhibitory activity. The reaction of
30  lysine epsilon amino groups with acetic anhydride produces an amide bond. This
    removes the features required for recognition by the C-terminal exopeptidase activity of
    Cathepsin B. This, in turn, abolishes enzyme interaction and inhibition.

    [00159]         Thirty-seven synthetic peptides were supplied by Mimotopes Pty Ltd
    (Melbourne, Australia). The structures were based on peptide sequences in MRJP 1-5.
    Particular focus was placed on the C-terminus of these proteins.
 5  [00160]         MGO modification was performed as follows. The incubation mixture
    included 180 pd peptide solution (5 mM) and 20 pil MGO solution (5%). Incubation
    was carried out overnight at room temperature. MGO was removed using C18 SPE
    cartridges. Eluted peptides were concentrated and solutions made up to original
    concentration.

    solutions containing 2 mM of unmodified or modified peptide according to the

     [00168]         The results show that both C-terminal and internal peptides can provide
    inhibition of Cathepsin B after modification of lysine with MGO. The peptide
    analogue LIR (SEQ ID NO: 51) has particularly potent activity.
 5   [00169]         The presence of endogenous protease activity in honey has been
    determined previously ((Larocca et al., 2012)), and we demonstrate that this protease
    leads to degradation of MRJP proteins in the presence of urea. The release of peptides
    from MRJP proteins is therefore expected during prolonged incubation of Manuka
    honey leading to release of MGO-modified peptides that have enhanced Cathepsin B
10  inhibition.
     [001701         Certain peptides show stimulatory activity in the absence of MGO
    treatment. This activation is in most cases lost after treatment with MGO. In some
    cases, longer peptides are more active. For specific peptides, the lysine is positioned at
    least 3 amino acid away from the C-terminal amino acid, and no more than 6 amino
15  acids away from the C-terminal amino acid. For inhibition, a free C-terminus is
    typically present. This allows a favorable interaction with Cathepsin B and potentially
    increased inhibition.
    [00171]          For the assayed peptides, an acid functional end is more likely to
    produce increased activity as compared to an amidated end. This is consistent with
20  internal protease digestion having the specificity similar to that of pancreatic trypsin,
    i.e., cleavage C-terminal to arginine and lysine residues, as long as the following amino
    acid is not proline. The preference for a C-terminal carboxylate group is
    understandable in context of the structure of Cathepsin B and its exopeptidase activity
    that acts on a C-terminal end.
25  [001721          Notably, the occlusive loop of Cathepsin B contains two histidine
    residues that are believed to coordinate to the C-terminus of the peptide. See, e.g.,

    structure of human liver cathepsin B: the structural basis for its specificity. EMBO J.
30  10: 2321-2330. This positions the peptide bond between amino acid 2 and 3 up from
    the C-terminus of the peptide. In addition, the orientation of peptides with respect to

    Cathepsin B may be inverted 180' if the primary amine or epsilon amino group of
    lysine has reacted with MGO. As noted above, this can undergo a cannizzaro
    rearrangement to produce CEL. This may also occur on the side chain epsilon amino
    group of lysine.
 5  [001731          Regarding the FAK peptide analogue (SEQ ID NO: 100), this showed
    limited inhibitory activity with the C-terminus containing paranitroanilide (pNA). It
    was postulated that this could block recognition of the peptide by Cathepsin B. To test
    this, the pNA group was removed under basic conditions in the presence of NaOH. The
    peptide was reassessed for activity before and after MGO-modification (data not
10  shown). Inhibitory activity was still not observed, suggesting that the position of lysine
    within the peptide sequence can affect activity. From this, it is concluded that it may be
    beneficial to position the lysine such that it sits closer to the active site of Cathepsin B.
