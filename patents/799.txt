                                                               FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to a method of treating pre-term labour with retosiban in
subjects with conditions resulting in uterine overdistension including polyhydroamnios and
multiple gestation. In another aspect, the invention relates to a method of preventing pre
term labour in subjects by the prophylactic administration of retosiban.
                                                       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The process of human parturition or birth involves a number of distinct physiological changes.
This includes strong co-ordinated contraction of the myometrium and dilation of the cervix. In
addition, the chorioamniotic membranes surrounding the foetus must separate from the
decidua (the lining of the uterus) to permit post partum expulsion of the membranes. Unlike
certain other mammals where labour is triggered by withdrawal of progesterone, in humans
there would appear to be no single trigger of all these events. Instead it has been postulated
that a "modular accumulation of physiological systems" must occurfor labour and delivery to
occur, namely (1) activation of the myometrium such that it is capable of responding to
contractile stimuli in a co-ordinated manner, (2) a change in the mechanical properties of the
cervix such that it is capable of being dilated following uterine contraction (this is typically
termed "cervical ripening") and (3) biochemical changes to the chorioamniotic membranes
(Mitchell and Taggart, Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol, 2009, 297: R525-R545).
Once all of these systems are in place, contractions of the smooth muscle cells of the
myometrium will be capable of dilating the uterus and expelling the foetus and foetal tissues
(placenta/membranes). The mechanism of smooth muscle contraction has been extensively
studied and involves filaments of myosin moving relative to filaments of actin (this is termed
the "sliding filament model") that ultimately results in a shortening (or contraction) of the cell.
The relative movement is accomplished by conformation changes that accompany
phosphorylation

 (and ADP binding) and dephosphorylation (and ATP binding) of the
 myosin regulatory light chain. Regulation of muscle contraction is
 achieved by regulation of the enzymes that phosphorylate (myosin light
 chain kinase or MLCK) and dephosphorylate (myosin light chain
 phosphatase or MLCP) the myosin regulatory light chain. Regulation of
 MLCK is achieved by regulation of the level of intracellular Ca 2 +. A
 notable property of the smooth muscle cells in the myometrium is that
 they have unstable membrane potentials that periodically result in influx
 of extracellular Ca 2 + through ion channels. This results in elevated
 intracellular Ca 2 + levels that are required for contraction (Mitchell and
 Taggart, supra).
 It will also be appreciated that intracellular Ca 2 + is a second messenger
 in a very large number of signalling pathways. Pathways that elevate
 levels of intracellular Ca 2 + (either through receptor operated Ca 2 + entry
 through the plasma membrane or through Ca 2 + release from the
 sarcoplasmic reticulum) may thus lead to augmentation of contraction. A
 number of G protein coupled receptors have been postulated to be
 involved in augmenting intracellular Ca 2 + levels during labour including
 the receptors for OT (oxytocin - note that synthetic oxytocin is frequently
 used during labour to increase the frequency and intensity of
 contractions), ET-1 (endothelin-1) and certain prostaglandins including
 PGF-2a and PGFH2 (prostaglandin F2a and prostaglandin H2; Mitchell
 and Taggart, supra). It is entirely conceivable that numerous other
 signalling pathways may be involved in augmenting intracellular Ca 2 +
 levels in uterine smooth muscle cells during labour in a similar manner.
 Signalling pathways that result in inhibition of MLCP leads to a
 prolongation of the phosphorylated form of the myosin regulatory light
 chain (the contractile form) and hence result in enhanced myometrial
 contractility. There is some evidence to suggest that pathways that
 elevate levels of the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) indirectly
 inhibit MLCP (Mitchell and Taggart, supra). In addition, there is some
 evidence to suggest that signalling pathways that elevate levels of ROK
 (rho associated kinase) result in inhibition of MLCP and hence enhanced
                                                2

WO 2015/192878                                                        PCT/EP2014/062602
 myometrial contractility (Mitchell and Taggart, supra).
 In addition to regulatory pathways resulting in myometrial contractility, relaxation
 pathways also exist. Phosphorylation of MLCK inhibits phosphorylation of the
 myosin regulatory light chain resulting in uterine relaxation. Signalling pathways
 that elevate intracellular cAMP or cGMP result in phosphorylation of MLCK and
 hence uterine relaxation. These include the P2- adrenergic pathway, the PG12
 (prostaglandin 12, also known as prostacyclin) pathway and the nitric oxide (NO)
 pathway (Mitchell and Taggart, supra).
 It will be apparent that, for such signalling pathways to be effective in regulating
 myometrial contractility, the necessary ligands, receptors and machinery capable
 of transducing the signals generated on ligand binding must be present in the
 smooth muscle cells. Several studies have shown that the complement of
 signalling molecules in the myometrium changes as pregnancy progresses,
 although there is frequent disagreement on the nature of the changes of particular
 proteins (Mitchell and Taggart, supra). For example, some studies show that
 concentrations of the oxytocin receptor in the myometrium increase before labour
 onset, but this is not found in other studies. Microarray techniques have been
 used to assess changes in gene expression at parturition. These studies have
 shown significant changes in the expression of genes associated with the immune
 system and in a variety of signalling pathways (Mitchell and Taggart, supra). It
 thus seems plausible that the balance between contractile and relaxation
 signalling pathways is, at least in part, regulated by the protein content of the cell.
 In other words, there may be a shift in the protein content of the myometrium to
 favour relaxation pathways during early gestation, but to favour contractile
 pathways at term. How these changes in levels of gene expression are regulated
 is unknown, but it is noted that progesterone is believed to increase expression of
 genes associated with uterine relaxation and suppress genes associated with
 uterine activation and some investigators have proposed that there is a "functional"
 progesterone withdrawal prior to the initiation of labour in which the concentration
 of progesterone in the myometrium is reduced despite elevated levels in maternal
 plasma (several mechanisms have been proposed that would be capable
 achieving this, although there is little evidence supporting any particular
 mechanism at the present time, see Mitchell and Taggart, supra).

WO 2015/192878                                                            PCT/EP2014/062602
  For a successful delivery, it is not sufficient that individual smooth muscle cells
  have the appropriate transduction machinery to enable it to respond to contractile
 signals. It is also necessary that the myometrium as a whole is capable of co
 ordinated contraction. This would appear to be regulated at least in part by
  prostaglandins, the levels of which increase prior to the onset of labour or during
 early labour. Prostaglandins stimulate myometrial gap junction formation that
 enables rapid and efficient spread of electrical impulses throughout the uterine
  muscle. It will be appreciated that, in addition to stimulating myometrial gap
 junction formation, prostaglandins are also capable of augmenting intracellular
 Ca 2 levels, promoting myometrial contraction. This may help to co-ordinate the
 various changes required for myometrial activation.
 The second physiological change that must occur for successful delivery is
 cervical ripening. During most of pregnancy, the cervix is a rigid organ that helps
 to support the weight of the growing foetus. Its rigidity is due to its high content of
 collagen and other structural molecules (e.g. proteoglycans), as well as to the
 selection of rigid forms of these structural molecules (e.g. the proteoaminoglycan
 decorin- PGS2- which covers the surface of collagen bundles stabilising them
 and promoting the formation of thicker bundles of fibres; Romero et al., Ann N Y
 Acad Sci, 1994, 734:414-429). Cervical ripening appears to result from a decrease
  in total collagen content, a change in the nature of the collagen and other
 structural molecules present (e.g. PGS2 is replaced with PGS1 that has no affinity
 for collagen, resulting in disorganised collagen fibrils with little rigidity) and an
  increase in collagenolytic activity (Romero et al., supra). Cervical ripening is known
 to be accompanied by an influx of pro-inflammatory cells, particularly neutrophils into
 the cervix. It is believed that these cells secrete matrix metalloproteinases that
  breakdown the collagen matrix as well as cytokines and other mediators such as
  prostaglandins that have an effect on extracellular matrix metabolism (Romero et al.,
 supra). In this regard, it is noted that prostaglandins are used clinically to induce
 cervical ripening prior to induction of labour or abortion (Romero et al., supra). In
 addition, there is evidence for a potential role for estrogen (IV administration of
  17p estradiol induces cervical ripening and estrogen is known to stimulate
 collagen degradation in vitro; Romero et al., supra) and anti-progestins are also
  used clinically for cervical ripening (progesterone has been shown to block
                                               4

WO 2015/192878                                                          PCT/EP2014/062602
 estrogen induces collagenolysis in vitro; Romero et al., supra). As mentioned
 above, it has been proposed that there is a functional progesterone withdrawal
 prior to the initiation of labour, and if this occurs, this would remove a signalling
 pathway that has a negative effect on cervical ripening and may provide some
 mechanism to co-ordinate myometrial activation and cervical ripening.
 The final physiological change required for successful delivery is the separation of
 the chorioamniotic membrane from the decidua. Whilst it isknown that this is
 achieved by dissolving the fibronectin cement linking the maternal and foetal
 tissues, little is known about the regulation of this process (Romero et al., supra).
 It follows from the above that labour will take place once the myometrium is activated
 to respond to contractile stimuli in a co-ordinated manner, and once the changes
 resulting in cervical ripening and separation of foetal and maternal membranes have
 been initiated. Although there are a few instances (highlighted above) where the
 same signals are involved in activating the separate physiological systems required
 for labour, it is not clear how much overlap or coordination exists between the
 mechanisms governing each physiological system.
 Of course, the motivation for understanding the regulation of parturition relates to the
 serious clinical consequences associated with being born too early. Pre-term births
 (deliveries that occur at less than 37 weeks gestation) account for 75% of neonatal
 mortality and more than half the long term morbidity. Although most pre-term babies
 survive, they are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairments and
 respiratory and gastrointestinal complications (Goldenberg et al., Lancet, 2008, 371:
 75-84).
 Although most instances of pre-term labour appear to be spontaneous, pre-term
 labour is associated with a number of risk factors (several of which may be present in
 a single subject). These include intra-uterine infection or inflammation, precocious
 foetal endocrine activation, short cervix, maternal history of pre-term
 delivery, decidual haemorrhage, excessive myometrial and foetal membrane
 overdistension (caused by multiple gestation or polyhydroamnios - note that stretch
 of the uterus is hypothesised to have a role in labour induction at term) and stress
 (Goldenberg et al., supra). Intra-uterine infection triggers a number of signaling
 pathways. For example, microorganisms are recognized by receptors that elicit
 release of cytokines which in turn stimulate the production of prostaglandins, other
                                                5

WO 2015/192878                                                         PCT/EP2014/062602
 inflammatory mediators and matrix degrading enzymes (Goldenberg et al., supra).
 Microbial endotoxins are also known to stimulate the production of prostaglandins
 (Goldenberg et al., supra). As outlined above, prostaglandins are known to be
 involved in myometrial contraction and cervical ripening. Inflammation is also
 associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, IL-1P (interleukin 1P), IL6
 (interleukin 6) and TNFa (tumor necrosis factor a) which are believed to initiate
 signalling pathways that activate the necessary physiological systems for labour. The
 link between uterine stretch and labour induction will be discussed later. The
 signalling pathways linking the remaining risk factors and the required physiological
 systems is not clear.
 Since the majority of cases of pre-term labour are spontaneous and because it is not
 known how most of the risk factors for pre-term labour activate the physiological
 systems required for labour, therapeutic interventions for pre-term labour rely on
 inhibiting uterine contractions or promoting uterine relaxation by modulating the
 signalling pathways that regulate the activity of MLCK and MLCP (see above; Simhan
 and Caritis, N Engl J Med, 2007, 357(5): 477-487). Drugs that inhibit uterine
 contractions/promote uterine relaxation are known as tocolytics. Drugs currently
 used as tocolytics have a responder rate of less than 50%. Further, the responder
 rate to tocolytics is somewhat misleadingly high since it includes cases of "false"
 labour - which resolves spontaneously without intervention - which is difficult to
 distinguish from pre-term labour based on clinical impression alone. It follows that, in
 the majority of cases, tocolytic therapy is not capable of stopping uterine contractions
 or interrupting the labour process. This is probably because, in these patients, the
 preponderance of active signalling pathways regulating MLCK and MLCP promote
 contraction.
 Those patients that respond to the drugs used as tocolytics typically have their
 pregnancies maintained for a relatively short period (24 - 48 hours; Simhan and
 Caritis, supra), although the Cochrane review for nifedipine indicates that it
 significantly delays delivery when assessed at 7 days. The short duration of
 action of most tocolytics suggests that there is no change to the underlying
 status of the myometrium such that labour (re-)initiates following withdrawal of
 therapy. Nonetheless, this short period tocolysis is considered important since it
 permits the patient to be moved to a tertiary care centre which can provide the
 best care for the mother and baby (although there are no studies supporting this
 hypothesis). It also may allow time for the administration and therapeutic effect

 Retosiban ((3R,6R)-3-(2,3-dihydro-1 H-inden-2-yl)-1-[( 1R)-1-(2-methyl- 1,3-oxazol
 4-yl)-2- (morpholin-4-yl}-2-oxoethyl]-6-[( 1S)-1-methylpropyl]-2,5-piperazinedione) is a
 compound capable of binding to the oxytocin receptor (W02005/000840). It is in
 clinical development for the acute treatment of pre-term labour in singleton
 pregnancies. In a phase || clinical study, retosiban had a responder rate slightly
 higher than other tocolytics (the response rate or percentage of women achieving
 uterine quiescence (54 contractions/h with no change in cervical dilation >1 cm at 5-6
 h) was 50-57%, depending upon route of administration/dose; see http;/www.gsk
 clinica studyregister~com/studyOTA105256#rs).      In this same study, it was shown that
 retosiban increased days to delivery by a mean of 8.2 days relative to placebo
 (Snidow et al., Am J Obstet Gynecol., 2013, 2: S155).
 True responders in this study (i.e. responders in the study excluding those in false
 labour - see above) presumably represent those subjects where the contractile
 stimulus promoting labour was primarily mediated by the oxytocin pathway (such that
 inhibiting this pathway puts the myometrium into a state where relaxation pathways
 are favoured). This is evidence that the oxytocin pathway is activated in some
 women in pre-term labour. However, what triggers this pathway in these women is
 usually unclear.
 As mentioned above, pre-term labour is associated with uterine overdistension
 caused by multiple gestation or polyhydroamnios. Since it is also believed that
 stretch may play a role in the normal initiation of labour at term, it is possible that
 this simply reflects early induction of this pathway in subjects having uterine
 over-distension.
 Stretching myometrial strips has been demonstrated to increase their contractile
 response to KCI (which causes contraction by depolarization of the uterine
 smooth muscle cells, and by opening of voltage sensitive channels leading to an
 increase in intracellular Ca 2 +) and oxytocin (which increases intracellular Ca 2 +
 levels as discussed above and also activates plasma membrane Ca 2 + channels;
 Tattersall et al., Reprod Sci, 2010, 17(3 Suppl): 85A). This suggests that stretch
 may play a role in myometrial activation (one of the physiological changes
 required for the initiation of labour).  Microarray techniques have been used to
                                               7

WO 2015/192878                                                           PCT/EP2014/062602
 identify transcripts whose levels in myometrial strips are significantly different
 when incubated in high and low stretch conditions. A large number of rather
 diverse transcripts (e.g. gastrin releasing peptide) were identified (Tattersall et
 al., J Physiol., 2012, 590(9): 2081-2093). The pathway by which these gene
 products are regulated is not known, nor indeed is it known if there is a single or
 several signalling pathways involved in regulating of all the gene products
 identified. One noteable gene product that did not appear to be differentially
 regulated is the oxytocin receptor. A large number of studies show that levels of
 the oxytocin receptor are increased during labour, although there are conflicting
 findings about the precise timing of this increase with some studies suggesting
 that the increase occurs in late gestation and other studies suggesting that this
 occurs at the onset of labour (Terzidou et al., J Clin Endocrin Metab, 2005,
 90(1):237-246). If the former explanation is true, then it is possible that the non
 identification of the oxytocin receptor as being regulated by stretch could simply
 be attributed to the fact that it was already elevated in the tissues concerned
 (which were obtained from pregnant woman undergoing elective caesarean
 section at term, where levels of the oxytocin receptor were initially high). Of
 course, if this is the case, it seems clear that the increase in oxytocin receptor,
 whilst possibly triggered by stretch (there is some evidence that stretch activated
 focal adhesion proteins might be involved in activation of MAPK signalling
 cascades which result in an increase in the binding of C-EBP to sites in the
 oxytocin receptor promoter; Li et al., PLoS ONE, 2009, 4(1): e7489), cannot
 alone be responsible for labour induction (since high levels are present before
 labour is initiated). It may simply represent one change involved in myometrial
 activation (the biochemical changes that take place to permit the myometrium to
 respond to contractile stimuli). Even supposing that the upregulation of the
 oxytocin receptor was directly in the pathway transducing the initiation of labour,
 it would seem logical that its ligand, oxytocin, would also need to be present.
 There is no evidence suggesting that oxytocin levels are regulated by stretch.
 There are isolated reports of atosiban (an oxytocin antagonist) being used
 successfully to treat pre-term labour in twin pregnancies. However, to the best of
 our knowledge, no placebo controlled clinical trials have been conducted to
 investigate the effect of oxytocin ligands in subjects with multiple gestations or
 polyhydroamnios (in retosiban clinical trials conducted to date, such subjects
                                               8

WO 2015/192878                                                           PCT/EP2014/062602
 were excluded).
 One study compared the contractile properties of myometrium obtained from the
 uterus of women with singleton and twin pregnancies during elective caesarian
 section (Turton et al., PLoS ONE; 8 (5): e63800). This study showed that
 myometrial contractile activity in response to oxytocin was shown to correlate
 with neonatal birth weight (the birth weight of twins was combined), a marker of
 uterine stretch. Whilst this would appear to suggest a role for the oxytocin
 pathway in pre-term labour associated with uterine overdistension, the very same
 study shows no significant differences in contractile activity in response to
 oxytocin in myometrium derived from a pre-term twin pregnancy compared to
 myometrium derived from a pre-term singleton pregnancy.
 Accordingly, it is not clear whether inhibition of the oxytocin pathway would be
 effective in treating pre-term labour in women with uterine overdistension.
 In this regard, it is noted that the fact that oxytocin antagonists are effective in
 treating pre-term labour in a proportion of females with singleton pregnancies
 cannot be used to predict efficacy in treating pre-term labour in subjects with a
 multiple gestation. This is because it is known that therapies effective in
 preventing pre-term labour in singleton pregnancies are not always effective in
 preventing pre-term labour in multiple gestations. For example, in clinical studies
 addressing the role of progesterone supplementation in preventing pre-term
 delivery it was found that daily administration of vaginal progesterone reduced
 by more than 40% the frequency of birth before 34 weeks of gestation among
 asymptomatic women with a short cervix (a risk factor for pre-term labour) that
 were pregnant with a single foetus (Fonseca et al., N Engl J Med, 2007, 357:
 462-469). By contrast, other studies shows no reduction in the frequency of
 pre-term birth following prophylactic administration of intramuscular 17-a
 hydroxyprogesterone caproate in women pregnant with twins (Rouse et al., N
 Engl J Med, 2007, 357: 454-461) or following prophylactic administration of
 vaginal progesterone gel in women pregnant with twins (Norman et al., Lancet,
 2009, 373(9680): 2034-2040). Further, cerclage (placing a stitch in the cervix)
 has been shown to be beneficial in singleton pregnancies where the mother has
 a short cervix and prior pre-term birth (both risk factors for pre-term labour) but
                                                 9

WO 2015/192878                                                         PCT/EP2014/062602
 not to be beneficial in multiple pregnancies where the mother has a short cervix
 (Berghella et al., Obstet Gynecol, 2005, 106(1): 181-189).
 These differences in response to prophylactic therapies aimed at preventing pre
 term labour suggest that the mechanisms by which the physiological systems
 required for labour may be activated differently in women with multiple gestations
 compared to at least the majority of women with singleton pregnancies.

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 The Example describes an experiment in which myometrial explants are maintained
 in a viable state for a period of up to 3 days under conditions of high and low stretch
 in the presence or absence of retosiban. Following removal of retosiban, the
 myometrial explants were challenged with KCI (which depolarizes the cell
 membrane resulting in smooth muscle contraction) and oxytocin (which triggers
 contraction of smooth muscle by triggering the release of intracellular Ca2 - see
 background).
 The key finding is that in conditions of high stretch (simulating uterine
 overdistension), retosiban inhibited myometrial contractility resulting from KCI or
 oxytocin challenge. This implies that the preincubation with retosiban in some way
 changed the signalling pathways of the myometrium in such a way as to prevent it
 responding to contractile stimuli. It is noteworthy that these results cannot result
 simply from retosiban blocking the oxytocin receptor (this is for two reasons: (1)
 retosiban was removed before KCI and oxytocin challenge and (2) KCI does not
 exert its contractile effect via the oxytocin receptor).
 Based on the above, it is reasonable to extrapolate that retosiban, through some
 unknown mechanism, is capable of inhibiting contraction of the myometrium of
 subjects in which the uterus is overdistended, for example in situations of multiple
 gestation or polyhydroamnios.
 The observation that retosiban seems to change the signalling pathways of the
 myometrium in such a way as to prevent it responding to contractile stimuli may also
 explain the observation that in a phase || clinical study, retosiban resulted in a greater

 In a third aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a human female subject
 in pre-term labour, which method comprises a step of identifying whether said human

 In yet another aspect, the invention provide use of (3R,6R)-3-(2,3-dihydro-1 H-inden
 2-yl)-1-[( 1R)-1-(2-methyl- 1,3-oxazol-4-yl)-2- (morpholin-4-yl}-2-oxoethyl]-6-[( 1S)-1
 methylpropyl]-2,5-piperazinedione in the manufacture of a medicament for the
 treatment of pre-term labour in a human female subject that has a multiple gestation
 or polyhydroamnios.
 To practice the claimed invention, it is necessary to be able to identify the subject to
 be treated. In this regard, as discussed in the background section, it is difficult to
                                              12

WO 2015/192878                                                         PCT/EP2014/062602
 distinguish labour leading to imminent delivery from "false labour" based on clinical
 impression alone. In the context of this invention, the subject is considered to be in
 "labour" if diagnosed as such by a physician or midwife, using diagnostic criteria
 known in the art. The current criteria are the presence of regular painful uterine
 contractions in association with dilation and/or effacement of the uterine cervix.
 The term pre-term labour relates to spontaneous labour initated before 37 weeks
 gestational age. Methods of determining gestational age are well known in the art.
 These include calculation based on the date of the last menstrual period (adjusting
 for cycle length) and methods based on sonographic measurement of fetal size,
 such as the crown-rump length of the fetus, or measurement of the head
 circumference, biparietal diameter or femur length of the fetus, with the exact
 measurements being used depending on the gestational age when the assessment
 is made.
 In one embodiment, the subject has a multiple gestation. Multiple gestation is where
 there is more than one fetus in the uterine cavity. Multiple gestation is readily
 diagnosed by sonography.
 In another embodiment, the subject has polyhydroamnios. Polyhydroamnios is
 generally confirmed using ultrasonic measurements. These can be either assessment
 of the largest measureable vertical pool of amniotic fluid when an ultrasound scan is
 performed, or measurement of the largest measurable vertical pool of amniotic fluid in
 each of the four assumed quadrants (upper left and right and lower left and right) of
 the uterus (the sum of these measurements - in mm - is termed the amniotic fluid
 index).
 Where the largest measurable vertical pool of amniotic fluid is measured,
 polyhydroamnios can be diagnosed by a measurement that is 28 cm. In a more
 particular embodiment, polyhydroamnios can be diagnosed by a measurement that is
   12 cm. Even more particularly, polyhydroamnios can be diagnosed by a
 measurement that is    16 cm.
 Where the amniotic fluid index is measured, polyhydramnios may be diagnosed when
 the sum of these measurements (in mm) exceeds a threshold that does not vary with
 gestational age. This could be >250, >300, >400, or could be based on some other
                                              13

WO 2015/192878                                                          PCT/EP2014/062602
 widely used clinical threshold. Alternatively, where the amniotic fluid index is
 measured, polyhydramnios can be diagnosed when the sum of these measurements
 (in mm) exceeds a threshold that differs according to gestational age. Several
 reference ranges exist for the amniotic fluid index at different gestational ages. A
 suitable reference range for amniotic fluid index at different gestational ages in
 uncomplicated singleton pregnancies is given in Table 1 (adapted from Hinh and
 Ladinsky, Int J Gynec Obstet, 2005, 91: 132-136). Polyhydroamnios can be
 diagnosed by a measurement that is    > 9 0th  percentile on an appropriate reference
 range. In a more particular embodiment, polyhydroamnios can be diagnosed by a
 measurement that is >9 5th percentile on an appropriate reference range. Even more
 particularly, polyhydroamnios can be diagnosed by a measurement that is > 9 7 .5th
 percentile on an appropriate reference range. Alternatively, polyhydroamnios may be
 diagnosed when this measurement exceeds the mean for a given gestational age
 (based on the clinically accepted estimated date of delivery) by a threshold of
 multiples of the standard deviation. Thus, in one embodiment, polyhydroamnios can
 be diagnosed by a measurement that is greater than or equal to the sum of the mean
 value for the given gestational age (based on the clinically accepted estimated date of
 delivery) plus 1 standard deviation. In a more particular embodiment,
 polyhydroamnios can be diagnosed by a measurement that is greater than or equal to
 the sum of the mean value for the given gestational age (based on the clinically
 accepted estimated date of delivery) plus 2 standard deviations.

 Polyhydroamnios may also be diagnosed clinically. It could be suspected by an
 enlarged symphysis-fundal height for gestational age. The suspicion might be
 confirmed by noting that the uterus appears hard (referred to as tight or tense), when
 foetal parts are not readily palpated in circumstances (based on gestational age and
 maternal body habitus) where they might be expected to have been palpable, or
 through other aspects of physical examination, such as the elicitation of a "fluid thrill",
 as described in standard textbooks on the subject.
 It is noted that, in the clinical trials conducted to date with retosiban, subjects with
 multiple gestation and polyhydroamnios were excluded and clinical trials have only
 been conducted with subjects in spontaneous pre-term labour with uncomplicated
 singleton pregnancies. The females that are the subject of the methods and uses of
 the invention are thus distinct from those treated in the retosiban clinical trials.
 Further, the subjects of the methods and uses of the invention are distinguished from
 those treated in clinical trials by their physiological status, namely multiple gestation
 or polyhydroamnios.
 In certain embodiments of the invention, (3R,6R)-3-(2,3-dihydro-1 H-inden-2-yl)-1-[(
 1R)-1-(2-methyl- 1,3-oxazol-4-yl)-2- (morpholin-4-yl}-2-oxoethyl]-6-[( 1S)-1
 methylpropyl]-2,5-piperazinedione (henceforth retosiban) is administered parenterally.
 In a more particular embodiment, retosiban is administered intravenously. Even more
 particularly, retosiban is administered via IV (intravenous) infusion at a dose required
 to produce plasma concentrations of retosiban of between 5 and 400 ng/mL. Most
 particularly, retosiban is administered via IV (intravenous) infusion at a dose required
 to produce plasma concentrations of retosiban of between 75 and 150 ng/mL.
 In certain embodiments where retosiban is administered via IV infusion, a steady
 state plasma concentration of between 50 to 400 ng is provided for 2 hours. The
 steady state plasma concentration is then reduced such that this is between 5 to 150
 ng at 48 hours from the start of the infusion.
 In another embodiment, retosiban may be administered as a 6 mg intravenous
 loading dose over 5 minutes, followed by a 6 mg/hour continuous infusion over 48
                                                 15

WO 2015/192878                                                          PCT/EP2014/062602
 hours. For subjects with an inadequate response after the first hour of treatment, the
 dose may be increased by another 6 mg loading dose over 5 minutes followed by a
 12 mg/hour continuous infusion for the remainder of the 48 hour period.
 In other embodiments of the invention, retosiban is administered orally. In a more
 particular embodiment, retosiban is administered orally at a dose of between 200-500
 mg/day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as
 divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or
 more sub-doses per day. In one embodiment, the daily dose is selected to provide
 plasma concentrations of retosiban of between 5 and 400 ng/mL. More particularly,
 the daily dose is selected to provide plasma concentrations of retosiban of between
 75 and 150 ng/mL.
 The experiments shown in the example also show that retosiban reduced the
 sensitivity to oxytocin (as measured by the pEC 5o) in both conditions of high and low
 stretch. This observation suggests that the prophylactic administration of retosiban
 may be effective in preventing pre-term labour in a subject at risk of pre-term labour.
 A subject at risk of pre-term labour is a subject with any recognized risk factor for pre
 term labour (certain of these are discussed in the Background section). These
 include a short cervix (see below for diagnosis), the presence of fetal fibronectin on a
 vaginal swab, previous pre-term birth, previous cervical surgery, uterine abnormality
 (diagnosed by sonography), polyhydroamnios and multiple gestation (as discussed
 above, these last two conditions are associated with uterine overdistension).
 A short cervix may be diagnosed by transvaginal sonography or clinical examination.
 In one embodiment, a short cervix can be diagnosed by a measurement that is 25
 mm. In a more particular embodiment, a short cervix can be diagnosed by a
 measurement that is 520 mm.
 Alternatively, a short cervix can be diagnosed by a measured that is less than a
 threshold (that differs according to gestational age). Several reference ranges exist
 for cervical length. A suitable reference range for cervical length in singleton
 pregnancies is given in Table 2 ((adapted from Salomon et al., Ultrasound Obstet
 Gynecol, 2009, 33:459-464). A short cervix can be diagnosed by a measurement that
 is 510th percentile on an appropriate reference range. In a more particular

 embodiment, a short cervix can be diagnosed by a measurement that is 55th
 percentile on an appropriate reference range. Even more particularly, a short cervix
 can be diagnosed by a measurement that is 51t percentile on an appropriate
 reference range. Alternatively, a short cervix may be diagnosed when this
 measurement is lower than the mean for a given gestational age (based on the
 clinically accepted estimated date of delivery) by a threshold of multiples of the
 standard deviation. Thus, in one embodiment, a short cervix can be diagnosed by a
 measurement that is less than or equal to the mean value for the given gestational
 age (based on the clinically accepted estimated date of delivery) minus 1 standard
 deviation. In a more particular embodiment, a short cervix can be diagnosed by a
 measurement that is less than or equal to the mean value for the given gestational
 age (based on the clinically accepted estimated date of delivery) minus 2 standard
 deviations.

 In one embodiment of the methods for preventing pre-term labour, retosiban is
 administered orally. In a more particular embodiment of these methods, retosiban is
 administered orally at a dose of between 200-500 mg/day. The desired dose may be
 conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at
 appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. In
 one embodiment, the daily dose is selected to provide plasma concentrations of
 retosiban of between 5 and 400 ng/mL. More particularly, the daily dose is selected
 to provide plasma concentrations of retosiban of between 75 and 150 ng/mL.
 Whilst it is possible that, for use in any of the methods/therapies described above, a
 compound of the invention may be administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable
 to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation. Formulations
 suitable for parenteral and oral administration are well known in the art.
                                              EXAMPLE
 Method
 Human myometrial strips (obtained from non-labouring patients undergoing
 routine elective caesarean section at term) were cultured in medium (phenol red
 free DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal stripped foetal calf serum, 2 mM L
 glutamine and antibiotics) in an incubator (37'C, humidified 5% C02) under
 conditions of low stretch (0.6 g mass) or high stretch (2.4 g mass). Half of the
 strips in both the low and high stretch groups were incubated with 1 mM
 retosiban (diluted in DMSO). The remaining strips (paired samples from the
 same patient) were incubated DMSO.
 After 20-24 hours incubation, myometrial contractility of the strips was studied as
 described previously (J Physiol 2012; 590(Pt9): 2081-2093). Briefly, tension was
 initially set at 2 g for all strips. Strips were washed with fresh Krebs after 15 and
 30 min and the tension reset to 2 g. After a further hour of washes (every 15
                                                 21

WO 2015/192878                                                          PCT/EP2014/062602
 min), the issue was treated with 50 mM KCI (50 mM, 5-7 min). This was washed,
 the tissue allowed to recover and then a cumulative concentration response
 curve to oxytocin (up to 100 nM) was obtained. Maximal responses to KCI and
 oxytocin were normalized to strip wet weight. The mean normalized responses
 of duplicate strips were calculated for the four different groups (low stretch with
 retosiban, low stretch with vehicle, high stretch with retosiban, high stretch with
 vehicle). Effects were expressed as fold change i.e. the ratio of normalized
 responses in the experimental and control conditions from different strips
 obtained from the same woman. pEC 5 0 values were calculated using analysis of
 the area under the curve for each concentration of oxytocin.
 Since the data were expressed as fold changes, all ratios were log transformed
 and normal distribution following log transformation was assessed using the
 Sharpiro-Wilk test. The null hypothesis was that there was no change in the
 mean normalized responses with a given intervention. All statistical tests were
 one sample Student's t-tests that the mean fold change was significantly different
 from one (i.e. all analysis were paired comparisons of different strips from the
 same woman). Continuous associations were assessed using linear regression
 of log transformed fold changes. For the analysis of pEC 50 Student's paired t
 test was used.
 Results
 Effect of stretch on myometrial contractility in tissues incubated with retosiban or
 vehicle
 Increased stretch increased the contractility of tissues that were not incubated
 with retosiban (Figure 1). The median fold change (IQR, P) with stretch (high
 stretch compared with low stretch) was 1.59 (1.14-1.81, P= 0.007, n=12) and
 1.51 (1.04-1.82, P=0.01, n=12) (Student's paired T test after logarithmic
 transformation) for KCI and oxytocin, respectively. There was no statistically
 significant effect of stretch when strips were incubated with retosiban (Figure 1).
 The mean fold change was 1.14 (0.97-1.27, P=0,27, n=12) and 1.14 (0.94-1.34,
 P=0.23, n=12) for KCI and oxytocin, respectively.
 Effect of incubation with retosiban in low and high stretch

 In tissues exposed to low stretch, incubation with retosiban had no statistically
 significant effect on the maximal response to either KCI or oxytocin (Figure 2). The
 median fold change (IQR, P) with retosiban was 1.00 (0.85-1.22, P=0.81, n=1 2) for
 KCI and 0.97 (0.76-1.07, P=0.15, n=12) for oxytocin. In tissues exposed to high
 stretch, incubation in retosiban resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the
 maximal response to both KCI and oxytocin (Figure 2). The median fold change was
 0.74 (0.60-1.03, P=0.046, n=12) for KCI and 0.71 (0.53-0.91, P=0,008, n=12) for
 oxytocin.
 Relationship between the effect of stretch and effect of retosiban
 There was significant variation in the magnitude of reduction in responses to KCI and
 oxytocin induced by incubation in retosiban. The greater the effect of stretch on
 responses of myometrium from a given patient, the greater was the reduction in
 response induced by retosiban (Figure 3).
 Effect of stretch on the pEC50 to oxytocin
 The sensitivity of the myometrium to oxytocin was estimated using the pEC 5 0 .
 Stretch had no significant effect on the pEC50 to oxytocin in the presence of
 either retosiban or vehicle. In tissues incubated with retosiban, the median pEC 50
 (IQR) to oxytocin was 8.43 (8.22-8.68) in low stretch and 8.65 (8,34-8,71) in high
 stretch (P=0.51, n=10). In tissues incubated with vehicle the pEC 50 to oxytocin
 was 8.90 (8.77-9.04) in low stretch and 9.08 (8.86-9.22) in high stretch (P=0.17,
 n=11).
 Effect of retosiban on the pEC50 to oxytocin in similarly stretched tissues
 Retosiban reduced the sensitivity to oxytocin in both conditions of low and high
 stretch (Figure 4). When incubated under low stretch, the pEC 50 to oxytocin in
 samples incubated in retosiban was 8.36 (8.21-8,68) and in samples incubated in
 vehicle was 8.93 (8.66-9.07) (P=0.001, n=1 1). When incubated under high
 stretch, the pEC 50 to oxytocin in samples incubated in retosiban was 8.67 (8.34
 8.71) and in samples incubated in vehicle was 9.16 (8.97-9.22) (P<0.001, n=9).
 Conclusions
      .   Prolonged stretch of human myometrium increases its contractile response to
          both potassium and oxytocin.

    .   Incubation in retosiban had no effect on the maximum contractility of
        myometrium in conditions of low stretch,
    .   Incubation in retosiban inhibited the maximum contractility of myometrium
        exposed to high stretch and the magnitude of the inhibition increased as the
        effect of stretch increased
    .   Incubation with retosiban significantly decreased the sensitivity of
        myometrium to oxytocin under both conditions of low and high stretch.
    .   The effects of retosiban could not simply be explained by oxytocin receptor
        antagonism as (i) all experiments quantifying contractility were performed in
        the absence of retosiban, (ii) similar changes were observed in the response
        to KCl, which stimulates myometrial contractility by direct depolarisation of
        smooth muscle
    .   These data support the hypothesis that prolonged exposure of myometrial
        smooth muscle to retosiban may inhibit the pro-contractile effect of stretch
