                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
           Most compounds that are useful in the method of the invention contain
    one or more asymmetric centers, such that the compounds may exist in
    enantiomeric as well as in diastereomeric forms. In fact, most of the
 5  compounds of the present invention have two asymmetric carbons adjacent to
    one another and therefore can exist in erythro or threo form, with each of
    these two forms having dextrorotatory (D) or levorotary (L) enantiomers.
    Although the threo form is generally preferred in accordance with the present
    invention, unless it is specifically noted otherwise, the scope of the present
10  invention includes all enantiomers, diastereomers and diastereomeric or
    racemic mixtures. In light of the foregoing, it should be clearly understood
    that the designation "DL" or "(+/-)" or "(±)" in this application includes the pure
    dextrorotatory enantiomer, the pure levorotatory enantiomer and all racemic
    mixtures, including mixtures where the two enantiomers are present in equal
15  or in unequal proportions. Moreover, for simplicity sake in many of the
    structural formulas, such as in the example below, only one of the
    enantiomers is actually shown but when the designation "DL" or "(+/-)" or or
    "(±)" appears it also includes the enantiomeric form (mirror image) of the
    structure actually shown in the formula.
20          For example:
                                  OH O
                                          No

                              DL-threo (only one enantiomer shown)
            Thus, in the example above, only one enantiomer is shown, but
     because the designation "DL" (or or "(+/-)" or "(±)") appears below the formula,

    and all racemic mixtures of the two optical isomers are also included.
            In the case of some compounds of the present invention one
 5  enantiomer of the threo, and in some cases of the erythro, enantiomers is
    significantly more active than the other enantiomer of the same pair. For this
    reason the isolated enantiomer which is significantly more active than the
    other is considered a novel and inventive composition even if the racemic
    mixture or the other opposite enantiomer of the same compound have already
10  been described in the prior art.
            Some of the compounds that are useful in the method of the present
    invention contain three or more asymmetric centers. An example is the
    following compound

            Keeping the foregoing examples in mind the reader one of ordinary skill
    in the art should readily understand the scope of each described example,
    although in a broad sense all isomers, enantiomers and racemic mixtures are
 5  within the scope of the invention.
            The term "alkyl" in the general description and definition of the
    compounds includes straight chain as well as branch-chained alkyl groups.
            Generally speaking the compounds of the invention may form salts with
    pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases, and such pharmaceutically
10  acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula 1 and of Formula 2 are also
    within the scope of the invention.
            Referring now to the novel compounds of Formula 1, in a class of
    preferred compounds of the invention none of the W, X and Y groups is a
    heteroatom. Within this class, compounds are preferred where the sum of m,
15  n and q is 3 and the aromatic group is unsubstituted or substituted with one or
    more halogen, alkyl of 1 to 6 carbons, or halogen substituted alkyl of 1 to 6
    carbons. Compounds within this class are also preferred where the R5 and R6
    groups form a carbocyclic ring, or a heterocyclic ring.
            In another class of preferred compounds in accordance with Formula 1
20  one of the variables W, X and Y represents a heteroatom, preferably nitrogen
    and the sum of m, n and q is 3.
            In still another class of preferred compounds in accordance with
    Formula 1 one or two of the variables W, X and Y represent a heteroatom,
    selected from N, 0 or S and the sum of m, n and q is 2.
25          Referring still to the compounds of Formula 1, compounds are
    preferred where R4 is H or an acyl group, more preferably H.

   WO 2008/109610                                                      PCT/US2008/055812
                                             12
             With reference to the variables R3 , compounds in accordance with
     Formula 1 are preferred where both R3 groups are Hand where one R3 group
     is H and the other is benzyl, monohalogeno, dihalogeno, methyl or methoxy
    substituted benzyl, cyclohexyl, an alkyl of 1 to 7 carbons, COR 7 , COOR 7
 5  where R7 is alkyl of 1 to 15 carbons, benzyloxy, phenyl, methoxyphenyl,
     monohalogen or dihalogeno substituted phenyl, a 2-hydroxy-1-phenylethyl
    group or an alkyl group of 1 to 20 carbons itself substituted with an NH2 ,
     NHCOR 7 , or NHCOOR 7 group.
             Referring now to the variables R1 and R2 in the compounds of Formula
10   1, compounds are preferred in accordance with the invention where R1 and R2
    jointly form a pyrrolidine, a 3-fluoro or a 3,3-difluoro or an 3-hydroxy
    substituted pyrrolidine, a morpholine, a thiomorpholine, a piperazine, an alkyl
    substituted piperazine where the alkyl group has 1 to 6 carbons, an azetidine,
    a tetrahydrothiazole, an indoline, or a 2H-pyrrol ring or R1 and R2 are two alkyl
15  groups of 1 to 3 carbons.
         Referring now to the novel compounds of Formula 2, with respect to the
    variables W, X, Y, m, n, q, R1 , R2 , R5 , R6 , R3 compounds are generally
     preferred in which these variables have the same preferences as in
    compounds of Formula 1.
20           With respect to R9 and R1 0 , compounds are generally preferred where
     R9 and R10 are both hydrogen, where one of these two variables is hydroxy
    and the other is alkyl of 1 to 6 carbons, where the R9 and R10 groups jointly
    form an NOR,1 group, and where R9 is hydrogen, the dashed line between
    carbons 2 and 3 represent a double bond and R10 does not exist. With
25  respect to R,1 compounds of Formula 2 are preferred where R1 is H, or
    COR 12 where R12 is alkyl of 1 to 3 carbons.
             Presently still more preferred are Compounds of Formula 2 where R1
    and R2 jointly with the nitrogen form a five-membered ring, where both R3
    groups are hydrogen and where one of the R3 groups is hydrogen and the
30  other is formyl.

            The compounds described here may be used to treat a patient
    suffering from one or more types of cognitive disorder, such as an agnosia, an
    amnesia, an aphasia, an apraxia, a delirium, a dementia, and a learning
    disorder.
 5          To "treat," as used here, means to deal with medically. It includes, for
    example, administering a compound of the invention to prevent the onset of a
    cognitive disorder, to alleviate its severity, and to prevent its reoccurrence.
            The term "cognitive disorder," as used here, means any condition
    characterized by a deficit in mental activities associated with thinking,
10  learning, or memory. Examples of such disorders include agnosias,
    amnesias, aphasias, apraxias, deliriums, dementias, and learning disorders.
            In some cases, the cause of a cognitive disorder may be unknown or
    uncertain. In other cases, the cognitive disorder may be associated with (that
    is, be caused by or occur in the presence of) other conditions characterized
15  by damage to or loss of neurons or other structures involved in the
    transmission of signals between neurons. Hence, cognitive disorders may be
    associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,
    corticobasal degeneration, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, frontotemporal lobar
    degeneration, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, normal pressure
20  hydrocephalus, organic chronic brain syndrome, Parkinson's disease, Pick
    disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, or senile dementia (Alzheimer type);
    it may be associated with trauma to the brain, such as that caused by chronic
    subdural hematoma, concussion, intracerebral hemorrhage, or with other
    injury to the brain, such as that caused by infection (e.g., encephalitis,
25  meningitis, septicemia) or drug intoxication or abuse.
            Cognitive disorders may also be associated with other conditions which
    impair normal functioning of the central nervous system, including psychiatric
    disorders such as anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, mood disorders,
    schizophrenia, and somatoform and factitious disorders; it may also be
30  associated with conditions of the peripheral nervous system, such as chronic
    pain.

            The compounds described here may be used to treat agnosias,
    amnesias, aphasias, apraxias, deliriums, dementias, learning disorders and
    other cognitive disorders regardless of whether their cause is known or not.
           Examples of dementias which may be treated with the methods of the
 5  invention include AIDS dementia complex, Binswanger's disease, dementia
    with Lewy Bodies, frontotemporal dementia, multi-infarct dementia, Pick's
    disease, semantic dementia, senile dementia, and vascular dementia.
            Examples of learning disorders which may be treated with the methods
    of the invention include Asperger's syndrome, attention deficit disorder,
10  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, childhood disintegrative
    disorder, and Rett syndrome.
            Examples of aphasia which may be treated with the methods of the
    invention include progressive non-fluent aphasia.
            The compounds described here may also be used to treat patient
15  having deficits in mental activities that are mild or that otherwise do not
    significantly interfere with daily life. Mild cognitive impairment is an example
    of such a condition: a patient with mild cognitive impairment displays
    symptoms of dementia (e.g., difficulties with language or memory) but the
    severity of these symptoms is such that a diagnosis of dementia may not be
20  appropriate. The compounds described here may be used to treat mild
    cognitive impairment and other, similarly less severe forms of cognitive
    disorders.

 5
    Modes of Administration:
           The compounds of the invention may be administered at
    pharmaceutically effective dosages. Such dosages are normally the minimum
    dose necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic effect; in the treatment of
10  cognitive disorders, the desired therapeutic effect is an improvement in
    cognitive functioning, or an alleviation of any of the symptoms associated with
    agnosia, amnesia, aphasia, apraxia, delirium, dementia, or learning disorders.

   WO 2008/109610                                                    PCT/US2008/055812
                                             26
    For human adults such doses generally will be in the range of 0.1-5,000
    mg/day; more preferably in the range of 1 to 3,000 mg/day, 10 mg to 500
    mg/day, 500 to 1,000 mg/day, 1,000 to 1,500 mg/day, 1,500 to 2,000 mg/day,
    2,000 to 2,500 mg/day, or 2,500 to 3,000 mg/day. However, the actual
 5  amount of the compound to be administered in any given case will be
    determined by a physician taking into account the relevant circumstances,
    such as the severity of the cognitive disorder, the age and weight of the
    patient, the patient's general physical condition, the cause of the disorder, and
    the route of administration.
10          The compounds are useful in the treatment of cognitive disorders in a
    mammal; particularly a human being. Preferably, the patient will be given the
    compound orally in any acceptable form, such as a tablet, liquid, capsule,
    powder and the like. However, other routes may be desirable or necessary,
    particularly if the patient suffers from nausea. Such other routes may include,
15  without exception, transdermal, intraperitonial, parenteral, subcutaneous,
    intranasal, intrathecal, intramuscular, intravenous and intrarectal modes of
    delivery. Compositions useful in the method of the invention may further
    include an excipient. Such an excipient may be a carrier or a diluent; this is
    usually mixed with the active compound, or permitted to dilute or enclose the
20  active compound. If a diluent, the carrier may be solid, semi-solid, or liquid
    material that acts as an excipient or vehicle for the active compound. The
    formulations may also include wetting agents, emulsifying agents, preserving
    agents, sweetening agents, and/or flavoring agents. If used as in an
    ophthalmic or infusion format, the formulation will usually contain one or more
25  salt to influence the osmotic pressure of the formulation.

          The inventors demonstrated          memory-enhancing activity with three
    compounds of the invention.            The passive avoidance task exploits the
30  tendency for rodents to avoid environments previously associated with an
    aversive stimulus (e.g. shock) and is therefore a reliable measure of
    emotional memory.        The Morris water maze (MWM) task, a test of spatial

    learning and memory, requires that the animal learns the spatial locations of
    various extra-maze cues in order to accurately locate an escape platform that
    is hidden beneath the surface of the water in a water tank. In all of these
    tasks, the tested compounds improved memory: in passive avoidance, this
 5  was true for young mice, and in the MWM task, the compounds significantly
    improved learning and memory in aged rats.
          Importantly, the tested compounds are orally active, and therefore could
    be administered in many forms, including but not limited to tablet or capsule.
    These compounds may also be administered IV, intramuscularly, intrathecally,
10  subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally.
          Table 2, below, indicates the effects of compounds of the invention in a
    passive avoidance task (latency to enter the dark/shock compartment as
    dependent variable). Data were analyzed with One-Way ANOVAs followed
    by Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc measures (required P value dependent
15  upon number of comparisons). The table below includes data from Vehicle
    treated mice and mice treated with Compound A and Compound B.

20  were no significant differences during training (pre-treatment), but the post
    training injections of Compound A and Compound B significantly improved
    memory for the shock-associated environment.

            Young and aged controls decreased their escape latencies (time to find
    the platform) from session to session, indicating that they could learn to locate
    the hidden platform.    Aged controls had longer escape latencies and path
    length than young controls during water-maze training, suggesting age-related
15  learning deficits. The effect of age was mainly observed during the       3 rd - 5 th
    training days (Day 9-11).        An analysis of variance conducted in control
    animals supported a statistically significant main effect of age over the training
    period (ANOVA: F Age (all trials) = 15.644; p < 0.001).

    compared with young controls (data not shown), suggesting the absence of
    motor impairment in aged rats.
 5         Compound C (10 mg/kg), administered twice daily for 6 days prior to
    the experiment and twice daily during the experiment, decreased the escape
    latency of aged rats over the training period, as compared with aged controls.
    The effect of Compound C was statistically significant when pooling the data
    obtained during the last 3 training sessions. Compound C did not affect the

    Training/Testing
            One Day 0, animals were individually placed in the bright side of a 2
    chambered inhibitory avoidance box.          Mice were given 35 seconds to
    acclimate after which a door between the two compartments was lifted and
 5  the animals were allowed to cross over into the dark compartment. Once they
    crossed over, the gate would close and the animal would receive a mild (0.15
    mA,    2 sec) footshock.       Memory     retention for the shock-associated
    environment was evaluated 24 hours (Day 1), 4 (Day 4) and 7 (Day 7) days
    later. On each of the three memory retention tests (Days 1, 4, and 7), the
10  mouse was given 15 seconds to acclimate before the gate was lifted. Latency
    to enter the dark (shock) compartment was measured and considered an
    index of passive fear avoidance. Maximum trial length = 180 sec.
    Morris Water Maze
15          The Morris Maze consisted of a circular water tank (150 cm in
    diameter) filled with water and maintained at 270C with an escape platform
    (15 cm in diameter) 18 cm from the perimeter always in the same position 2
    cm beneath the surface of the water. The water was made opaque by addition
    of a non-toxic coloring agent rendering the platform invisible. The testing was
20  performed under light of moderate intensity.
            The animals were given 5 training sessions over 5 consecutive days.
    Each training session consisted of 3 consecutive trials in the Morris Maze
    separated by 120 seconds. For each trial the animal was placed in the maze
    at one of two starting points equidistant from the escape platform and allowed
25  to find the escape platform. The animal was left on the escape platform for 60
    seconds followed by a 60-second rest in an individual cage before starting a
    new trial. If the animal did not find the platform within 120 seconds, the
    experimenter removed it from the water and placed it on the platform for 60
    seconds. During the 3 trials the animals started the maze from the different
30  starting points in a randomly determined order per animal.

   WO 2008/109610                                                  PCT/US2008/055812
                                         32
           The trials were video-recorded and the behavior of the animals was
    analyzed using a video-tracking system (Panlab: Smart). The principal
    measure taken was the escape latency (time to find the hidden platform) at
    each trial. Additional measures (path length (distance travelled to find the
 5  hidden platform) and average speed) were also measured.
           Aged animals show amnesia in this task as indicated by a lower
    capacity to reduce their escape latencies from trial to trial.
    15 aged rats were studied per group. The experiment also included a young
    control group. The test was performed blind.
10         Compound C was evaluated at the dose of 10 mg/kg, administered
    p.o., and compared with a vehicle control group. The animals received the
    assigned treatment twice daily for 6 days prior to water-maze training. Twice
    daily administration continued during training, with one administration 60
    minutes before each training session and the second administration between
15  either 8.30-9.30 am or 4:30-5:30 pm, whichever was furthest from the training
    session for that particular animal.
           The experiment therefore included 3 groups.
           Data were analyzed by comparing treated groups with aged control
    using Mann Whitney U tests. In addition, the data were submitted to a two
20  factor analysis of variance (with age and session as factors, with repeated
    measures for session).
