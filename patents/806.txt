                       SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR BETTING ON
                      A SUBSET OF PARTICIPANTS IN AN EVENT
   ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
           A method of managing bets is provided. The method includes receiving win
   bets and group bets. Each win bet includes a bet that a participant selected from a set
   of participants in an event will win the event. Each group bet includes a bet that one
 5 of a subset of the set of participants will win the event.           Results of the event
   identifying a winning participant from the set of participants are received. An amount
   of a win bet payout for at least a portion of the win bets that comprise a bet on the
   winning participant is determined. An amount of a group bet payout for at least one
   of the group bets is also determined.        In this manner, a bettor may bet on all
10 participants in an event other than a particular participant, such as the favorite
   participant, and thus effectively bet against the particular participant.

                        SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR BETTING ON
                       A SUBSET OF PARTICIPANTS IN AN EVENT
   TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
           This invention relates in general to betting on events and, more particularly, to
   a system and method for betting on a subset of participants in an event.
 5 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           Wagering on sporting events, such as horse races, for example, is a large and
   growing industry in many parts of the world. Various types of betting products or
   systems are available for various types of sporting events     For example, typical horse
   racing bets allow bettors to bet on a single horse or on several horses in a particular
10 race or series of races. For instance, a bettor can bet on a particular horse to finish
   first (win), finish in the top two (place), or finish in the top three (show). A bettor
   may also make various combination bets with multiple horses, such as an exacta bet
   (covering the top two horses in order) or a trifecta bet (covering the top three horses in
   order).   In addition, a bettor may bet on a series of races, such as the daily double
15 (winners of two consecutive races), the pick-three (winners of three consecutive
   races), and the pick-six (winners of six consecutive races), for example.
           In a pari-mutuel betting system, all bets regarding a particular event are
   aggregated, a commission (or "take-out") is taken by the track, and the remainder is
   distributed among the winning bettors. For example, pari-mutuel betting systems are
20 commonly used in North America (and other various places throughout the world) for
   betting on horse races.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           According to one embodiment, a method of managing bets is provided. The
25 method includes receiving one or more win bets and one or more group bets. Each
   win bet includes a bet that a participant selected from a set of participants in an event
   will win the event. Each group bet includes a bet that one of a subset of the set of
   participants will win the event, wherein the subset includes a plurality of the set of
   participants. Results of the event identifying a winning participant from the set of
30 participants are received. An amount of a win bet payout for at least a portion of the
   win bets that comprise a bet on the winning participant is determined. An amount of
   a group bet payout for at least one of the group bets is also determined.

                                                2
           According to another embodiment, a system for managing bets is provided.
   The system includes a memory coupled to a processor. The memory is operable to
   store one or more win bets and one or more group bets. Each win bet includes a bet
   that a participant selected from a set of participants in an event will win the event.
 5 Each group bet includes a bet that one of a subset of the set of participants will win
   the event, wherein the subset includes a plurality of the set of participants.       The
   memory is also operable to store results of the event identifying a winning participant
   from the set of participants. The processor is operable to determine an amount of a
   win bet payout for at least a portion of the win bets that comprise a bet on the winning
10 participant, and also to determine an amount of a group bet payout for at least one of
   the group bets.
           Various embodiments of the present invention may benefit from numerous
   advantages.    It should be noted that one or more embodiments may benefit from
   some, none, or all of the advantages discussed below.
15         One advantage of the invention is that in an event which includes a set of
   participants, a bettor may bet on a subset of the set of participants, and win the bet if
   any of the subset of participants wins the event.      Thus, for example, a bettor who
   believes that a particular participant in an event will not win the event, but is unsure
   of which other participant to bet on, may purchase a group bet which includes a group
20 of participants which excludes the particular participant. For example, a bettor who
   believes that the favorite in a horse race will not win the race, but is unsure on which
   other horse to bet, may purchase a group bet which includes every horse in the field
   except for the favorite.
           In this manner, a bettor may bet on all horses other than the favorite (or
25 another particular horse), thus effectively betting against the favorite, without having
   to place individual bets on each of the non-favorite horses.       In some situations, a
   bettor may make such a group bet on an event when he or she otherwise would not
   have made a bet on the event, since the bettor need not place individual bets on each
   of the non-favorite horses. This may increase the total pool of wagers on the event,
30 which may increase profits at least for the one or more entities that collect a
   percentage of the take-out on such wagers.
           Another advantage of the invention is that such group bets may be provided in
   a pari-mutuel betting system in which all bets regarding a particular event are pooled.

                                               3
           Other advantages will be readily apparent to one having ordinary skill in the
   art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS OF THE
30 INVENTION
           FIGURE 1 illustrates an example system 10 for receiving and managing bets
   12 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System 10 includes
   one or more betting system interfaces 14 and a betting system platform 16 coupled by

                                                4
   one or more communications networks 18.         In general, one or more clients 20 may
   receive betting information (such as event times, betting rules, betting options and
   odds, for example) and/or place bets 12 via betting system interfaces 14.         Betting
   system interfaces 14 communicate such bets 12 received from clients 20 to betting
 5 system platform 16.      Betting system platform 16 stores the received bets 12,
   determines appropriate odds and payouts, and communicates such odds and payouts
   to one or more of the betting system interfaces 14.
            System 10 permits clients 20 to place at least both win bets (or straight
   wagers) 22, as well as group bets 24 on a betting event having a set of event
10 participants, such as a horse race, dog race, auto race, or golf tournament, for
   example. A win bet (or straight wager) 22 is a bet that a particular participant will
   win the event. For example, in a horse race, an example of a win bet 22 is a bet that
   Horse #3 will win the race. A group bet 24, on the other hand, is a bet that one of a
   group, or subset, of the set of participants will win the event. In some situations, the
15 subset or group may include all of the participants in an event except for a single
   participant.  In such situations, the group may include all of the participants in an
   event except for the "favorite," or in other words, the participant having (or predicted
   to have) the best chance of winning the event. For example, in a 14-horse race in
   which Horse #3 is the favorite, an example group bet 24 is a bet that any of the horses
20 except for Horse #3 will win the race.
           By placing a group bet 24, a client 20 may bet on all participants other than
   the favorite (or another particular participant), thus effectively betting against the
   favorite, without having to place individual bets on each of the non-favorite
   participants.  Thus, for example, a bettor who believes that the favorite horse in a
25 horse race a will not win the race, but is unsure on which other horse to bet, may
   purchase a group bet 24 which includes all horses except the favorite.
           In some embodiments, more than one different group bet 24 may be available
   to clients 20. For example, for a particular ten-horse race, a first group bet 24 may be
   available which covers Horses #2-#10, thus effectively providing a bet against Horse
30 #1; a second group bet 24 may be available which covers Horses #1 and #3-#10, thus
   effectively providing a bet against Horse #2; and a third group bet 24 may be
   available which covers Horses #1-#4 and #6-#10, thus effectively providing a bet
   against Horse #5.

                                                5
           In alternative embodiments, the group of participants covered by a particular
   group bet 24 may exclude two, three, or any other number of participants in the event.
   For example, for the ten-horse race discussed above, a group bet 24 may be available
   which covers Horses #3-#4 and #6-#10, thus effectively providing a bet against
 5 Horses #1, #2 and #5. The number of participants for which a particular group bet 24
   may cover may be related to the number of participants in the event. For example, in
   one embodiment, a group bet 24 in a six-horse race may cover all but one horse (such
   as the favorite horse), a group bet 24 in a eight-horse race may cover all but two
   horses (such as the top two favorites), and a group bet 24 in a race of ten or more
10 horses may cover all but three horses (such as the top three favorites).
           In some embodiments, system 10 is a pari-mutuel betting system in which all
   bets 12 (or at least a relevant group of bets 12) regarding a particular event are pooled,
   a commission (or "take-out") is taken by the track or other wagering provider, and the
   remainder is distributed among the winning bettors. In other embodiments, system 10
15 may be another type of betting system, such as a betting system in which clients 20
   take positions against a bookmaker, for example.
           Group bets 24 may be incorporated into an existing pari-mutuel pool in the
   following manner. Suppose, for example, a group bet 24 which covers all participants
   in an event except for the favorite participant. At the close of betting on a particular
20 event, the amount of each individual group bet 24 (less the take-out rate) is divided
   and allocated among all participants covered by the group bet 24 such that the
   potential payout (in other words, the payout if the group bet 24 wins) for the group bet
   24 is related to the odds on the favorite participant. Generally, the lower the odds on
   the favorite participant (in other words, the more that has been bet on the favorite), the
25 greater the potential payout for the group bet 24. Thus, a group bet 24 in a race in
   which the favorite participant has 3-5 odds pays more than a similar group bet 24 in a
   race in which the favorite participant has 2-1 odds. In one embodiment, the payout
   for the group bet 24 is equal to the inverse of the odds on the favorite participant.
   Thus, in this embodiment, if the favorite participant has 2-5 odds, the group bet 24
30 will payout at a 5-2 rate.
           Betting system interfaces 14 may include any suitable interface between a
   client 20 and betting system platform 16.        For example, as shown in FIGURE 1,
   betting system interfaces 14 may include physical interfaces, such as track interfaces

                                                6
   26 and/or off-track interfaces 28. Track interfaces 26 are generally located at a track,
   while off-track interfaces 28 are generally located at an off-track-betting (OTB)
   establishment, such as an OTB parlor. Track interfaces 26 and off-track interfaces 28
   may include tellers 30, which may receive bets 12 from and distribute payouts to
 5 clients 20, and/or monitors 32, which may be viewed by clients 20 to monitor betting
   information such as the event time, the current odds, and the projected or actual
   payouts for various bets 12, for example. In some situations, such information may
   be updated substantially in real time or at preset intervals (such as every 30 seconds,
   for example) as new bets 12 are placed and/or as information regarding the event
10 changes, for example. Monitors 32 may include, for example, tote-boards or closed
   circuit televisions located at a track or OTB establishment.
            Track interfaces 26 and/or off-track interfaces 28 may also include one or
   more self-service betting machines 33.       In some embodiment, self-service betting
   machines 33 allow clients 20 to insert payment into the machine (such as cash or by
15 using a voucher or a credit or debit card), place one or more win bets 22 and/or group
   bets 24, and receive a printout (such as a ticket, for example) indicating the bet or bets
   placed.    Printouts for winning bets may be inserted into the self-service betting
   machine, such as to receive a payment voucher (which may be used to receive a
   payout from a teller 30) or to place additional bets 12. In other embodiments, self
20 service betting machines 33 allow clients 20 to use a credit or debit card to place bets
   12. The credit or debit card may have an associated account, which may be a betting
   account provided and/or managed by a betting account provider.                  In some
   embodiments, after the betting event is completed, a client 20 may insert or swipe his
   or her credit or debit card in the self-service betting machines 33 in order to update
25 the balance on the card. Self-service betting machines 33 may also allow the client 20
   to print out payment vouchers which may be presented to a teller 30 in order to
   receive payments.
            As shown in FIGURE 1, betting system interfaces 14 may also include various
   non-physical interfaces, such as one or more telephone operators 34 and one or more
30 websites 36.      Clients 20 may access or communicate with such non-physical
   interfaces via one or more communications networks 44. Communications networks
   44 may include one or more servers, routers, switches, repeaters, backbones, links
   and/or any other appropriate type of communication devices coupled by links such as

                                                7
   wire line, optical, wireless, or other appropriate links. In general, communication
   network 28 may include any interconnection found on any communication network,
   such as a telephone network, a local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network
   (MAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, portions of the Internet, or any other
 5 data exchange system. To access betting system interface 14 using communication
   networks 44, clients 20 may use a computer, a personal digital assistant (pda), a cell
   phone, a remote paging device, an electronic mail communication device, a handheld
   betting device, or any other suitable mobile device.    In certain embodiments, clients
   20 may receive any suitable information, such as betting information, from betting
10 system platform 16 via mobile devices using, for example, communication networks
   44 and betting system interfaces 14.
           Telephone operators 34 may communicate betting information (such as event
   times, betting rules, betting options and odds, for example) to, and take bets 12 from,
   clients 20. Similarly, websites 36 may communicate betting information to clients 20
15 and allow clients 20 to place bets 12. One or more of such websites 36 may be hosted
   by one or more servers associated with system 10, which server or servers may also
   host betting system platform 16 in some embodiments. In some embodiments, betting
   information available to clients 20 via websites 36 may be updated substantially in
   real time or at preset intervals (such as every 30 seconds, for example) as new bets 12
20 are placed and/or as information regarding the event changes, for example.
           In some embodiments, one or more websites 36 may be provided by, or
   associated with, an Internet betting provider 46, for example.          Internet betting
   provider 46 may provide Internet account wagering by providing online betting
   accounts to one or more clients 20. Using an online betting account, a client 20 may
25 interface with one or more websites 36 associated with the Internet betting provider
   46 in order to fund the account, view betting information regarding betting events,
   and place bets (such as win bets 22 and/or group bets 24).          Such online betting
   accounts may include one or more various types of accounts, such as deposit
   accounts, credit accounts, stop-loss accounts, and hybrid accounts, for example.
30         Some or all of the betting system interfaces 14 of system 10 may be operable
   to offer or receive both win bets 22 and group bets 24.             However, in some
   embodiments, one or more betting system interfaces 14 may only offer or receive
   either win bets 22 or group bets 24.       For example, in a particular embodiment, a

                                             8
   website 36 may allow clients 20 to place both win bets 22 and group bets 24, while a
   particular OTB parlor 28 may only allow clients 20 to place win bets 22.
           As discussed above, betting system platform 16 is operable to receive bets 12
   (including both win bets 22 and group bets 24) from betting system interfaces 14,
 5 store the received bets 12, determine appropriate odds and payouts, and communicate
   such odds and payouts to one or more of the betting system interfaces 14, which may
   then display such odds and/or payouts to clients 20. As shown in FIGURE 1, betting
   system platform 16 includes a processor 38 coupled to a memory 40. Processor 38 is
   generally operable to execute various algorithms or calculations to determine current
10 odds data 50, such as current pool data 52, current odds data 54 and/or potential
   payout data 56, shown in FIGURES 2A, 2B and 2C, which are discussed below in
   greater detail.
           As discussed above, betting system platform 16 comprises processor 38 and
   memory 40.      Processor 38 may comprise any suitable processor that executes a
15 betting system software application 42 or other computer instructions, such as a
   central processing unit (CPU) or other microprocessor, and may include any suitable
   number of processors working together. Memory 40 may comprise one or more
   memory devices suitable to facilitate execution of the computer instructions, such as
   one or more random access memories (RAMs), read-only memories (ROMs),
20 dynamic random access memories (DRAMs), fast cycle RAMs (FCRAMs), static
   RAM (SRAMs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), erasable programmable
   read-only memories (EPROMs), electrically erasable programmable read-only
   memories (EEPROMs), microcontrollers, or microprocessors.
           Memory 40 is generally operable to store various information that may be
25 used by processor 38 in determining odds and/or payouts. For example, memory 40
   may comprise any suitable number of databases, which may be co-located or
   physically and/or geographically distributed. In the example shown in FIGURE 1,
   memory 40 may store any or all of the following: betting system software application
   42, current odds data 50, one or more event parameters 58, one or more bet
30 parameters 60, one or more calculation rules 62, one or more event results 64, and one
   or more bet results 66. Event parameters 58 may comprise various parameters of one
   or more betting events, such as, for example, the type of event, the time, date and
   location of the event and/or the number (or in some cases, the name) of each of the

                                                9
   participants in the event. Bet parameters 60 may comprise various parameters of one
   or more received bets 12, such as the identity of the client 20 who placed the bet 12,
   the manner in which the bet 12 was placed (such as via telephone, the Internet, or in
   person at a track or OTB establishment, for example), the type of bet 12 (such as
 5 whether the bet 12 is a win bet 22 or a group bet 24, for example), the commission
   rate on the bet 12, the participant or participants covered by the bet 12 and/or the
   amount of the bet 12, for example.         Calculation rules 62 may comprise various
   equations or other algorithms to be used by processor 38 in determining various
   current odds data 50. Examples of such equations are illustrated and discussed below
10 with reference to FIGURES 3A and 3B. Event results 64 may comprise various data
   regarding the results of one or more betting events, such as the final position of each
   participant in an event, whether there was a tie for any position and/or whether any
   participants did not finish the event, for example.       Bet results 66 may comprise
   various data regarding the results of various bets 12, such as the identity of the client
15 20 who placed the bet 12, whether the bet 12 was a winning bet, the determined
   payout for the bet 12 and/or whether the payout was distributed to the client 20, for
   example.
            As discussed above, one or more communications networks 18 couple and
   facilitate wireless or wireline communication between one or more betting system
20 interfaces 14 and betting system platform 16. Each communication network 18 may
   include one or more servers, routers, switches, repeaters, backbones, links and/or any
   other appropriate type of communication devices coupled by links such as wire line,
   optical, wireless, or other appropriate links. In general, each communication network
   18 may include any interconnection found on any communication network, such as a
25 local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network
   (WAN), the Internet, portions of the Internet, or any other data exchange system.
            As discussed above, processor 38 is operable to execute betting system
   software application 42 to determine current odds data 50, such as current pool data
   52, current odds data 54 and/or potential payout data 56, shown in FIGURES 2A, 2B
30 and 2C. Processor 38 may determine such current odds data 50 based at least on data
   received from memory 40 and/or one or more betting system interfaces 14.               In
   addition, processor 38 may update such current odds data 50 based on new
   information being received by betting system platform 16. In some embodiments,

                                               10
   processor 38 may update current odds data 50 in real time, substantially in real time,
   or at preset intervals (such as every 30 seconds, for example).
           As shown in FIGURE 1, current odds data 50 may be communicated to one or
   more betting system interfaces 14 via communications network 18, as indicated by
 5 arrow 70. Current odds data 50 may then be made available to clients 20, such as via
   tote boards or monitors 32 located at a track or OTB establishment, for example, or on
   an appropriate website 36 that may be accessed by clients 20, for example. In this
   manner, clients 20 may have access to real-time or substantially real-time current
   odds data 50 regarding various betting events.
10         FIGURES 2A, 2B and 2C illustrate example types of current odds data 50 for
   an example horse race in which Horse #4 is the favorite and a group bet 24 is offered
   which covers Horse #1, Horse #2, Horse #3 and Horse #5 (all horses except Horse
   #4). FIGURE 2A illustrates current pool data 52 reflecting the current total amount,
   or the current stake, of win bets 22 on each horse and the current total amount, or the
15 current stake, of group bets 24. Thus, FIGURE 2A illustrates the total current win bet
   stake on each horse, as well as the total current group bet stake on the group bet 24.
           FIGURE 2B illustrates current odds data 54 reflecting the current odds on the
   win bet 22 for each horse and current odds on the group bet 24, both without and with
   take-out at a 15% rate. FIGURE 2C illustrates potential payout data 56 reflecting the
20 potential payout for each win bet 22 for each horse and the potential payout for the
   group bet 24 if betting were closed at that point (in other words, if no additional bets
   were accepted for that betting event). FIGURE 2C illustrates the potential payout for
   each bet both without and take-out at a 15% rate.
           As discussed above, processor 38 may calculate various current odds data 50
25 using various algorithms or equations. FIGURES 3A and 3B illustrate examples of
   such algorithms or equations in accordance with one embodiment of the present
   invention.    In particular, FIGURES 3A and 3B illustrates various equations for
   calculating the current potential payout for each bet 12, including both win bets 22
   and group bets 24, associated with a particular betting event. The equations shown in
30 FIGURES 3A and 3B are similar; however, the equations shown in FIGURES 3A
   account for take-out, while the equations shown in FIGURES 3A do not.                The
   equations shown in FIGURES 3A and 3B are best understood when viewed in
   conjunction with FIGURES 4A-4F, as discussed below.

                                               11
           As discussed above, FIGURE 3A illustrates various equations for calculating
   the current potential payout for both win bets 22 and group bets 24, accounting for
   take-out (commission).     In particular, FIGURE 3A illustrates an after-commission
   (AC) group bet pool equation 100; a participant's AC win bet stake equation 102; a
 5 total AC win bet stake equation 104; an AC group-participant win bet pool equation
   106; a total AC pool on all participants equation 108; an AC group bet pool allocation
   equation 110; a participant's total AC stake equation 112; a pair of alternative total
   AC group bet payout equations, 114A and 114B; a total AC group bet profit equation
   116; a pair of alternative AC payout per group bet unit currency equations, 11 8A and
10 118B; a pair of alternative total AC win bet payout equations, 120A and 120B; a total
   AC win bet profit equation 122; and a pair of alternative AC payout per win bet unit
   currency equations, 124A and 124B.
           The AC group bet pool equation 100 may be used to determine the after
   commission group bet pool, which is equal to the before-commission (BC) group bet
15 pool minus the take-out. In some embodiments, the take-out is a percentage of each
   bet 12, and the total take-out for an event is thus that percentage of the total pool. For
   example, if the take-out rate is 15%, the take-out on each win bet 22 or group bet 24 is
   equal to 15% of such win bet 22 or group bet 24, and the total take-out for the event is
   15% of the total pool for the event.        However, it should be understood that in
20 alternative embodiments, the take-out (commission) may be otherwise calculated. For
   example, a separate take-out rate may be charged for win bets 22 and group bets 24.
           The participant's AC win bet stake equation 102 may be used to determine the
   total AC win bet stake on each participant in the event. According to equation 102,
   the AC win bet stake on each participant is equal to the BC win bet stake on that
25 participant minus the take-out.
           The total AC win bet stake equation 104 may be used to determine the total
   AC win bet stake on all participants, which equals the sum of the AC win bet stake on
   each participant (as determined using equation 102).
           The AC group-participant win bet pool equation 106 may be used to determine
30 the total AC stake of win bets 22 on each participant in the group, or subset, of
   participants covered by the group bet 24. The participants in the group of participants
   covered by the group bet 24 may be referred to as the "grouped participants."          For
   example, in a 5 horse race in which Horse #4 is the favorite and a group bet covers

                                               12
   Horses #1, 2, 3 and 5, the group-participant win bet pool equation 106 may be used to
   determine the total AC stake of win bets 22 placed on Horses #1, 2, 3 and 5.
           The total AC pool on all participants equation 108 may be used to determine
   the total AC pool, including the total pool of back bets 22 and group bets 24.
 5 According to equation 108, the total AC pool is the sum of the total AC win bet stake
   (as determined by equation 104) and the AC group bet pool (as determined by
   equation 100).
           The AC group bet pool allocation equation 110 may be used to determine the
   allocation of the AC group bet pool among each of the grouped participants.
10 According to equation 110, the AC group bet pool (as determined using equation 100)
   is allocated among the grouped participants in direct proportion to the stake of AC
   win bets 22 placed on each of the grouped participants (as determined using equation
   102).
           The participant's total AC stake equation 112 may be used to determine the
15 total AC stake on each participant in an event. According to equation 112, the total
   AC stake on each participant is the sum of the AC win bet stake on that participant (as
   determined using equation 102) and the portion of the AC group bet pool allocated to
   that participant (as determined using equation 110).
           Each of the alternative total AC group bet payout equations, 114A and 114B,
20 may be used to determine the potential total AC payout for the AC group bet pool if
   each participant were to win the event. According to equation 114A, the total AC
   group bet payout for each particular participant is based on the total AC stake on all
   participants except for the particular participant (as determined using equation 112),
   the total AC stake on the particular participant (as determined using equation 112),
25 and the portion of the AC group bet pool allocated to the particular participant (as
   determined using equation 110). According to equation 114B, the total AC group bet
   payout for each particular participant is based on the total AC pool on all participants
   (as determined using equation 108), the portion of the AC group bet pool allocated to
   the particular participant (as determined using equation 110), and the total AC stake
30 on the particular participant (as determined using equation 112).
           It should be understood that using the equations shown in FIGURE 3A, the
   AC group bet payout will be the same if any of the subset of participants covered by
   the group bet 24 wins the event. Thus, by placing a group bet 24, a bettor may

                                                13
   effectively bet against a particular participant (the participant excluded from the
   subset of participants covered by the group bet 24), and be assured of a particular
   payout if any of the participants covered by the group bet 24 wins the event.
           The total AC group bet profit equation 116 may be used to determine the
 5 potential total AC profit on the AC group bet pool if each participant were to win the
   event. According to equation 116, the total AC group bet profit is equal to the total
   AC group bet payout (as determined using equation 114) minus the total BC group bet
   pool.
           Each of the alternative AC payout per group bet unit currency equations, 11 8A
10 and 118B, may be used to determine the potential AC payout per unit of currency
   (such as one dollar, one pound, or other unit of currency) wagered on group bet 24 if
   the group bet 24 were to win. For example, equations 11 8A and/or 11 8B may be used
   to determine the potential AC payout per dollar wagered on group bet 24.
           According to equation 118A, the potential AC payout per unit currency for
15 each group bet 24 is based on the BC group bet pool and the total AC group bet
   payout (as determined using equation 114).           According to equation 118B, the
   potential AC payout per unit currency for each group bet 24 is based on the total AC
   pool on all participants (as determined using equation 108), the total AC stake on a
   particular participant (as determined using equation 112), the portion of the AC group
20 bet pool allocated to the particular participant (as determined using equation 110), and
   the AC group bet pool (as determined using equation 100).
           Each of the alternative total AC win bet payout equations 120 may be used to
   determine the potential total AC payout for the total AC win bet stake on each
   particular participant if that participant were to win the event. According to equation
25 120A, the total AC win bet payout for each particular participant is based on the total
   AC stake on all participants except for the particular participant (as determined using
   equation 112), the total AC stake on the particular participant (as determined using
   equation 112), and the AC win bet stake on the particular participant (as determined
   using equation 102). According to equation 120B, the total AC win bet payout for
30 each particular participant is based on the total AC pool on all participants (as
   determined using equation 108), the AC win bet stake on the particular participant (as
   determined using equation 102), and the total AC stake on the particular participant
   (as determined using equation 112).

                                               14
           The total AC win bet profit equation 122 may be used to determine the
   potential total AC profit on the total win bet stake on each particular participant if that
   participant were to win the event. According to equation 122, the potential AC profit
   on the total win bet stake on each participant is equal to the potential total AC win bet
 5 payout for that participant (as determined using equation 120) minus the total BC win
   bet stake on that participant.
           Each of the alternative AC payout per win bet unit currency equations 124
   may be used to determine the potential AC payout per unit of currency (such as one
   dollar, one pound, or other unit of currency) wagered on each win bet 22 if that win
10 bet 22 were to win.      For example, equations 124A and/or 124B may be used to
   determine the potential payout per dollar wagered on each winning win bet 22.
           According to equation 124A, the potential AC payout per unit currency for
   each win bet 22 on a particular participant is based on the total BC win bet stake for
   that participant and the potential AC total win bet payout for that participant (as
15 determined using equation 120).        According to equation 124B, the potential AC
   payout per unit currency for each win bet 22 on a particular participant is based on the
   total AC pool on all participants (as determined using equation 108) and the total BC
   stake on the particular participant (as determined using equation 138, shown in
   FIGURE 3B).
20         As discussed above, FIGURE 3B illustrates various equations for calculating
   the current potential payout for both win bets 22 and group bets 24, without
   accounting for take-out (commission). In particular, equations FIGURE 3B illustrates
   a total BC win bet stake equation 130; a BC group-participant win bet pool equation
   132; a total BC pool on all participants 134; a group bet pool allocation equation 136;
25 a participant's total stake equation 138; a pair of alternative total group bet payout
   equations, 140A and 140B; a total group bet profit equation 142; a pair of alternative
   payout per group bet unit currency equations, 144A and 144B; a pair of alternative
   total win bet payout equations, 146A and 146B; a total win bet profit equation 148;
   and a pair of alternative payout per win bet unit currency equations, 150A and 150B.
30 Equations 130 through 150 are similar to equations 104 through 124, respectively,
   shown in FIGURE 3A, but without accounting for take-out.
           FIGURES 4A through 4F may be used to illustrate the calculation of payouts
   and profits for win bets 22 and group bets 24 for various results of an example horse

                                               15
   race using the example equations shown in FIGURES 3A and 3B in accordance with
   an embodiment of the present invention. In the example shown in FIGURES 4A
   through 4F, the horse race is a five-horse race, Horse #4 is the favorite, and a group
   bet 24 is provided which covers Horses #1, 2, 3 and 5 (all horses except Horse #4). It
 5 should be understood that the payouts and profits calculated as described above may
   comprises potential payouts and profits, which may be calculated and/or updated
   dynamically prior to the race, or actual payouts and profits, which may be calculated
   after betting on the race has been closed, or after the race has been run and/or declared
   "official."
10         Each of FIGURES 4A through 4E illustrates the calculation of the potential
   payouts and profits for win bets and group bets if a particular horse were to win the
   race. In particular, FIGURE 4A illustrates the calculation of the potential payouts and
   profits if Horse #1 were to win; FIGURE 4B illustrates the calculation of the potential
   payouts and profits if Horse #2 were to win; FIGURE 4C illustrates the calculation of
15 the potential payouts and profits if Horse #3 were to win; FIGURE 4D illustrates the
   calculation of the potential payouts and profits if Horse #4 were to win; and FIGURE
   4E illustrates the calculation of the potential payouts and profits if Horse #5 were to
   win. In addition, each of FIGURES 4A through 4E illustrates the calculation of the
   potential payouts and profits before (or without) accounting for take-out and after (or
20 with) accounting for take-out.
           FIGURE 4A illustrates a payout table 200A and a stakes table 202. Payout
   table 200A indicates various payouts and profits assuming Horse #1 were to win.
   Such payouts and profits are based at least on stakes table 202 and one or more
   calculations shown in FIGURES 3A and 3B.
25         Payout table 200A includes various payouts and profits as calculated before
   commission (BC), as indicated by row 206A, and after-commission (AC), as indicated
   by row 204A. A take-out rate of 15% is used in this example. However, it should be
   understood that any suitable take-out rate may be used. For each case, BC and AC,
   payout table 200A indicates the take-out rate 208A; the total stake on all horses,
30 210A; the total stake on Horse #1, 212A; the total win bet payout if Horse #1 were to
   win, 214A; the payout per win bet unit currency if Horse #1 were to win, 216A; the
   total win bet profit if Horse #1 were to win, 218A; the total group bet payout if Horse

                                              16
   #1 were to win, 220A; the payout per group bet unit currency if Horse #1 were to win,
   222A; and the total group bet profit if Horse #1 were to win, 224A.
            Stakes table 202 includes a before-commission (BC) section 250 and an after
   commission (AC) section 252. BC section 250 indicates example current BC win bet
 5 stakes 254 on each horse, a current BC total of win bets on all horses 256, a BC
   group-participant win bet pool 258, an example current BC group bet pool 260, and
   the BC allocation of the group bet pool, indicated by reference number 262. AC
   section 252 indicates example current AC win bet stakes 270 on each horse, a current
   total of win bets on all horses 272, an AC group-participant win bet pool 274, an
10 example current AC group bet pool 276, and the allocation of the AC group bet pool,
   indicated by reference number 278.
           Various data within BC section 250 and AC section 252 may be determined
   using one or more calculations shown in FIGURES 3A and 3B.               For example,
   regarding BC section 250, the current BC total of win bets on all horses 256 may be
15 determined using equation 130; the BC group-participant win bet pool 258 may be
   determined using equation 132; and the BC allocation of the group bet pool, indicated
   as 262, may be determined using equation 136.
           Regarding AC section 252, the current AC win bet stakes 270 on each horse
   may be determined using equation 102; the current AC total of win bets on all horses
20 272 may be determined using equation 104; the AC group-participant win bet pool
   274 may be determined using equation 106; the current AC group bet pool 276 may
   be determined using equation 100; and the allocation of the AC group bet pool,
   indicated as 278, may be determined using equation 110.
           In addition, as discussed above, the payouts and profits shown in payout table
25 200A may be determined based on stakes table 202 using one or more calculations
   shown in FIGURES 3A and 3B. First, the various payouts and profits calculated with
   or after take-out, as indicated along row 204A, may be determined using one or more
   calculations shown in FIGURES 3A.          For example, the total stake on all horses
   (before take-out), 210A, may be determined using equation 136. The total AC stake
30 on Horse #1, 212A, may be determined using equation 112, for example. The total
   AC win bet payout if Horse #1 were to win, 214A, may be determined using either
   equation 120A or equation 120B, for example. The AC payout per win bet unit
   currency if Horse #1 were to win, 216A, may be determined using either equation

                                              17
   124A or 124B, for example. In the example shown in FIGURE 4A, the AC payout
   per win bet unit currency is defined as the AC payout per dollar wagered on a win bet
   on Horse #1.     The total AC win bet profit if Horse #1 were to win, 218A, may be
   determined using equation 122, for example. The total AC group bet payout if Horse
 5 #1 were to win, 220A, may be determined using either equation 114A or 114B, for
   example. The AC payout per group bet unit currency if Horse #1 were to win, 222A,
   may be determined using either equation 11 8A or 118B, for example. In the example
   shown in FIGURE 4A, the AC payout per group bet unit currency is defined as the
   payout per dollar wagered on the group bet 24. Finally, the total AC group bet profit
10 if Horse #1 were to win, 224A, may be determined using equation 116, for example.
            Similarly, the various payouts and profits calculated without or before take
   out, as indicated along row 206A, may be determined using one or more calculations
   shown in FIGURES 3B. For example, the total BC stake on Horse #1, 212A, may be
   determined using equation 138. The total win bet payout if Horse #1 were to win,
15 214A, may be determined using either equation 146A or 146B, for example.            The
   payout per win bet unit currency if Horse #1 were to win, 216A, may be determined
   using either equation 150A or 150B, for example. In the example shown in FIGURE
   4A, the payout per win bet unit currency is defined as the payout per dollar wagered
   on a win bet on Horse #1. The total win bet profit if Horse #1 were to win, 218A,
20 may be determined using equation 148, for example. The total group bet payout if
   Horse #1 were to win, 220A, may be determined using either equation 140A or 140B,
   for example. The payout per group bet unit currency if Horse #1 were to win, 222A,
   may be determined using either equation 144A or 144B, for example. In the example
   shown in FIGURE 4A, the payout per group bet unit currency is defined as the payout
25 per dollar wagered on the group bet 24. Finally, the total group bet profit if Horse #1
   were to win, 224A, may be determined using equation 142, for example.
           In this manner, the various payouts and profits included in payout table 200A
   may be determined for situations both with and without take-out. As discussed above,
   the various payouts and profits included in payout table 200A are relevant in the event
30 that Horse #1 wins the race. FIGURES 4B, 4C, 4D and 4E illustrate payout tables
   200B, 200C, 200D and 200E, respectively, which indicate the relevant payouts and
   profits in the event that Horse #2, Horse #3, Horse #4 or Horse #5, respectively, wins
   the race.

                                            18
           In view of FIGURES 4A, 4B, 4C and 4E, it can be seen that the potential total
   group bet payout (indicated as 220A, 220B, 220C and 220E, respectively) is the same
   ($4,000 without take-out and $3,400 with a 15% take-out rate) if any of the horses
   covered by the group bet 24 (Horses #1, #2, #3 and #5) win the race. However, as
 5 shown in FIGURE 4D, it can be seen that the potential total group bet payout 220D if
   the favorite horse (Horse #4) wins is zero.   It should be understood that in some
   alternative embodiments, the potential total group bet payout may not be different
   depending on which of the grouped participants wins the event.
           FIGURE 4F illustrates a payout table 240 which includes the potential after
10 commission payouts and profits for each of the five horses as determined above with
   reference to FIGURES 4A through 4E. In other words, table 240 combines the after
   commission rows shown in FIGURES 4A through 4E as rows 204A, 204B, 204C,
   204D and 204E.
           FIGURE 5 is a flowchart illustrating an example method of receiving,
15 managing, and paying win bets 22 and group bets 24 in accordance with an
   embodiment of the present invention. At step 300, win bets 22 are received from one
   or more clients 20 via one or more betting system interfaces 14, such as described
   above with reference to FIGURE 1. For example, in the example horse race discussed
   above with reference to FIGURES 4A through 4F, assume various win bets 22 are
20 received which create the win bet stakes for each horse shown in column 254 of
   FIGURE 4A. At step 302, group bets 24 are received from one or more clients 20 via
   one or more betting system interfaces 14, such as described above with reference to
   FIGURE 1. For example, in the example discussed above, assume various wagers are
   received on the group bet 24 covering Horses #1, #2, #3 and #5 which creates a
25 before-commission group bet pool 260 of $2,000 as shown in FIGURE 4A. In some
   situations, steps 300 and 302 may be occur simultaneously, or may at least partially
   overlap.
           Each win bet 22 or group bet 24 received at steps 200 and/or 302 may be
   stored at step 304, such as within memory 40, for example. A take-out (commission)
30 rate may be applied to each received win bet 22 and group bet 24 at step 306, such as
   described above with reference to FIGURE 4A. For example, regarding win bets 22,
   a take-out rate of 15% may be applied to received win bets 22 shown in column 254
   of FIGURE 4A to generate the after-commission win bet stakes for each horse shown

                                               19
   in column 270 of FIGURE 4A. Similarly, a take-out rate of 15% may be applied to
   each group bet 24, or to the group bet pool 260, to generate the after-commission
   group bet pool 276 of $1,700, as shown in FIGURE 4A.
            At step 308, each received group bet 24 may be divided and allocated among
 5 all participants covered by the group bet 24, or all grouped participants, such that the
   potential payout for the group bet 24 is related to the odds on the favorite participant,
   such as described above with reference to FIGURES 1 and 4A. For example, the
   after-commission group bet pool 276 may be divided an allocated as shown in column
   278 of FIGURE 4A.
10          At step 310, various odds, payouts and/or profits for some or all received
   and/or stored win bets 22, such as various current odds 50 or various payouts and
   profits shown in FIGURES 4A through 4F, for example, may be determined by
   betting system platform 16. For example, in the example discussed above, various
   win bet payouts and profits shown in table 200A of FIGURE 4A (and similarly for
15 those shown in tables 200B, 200C, 200D and 200E shown in FIGURES 4A, 4B, 4C
   and 4D, respectively) may be determined at step 310, such as the total win bet payout
   if Horse #1 were to win, 214A; the payout per win bet unit currency if Horse #1 were
   to win, 216A; and the total win bet profit if Horse #1 were to win, 218A. Step 310 is
   described in greater detail with reference to FIGURE 6.
20          At step 312, various odds, payouts and/or profits for some or all received
   and/or stored group bets 24, such as various current odds 50 or various payouts and
   profits shown in FIGURES 4A through 4F, for example, may be determined by
   betting system platform 16. For example, in the example discussed above, various
   group bet payouts and profits shown in table 200A of FIGURE 4A (and similarly for
25 those shown in tables 200B, 200C, 200D and 200E shown in FIGURES 4A, 4B, 4C
   and 4D, respectively) may be determined at step 312, such as the total group bet
   payout if Horse #1 were to win, 220A; the payout per group bet unit currency if Horse
   #1 were to win, 222A; and the total group bet profit if Horse #1 were to win, 224A.
   Step 312 is described in greater detail with reference to FIGURE 7.
30          At least portions of steps 310 and 312 may be performed simultaneously. In
   addition, in some embodiments, steps 310 and 312 are performed in real time,
   substantially in real time, or at preset intervals (such as every 30 seconds, for

                                                 20
   example) as win bets 22 and/or group bets 24 are received by betting system platform
   16.
            At step 314, it is determined whether the betting pool is closed.       In some
   embodiments, the betting pool, which includes all bets on the event to be considered
 5 in the final determination of payouts, may be closed substantially at the time of or
   after betting is closed on the event. For example, in some embodiments, bets which
   are made prior to the close of betting but are processed (at least partially) after the
   close of betting (such as due to processing and transmission delays, for example) may
   be included within the betting pool.
10          If the betting pool is still open, the method may return to steps 300 through
   312 to receive and store additional win bets 22 and/or group bets 24, and to
   recalculate the current odds, payouts and/or profits. In this manner, betting system
   platform 16 may update the current odds, payouts and/or profits associated with the
   various bets 12 associated with the event.        In some embodiments, betting system
15 platform 16 may perform such updates continuously and/or in real time, substantially
   in real time, or at preset intervals (such as every 30 seconds, for example).
            Thus, it should be understood that each time the method returns to steps 300
   through 312 while the betting pool remains open, the allocation of the group bet pool
   is recalculated at step 308 for newly received win bets 22 and/or group bets 24. In
20 this manner, the allocation of the group bet pool may be continuously (or at preset
   intervals) updated in order to provide the appropriate win bet and group bet payouts
   (which are determined at steps 310 and 312, respectively.)
            If it is determined at step 314 that the betting pool is closed, the method
   proceeds to step 316. At step 316, it is determined whether any of the participants in
25 the event will not be competing in the event, such as if a participant is scratched,
   withdrawn, or becomes a non-runner, for example.           For example, betting system
   platform 16 may receive a notification that one or more of the participants has been
   withdrawn from the event prior to the start of the event. If it is determined at step 316
   that one or more participants will not be competing in the event, the method may
30 return to step 308 to recalculate the allocation of the group bet pool based on the
   updated set of participants in the event. Otherwise, the method may proceed to step
   318. In an alternative embodiment, if it is determined at step 316 that one or more
   participants will not be competing in the event, all group bets 24 may be cancelled,

                                               21
   and refunds may be issued for such group bets 24. It should be understood that step
   318 may be performed before, after, or both before and after step 314.
           At step 318, the results of the event are received, such as the final position of
   each participant in the event and whether there was a tie for any position, for example.
 5 At step 320, win bet payouts may be distributed to clients 20 who made win bets 22
   on the winning participant. For example, assuming in the example discussed above
   that Horse #1 won the race, win bet payouts may be distributed to clients 20 who
   made win bets 22 on Horse #1, which payouts may be based on payouts determined at
   step 310, such as payout per win bet unit currency if Horse #1 were to win, 216A, for
10 example. In some embodiments, win bet payouts may be distributed according to the
   final determination of win bet payouts made at step 310. In alternative embodiments,
   win bet payouts may be distributed according to a final determination of win bet
   payouts made after the betting closed or even after the event was completed.
           At step 322, group bet payouts may be distributed to clients 20 who made
15 winning group bets 24. For example, assuming in the example discussed above that
   Horse #1 won the race, the group bet 24 is a winning bet, and thus group bet payouts
   may be distributed to all clients 20 who wagered on the group bet 24. Such group bet
   payouts may be based on payouts determined at step 312, such as payout per group
   bet unit currency if Horse #1 were to win, 222A, for example. In some embodiments,
20 group bet payouts may be distributed according to the final determination of group bet
   payouts made at step 312. In alternative embodiments, group bet payouts may be
   distributed according to a final determination of group bet payouts made after the
   betting closed or even after the event was completed. In some situations, steps 320
   and 322 may be occur simultaneously, or may at least partially overlap.
25         FIGURE 6 is a flowchart illustrating an example method of determining
   various odds, payouts and/or profits for win bets 22, such as described above with
   reference to step 314 shown in FIGURE 5. This method may be used to determining
   various odds, payouts and/or profits for win bets 22 associated with each participant
   in an event. For example, in the example discussed above, the method may be used
30 to determine the payouts for win bets 22 made on each of the five horses. At step
   340, a participant in the set of participants in the event is selected. For example, in
   the example discussed above, Horse #1 may be selected first, and steps 342 through

                                               22
   350 may then be performed to determine the total win bet payout for win bets 22
   made on Horse #1.
           At step 342, the total after-commission (AC) stake on all non-selected
   participants is determined. For example, equation 112 shown in FIGURE 3B may be
 5 used to determine the total stake of each non-selected participant, and the total stake
   of each non-selected participant may be added together. In the example discussed
   above, the total after-commission (AC) stake on all non-selected participants is the
   total AC stake on Horses #2, 3, 4 and 5, which equals $10,710, as determined by
   adding the win bet and group bet stakes for Horses #2, 3, 4 and 5, as shown in
10 columns 270 and 278 of table 202 shown in FIGURE 4A.
           At step 344, the total AC stake on the selected participant is determined, such
   as using equation 112 shown in FIGURE 3B. In the example discussed above, the
   total AC stake on Horse #1 is $1,190, as shown in column 212A of table 200A shown
   in FIGURE 4A. The total AC win bet stake on the selected participant is determined
15 at step 346. In the example discussed above, the total AC win bet stake on Horse #1
   is $850, as shown in column 270 of table 202 shown in FIGURE 4A.
           At step 348, the total AC win bet payout for the selected participant is
   determined, such as using either equation 120A or 120B shown in FIGURE 3B. In
   the example discussed above, the total AC win bet payout for Horse #1 is $8,500, as
20 shown in column 214A of table 200A shown in FIGURE 4A.
           At step 350, the AC payout per win bet unit currency for the selected
   participant is determined, such as using either equation 124A or 124B shown in
   FIGURE 3B. This may comprise, for example, determining the payout per one dollar
   wagered on a win bet on the selected participant.
25         At step 352, it is determined whether there are any more participants in the set
   of participants in the event. If so, the method returns to repeat steps 340 through 350
   for each remaining participant. If not, the method ends. For example, in the example
   discussed above, 340 through 350 are repeated for Horses #2, 3, 4 and 5 to determine
   the payouts for win bets 22 made on each of the Horses #2, 3, 4 and 5.
30         FIGURE 7 is a flowchart illustrating an example method of determining
   various odds, payouts and/or profits for group bets 24, such as described above with
   reference to step 318 shown in FIGURE 5. For example, in the example discussed
   above, the method may be used to determine the payouts for group bets 24. At step

                                                23
   360, a participant in the set of participants in the event is selected. Steps 362 through
   370 are then performed, as discussed below, to determine the group bet payout if the
   selected participant were to win the event.       For example, in the example discussed
   above, Horse #1 may be selected first at step 360 to determine (at steps 362 to 370)
 5 the group bet payout if Horse #1 were to win the race.
           At step 362, the total after-commission (AC) stake on all non-selected
   participants is determined. For example, equation 112 shown in FIGURE 3B may be
   used to determine the total stake of each non-selected participant, and the total stake
   of each non-selected participant may be added together. In the example discussed
10 above, the total after-commission (AC) stake on all non-selected participants is the
   total AC stake on Horses #2, 3, 4 and 5, which equals $10,710, as determined by
   adding the win bet and group bet stakes for Horses #2, 3, 4 and 5, as shown in
   columns 270 and 278 of table 202 shown in FIGURE 4A.
           At step 364, the total AC stake on the selected participant is determined, such
15 as using equation 112 shown in FIGURE 3B. In the example discussed above, the
   total AC stake on Horse #1 is $1,190, as shown in column 212A of table 200A shown
   in FIGURE 4A. The AC portion of the group bet allocated to the selected participant
   (such as at step 312 shown in FIGURE 5) is determined at step 366. In the example
   discussed above, the AC portion of the group bet allocated to Horse #1 is $340, as
20 shown in column 278 of table 202 shown in FIGURE 4A.
           At step 368, the total AC group bet payout if the selected participant were to
   win the event is determined, such as using either equation 114A or 114B shown in
   FIGURE 3B. In the example discussed above, the total AC group bet payout if Horse
   #1 were to win the race is $3,400, as shown in column 220A of table 200A shown in
25 FIGURE 4A.
           At step 370, the AC payout per group bet unit currency for the selected
   participant is determined, such as using either equation 118A or 118B shown in
   FIGURE 3B. This may comprise, for example, determining the payout per one dollar
   wagered on the group bet 24.
30         At step 372, it is determined whether there are any more participants in the set
   of participants in the event. If so, the method returns to repeat steps 360 through 370
   for each remaining participant. If not, the method ends. For example, in the example

                                              24
   discussed above, 360 through 370 are repeated for Horses #2, 3, 4 and 5 to determine
   the payouts for group bets 24 if each of the Horses #2, 3, 4 and 5 were to win the race.
           It should be understood that in various embodiments, the steps of the methods
   shown in FIGURES 5, 6 and 7 may be performed in any suitable order and may
 5 overlap in whole or in part without departing from the scope of the present invention.
   In addition, various steps and methods shown in FIGURES 5, 6 and 7 may be
   performed in serial or parallel, notwithstanding the example representations shown in
   FIGURES 5, 6 and 7. For example, as discussed above, in some embodiments, steps
   310 and 312 shown in FIGURE 5 may be performed after step 314. As another
10 example, steps 320 and 322 shown in FIGURE 5 may be performed in series or in
   parallel without departing from the scope of the invention.
           Although embodiments of the invention and their advantages are described in
   detail, a person skilled in the art could make various alterations, additions, and
   omissions without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as
15 defined by the appended claims.

   11.     A non-transitory tangible computer-readable memory having embodied
   therein one or more programs designed to cause one or more computers of a betting
   computer system platform to:
30         receive at a computer of a betting computer system platform, via a computer
   network, from betting computer system interfaces, data representing one or more
   group bets, wherein each group bet specifies a respective subset of a set of
   participants in an event, being a bet that any participant of the specified subset will

                                                30
   win the event, the payoff of the group bet being substantially equal for a win by any
   participant of the subset, at least some of the group bets specifying subsets with four
   or more participants; and
           receiving, at the computer of the betting computer system platform, via a
 5 payment acceptor, payment associated with one or more bets; on receiving an
   indication of the winning participant at the computer of the betting computer system
   platform, determine, by the computer of the betting computer system platform, data
   representing payout amounts for the group bets based on whether the winning
   participant is a member of the bets' respective specified subsets, such that the payouts
10 for each winning group bet is substantially uniform regardless of which particular
   participant in the winning bet's respective subset is the winning participant.
