                                               ABSTRACT
The Wonnarua Arrangement is a specific set of governance and financial arrangements that allow
communities to transparently, lawfully, effectively and efficiently work with member corporate cross
jurisdictional government agencies and private entity members to bring about public programs
and/or assets for which full cost recovery through user charges is not possible or is not acceptable. It
entails establishing a group of people representing interests and sufficient rights agreed relevant to
bringing about an outcome or set of outcomes, or to bringing about outcome/s in a certain way in
situations where constraints prevent an appropriate investment from being otherwise made and
where full user pays cost recovery is neither desirable nor achievable. As members of a group they
design projects sufficient to encourage investment by government and private investors with only
appropriate management and economic overhead as determined by the law and members of the
group. The project attracts higher funding via a variety of different possible schemes of arrangement
than otherwise would be the case because the project can be designed to implement and align
formal incentives and defined measurement processes that will iteratively encourage better
performance on sought outcomes. Specific governance as appropriate to the project is designed by
way of law, formal contract/s or by membership to networked cooperative entities with capital
structure and membership rules designed by the group members according to need. Where there is
incentive to do so the governance designed allows parts of government as funding members to
underwrite outcome risk for outcomes related to any other part of government in order to make
investment in the project more attractive to the private sector.

THE WONNARUA ARRANGEMENT - SPECIFIC GOVERNANCE AND FINANCIAL
ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW COMMUNITIES TO TRANSPARENTLY, LAWFULLY,
EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY WORK WITH MEMBER CORPORATE CROSS
JURISDICTIONAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PRIVATE ENTITY MEMBERS TO BRING
ABOUT PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND/OR ASSETS FOR WHICH FULL COST RECOVERY THROUGH
USER CHARGES IS NOT POSSIBLE OR IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.
In managing highest accountability of its resources, current systems of government restrict
unauthorised cost transfers from one part of government to another. As a result it can be complex
and onerous to gain cross-departmental resourcing appropriate to the total business case of an
integrated project (ie to mount a project requiring different parts of government to coordinate
resources and outcomes). As a result many quite deserving and sometimes quite important public
benefit projects remain unfunded because where there is insufficient motivation by government,
cost negative outcomes sought by one department are often not considered as cost positive
outcomes for another part of government, even when the summation of the two outcomes is in fact
a realisable net benefit to government. In other cases the overhead in commercial arrangements
institutionalised for the usually much larger projects is too high and the complexity of the
multitudionous authorities required to do it otherwise, is not viable for smaller community projects
or projects with marginal or "difficult" business cases. The communities wanting such projects are
therefore disempowered and sometimes become disengaged to the detriment of all.
This invention expands upon and generalises the essential elements of the Social Impact Bond
mechanism being currently used to satisfy government's preference to replace ongoing public
expenditures with private sector services wherever appropriate. A "no cost transfer" mindset and a
service-oriented development story seems to have unnecessarily restricted their use away from
projects where government resourcing on one side of the SIB mechanism could be being used for
projects measured and driven by another part of government in exactly the same way that any
single private entity can deal legally with two different parts of government at the same time within
a single privately managed project so long as each of the component transactions are at arm's length
and subject to its appropriate authority. To supercede these unnecessary restrictions, the invention
is designed with two necessary combining components :
1. Firstly a design that allows one part of government to participate in a measured collaboration
     with a scheme of arrangement involving one or more independent second parties while another
     part of government participates at the same time in the same collaboration and possibly also in
     an associated scheme of arrangement (possibly in a different role) because its participation
     produces a better business case for government than if just one part of government participated
     in the measured collaboration. (This is a new use of an old art AND it specifically includes
     funding of assets as well as services) COMBINED WITH

2.   A design for governance arrangements that allow transparent, lawful, effective and efficient
     participation by public and private entities with controls as appropriate to the level of
     resourcing, benefits and risks associated with the project or program and the outcomes either
     sought or possible as a result of the possibly ongoing and multi-threaded collaboration.
The best way of putting this invention into effect is to provide a governance environment that is
flexible and only as complex as it needs to be to provide the level of governance commensurate with
the project/s or program/s being managed. Because these could
     "    be as simple as the provision of a single short cycleway,
     e    involve active program/s supporting such an investment so as to achieve a successful
          business case for a possibly smaller population,
     e    involve investment in assets worth many millions of dollars (eg funding aircraft within
          foreign investment restrictions, water infrastructure)
     e    involve complex conflicts of interest,
I contend that the "best way" for putting this invention into effect is to implement the governance
environment on the basis of cooperative principles, with extra mechanisms available for dealing with
situations where significant disagreements or conflicts of interest can arise. Where the risk of
disagreement or conflict of interest is assessed to be of a sufficient level, a more complex
arrangement is required.
With low risk the minimum elements required to ensure appropriate government audits can occur
needs minimal corporate structure overhead. In that case the arrangement can be implemented via
contracts with no new entity or entities needed.
At the other end of the scale, the need for strong conflict resolution processes as well as clear
processes for removing conflicts of interest, necessitates a more complex architecture. Although
details of the business rules required will usually need to be implemented by the prospective
members at the time of incorporation, the Wonnarua Arrangement includes a structure template
that will also cope with expansion of goals and/or the possibility of changes in a particular
collaborative environment after incorporation of the cooperative.
At every level of complexity the Wonnarua Arrangement design is intended to include provisions
that will allow escalation of governance at the behest of the members.
There is design for the possibility that some community projects could require specific skills and
associations to manage risks according to the expectation of the public regarding an underlying
asset, project, program or environment. This includes a template for managing voting rights by
cooperative principles in the more complex arrangements where projects involving future
environmental outcomes may determine that government members, native title holders or any
other biodiversity custodian should have a greater say than members representing a development or

other interest group. The specific method for managing voting rights would then be negotiated
according to need as part of the collaborating entity's or entities' incorporation/s.

             a)     Each member expressing their preference for a decision via a majority or otherwise
                    defined and agreed scheme of voting counted up by virtue of their authenticated
                    membership of one of the cooperatives;
             b) Each member of each cooperative nominating what they believe is an appropriate
                    weighting for the final vote of their cooperative relative to the weighting given to other
                    cooperatives' votes, a minimum acceptable relative weighting for the vote of their
                    cooperative as well as weightings they think appropriate for the final majority vote of
                    each of the other cooperatives for the purpose of the decision making under
                    consideration;
             c) A method of near-instantaneously displaying of the gaps between the average and
                    standard deviation of each cooperative's and the whole group's average proposed
                    relative weightings for that same cooperatives' vote, as compared to the average and
                    standard deviation of the floor levels nominated by each member of each component
                    cooperative for the weighting preferred for her/his cooperative;
             d) A system that only delivers a legal decision when all minimum quora are achieved and
                    where, as part of the final decision making for that same vote, the average relative
                    weighting given to the majority or final vote of each incentive class in calculating the
                    final voted decision of the trust was made using relative weightings obtained by
                    averaging the proposed relative weighting for each incentive class averaged across all
                    voters of all incentive classes and where for each component cooperative that average
                    weighting is the same or higher than the average relative weighting minimum floor level
                    set for that particular vote where the floor level is calculated as the average of the

            member of only that cooperative as part of that same vote;
         e) A process and systems allowing members to reach a legal authenticated and auditable
            vote;
         f) Systems and or communication processes to ensure gaps can be closed in a timely and
            efficient manner that include provisions discouraging obstructive practices.
