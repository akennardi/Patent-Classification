                                   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         [2]     This invention relates to methods for controlling parasitic infestations of
animals and their environments, and, more particularly, to methods using isoxazolines to
control parasites in or on animals or in their environments, as well as treat parasitoses of
animals. The isoxazolines include 4-(isoxazolinyl)-benzamides (specifically, substituted A
(5-(halomethyl)-5-phenyl-isoxazolin-3-yl)-benzamides) and 4-(isoxazolinyl)
benzothioamides (specifically, substituted 4-(5-(halomethyl)-5-phenyl-isoxazolin-3-yl)
benzothioamides). This invention also relates to compositions comprising the isoxazolines for
use in such methods, the use of the isoxazolines to make medicaments for use in such
methods, and kits comprising the isoxazolines for carrying out such methods. This invention
further relates to the use of the isoxazolines as medicaments, particularly medicaments that
can be used in the above-referenced methods.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
         [3]     A number of pests and parasites are known to infest warm-blooded animals.
These pests and parasites can be great nuisances to both the animals and their owners. For
example, virtually all companion and livestock animals can be affected by ectoparasites, such
as ticks, mites, lice, and fleas. Ectoparasites tend to irritate the animals, and also can cause
clinical disease and adverse sub-clinical conditions, either by themselves or by carrying
vector-transmitted pathogens. To date, various treatments have been developed to control
ectoparasites on warm-blooded animals. Nevertheless, a need continues to exists for
compositions (and methods for their use) that are bioavailable, can provide contact or
systemic activity, are potently efficacious, have a quick onset of
                                                  1

   activity, have a long duration of activity, and/or are safe to the animal recipients and/or
   their human owners. This invention addresses this need.
                                  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 5          [4]     Briefly, this invention is generally directed to isoxazoline compositions
   (particularly 4-(isoxazolinyl)-benzamide compositions (also known as, for example, "4
   (4,5-dihydroisoxazole-3-yl)-benzoic acid amide" compositions) and 4-(isoxazolinyl)
   benzothioamide compositions (also known as, for example, "4-(4,5-dihydroisoxazole-3
   yl)-benzothioamide" compositions)), and their use to control ectoparasites in or on warm
10 blooded animals. In accordance with this invention, it has been discovered that these
   compositions generally show desirable bioavailability, and can provide contact and/or
   systemic activity. Many of the compositions also provide desirable safety profiles toward
   the warm-blooded animal recipients and/or their owners. In addition, it has been
   discovered that a single administration of such compositions generally provides potent
15 activity against one or more ectoparasites, while also tending to provide fast onset of
   activity, long duration of activity, and/or desirable safety profiles.
            151     This invention, therefore, is directed, in part, to a method for controlling
   ectoparasitic infestation of an animal. The method comprises administering isoxazoline, a
   salt of the isoxazoline, or a solvate of the isoxazoline or salt to the animal. The
20 isoxazoline corresponds in structure to Formula(I):
                                                                    z2

           [169]  The isoxazolines used in this invention generally can have two or more
   conformational structures. At minimum, for example, all the isoxazolines comprise a
   chiral (or asymmetric) carbon at the 5-position of the isoxazoline ring. In some
10 embodiments, for example, the chiral carbon has a left-handed (or "S" or "sinister")
   configuration. Such isoxazolines include those having the following structure:

            [170]  The isoxazolines may additionally have other conformational isomers, such
10 as, for example, substituents with a cis or trans double bond.
            [171]  A specific isomer often can be isolated from the corresponding racemic
   mixture (or a salt thereof) using, for example, chiral high performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) techniques. Such a technique is illustrated in Example 7 below
   for isolating the R and S enantiomers of racemic Compound 11-1. In some instances
                                               41

   when an isomer is difficult to separate, a more-easily-isolatable derivative of the isomer is
   isolated from the corresponding derivative racemic mixture (or a salt thereof), and then
   converted to the isomer. Alternatively, a specific isomer often can be directly synthesized
   from, for example, an optically pure starting material.
 5           [172]   In some embodiments, the ratio of one enantiomer (e.g., Compound 17-1)
   to another enantiomer (e.g., Compound 11-IR) in the pharmaceutical composition used
   with this invention is greater than 1:1. In some instances, for example, the ratio is greater
   than about 70:30, greater than about 85:15, greater than about 90:10, greater than about
   95:5, greater than about 98:2, or greater than about 99:1.
10           [173]   In some embodiments, the concentration of one enantiomer (e.g.,
   Compound 17-1) in the composition (or, more typically, a precursor composition) is
   greater than about 50% (by weight). In some such embodiments, for example, the
   concentration is greater than about 70% (by weight), greater than about 85% (by weight),
   greater than about 90% (by weight), greater than about 95% (by weight), greater than
15 about 98% (by weight), greater than about 99% (by weight), or greater than about 99.5%
   (by weight).
             [174]   Unless otherwise stated, a isoxazoline structure that does not indicate a
   particular conformation is intended to encompass compositions of all the possible
   conformational isomers of the isoxazoline, as well as compositions comprising fewer than
20 all (e.g., just one of) the possible conformational isomers.
                                       J. Salts of the isoxazolines
             [175]   As noted above, many isoxazolines used with this invention may be in the
   form of a salt. A salt may be advantageous due to one or more of its physical properties,
25 such as pharmaceutical stability in differing temperatures and humidities; crystalline
   properties; and/or a desirable solubility in water, oil, or other solvents. Acid and base salts
   typically can be formed by, for example, mixing a compound with an acid or base,
   respectively, using various known methods in the art. In general, when the salt is intended
   to be administered in vivo (i.e., to an animal) for a therapeutic benefit, the salt preferably is
30 pharmaceutically acceptable.
             [176]   In some instances, a base addition salt of a isoxazoline of Formula (I) can
   be prepared by reacting the isoxazoline with an approximately stoichiometric amount of
   an inorganic or organic base, typically a strong inorganic or organic base. Examples of
                                                 42

   base addition salts may include, for example, metallic salts, and organic salts. Metallic
   salts, in particular, include alkali metal (group Ta, e.g., lithium, sodium, or potassium)
   salts, alkaline earth metal (group Ila, e.g., barium, calcium, and magnesium) salts, heavy
   metal (e.g., zinc and iron) salts, and other physiologically acceptable metal salts. Such
 5 salts may be made from calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and zinc. For
   example, a free acid isoxazoline may be mixed with sodium hydroxide to form such a base
   addition salt.
            [177]   In some instances, an acid addition salt of a isoxazoline of Formula (I) can
   be prepared by reacting the isoxazoline with an approximately stoichiometric amount of
10 an inorganic or organic acid. Examples of contemplated inorganic acids for making
   pharmaceutically acceptable salts include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric,
   carbonic, sulfuric, and phosphoric acid. Examples of often suitable organic acids for
   making pharmaceutically acceptable salts generally include, for example, aliphatic,
   cycloaliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic, carboxylic, and sulfonic classes of
15 organic acids. Specific examples of organic acids include cholic, sorbic, lauric, acetic,
   trifluoroacetic, formic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, gluconic, digluconic, lactic, malic,
   tartaric acid, citric, ascorbic, glucuronic, maleic, fumaric, pyruvic, aspartic, glutamic, aryl
   carboxylic acid (e.g., benzoic), anthranilic acid, mesylic, stearic, salicylic, p
   hydroxybenzoic, phenylacetic, mandelic, embonic (pamoic), alkylsulfonic (e.g.,
20 ethanesulfonic), arylsulfonic (e.g., benzenesulfonic), pantothenic, 2
   hydroxyethanesulfonic, sulfanilic, cyclohexylaminosulfonic,         -hydroxybutyric, galactaric,
   galacturonic, adipic, alginic, butyric, camphoric, camphorsulfonic, cyclopentanepropionic,
   dodecylsulfic, glycoheptanoic, glycerophosphic, heptanoic, hexanoic, nicotinic, 2
   naphthalesulfonic, oxalic, palmoic, pectinic, 3-phenylpropionic, picric, pivalic, thiocyanic,
25 tosylic, and undecanoic acid.
            [178]   In some instances, an organic salt of a isoxazoline of Formula (I) may be
   made by, for example, quaternizing a basic nitrogen-containing group on the isoxazoline
   with an agent such as a CI-C 6 -alkyl halide (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides,
   bromides, or iodide), dialkyl sulfate (e.g., dimethyl, diethyl, dibuytl, or diamyl sulfate),
30 long chain halide (e.g., decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides, and
   iodide), arylalkyl halide (e.g., benzyl and phenethyl bromide), and the like.
                                                 43

            [179]  It should be understood that the counterion of an acid or base salt may, in
   some instances, be optically active (e.g., D-lactate and L-lysine salts) or racemic (e.g., DL
   tartrate and DL-arginine salts).
 5                                 K. Solvates of the isoxazolines
            [180]  In some instances, the isoxazolines of Formula (I) are in the form of stable
   complexes with solvent molecules that remain intact after the non-complexed solvent
   molecules are removed from the compounds. These complexes generally are referred to
   as "solvates." In some instances, the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example
10 when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated into the crystal lattice of the
   crystalline solid. A "solvate" encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates.
   Examples of suitable solvates include ethanolates, methanolates, and the like. A "hydrate"
   is a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is water. A solvate intended to be used in vivo
   preferably is pharmaceutically acceptable.
15
                                  L. Prodrugsof the isoxazolines
            [181]  It is contemplated that prodrugs of the isoxazolines of Formula (I) may be
   used with methods of this invention. As used in this patent, the term "prodrug" is a
   compound that is convertible in use (e.g., in vivo) by metabolic means or another
20 processes (e.g., hydrolysis) to a isoxazoline of Formula (I). In some embodiments,
   delivery of the isoxazoline in a prodrug form achieves improved delivery of the
   isoxazoline by improving its physicochemical or pharmacokinetic properties by, for
   example, enhancing systemic absorption, delaying clearance, or delaying breakdown in
   vivo.

   H.       Preparation of isoxazolines of Formula (I)

   isoxazolines of Formula (I) may be prepared using, for example, the methods illustrated
15 in these references, either alone or in combination with other techniques known in the art.
   HI.      Treatment Methods Using a Composition of this Invention
            [183]   The isoxazolines of Formula (I) generally may be used to control
   ectoparasites on animals, and, in turn, diseases directly caused by such ectoparasites
20 and/or diseases caused by pathogens carried by such ectoparasites. It is contemplated that
   the composition may be used to treat a range of animals, especially warm-blooded
   animals. Such warm-blooded animals include, for example, mammals. Mammals include,
   for example, humans. Other mammals include, for example, farm or livestock mammals
   (e.g., swine, bovines, sheep, goats, etc.), laboratory mammals (e.g., mice, rats, jirds, etc.),
25 companion mammals (e.g., dogs, cats, equines, etc.), fur-bearing animals (e.g., minks,
   foxes, chinchillas, rabbits, etc.), and wild and zoo mammals (e.g., buffalo, deer, etc.). In
   some embodiments, the compositions are used to treat canines (e.g., dogs, such as, for
   example, pure-bred and/or mongrel companion dogs, show dogs, working dogs, herding
   dogs, hunting dogs, guard dogs, police dogs, racing dogs, and/or laboratory dogs). In
30 other embodiments, the compositions are used to treat felines (e.g., domestic cats). It is
   contemplated that the compositions also are suitable to treat non-mammals, such as birds
   (e.g., turkeys, chickens, geese, ducks, parrots, etc.). It is also contemplated that such
                                                 45

   compositions may be useful to treat cold-blooded animals as well, such as, for example,
   fish (e.g., salmon, trout, koi, etc.).
            [184]    It has been discovered in accordance with this invention that the
   isoxazolines of Formula (I) are generally of particular value for controlling ectoparasites,
 5 i.e., arthropods that are injurious to, or spread or act as vectors of diseases in, warm
   blooded animals. The isoxazolines are generally beneficial for controlling various
   lifecycle stages of parasites, including egg, nymph, larvae, juvenile, and adult stages.
   Ectoparasites (generally insect and acarid pests) include the following.
   A.       Biting insects. These include, for example, migrating diperous larvae, such as, for
10          example, Hypoderma sp. in cattle, Gastrophilusin horses, and Cuterebrasp. in
            rodents; biting flies, such as, for example, bloodsucking adult flies (e.g., the horn
            fly (Haematobiairritans),horse flies (Tabanus spp.), stable flies (Stomoxys
            calcitrans),black flies (Simulium spp.), deer flies (Chrysops spp.), louse flies
            (Melophagus ovinus), tsetse flies (Glossina spp.)); parasitic fly maggots, such as,
15          for example, bot flies (Oestrus ovis and Cuterebraspp.), the blow flies (Phaenicia
            spp.), screwworms (Cochliomyia hominivorax), cattle grubs (Hypoderma spp.),
            and fleeceworms; and mosquitoes, such as, for example, Culex spp., Anopheles
            spp., and Aedes spp.
   B.       Mites. These include:
20          i.       Mesostigmata spp., such as mesostigmatids, which include chicken mites
                     (Dermanyssusgallinae).
            ii.      Astigmata spp., such as itch or scab mites, which include Sarcoptidae spp.
                     (e.g., Sarcoptes scabiei); and mange mites, which include Psoroptidaespp.
                     (e.g., Chorioptes bovis and Psoroptes ovis).
25          iii.     Prostigmataspp, such as chiggers, which include Trombiculidae spp. (e.g.,
                     North American chiggers, Trombicula alfreddugesi).
            iv.      Demodex.
   C.       Ticks. These include, for example, soft-bodied ticks, such as Argasidae spp. (e.g.,
            Argas spp. and Ornithodorosspp.); and hard-bodied ticks, such as Ixodidae spp.
30          (e.g., Ixodes ricinus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Haemaphysalisspp, Dermacentor
            reticulates,Dermacentorvariabilis,Amblyomma americanum, and Boophilus
            spp.).
                                                  46

   D.       Lice. These include, for example, chewing lice, such as Menopon spp. and
            Bovicola spp.; and sucking lice, such as Haematopinus spp., Linognathus spp., and
            Solenopotes spp.
   E.       Fleas. These include, for example, Ctenocephalides spp., such as dog fleas
 5          (Ctenocephalides canis) and cat fleas (Ctenocephalidesfelis); Xenopsylla spp.,
            such as oriental rat fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis); Pulex spp., such as human fleas
            (Pulex irritans);hedgehog fleas (Archaeopsylla erinacei); and bird fleas
            (Ceratophyllusgallinae).
   F.       True bugs. These include, for example, Cimicidae or the common bed bug (Cimex
10          lectularius);and Triatominae spp., such as triatomid bugs (also known as kissing
            bugs) (e.g., Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma spp.).
            [185]   An "infestation" refers to the presence of parasites in numbers that pose a
   risk of nuisance or harm to humans or animals. The presence can be in the environment
   (e.g., in animal bedding), on the skin or fur of an animal, etc. Unless otherwise stated,
15 when the infestation is within an animal (e.g., in the blood or other internal tissues), the
   term infestation is intended to be synonymous with the term, "infection," as that term is
   generally understood in the art.
            [186]   The phrase "control of ectoparasite infestation" means to reduce or
   eradicate parasite numbers in and/or on an animal, and/or to partially or completely inhibit
20 the development of parasite infestation in and/or on an animal. This may be achieved by,
   for example, killing, repelling, expelling, incapacitating, deterring, eliminating,
   alleviating, or minimizing the parasite. The control of ectoparasites can be insecticidal
   and/or acaricidal. The effect of the isoxazoline can be, for example, ovicidal, larvicidal,
   nymphicidal, adulticidal, or a combination thereof. In addition, the effect can manifest
25 itself directly by killing the parasites either immediately or after some time has elapsed
   (e.g., when molting occurs or by destroying eggs). The effect alternatively (or
   additionally) can manifest itself indirectly by, for example, reducing the number of eggs
   laid and/or the hatch rate.
            [187]   In general, an amount of a isoxazoline that is sufficient to "control" or be
30 "effective" against a target parasite is an amount that is sufficient to reduce or eradicate
   parasite numbers in and/or on an animal, and/or to partially or completely inhibit the
   development of parasite infestation in and/or on an animal. When the isoxazoline is
                                                 47

   administered systemically, an effective amount generally constitutes an amount that results
   in tissue and/or blood concentrations generally toxic when ingested by a target parasite.
            [188]  One of ordinary skill in the art typically can determine an "effective" dose
   by, for example, observing or detecting changes in a clinical condition or behavior of a
 5 host animal, as well as by observing or detecting relative changes in parasite numbers after
   such treatment. In general, a dose is considered effective for controlling a target parasite
   when the dose is sufficient to cause an existing or potential target parasite count to be
   reduced by at least about 5%. In some such instances, for example, the dose is considered
   effective when the dose is sufficient to cause an existing or potential parasite count to be
10 reduced by at least about 10% (or at least about 30%, at least about 50%, at least about
   60%, at least about 75%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99%).
            [189]  The optimum dosage generally depends on multiple factors, including, for
   example, the particular isoxazoline; the identity of any other active ingredient(s) being
   administered to the animal recipient; the route of administration; the type and severity of
15 the target condition and pathogen; the type (e.g., species and breed), age, size, sex, diet,
   activity, and condition of the intended animal recipient; and pharmacological
   considerations, such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology profiles of
   the isoxazoline and other active ingredient(s) being administered to the recipient animal.
   To the extent multiple active ingredients are administered for combined effects on a target
20 parasite or condition, the amount of each ingredient that constitutes an "effective amount"
   is an amount that, when combined with the other active ingredients, causes the desired
   effect.
            [190]  The isoxazolines of Formula (I) may be administered multiple times for a
   single treatment. Such multiple-dosage treatments are contemplated to include multiple
25 doses per day for one or more days, daily doses for multiple days, and/or doses
   administered two or more days apart. In some embodiments of this invention, however, a
   single dose is administered to effectively control a target parasite for a longer duration,
   such as, for example, at least about one week. In some such embodiments, for example,
   the single dose is effective to control a target parasite for at least about 2 weeks, at least
30 about 3 weeks, at least about 1 month, at least about 2 months, at least about 3 months, at
   least about 4 months, or at least about 6 months. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the
   frequency of treatments may be, for example, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly,
   quarterly, half yearly, or even longer (e.g., yearly).   The durations over which the
                                                48

   isoxazolines of Formula (I) tend to be effective against various ectoparasites by systemic
   administration is surprising. This is particularly true, given that such long activities may,
   in many instances, be obtained using low doses that are non-toxic to the animal recipients
   without requiring the use of a controlled-release means. Without being limited to any
 5 particular theory, it is hypothesized that this long duration of activity stems from the
   isoxazolines having particularly high toxicity when ingested by the target parasite.
           [191]   For many animal recipients, the isoxazoline dose and formulation are
   chosen to maintain a isoxazoline serum level of at least about 1 ng/ml (e.g., I to 50 ng/ml).
   In general, the amount of isoxazoline administered to the animal recipient is from about
10 0.001 to about 200 mg/kg body weight. In some embodiments, for example, from about
   0.01 to about 200 mg/kg body weight is administered. In other embodiments, for
   example, from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg body weight is administered. In some
   such embodiments, for example, from about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg body weight is
   administered. In other such embodiments, from about 1 to about 30 mg/kg body weight is
15 administered. Greater dosages tend to provide for greater duration of activity.
           [192]   It is contemplated that the duration of activity of a isoxazoline can be
   extended even further (or made more consistent) by using a controlled-release formulation
   or dosage form. For example, the isoxazoline can be administered in microspheres,
   granules, or implants (e.g., a subcutaneous implant) that release the isoxazoline by,
20 example, diffusion and/or erosion. Use of such a dosage form containing from about 1
   and about 50 mg/kg body weight (or from about 10 to about 30 mg/kg body weight, such
   as about 20 mg/kg of body weight) of the isoxazoline may allow for consistent activity
   lasting over several months or longer (e.g., a year).
           [193]   In some embodiments of this invention, a isoxazoline of Formula (I) is
25 administered to treat parasitoses of an animal (or make a medicament to treat parasitoses
   of an animal). The term "parasitoses" includes pathologic conditions and diseases
   associated with or caused by one or more ectoparasites directly, such as, for example,
   anemia and flea allergy dermatitis. It also includes pathologic conditions or diseases
   associated with caused by one or more vector-transmitted pathogens, such as, for example,
30 Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis (particularly canine ehrlichiosis), and Rocky Mountain spotted
   fever from vector ticks. The phrase "treatment of parasitoses" means to partially or
   completely inhibit the development of parasitoses of an animal susceptible to parasitoses,
   reduce or completely eliminate the symptoms of parasitoses of an animal having
                                                49

   parasitoses, and/or partially or completely cure parasitoses of an animal having
   parasitoses. In general, the treatment of parasitoses is achieved by administering a
   isoxazoline of Formula (I) to control an ectoparasite infestation.
            [194]   This invention also relates to treatment methods wherein at least an
 5 ancillary goal of controlling ectoparasites in and/or on an animal is to control an
   ectoparasitic infestation in an environment that is occupied (periodically or continuously)
   by the animal. In some such embodiments, for example, the animal is a companion animal
   (e.g., a cat or dog). The environment may be, for example, a house or other shelter; a
   room; a pen, a stall, or other confinement means; bedding; etc.
10          [195]   The terms "administer" and "administration" refer to the delivery of a
   isoxazoline of Formula (I), salt of the isoxazoline, solvate of the isoxazoline or salt, or
   prodrug of the isoxazoline. In some embodiments of this invention, systemic
   administration is desirable. "Systemic administration" is an administration at a site remote
   from a site wherein at least a portion of the target parasites reside. With systemic
15 administration, at least a portion of the isoxazoline reaches the target parasite via the
   animal recipient's bloodstream, other body fluids (lymph fluids), and/or tissues (e.g., skin
   or fat tissue). Typically, the parasite ingests the isoxazoline along with the animal
   recipient's blood, other body fluids, and/or tissue. Systemic administration may be
   achieved in several forms.
20          [196]   In some embodiments, the isoxazoline composition is systemically
   administered via an oral route in a unit dosage form, such as, for example, a soft or hard
   capsule, a pill, a powder, granules, a tablet (e.g., a chewable tablet), a paste, a solution, a
   suspension (aqueous or non-aqueous), an emulsion (oil-in-water or water-in-oil), an elixir,
   a syrup, a bolus, a drench, or via the animal recipient's feed or drinking water. When the
25 composition is administered via an animal's feed, it may, for example, be fed as a discrete
   feed or as a chewable treat. Alternatively (or additionally), it may, for example, be
   intimately dispersed in the animal recipient's regular feed, used as a top dressing, or in the
   form of pellets or liquid that is added to the finished feed. When the composition is
   administered as a feed additive, it may be convenient to prepare a "premix" in which the
30 composition is dispersed in a liquid or solid carrier. This "premix" is, in turn, dispersed in
   the animal's feed using, for example, a conventional mixer. When the composition is
   administered in the animal recipient's drinking water or as a drench, it may be convenient
   to use a solution or suspension formulation. This formulation can be, for example, a
                                                50

   concentrated suspension that is mixed with water or a dry preparation that is mixed and
   suspended in the water. In both instances, it is preferable to have the isoxazoline in a
   finely-pulverized form.
           [197]   The isoxazoline composition alternatively (or additionally) may be
 5 systemically administered topically using a transdermal formulation (i.e., a formulation
   that passes through the skin). Alternatively (or additionally), the composition may be
   systemically administered topically via the mucosa. Typical formulations for transdermal
   and mucosal administration include, for example, pour-ons, spot-ons, dips, sprays,
   mousses, shampoos, powders, gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments,
10 dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, limb bands, collars, ear tags,
   wafers, sponges, fibers, bandages, and microemulsions. The pour-on or spot-on methods,
   for example, comprise applying the isoxazoline composition to a specific location of the
   skin or coat, such as on the neck or backbone of the animal. This may be achieved by, for
   example, applying a swab or drop of the pour-on or spot-on formulation to a relatively
15 small area of the recipient animal's skin or coat (i.e., generally no greater than about 10%
   of the animal recipient's skin or coat). In some embodiments, the isoxazoline is dispersed
   from the application site to wide areas of the fur due to the spreading nature of the
   components in the formulation and the animal's movements while, in parallel, being
   absorbed through the skin and distributed via the animal recipient's fluids and/or tissues.
20         [198]   The isoxazoline composition alternatively (or additionally) may be
   systemically administered parenterally, such as via intramuscular injection, intravenous
   injection, subcutaneous injection, implant (e.g., subcutaneous implant), infusion, bolus,
   etc. In some such embodiments, the parenteral dosage form provides the animal recipient
   with from about 0.01 to about 200 mg/kg body weight of the isoxazoline.
25         [199]   Other contemplated modes of administration include, for example, rectal,
   vaginal, and via inhalation (e.g., via a mist or aerosol).
   IV.     Pharmaceutical compositions
           [200]   This invention also is directed to pharmaceutical compositions (or
30 medicaments) comprising a isoxazoline of Formula (I), salt of the isoxazoline, solvate of
   the isoxazoline or salt, or prodrug of the isoxazoline. The compositions also may (and
   generally will) comprise one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients.
                                                51

           [201]   Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured
   by, for example, processes known in the art. These processes include, for example, a
   variety of known mixing, dissolving, granulating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping,
   and lyophilizing processes. Optimal formulation depends on, for example, the route of
 5 administration.
           [202]   Solid dosage forms, for example, may be prepared by, for example,
   intimately and uniformly mixing the isoxazoline with fillers, binders, lubricants, glidants,
   disintegrants, flavoring agents (e.g., sweeteners), buffers, preservatives, pharmaceutical
   grade dyes or pigments, and controlled release agents.
10         [203]   Oral dosage forms other than solids may be prepared by mixing the
   isoxazoline with, for example, one or more solvents, viscosity-enhancing agents,
   surfactants, preservatives, stabilizers, resins, fillers, binders, lubricants, glidants,
   disintegrants, co-solvents, sweeteners, flavorings, perfuming agents, buffers, suspending
   agents, and pharmaceutical-grade dyes or pigments.
15         [204]   Contemplated binders include, for example, gelatin, acacia, and
   carboxymethyl cellulose.
           [205]   Contemplated lubricants include, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic
   acid, and talc.
           [206]   Contemplated disintegrants include, for example, corn starch, alginic acid,
20 sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and sodium croscarmellose.
           [207]   Contemplated buffers include, for example, sodium citrate, and magnesium
   and calcium carbonate and bicarbonate.
           [208]   Contemplated solvents include, for example, water, petroleum, animal oils,
   vegetable oils, mineral oil, and synthetic oil. Physiological saline solution or glycols (e.g.,
25 ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or polyethylene glycol) also may be included. The
   solvent preferably has sufficient chemical properties and quantity to keep the isoxazoline
   solubilized at temperatures in which the composition is stored and used.
           [209]   Contemplated viscosity-enhancing agents include, for example,
   polyethylene, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl
30 methylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, sodium alginate, carbomer, povidone, acacia,
   guar gum, xanthan gum, tragacanth, methylcellulose, carbomer, xanthan gum, guar gum,
   povidone, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, magnesium aluminum silicate, carboxyvinyl
   polymers, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose, laponite, water-soluble salts of cellulose
                                                 52

   ethers, natural gums, colloidal magnesium aluminum silicateor finely divided silica,
   homopolymers of acrylic acid crosslinked with an alkyl ether of pentaerythritol or an alkyl
   ether of sucrose, and carbomers.
            [210]   Contemplated surfactants include, for example, polyoxyethylene sorbitan
 5 fatty acid esters; polyoxyethylene monoalkyl ethers; sucrose monoesters; lanolin esters
   and ethers; alkyl sulfate salts; and sodium, potassium, and ammonium salts of fatty acids.
            [211]   Contemplated preservatives include, for example, phenol, alkyl esters of
   parahydroxybenzoic acid (e.g., methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (or "methylparaben") and
   propyl p-hydroxybenzoate (or "propylparaben")), sorbic acid, o-phenylphenol benzoic
10 acid and the salts thereof, chlorobutanol, benzyl alcohol, thimerosal, phenylmercuric
   acetate and nitrate, nitromersol, benzalkonium chloride, and cetylpyridinium chloride.
            [212]   Contemplated stabilizers include, for example, chelating agents and
   antioxidants.
            [213]   Solid dosage forms also may comprise, for example, one or more excipients
15 to control the release of the isoxazoline. For example, it is contemplated that the
   isoxazoline may be dispersed in, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.       Some oral
   dosage forms (e.g., tablets and pills) also may be prepared with enteric coatings.
            [214]   Topical administration may be achieved using, for example, a concentrated
   solution, suspension (aqueous or non-aqueous), emulsion (water-in-oil or oil-in-water), or
20 microemulsion comprising a isoxazoline dissolved, suspended, or emulgated in a
   pharmaceutically-acceptable liquid vehicle. In such embodiments, a crystallization
   inhibitor optionally may generally be present.
            [215]   When a liquid formulation is used topically on skin, it can be administered
   by, for example, pouring on, spreading, rubbing, atomizing, spraying, dipping, bathing, or
25 washing. A pour-on or spot-on formulation, for example, can be poured or atomized onto
   a limited spot on the skin (typically no greater than about 10% of the skin). In some such
   embodiments, the formulation allows or facilitates the isoxazoline to penetrate the skin
   and act on other parts body (e.g., the entire body). Such a pour-on or spot-on formulation
   can be prepared by dissolving, suspending, or emulsifying the isoxazoline in a suitable
30 skin-fitted solvent or solvent mixture. Other excipients may be included as well, such as,
   for example, a surfactant, colorant, antioxidant, stabilizer, adhesive, etc. Contemplated
   solvents include, for example, water, alkanol, glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene
   glycol, glycerin, benzyl alcohol, phenylethanol, phenoxyethanol, ethyl acetate, butyl
                                                53

   acetate, benzyl benzoate, dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol
   monobutyl ether, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, aromatic and/or aliphatic hydrocarbons,
   vegetable or synthetic oil, DMF, liquid paraffin, silicone, dimethylacetamide, N
   methylpyrrolidone, or 2,2-dimethyl-4-oxy-methylene- 1,3 -dioxolane.
 5          [216]   In some embodiments, a topical formulation (particularly a pour-on or spot
   on formulation) comprises a carrier that promotes the absorption or penetration of the
   isoxazoline through the skin into the blood stream, other bodily fluids (lymph), and/or
   body tissue (fat tissue). Contemplated examples of dermal penetration enhancers include,
   for example, dimethylsulfoxide, isopropyl myristate, dipropylene glycol pelargonate,
10 silicone oil, aliphatic esters, triglycerides, and fatty alcohols.
            [217]   Topical formulations also (or alternatively) may comprise, for example, one
   or more spreading agents. These substances act as carriers that assist in distributing an
   active ingredient over the animal recipient's coat or skin. They may include, for example,
   isopropyl myristate, dipropylene glycol pelargonate, silicone oils, fatty acid esters,
15 triglycerides, and/or fatty alcohols. Various spreading oil/solvent combinations also may
   be suitable, such as, for example, oily solutions, alcoholic and isopropanolic solutions
   (e.g., solutions of 2-octyl dodecanol or oleyl alcohol), solutions of esters of
   monocarboxylic acids (e.g., isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, lauric acid oxalic
   ester, oleic acid oleyl ester, oleic acid decyl ester, hexyl laurate, oleyl oleate, decyl oleate,
20 and caproic acid esters of saturated fatty alcohols having a carbon chain of 12 to 18
   carbons), solutions of esters of dicarboxylic acids (e.g., dibutyl phthalate, diisopropyl
   isophthalate, adipic acid diisopropyl ester, and di-n-butyl adipate), or solutions of esters of
   aliphatic acids (e.g., glycols). When the formulation comprises a spreading agent, it also
   may be advantageous to include a dispersant, such as, for example, pyrrolidin-2-one, N
25 alkylpyrrolidin-2-one, acetone, polyethylene glycol or an ether or ester thereof, propylene
   glycol, or synthetic triglycerides.
            [218]   When formulated in, for example, an ointment, it is contemplated that the
   isoxazoline may be mixed with, for example, either a paraffinic or a water-miscible
   ointment base. When formulated in a cream, it is contemplated that the isoxazoline may be
30 formulated with, for example, an oil-in-water cream base. In some instances, the aqueous
   phase of the cream base includes, for example at least about 30% (w/w) of a polyhydric
   alcohol, such as propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol,
   polyethylene glycol, or a mixture thereof.
                                                  54

            [219]   Injectable preparations may be formulated according to, for example, the
   known art using suitable solvents, solubilizing agents, protecting agents, dispersing agents,
   wetting agents, and/or suspending agents. Contemplated carrier materials include, for
   example, water, ethanol, butanol, benzyl alcohol, glycerin, 1,3-butanediol, Ringer's
 5 solution, isotonic sodium chloride solution, bland fixed oils (e.g., synthetic mono- or
   diglycerides), vegetable oil (e.g., corn oil), dextrose, mannitol, fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid),
   dimethyl acetamide, surfactants (e.g., ionic and non-ionic detergents), N
   methylpyrrolidone, propylene glycol, and/or polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG 400).
   Contemplated solubilizing agents include, for example, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,
10 polyoxyethylated castor oil, polyoxyethylated sorbitan ester, and the like. Contemplated
   protecting agents include, for example, benzyl alcohol, trichlorobutanol, p
   hydroxybenzoic acid ester, n-butanol, and the like.
            [220]   In some embodiments, a parenteral formulation is, for example, prepared
   from sterile powders or granules having one or more of the carriers materials discussed
15 above for other formulations. The isoxazoline is, for example, dissolved or suspended in a
   liquid comprising water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil,
   cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride, and/or various
   buffers. The pH generally may be adjusted, if necessary, with a suitable acid, base, or
   buffer.
20          [221]   For rectal administration, a suppository may be used. The suppository may
   be prepared by, for example, mixing a isoxazoline with a suitable non-irritating excipient
   that is solid at ordinary temperatures, but liquid at the rectal temperature, and will,
   therefore, melt in the rectum to release the drug. Contemplated excipients include, for
   example, such as cocoa butter; synthetic mono-, di-, or triglycerides; fatty acids; and/or
25 polyethylene glycols.
            [222]   Other inert ingredients may generally be added to the composition as
   desired. To illustrate, it is contemplated that these may include, for example, lactose,
   mannitol, sorbitol, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, tribasic calcium phosphate,
   dibasic calcium phosphate, sodium phosphate, kaolin, compressible sugar, starch, calcium
30 sulfate, dextro or microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, starch, sodium
   starch glycolate, crospovidone, microcrystalline cellulose, tragacanth,
   hydroxypropylcellulose, pregelatinized starch, povidone, ethylcellulose,
   hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and methylcellulose.
                                                 55

            [223]  A general discussion regarding formulation of drugs and various excipients
   may be found in, for example, Gennaro, A.R., et al., eds., Remington: The Science and
   PracticeofPharmacy (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 20th Ed., 2000). Another general
   discussion regarding formulation of drugs and various excipients may be found in, for
 5 example, Liberman, H. A., et al., eds., PharmaceuticalDosage Forms (Marcel Decker,
   New York, N.Y., 1980).
            [224]   The concentration of the isoxazoline of Formula (I) (or any salt of the
   isoxazoline, solvate of the isoxazoline or salt, or prodrug of the isoxazoline) in the
   composition may vary widely depending on, for example, the mode of administration.        In
10 general, the concentration is from about 1 to about 70% (by weight). In some such
   embodiments, for example, the concentration is from about 1 to about 50% (by weight), or
   from about 10 to about 50% (by weight). In other embodiments, the concentration is from
   about 35 to about 65% (by weight), from about 40 to about 60% (by weight), from about
   45 to about 55% (by weight), or about 50% (by weight).
15
    V.      Examples of contemplated combination therapies
            [225]   The methods of this invention encompass methods wherein a isoxazoline is
   the sole active ingredient administered to the recipient animal. It is contemplated,
   however, that the methods also encompass combination therapies wherein a isoxazoline is
20 administered in combination with one or more other active ingredients. The other active
   ingredient(s) may be, for example, one or more other isoxazolines. Alternatively (or
   additionally), the other active ingredient(s) may be one or more compounds that are not
   isoxazolines. The other active ingredient(s) may target the same and/or different
   pathogens and conditions.
25          [226]   Contemplated active ingredient(s) that may be administered in combination
   with the isoxazoline include, for example, anthelmintics, insecticides and acaricides, insect
   growth regulators and juvenile hormone analogues, anti-inflammatories, anti-infectives,
   hormones, dermatological preparations (e.g., antiseptics and disinfectants), and
   immunobiologicals (e.g., vaccines and antisera) for disease prevention.
30          [227]  Anthelmintics include, for example, avermectins (e.g., ivermectin,
   moxidectin, and milbemycin), benzimidazoles (e.g., fenbendazole, albendazole, and
   triclabendazole), salicylanilides (e.g., closantel and oxyclozanide), substituted phenols
   (e.g., nitroxynil), pyrimidines (e.g., pyrantel), imidazothiazoles (e.g., levamisole),
                                                56

   cyclooctadepsipeptide (e.g., Emodepside), and tetrahydropyrimidines (e.g., praziquantel).
   Anthelmintics also include, for example, amino acetonitrile derivatives, such as, for
   example, those discussed in Kaminsky, R., et al., "A new class of anthelmintics effective
   against drug-resistant nematodes," Nature, vol. 452, pp. 176-180 (March 13, 2008); and
 5 Int'l Patent Publ. Nos. W02006/050887 and W02005/044784.
            [228]   In some embodiments, the isoxazoline is administered in combination with
   (and, in some instances, in the same composition with) one or more macrocyclic lactone
   endectocidal parasiticides. These parasiticides tend to be useful against, for example, a
   broad spectrum of endoparasites and ectoparasites in mammals.
10          [229]   One particularly contemplated macrocyclic lactone parasiticide is
   ivermectin. Ivermectin is a semi-synthetic derivative of avermectin, and is generally
   produced as a mixture of at least 80% 22,23-dihydroavermectin B 1la and less than 20%
   22,23-dihydroavermectin Bib. Ivermectin is disclosed in US Patent 4,199,569. Ivermectin
   has been used as an antiparasitic agent to treat various parasitic diseases since the mid
15 1980's.
            [230]   Other macrocyclic lactone parasiticides include, for example:
   A.       Abamectin. This compound is, for example, identified as avermectin Bla/BIb in
            U.S. Patent 4,310,519. Abamectin contains at least 80% of avermectin Bla, and not
            more than 20% of avermectin BIb.
20 B.       Doramectin. This compound is known as 25-cyclohexyl-avermectin B 1. Its
            structure and preparation are discussed in, for example, US Patent 5,089,480.
   C.       Moxidectin. This compound is discussed in, for example, US Patent. 4,916,154.
   D.       Selamectin. This compound also is known as 25-cyclohexyl-25-de(1
            methylpropyl)-5-deoxy-22, 23-dihydro-5-(hydroxyimino)-avermectin B1
25          monosaccharide.
   E.       Milbemycin. This compound also is known as B41. It is isolated from the
            fermentation broth of a Milbemycin-producing strain of Streptomyces. The
            microorganism, fermentation conditions, and isolation procedures are discussed in,
            for example, US Patents 3,950,360 and 3,984,564.
30 F.       Emamectin. This compound also is known as 4"-deoxy-4"-epi
            methylaminoavermectin B     1. Its preparation is discussed in, for example, US
            Patent Nos. 5,288,710 and 5,399,717. It is a mixture of two homologues, 4"
            deoxy-4"-epi-methylaminoavermectin Bla, and 4"-deoxy-4"-epi
                                                 57

           methylaminoavermectin Bib. Salt of emamectin are commonly used. Non
            limiting examples of such salts are those discussed in US Patent 5,288,710, which
            include salts derived from benzoic acid, substituted benzoic acid, benzenesulfonic
            acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, and maleic acid. A particularly
 5          contemplated salt is emamectin benzoate.
   G.       Eprinomectin. This compound is known as 4"-epi-acetylamino-4"-deoxy
            avermectin B 1 . It was developed for use in all cattle classes and age groups. It was
           the first avermectin to generally show broad-spectrum activity against both endo
            and ecto-parasites, while also leaving minimal residues in meat and milk. It
10          generally has an additional advantage of being highly potent when delivered
           topically.

           [232]   In some contemplated embodiments, the isoxazoline is administered with
   pyridylmethylamine derivatives, such as, for example, pyridylmethylamine derivatives
   discussed in European Patent Appl. EP0539588 or Int'l Patent Appl. Publ.
   W02007/115643.
 5         [233]   In some contemplated embodiments, the isoxazoline is administered with
   nodulisporic acids and derivatives thereof, such as, for example, compounds discussed in
   US Patent 5,399,582; 5,945,317; 5,962,499; 5,834,260; 6,221,894; or 5,595,991; or Int'l

   both initial and sustained control of parasites at all stages of insect development, including
   eggs, on the animal subject, as well as within the environment of the animal subject.
15         [235]   Other antiparasitic compounds contemplated to be useful in combination
   therapies with the isoxazoline include, for example, imidazo[1,2-b] pyridazine compounds

25 turn, include, for example, beclomethasone dipropionate, betamethasone diproprionate,
   betamethasone valerate, budesonide, ciclesonide, deflazacort, dexamethasone, fluocinolone
   acetonide, fluticasone, propionate, fluticasone furoate, loteprednol, etabonate,
   mometasone, and mometasone furoate, methylpredniso lone, prednisolone, prednisone,
   rofleponide, and triamcinolone acetonide. Anti-inflammatory agents also include, for
30 example, one or more non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ("NSAIDs"). NSAIDs
   include, for example, salicylates, arylalkanoic acids, 2-arylpropionic acids (or "profens"),
   N-arylanthranilic acids, pyrazolidine derivatives, oxicams, COX-2 inhibitors,
   sulphonanilides, and licofelone. Anti-inflammatory ingredients also may include, for
                                               59

   example, antihistamines. Antihistamines include, for example, Hi-receptor agonists, H 2
   receptor agonists, H 3-receptor agonists, H4 -receptor agonists, mast cell stabilizers, and
   vitamin C.
           [237]    In the contemplated combination therapies, the isoxazoline of Formula (I)
 5 may be administered before, simultaneously, and/or after the other active ingredient(s). In
   addition, the isoxazoline may be administered in the same composition as the other active
   ingredient(s) and/or in a separate compositions from the other active ingredient(s).
   Further, the isoxazoline and other active ingredient(s) may be administered via the same
   and/or different routes of administration.
10         [238]    When the isoxazoline is administered in a combination therapy, the weight
   ratio of the active ingredients may vary widely. Factors influencing this ratio include, for
   example, the particular isoxazoline; the identity of the other active ingredient(s) be
   administered in the combination therapy; the mode(s) of administration of the isoxazoline
   and other active ingredient(s); the target condition and pathogen; the type (e.g., species
15 and breed), age, size, sex, diet, activity, and condition of the intended recipient; and
   pharmacological considerations, such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and
   toxicology profiles of the isoxazoline and other active ingredient(s). In some
   contemplated embodiments, for example, the weight radio of the isoxazoline to the other
   active ingredient(s) is, for example, is from about 1:3000 to about 3000:1. In some such
20 instances, the weight ratio is from about 1:300 to about 300:1. In other such instances, the
   weight ratio is from about 1:30 and about 30:1.
           [239]    In addition to other active ingredients, it is contemplated that the
   isoxazoline may be administered with one or more other compounds that beneficially
   affects (e.g., enhances or prolongs) the activity (or other characteristic, such as safety) of
25 the isoxazoline. For example, it is contemplated that the isoxazoline may be administered
   with one or more synergists, such as, for example, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and triphenyl
   phosphate (TPP). Other synergists include, for example, N~(2-ethylhexyl)-8,9,10
    inorborn-5-ene-2,-dcarboxamide (also known as "ENT 8184" or "MGK 264") and
   Verbutin (also known as "MB-599"). A discussion relating to insecticidal synergists may
30 be found in, for example, The PesticideManual, 13th Edition, cited above.

    VI.     Therapeutic kits
            [240]   This invention also is directed to kits that are, for example, suitable for use
   in performing the treatment methods described above. In general, such a kit will comprise
   a therapeutically effective amount of a isoxazoline of Formula (I), and an additional
 5 component(s). The additional component(s) may be, for example, one or more of the
   following: a diagnostic tool, instructions for administering the composition, an apparatus
   for administering the composition, a container comprising an excipient or other active
   ingredient to be mixed or administered in combination with the composition, or a memory
   aid (e.g., a stamp to adhere to a calendar to remind an animal owner of a time to
10 administer a subsequent dose of the composition).

   remainder of this disclosure in any way. The compound numbers referenced in these
15 examples refer to the compound numbers for the structures in the above detailed
   description and below claims.
            [242]   Example 1. Efficacy of Compounds 10-1 and 11-1 against cat fleas
   (Ctenocephalides felis).
20          [243]   Adult fleas (20-30) were fed on artificial membranes with blood spiked
   with Compound 10-1, Compound 11-1, or a positive control (fipronil) at a concentration
   of 100, 10, or 1 ppm. Flea efficacy was assessed after 48 hr of continuous feeding by
   comparing the number of killed and damaged fleas with the number of fed fleas. Flea
   efficacy was 100% for Compound 10-1, Compound 11-1, and fipronil at 100, 10, and 1
25 ppm.

                                  A. Efficacy againstfleas on mice
            [246]    Mice were divided into groups of three, and treated topically with 100 ppm
   body weight, orally with 10 mg/kg bodyweight, or subcutaneously with 10 mg/kg
 5 bodyweight of Compound 11-1, fipronil (positive control), or nothing (negative control).
   These mice were sedated and infested with adult fleas (C. felis) 1, 3, 6, and 24 hr after
   treatment. Fleas were recovered from the mice after approximately 30 minutes of feeding.
   The assessment of flea inhibition (% of dead and damaged fleas) was conducted 1 and 24
   hr after each infestation. The results are shown in Table 1.

   In general, with Compound 11-1, only a few damaged fleas were found relative to killed
   fleas. With fipronil, however, killed and damaged fleas were generally found in equal
   amounts. No side effects were observed with Compound 11-1 or fipronil during this
 5 experiment.
                                 B. Efficacy against mites on mice
            [247]    All mice used in the study had a present mite infestation with M.
   musculinus consisting of all stages of the parasite with at least a medium ("++") infestation
10 rate. The mice were divided into groups of three, and treated topically with 100 ppm body
   weight, orally with 10 mg/kg body weight, or subcutaneously with 10 mg/kg body weight
   of Compound 11-1, fipronil (positive control), or nothing (negative control). This
   treatment was then repeated 7 days later. The infestation rate per mouse ("+" = low
   infestation rate, "++"   = medium infestation rate, "+++"  = high infestation rate) was
15 assessed repeatedly on days 1, 6, 9, 13, and 23. Efficacy was defined as the inhibition of
   the mite infestation rate on treated mice relative to the negative control group. The results
   are shown in Table 2.

              C. Efficacy against soft (argaside) ticks and bed bugs on Guinea pigs
 5         [248]    Six Guinea pigs were treated orally, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally
   with 10 mg/kg bodyweight of Compound 11-1 or fipronil (positive control). The Guinea
   pigs were locally co-infested with juvenile soft ticks (0. moubata) and bed bugs (C.
   lectularius) once before the treatment, and at different time points after treatment between
   days 2 and 50. Ten engorged ticks/bed bugs were collected to assess the percentage of
10 killed individuals per species 24 hr after each infestation.
           [249]    For Guinea pigs treated with Compound 11-1, the ticks and bed bugs died
   within 1 to 5 hr following infestation up to Day 29, and within 8 to 24 hr after day 29. For
   Guinea pigs treated with fipronil, ticks and bed bugs died within 1 to 7 hr after infestation up to
   Day 29, and within 8 to 24 hr after day 29. The efficacy results with respect to ticks are
15 shown in Table 3.

                      D. Efficacy against hard (ixodide) ticks on Guinea pigs
           [250]    Guinea pigs were divided into groups of three. Each group was subjected
   to one of the following treatments with either Compound 11-1, fipronil (positive control),
10 or neither (negative control):
           Study   1:
            1.      100 ppm body weight topical administration by animal dip
           2.       10 mg/kg body weight oral administration
           3.       10 mg/kg body weight subcutaneous administration

           Study   2:
            1.      25 ppm body weight topical administration by animal dip
           2.       2.5 mg/kg body weight oral administration
20         3.       2.5 mg/kg body weight subcutaneous administration
           4.       No treatment (negative control)
                                                66

   One day before the treatment, all the Guinea pigs were infested with 100 vital juvenile
   ("nymph") hard ticks (brown dog ticks, R. sanguineus). Engorged, detached nymphs were
   counted (eN) from Day 4 to Day 8 to calculate the efficacy of the treatments according to
   following formula:
 5      Efficacy on engorged nymphs (%)       =  ( eN control group - E eN treatment group) X100
                                                             Y eN control group
   In addition, collected ticks were assessed for molting into the next stage.
            [251]   In the first study, 32 engorged R. sanguineus nymphs were collected from
   animals of the untreated negative control group. And in the second study, 75 engorged R.
   sanguineus nymphs were collected from animals of the untreated negative control group.
10 Molting into the next stage was observed for the negative control groups of both studies.
   In contrast, no nymphs were collected from any of the groups treated with Compound 11-1
   or fipronil in either study. Thus, the inhibition of engorged nymphs for both Compound
    11-1 and fipronil was 100%. No side effects were observed with Compound 11-1 or
   fipronil during either study.

            [252]   Example 3. Efficacy of various isoxazolines against cat fleas
   (Ctenocephalides felis) on mice.
            [253]   In this experiment, mice were randomly assigned to a treatment group or a
   negative control (untreated) group. Each group consisted of three mice. The mice in the
20 treatment groups were orally administered 20 mg/kg bodyweight of various isoxazolines
   dissolved in 7% DMF-premix and 93% purified water (aqua ad injectabilia). The
   application volume of these treatments was 0.01 mL/g bodyweight. One hour after
   treatment, each mouse was sedated and generally infested (whole body) with 30 vital,
   adult fleas (C.felis). To achieve this, the sedated mice were placed into an infestation-jar,
25 and the fleas were placed directly onto the fur. After approximately 30 minutes of
   feeding, fleas were recovered from the mice. Assessments for inhibition and mortality
   were conducted 1 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr after each infestation. The efficacy was calculated
   as the percentage of inhibited fleas in the treatment groups relative to the negative control
   group.

   The dogs were infested with approximately 80 fleas (C. felis) and 60 ticks (R. sanguineus)
   on Days -2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49. Fleas and ticks were counted on Day 2
   (approximately 48 h after treatment), as well as Days 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44, and 51
 5 (approximately 48 hr after each post-treatment re-infestation) to evaluate the insecticidal
   and acaricidal activity in the treated groups. In Group B, an additional flea and tick
   infestation was conducted on Day 56, with a respective flea and tick count on Day 58. In
   addition to the flea and tick counts, blood samples were collected before the treatments, as
   well as approximately 2 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr, 24 hr, and 72 hr after the treatment on Day Zero,
10 and then once on each of Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56. The concentration of
   Compound 11-1 in blood plasma was analyzed by HPLC/MS/MS. The LOQ of this
   method was 5 ng/ml. Table 8 shows the observed tick efficacies:

            [260]  Example 7. Isolation of the R and S enantiomers of Compound 11-1.
            [261]  Compound 11-1 (260 mg) was dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of n
   hexane/ethanol (13 ml) at 40'C. 80% of this solution was separated into aliquots of 400 gl
   on a semi-preparative liquid chromatographic system equipped with a Diacel Chiralpak*
10 AD-H column with 250 mm column length, 10 mm diameter, and 5 gm particle size. The
   mobile phase consisted of a 8:2 mixture of n-hexane/ethanol. A flow rate of 4 ml/min was
   used. The chiral fractions of both enantiomers were collected and evaporated in vacuum.
   The purity of the pooled fractions was controlled by analytical chiral chromatography
   using a Diacel Chiralpak@ AD-H column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 gm) and UV detection at 254
15 nm. For both enantiomers, a purity of greater than 99% was determined. This technique
   afforded 88 mg of Compound 17-1 (the S-enantiomer), which had an optical rotation of
   [U]D 2  +63.970 (ethanol, c = 2.97 mg/ml); and 80 mg of Compound 1 1-IR (the R
   enantiomer), which had an optical rotation of [ax]D 23           (ethanol,
