   The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method
   of performing it known to the applicant:
                                          Technical Field

   the invention is directed to a suspension assembly for large vehicles such as caravans,
   although the scope of the invention is not necessarily limited thereto.
 5                                       Background Art
            Vehicle suspension systems are typically used to absorb energy from vertical
   acceleration of the wheels of a vehicle when the vehicle is travelling over uneven road
   surfaces. By absorbing this energy, vehicle suspension systems can generally maximize
   the friction between the tires and the road surface, provide steering stability with good
10 handling and ensure the comfort of the passengers.
            Suspension systems for large vehicles, such as caravans, have a relatively large
   unsprung mass (being the mass of the suspension, wheels, and other components
   directly connected to them). This can present various challenges in suspension design.
   Many suspension systems currently on the market for large vehicles, require frequent
15 maintenance and repair, in particular if frequently used off road, or over other rough and
   uneven road surfaces.
            It is an aim of the invention to provide a suspension assembly which overcomes
   or ameliorates one or more of the disadvantages or problems described above, or which
   at least provides the consumer with a useful choice.
20                                  Summary of the Invention
            According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a suspension
   assembly for a vehicle including
            a support frame for mounting to the vehicle,
            a control arm assembly pivotally mounted to the support frame at a first
25 location, the control arm assembly including

                                                 -2
                    a carrier for carrying a spring at a second location, and
                    an attachment portion for attaching a pair of shock absorbers adjacent the
           carrier,
           wherein a wheel axle is mounted to the control arm assembly between the first
 5 location and the second location.
           Advantageously, the location of the carrier and attachment portion allow the
   shock absorbers and springs to be mounted to the rear of the wheel axle thereby
   permitting larger springs to be used, as desired, without the need to redesign the control
   arm assembly.
10         The control arm assembly may provide a modular suspension mount at one end
   thereof. The modular suspension mount may including the carrier and the attachment
   portion. The carrier may include a retainer for retaining a base of the spring. The
   attachment portion may be provided adjacent one side of the retainer. In one
   embodiment, the wheel axle may be mounted adjacent one side of the retainer and the
15 attachment portion mounted adjacent an opposite side of the retainer. The attachment
   portion may be fixedly attached to the retainer.
           Advantageously, the configuration of the modular suspension mount provides
   the control arm assembly with higher torsional strength than conventional suspension
   designs. The increased torsional strength of the control arm facilitates in maintaining the
20 correct wheel alignment characteristics for the vehicle, in particular for large vehicles in
   which the suspension assembly is constantly under heavy load.
           The attachment portion may be configured for attaching a first end of each of the
   pair of shock absorbers. The support frame may include a further attachment portion for
   attaching a second end of each of the shock absorbers. The attachment portion and
25 further attachment portion are generally aligned to allow each shock absorber to be
   mounted in a generally upright orientation.
           The generally upright orientation of the twin shock absorbers advantageously
   provide the assembly with greater shock absorbing efficiency and improved durability.
   More specifically, shock absorbers are typically designed to provide resistance to
30 otherwise uncontrolled vertical upwards and downwards movement of wheels and tyres
   affixed to suspension control arms so as to ensure contact between the tyres and the
   road surface at all times, and absorb the impact of the tyre hitting a bump. Due to the
   generally upright orientation of the shock absorbers, during the full stroke of the
   suspension, there is relatively little variation in the vertical component of the internal

                                               -3
   damping force. This advantageously allows the damping characteristics of each shock
   absorber to be constant throughout the full range of suspension movement.
            The carrier may include a stabiliser for stabilising the spring. In particular, the
   stabiliser may prevent the spring from sliding backwards, forwards or sideways in use.
 5 The stabiliser may include an insert for insertion into a base of the spring for stabilising
   the spring. The insert may be cylindrical shaped.
            The suspension assembly may further include one or more cable mounts for
   mounting a suspension limit cable adjacent the pair of shock absorbers. The limit cable
   advantageously prevents the shock absorbers from over extending in the lengthwise
10 direction.
            The support frame may include one or more water tank mounts for mounting
   one or more water tanks of the vehicle. The water tank mounts may be configured to
   allow mounting and dismounting of the water tanks independently of the control arm
   assembly. The water tank mount may include a water tank cradle configured for
15 attached to the support frame. The support frame may have a plurality of pins for
   allowing attachment of different sized water tank cradles.
            The suspension assembly may further include wheel alignment means for
   adjusting wheel alignment of the vehicle. In particular, the wheel alignment means may
   include a toe adjustment means for adjusting toe alignment of the vehicle. The wheel
20 alignment means may include one or more connection mechanisms for pivotally
   connecting the control arm assembly to the support frame. The connecting mechanism
   may include adjustment means for adjusting the angle of the control arm assembly
   relative to the support frame. The control arm assembly may include an independent
   wheel axle fixedly mounted thereto such that adjustment of the angle of the control arm
25 assembly results an adjustment in the angle of the wheel axle relative to the support
   frame.
            The connection mechanism may include a bolt, an eccentric washer affixed to
   the bolt, a bridging plate defining an elongate slot, the bridging plate having a U-shaped
   portion mounted thereto. When assembled, rotation of the eccentric washer may engage
30 with an inner surface of the U-shaped portion to cause the bolt to slide within the
   elongate slot.
           In one embodiment, the suspension assembly may include three further control
   arm assemblies, each further control arm assembly being pivotally mounted to the
   support frame and having an independent wheel axle mounted thereto.

                                                 -4
           The suspension assembly may be configured to form a discrete module for direct
   mounting to a chassis of the vehicle.
           The support frame may include a pair of lateral members, and a plurality of
   transverse members extending between the pair of lateral members. The control arm
 5 assemblies may be mounted to the support frame via the transverse members.
           According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a vehicle wheel
   assembly including a suspension assembly as described above, wherein a pair of front
   wheels are mounted to respective wheel axles of a first pair of the control arm
   assemblies, and a pair of rear wheels are mounted to respective wheel axles of a second
10 pair of the control arm assemblies. Each of the first pair of control arm assemblies may
   be pivotally mounted at one end to a first transverse member, and the respective shock
   absorbers of the first pair of control arm assemblies are mounted to a second transverse
   member. In addition, each of the second pair of control arm assemblies may be pivotally
   mounted at one end to a third transverse member, and the respective shock absorbers of
15 the second pair of control arm assemblies are mounted to a fourth transverse member.
           According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a vehicle wheel
   assembly including a suspension assembly as described above, wherein a wheel is
   mounted to the wheel axle of each control arm assembly, and each control arm
   assembly is fitted with a brake assembly, wherein each brake assembly is configured to
20 allow electronic coupling with an electronic stability control module of the vehicle.
           According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a vehicle having
   a suspension assembly as described above.
           The vehicle may be any suitable vehicle. For example, the vehicle may be a car,
   van, trailer, caravan, bus, shuttle or the like. Preferably, the vehicle is a caravan.

                       Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiment(s)
            It will be appreciated that the drawings have been provided for the purpose of
   illustrating a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Therefore, it will be
   understood that the present invention should not be limited to the features as shown in
15 the drawings.
            Figure 1 illustrates a suspension assembly 100 for a large vehicle such as a
   caravan. The suspension assembly 100 includes a support frame 102 for mounting to the
   vehicle, and four control arm assemblies 104a, 104b, 104c (hidden) and 104d. Each
   control arm assembly 104a, 104b, 104c, 104d (collectively referred to herein as '104') is
20 pivotally mounted to the support frame 102 at respective joints 106a, 106b, 106c
   (hidden), 106d (collectively referred to herein as '106') located at one end of each
   control arm assembly 104. Each joint 106 includes two connecting points (see 200a,
   200b as more clearly shown in Figure 2) pivotally mounted to the support frame 102.
            Now referring to Figures 1 and 2, each control arm assembly 104 includes a
25 modular suspension mount 112a, 112b, 112c (hidden), 112d (collectively referred to
   herein as '112'). Each suspension mount 112 is located adjacent an opposite end of the
   control arm assembly 104 to the joints 106.
            The configuration of one of the control arm assemblies 104d is more clearly
   shown in Figure 2. It will be appreciated that the other control arm assemblies 104a,
30  104b, 104c are configured in a similar manner. The modular suspension mount 112d
   includes a carrier 202 for carrying a spring 114 (Figure 1). The carrier 202 includes a
   retainer for retaining a base of the spring 114 and a cylindrical insert 204 for insertion
   into the base to thereby stabilise the spring 114 relative to the retainer 202. The modular

                                              -6
   suspension mount 112 also includes an attachment portion 206 for attaching a pair of
   shock absorbers 116 (Figure 1) adjacent the carrier 202.
           The control arm assembly 104d also includes an independent wheel axle 208
   mounted adjacent the suspension mount 112. In particular, the wheel axle 208 is
 5 mounted adjacent one side of the carrier 202 opposite the attachment portion 206. The
   wheel axle 208 is therefore mounted to the control arm 104d in a location between the
   pivot joint 106d and the attachment portion 206. The configuration of the control arm
   assembly 104d in this manner allows the spring 114 and shock absorbers 106 to be
   positioned to the rear the wheel axle 208. (The rear of the wheel axle being defined
10 relative to a forward moving direction of the vehicle, wherein the components before
   the wheel axle in the forward moving direction are located to the front of the wheel axle
   and the components behind the wheel axle are located to the rear of the wheel axle.)
           Arranging the spring 114 and shock absorbers 106 to the rear of the wheel axle
   208 in this manner advantageously permits larger springs to be used. For example,
15 larger springs can be used in heavy duty applications where the vehicle is relatively
   large and heavy and/or designed for off road use. Any suitable spring can be easily
   mounted onto the carrier 202 without the need to use a differently configured control
   arm assembly 104. Similarly, shock absorbers 116 having the most compatible
   characteristics can be used in combination with the selected spring 104 to provide the
20 most suitable energy absorption and response characteristics for the application.
           In addition, providing a modular and discrete suspension mount 112 for
   mounting the spring 104 and shock absorbers 116 provides the control arm assembly
    104 with relatively high torsional strength. One reason for this is that the suspension
   mount 112 is a rigid component mounted to the rearmost end portion of the control arm
25 assembly 104. The suspension mount 112 thereby provides a rigid connection for the
   lower end of the spring 104 and shock absorbers 116 such that torsional forces can be
   equally transferred to, and absorbed by the control arm assembly 104 in a more
   effective manner. The configuration of the control arm assembly 104 including the
   discrete suspension mount 112 advantageously prevents excessive camber change
30 during loading and unloading load cycles when the suspension assembly 100 is in use.
           The modular suspension mount 112 is fastened to a body 210 of the control arm
   assembly 104d. The body 210 includes a pair of arm members 212, 214, each extending
   from one side of the modular suspension mount 112 and the wheel axle 208 to a
   respective connecting point 200a, 200b of the pivoting joint 106d. A transverse joist 216

                                               -7
    is provided between the arm members 212, 214 to support and strengthen the control
    arm assembly 104d.
            The support frame 102 includes a pair of lateral members 108a, 108b extending
    along opposite sides of the support frame 102. The support frame 102 also includes four
 5 transverse members 1 10a, 1 Ob, 1 Oc, 1 Od (collectively referred to herein as '110')
    extending between the pair of lateral members 108a, 108b.
            As more clearly shown in Figures 1 and 3, the control arm assemblies 104 are
   mounted to the transverse members 110 of the support frame 102. In particular, the
   joints 106a, 106c of respective control arm assemblies 104a, 104c for a pair of front
10 wheels 302a, 302c (defined relative to a forward moving direction of a vehicle) are
   mounted on to a first transverse member 1 10a. On an opposite end of the control arm
    assemblies 104a, 104c, an upper end of the respective springs 114a, 114c and shock
    absorbers 1 16a, 116c are mounted to a second transverse member 1 Ob. (The mounting
    of the springs 114 and shock absorbers 116 to the support frame 102 will be described
15  in more detail below with reference to Figures 4a and 4b.)
            The joints 106a, 106c of respective control arm assemblies 104b, 104d for a pair
    of rear wheels 302b, 302d are mounted on to a third transverse member 1 Oc. On an
    opposite end of the control arm assemblies 104b, 104d, an upper end of the respective
    springs 1 14b, 1 14d and shock absorbers 1 16b, 1 16d are mounted to a fourth transverse
20 member 110d. As more clearly shown in Figure 1, the second and fourth transverse
   members 110b, 110d are slightly elevated relative to the first and third transverse
   members 1 Oa, 1 Oc to accommodate the springs 114 and shock absorbers 116.
            In the embodiment shown in Figure 3, diagonal bracing members 304a, 304b,
    304c, 304d ('304') are also provided to strengthen the support frame 102 and the overall
25 wheel assembly 300. Each bracing member 304 bridges a transverse member 110 and a
    lateral member 108 to thereby strengthen the connection between the respective
   transverse member 110 and lateral member 108.
            The wheel assembly 300 as shown in Figure 3 is modular and can be fastened to
    a vehicle body as a single unit.
30          Now referring to Figures 4a and 4b, which provides a close up view of control
    arm assembly 104b. The modular suspension mount 112b includes a cable mount 402
    for mounting a suspension limit cable 404 adjacent the pair of shock absorbers 116b.
    The limit cable 404 advantageously prevents the shock absorbers 116b from over
    extending in the lengthwise direction.

                                               -8
           As more clearly shown in Figure 4a, the upper end of the spring 404 is mounted
   to the fourth transverse member 1 10d via a stabilising insert 406. The insert 406 is
   cylindrical shaped and inserted into a top portion of the spring 404 to stabilise and hold
   the top portion of the spring 404 in position relative to the support frame 102.
 5         The upper end of the pair of shock absorbers 116b are pivotally mounted to the
   fourth transverse member 110d. In particular, an upper attachment portion 408 is
   provided on the fourth transverse member 11 Od for pivotally attaching the upper ends of
   the shock absorbers 116b. The upper attachment portion 408 is configured in a similar
   manner to the attachment portion 206 of the modular suspension mount 112b. Similarly,
10 an upper cable mount 410 is provided adjacent the upper attachment portion 406 for
   mounting an upper end of the suspension limit cable 404. It will be appreciated that a
   similar arrangement is provided on an opposite end of the fourth transverse member
    110d for attachment of the control arm assembly 104d. Moreover, the second transverse
   member 1 Ob is configured in a similar manner for attachment of the springs 1 14a,
15  114b, shock absorbers 116a, 116b and limit cables (not shown) of the front control arm
   assemblies 104a, 104b.
           The attachment portions 206 of the modular suspension mounts 112 are
   generally aligned with the respective upper attachment portions 406 such that each pair
   of shock absorbers 116 are arranged in a generally upright orientation (Figures 1, 3, 4a
20 and 4b). Allowing the shock absorbers 116 to be arranged in this orientation provides
   greater shock absorbing efficiency and improved durability.
           Whilst not specifically shown in the drawings, each control arm assembly 104 is
   fitted with a brake assembly. Each brake assembly is configured to allow electronic
   coupling with an electronic stability control module of the vehicle.
25         Each front control arm assembly 104a, 104c further include wheel alignment
   means 500 for adjusting toe alignment of the vehicle. In particular, each of the front
   control arm assemblies 104a, 104c includes a wheel alignment mechanism 500 as more
   clearly shown in Figure 5a for adjusting the toe-in of the vehicle.
           Figure 5a illustrates the wheel alignment mechanism 500 for front control arm
30 assembly 104c. The wheel alignment mechanism 500 includes a pair of connecting
   mechanisms 502a, 502b. Connecting mechanism 502a is adjustable to allow adjustment
   of wheel toe alignment as explained in further detail below.
           As shown in Figure 5a, the end portions of arm members 212, 214 of control
   arm assembly 104c are pivotally mounted to transverse member 110a via respective

                                                -9
   connecting mechanisms 502a, 502b. Connecting mechanism 502a pivotally connects
   arm member 214 to transverse member 110a via a conventional bolt and nut
   arrangement, with bridging plates 510 which couple the nut and bolt assembly with the
   transverse member 11 Oa.
 5         Figure 5b illustrates an exploded assembly view of connection mechanism 502b.
   As shown, the connection assembly includes a bolt 504. The bolt 504 includes an
   eccentric washer 506 affixed adjacent an enlarged head end portion thereof. The bolt
   504 includes a threaded portion 508 adjacent an opposite end thereof. A pair of L
   shaped bridging plates 512 are positioned on either side of connecting point 220a
10 (hidden) of arm member 212. Each bridging plate 512 includes a U-shaped portion 514
   affixed to an outer side of each bridging plate 512 as more clearly shown in Figure 5a
   and 5b. The U-shaped portion 514 defines a recess 516 for receiving the eccentric
   washer 506 therein. A similar eccentric washer 518 is received in the corresponding U
   shaped portion of the opposite bridging plate 512.
15         Figure 5c is illustrates the reverse side of the bridging plate 512 in Figure 5b. As
   more clearly shown in Figure 5c, each bridging plate 512 defines an elongate slot 520.
   When the connecting mechanism 502b is assembled, the bolt 504 is inserted through the
   slots 520 of each bridging plate 512 and arm member 212. The bolt 504 is secured in
   place using eccentric washer 518 and a nut 522 attached to the threaded end 508 of the
20 bolt 504.
           Rotation of the bolt 504 about its longitudinal axis causes an outer surface of
   eccentric washer 504 to engage with an inner surface 522 of U-shaped portion 514
   (Figure 5b) causing the cylindrical body of the bolt 504 to slide within the elongate slot
   520, thereby also causing the arm member 212 move forwardly or rearwardly with
25 respect to the bridging plates 512. As the bridging plates 512 are fixedly attached to the
   transverse member 110a, the rotation of the bolt 504 allows the end portion of arm
   member 212 to move slightly forwardly or rearwardly with respect to the transverse
   member 1 Oa. As the wheel axle 208 is fixedly mounted to the control arm assembly
    104c, this movement in turn allows the angle between the longitudinal axis of wheel
30 axle 208 to change with respect to transverse member 1 10a, thereby changing the angle
   of the wheel tyre (not shown) to adjust wheel toe alignment.
           As more clearly shown in Figure 2a, the connecting points 200a, 200b include
   resilient inserts within the respective openings such that a small amount of movement is

                                              - 10
   permitted between respective bolts 504 and the arm members 214, 212 during toe
   adjustment.
            The support frame 102 also includes water tank mounts (not shown) for
