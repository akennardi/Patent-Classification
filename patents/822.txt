            CONVEYOR MODULE, CONVEYOR ASSEMBLY, AND METHOD OF
                                        INSTALLING A CONVEYOR ASSEMBLY
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]                 The present invention relates to a modular conveyor system, and in particular,
to a conveyor module and associated support frame which may be easily transported and
installed with other such conveyor modules and frames to form a conveyor assembly.
BACKGROUND
[0002]                 The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information
derived from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as, an
acknowledgement or admission or any form of suggestion that prior publication (or
information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general
knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.
[0003]                 Conveyor belt systems used to transport minerals from mine sites are often
needed in remote locations where installation and maintenance of conveyors may be
challenging. Installation of conveyor belt systems is quite often difficult and costly, as
significant earthworks may be required, and, labour may be scarce and/or skilled.
Furthermore, after operation of such a mine ceases, or the location of mineral extraction
changes, conveyor belt assemblies may typically be required to be de-mobilised. However,
such known conveyor systems are typically not readily relocatable.
SUMMARY
[0004]                 The present invention seeks to provide a conveyor module which may be
utilised with other such conveyor modules to form a conveyor assembly which, due to its
modular form, is more easily and less expensively installed than the aforementioned prior
art conveyor systems.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0062]               Throughout the drawings, like numerals were used to identify similar features,
except where expressly otherwise indicated.
[0063]               It should be appreciated also that whilst particular embodiments of the
invention, which relate to any one or combination of a conveyor module, a support frame,
and a conveyor assembly, together with a method of transporting, installing and operating

                                                          -9
a conveyor assembly are herein described and shown, these are for exemplary purposes
only. The invention should not be limited to these specific embodiments. All such
variations and modifications which become apparent to person skilled in the art should be
considered to be encompassed within the scope of this invention.
[0064]                 As shown in FIG. 1, the conveyor module, generally designated by the numeral
 1, may typically be formed from, or built to be similar to, a shipping container which
houses pre-assembled conveyor components.
[0065]                 Persons skilled in the art will readily appreciate that a shipping container has a
standardised size which is dimensioned such that it can readily fit on a ship, train, truck, or
other mode of transport, and be stacked, along with like containers to store and transport
goods domestically and internationally. Such containers are known under a number of
names, such as simply "container", cargo or freight container, ISO container, shipping, or
ocean container, etc. When referring to the "module" of the present invention, it should be
understood that the "module" of the present invention may, in its preferred embodiment, be
dimensioned to be equivalent, or at least compatible with, such a standardised ISO
intermodal shipping container.
[0066]                 The conveyor assembly of the present invention is typically formed of a
plurality of conveyor idler structures provided in spaced apart location relative to each
other. These conveyor idler structures collectively support a conveyor belt, and, are
operated by appropriate drive means, etc.
[0067]                 The conveyor module I according to present invention shown in FIG. 1
includes a basic module structure being formed of a substantially longitudinal main frame
portion 4. The ends 5 and 6 of the longitudinal-shaped module 1 may be substantially
open, such that the module I may be positioned adjacent similar conveyor modules 1, to
thereby effectively form a conveyor assembly of any desired length.
[0068]                 The embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1 shows a preferred arrangement of a
module 1 having a floor surface 7, a roof surface 8, and, substantially open side walls 9
and 10. A plurality of conveyor idler structures 3 are provided in spaced apart relationship

H:\kmh~lmerwoven\MNRPor-b\DCC\KMH\169166291Ldox-15/05/21 8
                                                           - 10
within the module 1. As will be understood by a person skilled in the art, such a structure
may provide protection to the conveyor components housed therein from weather, dust and
environmental effects, whilst having at least partly open or openable side walls 9 and 10 to
allow for visual inspection and/or maintenance access to the conveyor structure.
[0069]               FIG. 2 illustrates how two such conveyor modules 1, as shown in FIG. 1, may
typically be interconnected via a support frame 11 to effectively join the conveyor modules
 I such that they can function as a composite conveyor assembly 15.
[0070]               Whilst further explanation will be provided hereafter, FIG. 2 illustrates how
idler rollers 12 may extend outwardly from the ends 5 and 6 of the conveyor module I to a
position above an interconnecting support frame 11, and, how an extension roof 13 may be
adapted to extend from one or both ends of the spaced apart conveyor modules 1. Prior to
going into the details of how the modules 1 are positioned/installed and then expanded to
form the conveyor assembly 15, details of the conveyor module 1 will be firstly illustrated
with reference to FIGS. 3 to 6.
[0071]               In FIG. 3, there are shown various views of the conveyor module 1 in a first
position wherein the roof 8 is stowed in a transport position for compact transportation of
the conveyor module 1. Specifically, FIG. 3A illustrates an isometric view of this transport
position of conveyor module, whilst FIG. 3B illustrates a side elevation view, and, FIG. 3C
illustrates an end view.
[0072]               Referring now to FIG. 4, which shows similar views to FIG. 3, the conveyor
module 1 is shown with the roof 8 raised to an expanded or operational position. FIG. 4A
illustrates an isometric view with the roof raised in this operational position, whilst FIG.
4B illustrates a side elevation view with the roof raised, and, FIG. 4C shows an end view
with the roof raised. It should be noted that in FIGS. 3 and 4, the conveyor componentry is
not shown for clearer understanding of the roof positions.
[0073]               FIG. 5 illustrates, in FIGS 5A and 5B, plan and bottom views, respectively, of
the conveyor module 1 as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4.

                                                           - 11
[0074]               Referring now to FIG. 6, the conveyor module 1 is illustrated to be typically
formed of a substantial longitudinal main frame 4, and, an extension frame portion 14. As
will be understood from FIG. 6, the extension of frame portion 14 may be adapted to
slidably extend at least partially outwardly of the end of the main frame 4. The extension
frame portion 14, which supports conveyor components 12, effectively increases the
operable length of the conveyor module 1. This facilitates productive use of the available
space in or from each conveyor module 1, during transportation, whilst thereafter, at the
installation location, the extension frame portion 14 may be slid outwards to the operating
position, such as shown in FIG. 6.
[0075]               Referring back to FIG. 2, it will be noted that, when two conveyor modules 1
are positioned in spaced apart relationship, the extension frames 14 of each module 1 may
be slid outwardly towards each other. The advantage of having these slidably extended
frame portions 14 rather than simply providing a plurality of conveyor modules adjacent to
each other is that this reduces the number of modules required to be built and transported.
This is particularly advantageous in remote locations, however it will be appreciated that it
is not essential for the modules to be extendable in this way.
[0076]               FIGS. 7A and 8 illustrate a preferred embodiment of a support frame 11 which
may be used in conjunction with the conveyor module 1 to form the conveyor assembly 15
of the present invention. The support frame 11, as shown in FIGS. 7A and 8 may be
typically formed of metal and may be made of any desired size. The support frame is
adapted to be positioned on a substrate surface, to support modules 1. The ends 16 of the
frame 11 may optimally be telescopically expandable in width, and, provided with support
posts 17 for engaging with and supporting the conveyor module 1. As shown in FIG. 7B,
the support posts 17 are preferably height adjustable to compensate for an uneven substrate
surface and/or to support the support frame 11 in a substantially horizontal manner or any
other desired angular disposition.
[0077]               FIG. 9 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a portion of a conveyor assembly
 15, including a pair of conveyor modules 1 supported on either end of a support frame 11,
and in particular, on the corners of the support frame 11 on support posts 17. As will be

understood, any number of conveyor modules 1 and support frames 11 may be
interconnected to form a conveyor assembly.
[0078]                 FIG. 10 illustrates a schematic elevational view showing how typical conveyor
components 12 may slide out from the ends of conveyor modules 1, above the support
frame 11 to the operational position.
[0079]                  FIG. 11 shows the conveyor module 1, with an extendable frame portion
compactly housing the conveyor components 12 within the container module 1, in the
transportation position.
[0080]                 In FIG. 12 it is shown how a support frame 11 may optionally incorporate
various typical conveyor components thereon. FIG. 12 illustrates both the transport
position, wherein the conveyor components may be pivotally hinged in a compacted
configuration, and, in an operational position wherein the conveyor components are
pivotally rotated from that transport position to a position for operational use. This
configuration, as will be understood by a person skilled in the art, could be utilised instead
of, or in addition to, incorporating the slide out conveyor component structure as
previously described and shown, such as, with reference to FIG. 10.
[0081]                 In FIG. 13A it is illustrated how a support frame 11 may typically be releasably
engaged to a conveyor module 1. FIG. 13 illustrates a support leg 17 of the support frame
 11 incorporating a twist lock fitting 18. The twist lock fitting 18 enables quick fixing and
release of the module 1 to or from the support post 17. The configuration shown, having a
tapered upper end on the twist lock fitting 18, facilitates easy self-location with or in an
engagement slot or orifice provided within the corner under the bottom of conveyor
module 1. A variety of engagement or locking devices in alternative to the twist lock
fitting 18 may alternatively be used, as would be readily apparent to persons skilled in the
art.
[0082]                 As shown in FIG. 8, the support 11 may optionally be telescopic in form to
allow for variation in frame width, so as to facilitate compact transportation but, allowing
it to be expanded in width when desired to be connected to the conveyor module 1. The

                                                          - 13
support frame 11 preferably allows for longitudinal movement and articulation between
adjacent modules 1.
[0083]                 As shown in Fig. 13B the support leg 17 may also be height adjustable to assist
in levelling of the container modules 1 attached thereto.
[0084]                 A plurality of support frames 11 may typically be positional in pairs back to
back with support legs stowed between during transportation. This permits efficient
transportation of a plurality of the support frames/modules in a single transportation
exercise, thus ensuring cost efficiency.
[0085]                 Alternatively, instead of using the support frames, drop down legs, such as
shown in FIG. 28 (and which will be described hereinafter) may be used to support the
conveyor modules 1 on the substrate surface.
[0086]                 A variety of roof structures may alternatively be used on the modules 1. In
FIG. 14 it is illustrated a configuration of a roof 8 which is adjustable in height and/or is
removable. FIG. 14A illustrates the adjustable roof 8 in the transportation position, whilst
FIG. 14B illustrates the roof 8 in the operational position.
[0087]                 FIG. 15 illustrates how the roof 8 may be engaged and secured with the
remainder of the main frame 4, the illustrated embodiment showing the use of a double pin
locking arrangement, for improved rigidity.
[0088]                 In FIG. 16 is shown a split roof arrangement, whereby a slide out roof 13 may
be slid out from each conveyor module 1. The slide out roof portions 13 from two adjacent
modules I may substantially abut as shown in FIG. 16.
[0089]                 Alternatively, a tarpaulin roof may be provided, such as shown in FIG. 17.
FIG. 17A illustrates a tarpaulin roof in a closed position, whilst FIG. 17B shows the
tarpaulin roof in the open position. Such a roof may be provided in locations of less harsh
environments, where a more solid structure may not be required. The tarpaulin roof
embodiment advantageously provides some form of protection from dust, etc., ingress to
the conveyor whilst enabling easy access during maintenance.

[0090]                 It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, in alternative
embodiments, similar extendable roof sections may be provided to extend to a side of the
module using the same pivoting, folding or slidably extendable techniques as shown herein
for the ends of the module.
[0091]                 In FIG. 18 is illustrated how typical conveyor components such as a conveyor
idler 3 may be supported on the floor 7 of module I utilising an "H" frame support
structure. Various means for adjusting the position of the conveyor components will be
described hereafter.
[0092]                 For example, in FIG. 19 is illustrated how idler support posts may be
positioned at different locations to suit different belt widths. FIG. 19A illustrates the
support post to suit a wide belt width, whilst FIG. 19B illustrates a support post position to
suit a mid belt width, and, FIG. 19C illustrates a support post position to suit a narrow belt
width.
[0093]                 To facilitate adjustment of the conveyor components 3, various mountings may
be utilised. FIG. 20 illustrates a mounting 20 which incorporates one or more horizontal
slots 22 and one or more vertical slots 21, to allow for both horizontal and vertical
adjustment of the conveyor idler 3 and other conveyor components.
[0094]                 Conveyor support brackets can also be supplied in an offset version that adjusts
either side of the structure inwardly or outwardly to compensate for an out of tolerance
condition that affects belt tracking.
[0095]                 As will be understood by persons skilled in the art, various other optional
features may additionally be provided with conveyor module of the present invention. For
example, wire supports may be required. A retractable lanyard wire support 23 is shown in
FIG. 21, illustrating both the operating and transport positions of such a component.
[0096]                 FIG. 22 illustrates a structured mounted lanyard wire support which may also
optionally be incorporated in the module of the present invention.

[0097]                 FIG. 23A illustrates yet another optimal conveyor component, being a drop
down cable tray 24, and shows both the transport in transit and operational positions of the
cable tray, and, FIG. 23B illustrates roof mounted cable tray option.
[0098]                 FIG. 24 shows a walkway support beam may additionally be incorporated to
provide walkway and maintenance access on any elevated section of the conveyor. The
platform support beam may be supplied as a mounting point for walkway sections when
required.
[0099]                 As will be apparent to persons skilled in the art, conveyor modules I may be
manufactured to house any number of optional conveyor components therein and then
transported, in a compact manner to the location where the conveyor modules are to be
installed to form a conveyor assembly 15. To install the conveyor assembly 15 at the
installation location, support frames 11 may be firstly placed on the substrate surface. Once
support frames II are in position, then a conveyor module I may be positioned atop the
ends of the support frames II and span adjacently positioned support frames 11.
[0100]              A twist lock arrangement 18 described in relation to FIG. 13 may be utilised, so
that the module 1 may be effectively locked to the respective support frame support posts
 17. Thereafter, the extension frames 14 may be slid outwardly of the main frame 4, and
any conveyor componentry may then be spaced apart at appropriate positions along the
conveyor assembly 15. For example, conveyor idlers 3 which may initially be transported
within the main frame 4 may be slid out on the extension frames 14 to their desired
operational position such that they are then relatively evenly spaced apart, if so desired, to
thereby then support a conveyor belt.
[0101]              The roof 8 of the modules 1 may be elevated from the transportation position to
the conveyor operational position. If the conveyor assembly is at some stage later
thereafter decommissioned, extension frames 14 may be slid back within the main frames
4 to be compactly housed and thereby transported for relocation to another location.
[0102]              Particular embodiments of the module 1, support frame 11, etc., have been
herein described, as have certain optional features thereof, all directed towards a conveyor

module which may be pre-fabricated with all its main components, then transported for
installation, along with other such modules 1. The modules 1 are typically dimensioned to
be compatible with the standardised ISO intermodal shipping container dimensions. The
modules may then be quickly and easily transported with existing modes of transportation
set up for transporting shipping containers, and then rapidly commissioned at a location,
which may typically be remote.
[0103]              As shown in FIG. 25, an end of a conveyor module 1 may alternatively be
embodied to be supported on a support pad, for example, the support pad formed of
concrete or like material. The module may be, in this embodiment, affixed to the support
pad in a removable manner by utilising a bridge clamp connection as shown in FIG. 25.
Alternatively, a pre-cast threaded bore casing that allows threaded adjustable legs with
twist lock fittings may be used. Other forms of support may alternatively be used as will be
appreciated by persons skilled in the art.
[0104]              In FIG. 26 is shown an alternative support frame 11 to that previously described
in relation to FIG. 7. This version of the support frame 11 incorporates a trestle
arrangement which provides the ability to flat pack the frame sides for transport. The sides
may then be bolted together on site to form a trestle. The four corners of the base may
utilise corner castings which could provide a simple lock in to the bed of a truck, similar to
that as is done with shipping containers. Frames could typically be supplied in adjustable
height to cater for varying slope.
[0105]              FIG. 27 shows yet an alternative embodiment of the invention. As previously
described, the conveyor module 1 of the present invention is preferably formed to be of a
standardised size and shape such that it substantially conforms to an intermodal shipping
container.
[0106]              The framework of this other embodiment of a container module 100 is illustrated
in FIG. 27A, without the conveyor componentry shown therein, but, with "drop down"
support legs 101 shown thereon. The container framework, generally designated by the
numeral 100, shows four support legs provided thereunder 101, and also, shows module
connection arms 102 on one end of the framework, the details of which will be described

hereinafter. FIG. 27B also illustrates the frame 100, the legs 101 and the arms 102, but also
illustrates idlers 103 positioned within the conveyor module frame 100, at spaced apart
locations therein.
[0107]            In FIG. 28 is detailed a preferred but non-limiting embodiment of such support
legs 104, FIG. 28A illustrating an isometric view of the support leg structure, whilst FIG.
28B showing an elevational view thereof in the operational position, and FIG. 28C
showing an elevational view thereof in the folded, or retracted position, suitable for
transportation.
[0108]            The embodiment of the support leg shown in FIGS. 28 shows a plate-like
member 105 which is adapted to be supported on a substrate surface, and which may
optionally incorporate an abutment surface which is designed to inhibit movement when
positioned on the substrate surface by means of having raised ribs or the like. The support
leg itself 107 is preferably articulated about pivot point 108 such that it can move between
the operational position as shown in FIG. 28B and the folded, or retracted position shown
in FIG. 28C such that it may be compactly stored for transportation. A plate at the top of
support leg 107, illustrated by the reference numeral 109, may be bolted or otherwise
attached to the module 110 as will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art by bolts,
pins, or the like.
[0109]               In FIG. 29A is illustrated how the internal conveyor componentry 115 within
the module 116 may be angularly positioned therein in an asymmetric manner or the like,
so as to take into account desired curvature, for instance when the conveyor is intended to
convey material around a curve or corner. FIG. 29B illustrates the modular container 116
in an angular disposition supported on support legs 117 and 118 above substrate plates 119
and 120 respectively. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art such angular
disposition facilitates appropriate conveyance of the conveyed material on the conveyor,
and the extent of angling is variable depending on site specifications, etc. Vertical curves
are also possible, in that conveyor is able to go up and down grades of up to around 10
degrees. Compound curves where angulation in both horizontal and vertical planes is also
possible.

[0110]               In FIG. 30A is illustrated a module connection arm, which is adapted to secure
or interconnect adjacent modules. The connection arm, illustrated by reference numeral
 121, may typically be pivoted about a pivot point 122 and/or elongated using an extendible
length arm 123 and incorporate appropriate connection members 124 and 125 for
securement to a pair of modules 126 and 127 respectively, as illustrated in FIG. 30B. It
will be appreciated that a variety of different types of connection arms, etc., may
alternatively be utilised.
[0111]               In FIG. 31 is illustrated an elevated conveyor module, elevated from the
substrate surface on elongated support legs. The module 130 is shown having four
elongated legs 131 supported on substrate plates 132. The legs 131 may be of adjustable
length, if desired, as will be understood by person skilled in the art.
[0112]               In FIG. 32 is illustrated how a hopper may be positioned over a conveyor
module. The conveyor module 140 is shown supported on its various support legs 141, and
the hopper 142 is shown having its own framework 143 to position it over the module.
Various other components may likewise be installed, as desired. The hopper can
alternatively be an integral part of the conveyor module and bolted directly to structural
elements.
[0113]               It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the module may be
readily installed by being transported by ship, truck, train or other transportation modes
and then, being appropriately craned into position.
[0114]               FIG. 33 shows a robotic idler changing machine adapted to travel along the top
of a conveyor module 1. The robotic idler changing machine is adapted to lift a running
conveyor belt with product clear of the idler rollers. Robotic arms can then remove
damaged rollers and replace with new rollers in a safe manner whilst not disrupting
productive time.
[0115]               It will be appreciated that numerous other variations and modifications will
become apparent to persons skilled in the art. All such variations and modifications should
