    Field of the Invention
    The present disclosure relates to fiber optic and electrical connection systems, and more
   particularly to connection systems that simultaneously connect both optical and electrical
20  circuits.
   Background of the Invention
   Fiber optic cables are widely used to transmit light signals for high speed data
25 transmission. A fiber optic cable typically includes: (1) an optical fiber or optical fibers;
    (2) a buffer or buffers that surrounds the fiber or fibers; (3) a strength layer and/or strength
    members that surrounds the buffer or buffers; and (4) an outer jacket. Optical fibers
    function to carry optical signals. A typical optical fiber includes an inner core surrounded
   by a cladding that is covered by a coating. Buffers (e.g., loose or tight buffer tubes)
30  typically function to surround and protect coated optical fibers. Strength layers and/or
    strength members add mechanical strength to fiber optic cables to protect the internal
    optical fibers against stresses applied to the cables during installation and thereafter.
    Example strength layers/strength members include aramid yarn, steel, glass-reinforced

                                                                                             -2
   plastic (GRP), and epoxy reinforced glass roving. Outer jackets provide protection against
    damage caused by crushing, abrasions, and other physical damage. Outer jackets also
   provide protection against chemical damage (e.g., ozone, alkali, acids).
 5 Fiber optic cable connection systems are used to facilitate connecting and disconnecting
    fiber optic cables in the field without requiring a splice. A typical fiber optic cable
    connection system for interconnecting two fiber optic cables includes fiber optic
    connectors mounted at the ends of the fiber optic cables, and an adapter for mechanically
    and optically coupling the fiber optic connectors together. Fiber optic connectors generally
10  include ferrules that support the ends of the optical fibers of the fiber optic cables. The end
    faces of the ferrules are typically polished and are often angled. The adapter includes co
    axially aligned ports (i.e., receptacles) for receiving the fiber optic connectors desired to be
    interconnected. The adapter includes an internal sleeve that receives and aligns the ferrules
    of the fiber optic connectors when the connectors are inserted within the ports of the
15  adapter. With the ferrules and their associated fibers aligned within the sleeve of the
    adapter, a fiber optic signal can pass from one fiber to the next. The adapter also typically
    has a mechanical fastening arrangement (e.g., a snap-fit arrangement) for mechanically
    retaining the fiber optic connectors within the adapter. One example of an existing fiber
    optic connection system is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,579,014, 6,648,520, and
20  6,899,467.
    It is generally desirable to overcome or ameliorate one or more of the above described
    difficulties, or to at least provide a useful alternative.

 5  One preferred embodiment of the present disclosure relates to a fiber optic and electrical
    connection system that includes a fiber optic cable, a ruggedized fiber optic connector, and
    a ruggedized fiber optic adapter.
    The fiber optic cable includes first and second strength members that are electrically

   portion of the ruggedized fiber optic connector. The ruggedized port includes internal
   threads that threadingly receive external threads of the coupling nut, and the ruggedized
   port includes a sealing surface that engages the sealing member of the ruggedized fiber
    optic connector when the ruggedized fiber optic connector is fully connected to the
 5 ruggedized fiber optic adapter. The first contact of the third electrical conductor of the
   ruggedized fiber optic adapter electrically contacts the first electrical conductor of the
   ruggedized fiber optic connector and the second contact of the fourth electrical conductor
    of the ruggedized fiber optic adapter electrically contacts the second electrical conductor of
   the ruggedized fiber optic connector when the ruggedized fiber optic connector is fully
10  connected to the ruggedized fiber optic adapter.
    The first and the second strength members of the fiber optic cable can be electrically
    insulated from each other. The first and the second electrical conductors of the ruggedized
    fiber optic connector can be electrically insulated from each other. And, the third and the
15  fourth electrical conductors of the ruggedized fiber optic adapter can be electrically
    insulated from each other.
    The first and the second strength members can include a glass reinforced plastic clad by a
    conductive material. The connector housing of the ruggedized fiber optic connector can
20  include a first channel for receiving the first strength member and a second channel for
    receiving the second strength member of the fiber optic cable. The first electrical
    conductor can include a first lug at least partially between the first strength member and a
    wall of the first channel, and the second electrical conductor can include a second lug at
    least partially between the second strength member and a wall of the second channel. The
25  first lug electrically connects the first electrical conductor to the first strength member, and
    the second lug electrically connects the second electrical conductor to the second strength
    member. The first lug can be bonded to the first strength member, and the second lug can
   be bonded to the second strength member by an electrically conducting material.
30  The plug portion of the connector housing of the ruggedized fiber optic connector can

    a contacting portion of the first electrical conductor, and the second detent can expose a
    contacting portion of the second electrical conductor. The ferrule sleeve of the ruggedized
    fiber optic adapter can define a central longitudinal axis. The first contact of the third
    electrical conductor can be spring-loaded toward the longitudinal axis, and the second
 5  contact of the fourth electrical conductor can be spring-loaded toward the longitudinal axis.
    The first and the second contacts can initially spread apart from each other upon insertion
    of the plug portion of the connector housing into the ruggedized port of the ruggedized
    fiber optic adapter. The first contact can press into the first detent and the second contact
    can press into the second detent when the ruggedized fiber optic connector is fully
10  connected to the ruggedized fiber optic adapter. The first contact can electrically contact
    the contacting portion of the first electrical conductor and the second contact can
    electrically contact the contacting portion of the second electrical conductor when the
    ruggedized fiber optic connector is fully connected to the ruggedized fiber optic adapter.
15  The adapter housing of the ruggedized fiber optic adapter can include first and second slots
   between the first and the second ends of the adapter housing. The first and the second slots
    can extend through a wall of the adapter housing from the ruggedized port to an exterior of
    the adapter housing.

    Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments of the Invention
15
    The present disclosure involves fiber optic cable connection systems and components that
    connect both optical paths and electrical paths. In particular, a fiber optic cable includes at
    least one optical fiber and at least one electrical conductor. The fiber optic cable is
    terminated and connected to hardware such as telecommunications and/or computer
20  hardware. Upon connection, the optical fiber is optically connected and the electrical
    conductor is electrically connected to the hardware via the termination. The hardware can
    include an adapter, and the adapter can connect the fiber optic cable to a second optical
    cable and/or a second electrical conductor.
25 As depicted, a fiber optic cable 20 includes two electrical conductors, 224 A and 224B. In
   particular, the fiber optic cable 20 includes a first strength member 224A and a second
    strength member 224B that are electrically conductive and function as the electrical
    conductors 224A, 224B (see Figures 1 and 2). Example strength members 224A, 224B can
   be made of aramid yam, steel, glass-reinforced plastic (GRP), and/or epoxy reinforced
30  glass roving. The strength members 224A, 224B can include a conductive metallic coating
    such as an aluminum or a copper coating over otherwise non-conducting or poorly
    conducting material. The strength members 224A, 224B can include conductive metallic

    strands such as aluminum or copper strands, and the strands can be mixed with otherwise
   non-conducting or poorly conducting material of the strength members 224 A, 224B. In
    other embodiments, the electrical conductors 224 A and 224B can be separate from the
    strength members. The example fiber optic cable 20 further includes an optical fiber 500, a
 5 buffer layer 220 (see Figures 5 and 6), and a cable jacket 226.
   As depicted, the fiber optic cable 20 is terminated by a fiber optic connector 32. The fiber
    optic connector 32 can be a ruggedized fiber optic connector and is depicted as such. The
    fiber optic connector 32 includes similarities to fiber optic connectors illustrated at U.S.
10 Patent Application Publications 2009/0148101,                                                2009/0148102, 2009/0148103, and
   2009/0148104, incorporated by reference above. The fiber optic connector 32 includes a
    connector housing 39 (see Figure 5) that extends between a proximal end 54 (see Figure 1)
    and a distal end 52 (see Figure 5). The distal end 52 includes a plug portion 56, and the
   proximal end 54 is mechanically connected to the fiber optic cable 20. A coupling nut 40
15 with external threads 75 can be placed over and/or rotatably mounted on the connector
   housing 39. A sealing member 49 can be placed around the connector housing 39 between
   the coupling nut 40 and the distal end 52. A ferrule 100 is mounted to the plug portion 56
    and terminates the optical fiber 500 of the fiber optic cable 20. The ferrule 100 defines a
    central longitudinal axis Ai of the fiber optic connector 32 (see Figures 5 and 6).
20
    The fiber optic connector 32 includes a first electrical conductor 391A and a second
    electrical conductor 391B. The first electrical conductor 391 A is electrically connected
   with the first strength member 224A, and the second electrical conductor 39 IB is
    electrically connected with the second strength member 224B (see Figure 6). As depicted,
25 the connector housing 39 includes a first pathway 396A and a second pathway 396B that
    extend at least partially within the connector housing 39 (see Figure 5). The first and the
    second pathways 396 A, 396B extend within a circumference of the sealing member 49
    and thus do not interfere or compromise functionality of the sealing member 49. The first
    and the second pathways 396 A, 396B extend within an interior of the coupling nut 40 and
30 thus do not interfere or compromise functionality of the coupling nut 40. Likewise, the first
    and the second pathways 396 A, 396B extend within various other features of the

    connector housing 39, as illustrated at Figure 5. As depicted, the first and the second
   pathways 396A, 396B distally emerge at detents 55A and 55B of the connector housing 39
   respectively, and the pathways 396A, 396B proximally emerge within the connector 32
   near ends 225 A, 225B of the strength members 224A, 224B. The detents 55A, 55B can be
 5 positioned at the plug portion 56 of the connector housing 39. As depicted, the first
    electrical conductor 391 A is positioned partially within the first pathway 396 A, and the
    second electrical conductor 39 IB is positioned partially within the second pathway 396B.
    The first electrical conductor 391 A of the fiber optic connector 32 includes a contacting
10 portion 381 A at or near its distal end, and the second electrical conductor 39 IB of the
    fiber optic connector 32 includes a contacting portion 381B at or near its distal end (see
    Figure 6). The contacting portion 381 A is exposed within the detent 55 A, and the
    contacting portion 381 B is exposed within the detent 55B. The first electrical conductor
    391 A of the fiber optic connector 32 includes a lug 371 A at or near its proximal end, and
15  the second electrical conductor 39 IB of the fiber optic connector 32 includes a lug 371B at
    or near its distal end (see Figures 1 and 2). The lugs 371 A, 371B are adapted to be
   mechanically and electrically connected with the strength members 224A, 224B. The
    electrical conductors 391 A, 391B thereby electrically connect the strength members 224B,

20 portions 381 A, 38 IB face laterally outward from the plug portion 56.
   As depicted, the fiber optic connector 32 can be received by and connected to a fiber optic
    adapter 34. The fiber optic adapter 34 can be a ruggedized fiber optic adapter and is
    depicted as such. The fiber optic adapter 34 includes similarities to fiber optic adapters
25  illustrated                 at U.S.                 Patent Application                     Publications 2009/0148101, 2009/0148102,

    adapter mounting nut 46 can be placed over external threads 66 of the first housing piece
   45 of the adapter housing 44. The first housing piece 45 can include a mounting flange 48
    for use in conjunction with the adapter mounting nut 46. A sealing member 17 can be
 5 placed around the adapter housing 44 between the adapter mounting nut 46 and the
   mounting flange 48. Ruggedisation functions, including sealing by the sealing member 17
    and the sealing surface 74, adapter 34 mounting by the mounting flange 48 and the
   mounting nut 46, and connector 32 attachment by the internal threads 76 are thus
    accomplished and/or accommodated by the first housing piece 45 of the adapter housing
10 44. A ferrule holding and alignment sleeve 202 is mounted within the fiber optic adapter
    34 and is accessible from both the ports 35 and 37. The alignment sleeve 202 defines an
    axis A2 of the fiber optic adapter 34.
    The fiber optic adapter 34 includes a first electrical conductor 323A and a second electrical
15  conductor 323B. The first and second electrical conductors 323A, 323B can be
    substantially identical to each other and be collectively referred to as an electrical
    conductor 323 (see Figures 7 and 8). In certain embodiments, the electrical conductor 323
    is made of a material with flexible and/or spring-like properties. The first electrical
    conductor 323 A is electrically connected with the first electrical conductor 391 A and the
20  second electrical conductor 323 B is electrically connected with the second electrical
    conductor 39 IB when the fiber optic connector 32 is fully received by the fiber optic
    adapter 34 (see Figures 1 and 2). As depicted, the second housing piece 47 of the adapter
    housing 44 includes a first slot 343A and a second slot 343B that extend through a wall 50
    of the second housing piece 47 (see Figure 3). The first and the second slots 343A, 343B
25  extend through the wall 50 of the second housing piece 47 of the housing 44 between the
    sealing member 17 and the non-ruggedized port 37 and thus do not interfere or
    compromise functionality of the sealing member 17, the sealing surface 74, and/or other
    ruggedized features of the ruggedized fiber optic adapter 34. The first and the second slots
    343A, 343B extend within an interior of the adapter housing 44. As depicted, the first

    The first electrical conductor 323A of the fiber optic adapter 34 includes a contacting
   portion 383A at or near an exterior of the adapter housing 44, and the second electrical
 5  conductor 323B includes a contacting portion 383B at or near the exterior of the adapter
   housing 44 (see Figure 4). As depicted, the contacting portions 383 A, 383B face normal to
   the central longitudinal axis A2 of the fiber optic adapter 34. The first electrical conductor
    323 A of the fiber optic adapter 34 includes a contact 331 A at or near the interior of the
    adapter housing 44, and the second electrical conductor 323B includes a contact 33 IB at
10  or near the interior of the adapter housing 44 (see Figure 4). The contacts 331 A, 331 B are
   biased inwardly within the adapter housing 44 and are adapted to be mechanically and
    electrically connected with the contacting portions 381 A, 381 B of the electrical
    conductors 391 A, 39 IB of the fiber optic connector 32 when the fiber optic connector 32
    is fully inserted into the first port 35 of the fiber optic adapter 34. The contacts 331 A,
15  331B include a ramp and/or a rounded portion 332 (see Figures 7 and 8). As depicted, the
    electrical conductor 323 includes a cantilevered arm 333 that urges the contacts 331 A,
    331B inward toward the axis A2 of the fiber optic adapter 34 when the electrical
    conductors 323 are in an installed position, as shown at Figure 4.
20 When the fiber optic connector 32 is inserted into the port 35 of the fiber optic adapter 34,
   the plug portion 56 can flex the contacts 331 A, 33 IB of the electrical conductors 323 A,
    323B outward. As the insertion continues, the contacts 331 A, 331B reach the detents 55
   A, 55B of the connector housing 39 and thereby un-flex into the detents 55 A, 55B. When
   the contacts 331 A, 331B un-flex, they establish electrical contact with the contacting
25 portions 381 A, 38 IB of the electrical conductors 391 A, 391B of the fiber optic connector
    32. The electrical conductors 323A, 323B thereby electrically connect the fiber optic
    connector 32 to the exterior of the fiber optic adapter 34.

    enclosure 19 (e.g., a cabinet, a fiber distribution hub, a drop terminal, etc.) or other piece of
    optical-electrical hardware (see Figures 11, 13, 14, and 17-19). An example drop terminal
    is described at U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0138025, published June 12,
   2008, and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The enclosure 19 includes one
 5  or more openings 22 (see Figure 12) that are adapted to mount the fiber optic adapter 34.
   An example electrical conductor 260 can be included within the enclosure 19 that makes
    electrical contact with the contacting portions 383 A, 383B of the electrical conductors 323
   A, 323B (see Figure 14). The path of electrical continuity can transmit electricity for the
   purpose of electrical power and/or electrical signals between the fiber optic cable 20 and
10 the enclosure 19.
    The electrical conductor 260 can be included on and held by a circuit board 250 or other
    suitable means. Figures 11 and 13-19 illustrate several circuit boards that are collectively
   referred to as the circuit boards 250. The circuit boards 250 include several electrical
15  conductors that are collectively referred to as the electrical conductors 260.
    The electrical conductors 323 include a valley 328 and a peak 329. The circuit boards 250
    can be held in operational position by mounting them on one or more of the electrical
    conductors 323. In particular, the circuit boards 250 include one or more openings 222 (see
20 Figures 15 and 16). The openings 222 of the circuit boards 250 can be held within a pair of
    opposed valleys 328 of the electrical conductors 323 of the fiber optic adapters 34. The
    circuit boards 250 can be snapped on and snapped off from around the fiber optic adapters
    34 by pressing them over the peaks 329 of the electrical conductors 323 of the fiber optic
    adapters 34. The peaks 329 can elastically and/or plastically deform when the circuit board
25 250 is snapped on and off.
    The circuit boards 250 or other mountings for the electrical conductors 260 within the
    enclosure 19 can be mechanically supported by the enclosure 19 and/or other structure
   within the enclosure 19. This allows the electrical conductors 323 of the adapter 34 to be
30  electrically connected with the conductors 260 of the circuit board 250 when the adapter
    34 is inserted through the opening 22 of the enclosure 19. As described above but with the

    circuit board 250 remaining stationary, the adapter 34 can be snapped in and snapped out
    of the opening 222 of the circuit board 250.
   Figures 11 and 13-19 illustrate the various circuit boards 250. In particular, Figures 11 and
 5  13-18 illustrate a crossed connection circuit board 250C and a straight connection circuit
   board 250S. The circuit boards 250C and 250S can transmit signals and/or power between
    a first fiber optic cable 20A and a second fiber optic cable 20B. The crossed connection
    circuit board 250C results in electrical connection between the first strength member 224A
    of the first fiber optic cable 20A and the second strength member 224B of the second fiber
10  optic cable 20B. The crossed connection circuit board 250C also results in electrical
    connection between the second strength member 224B of the first fiber optic cable 20A
    and the first strength member 224A of the second fiber optic cable 20B (see Figure 13).
    The straight connection circuit board 250S results in electrical connection between the first
    strength member 224A of the first fiber optic cable 20A and the first strength member 224
15 A of the second fiber optic cable 20B. The straight connection circuit board 250S also
   results in electrical connection between the second strength member 224B of the first fiber
    optic cable 20A and the second strength member 224B of the second fiber optic cable 20B.
    The circuit boards 250C and 250S and the paths of electrical continuity that they are part
    of can be used, for example, to bring electrical power from a dwelling of an end user to a
20  fiber optic enclosure (e.g., the cabinet, the fiber distribution hub, the drop terminal, etc.).
    The electrical power can be transferred by the fiber optic cables 20A, 20B and used within
   the fiber optic enclosure to provide power to active optical components within the
    enclosure. One of the cables 20A, 20B can be connected to the dwelling of the end user
    and receive electrical power from the dwelling.
