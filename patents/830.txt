                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0005]           1. Field of the Invention
[0006]          This invention pertains generally to monitoring skin pressure ulcers and more
particularly to skin ulcer monitoring via measurement of Sub-epidermal Moisture (SEM).
[0007]          2. Description of Related Art
[0008]          Patients' skin integrity has long been an issue of concern for nurses and in nursing
homes. Maintenance of skin integrity has been identified by the American Nurses Association as
an important indicator of quality nursing care. Meanwhile, pressure ulcers remain a major health

                                                    2
problem particularly for hospitalized older adults. When age is considered along with other risk
factors, the incidence of pressure ulcers is significantly increased. Overall incidence of pressure
ulcers for hospitalized patients ranges from 2.7% to 29.5%, and rates of greater than 50% have
been reported for patients in intensive care settings. In a multicenter cohort retrospective study of
1,803 older adults discharged from acute care hospitals with selected diagnoses, 13.2% (i.e., 164
patients) demonstrated an incidence of stage I ulcers. Of those 164 patients, 38 (16%) had ulcers
that progressed to a more advanced stage. Pressure ulcers additionally have been associated with
an increased risk of death one year after hospital discharge. The estimated cost of treating
pressure ulcers ranges from $5,000 to $40,000 for each ulcer, depending on severity.
[0009]       Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a preventive solution to measure
moisture content of the skin as a mean to detect early symptoms of ulcer development.
                             BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0009a]      It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome, or at least
ameliorate, at least one disadvantage of present arrangements.
[0009b]      One aspect of the present invention provides a Sub-Epidermal Moisture (SEM)
sensing apparatus, comprising: a flexible substrate, a first electrode and a second electrode that
are both disposed on a common side of the flexible substrate, and an electronics package that is
individually wired to each of the first and second electrodes and configured for independent
interrogation, excitation, and data retrieval and further configured to measure a sub-epidermal
capacitance of a target region of skin between the first and second electrodes, the sub-epidermal
capacitance corresponding to the moisture content of the target region.
[0009c]      Another aspect of the present invention provides a Sub-Epidermal Moisture (SEM)
sensing apparatus, comprising: a flexible substrate, four or more electrodes disposed on a
common side of the flexible substrate, and an electronics package that is individually wired to
each of the four or more electrodes configured for independent interrogation, excitation, and data
retrieval, wherein said electronics package is further configured to select a pair of electrodes
from said four or more electrodes and measure a sub-epidermal capacitance of a target region of
skin between the selected pair of electrodes, the sub-epidermal capacitance corresponding to an
amount of moisture content of the target region.
[0010]       Another aspect of the present invention is a smart compact capacitive
sensing conforming handheld apparatus configured to measure Sub-epidermal Moisture (SEM)
as a mean to detect and monitor the development of pressure ulcers. The device incorporates an
array of electrodes which are excited to measure and scan SEM in a programmable and
multiplexed manner by a battery-less RF-powered chip. The scanning operation is initiated by an

                                                2a
interrogator which excites a coil embedded in the apparatus and provides the needed energy
burst to support the scanning/reading operation. Each embedded electrode measures the
equivalent sub-epidermal capacitance

          corresponding and representing the moisture content of the target surface.
   [0011]         An aspect of this invention is the in situ sensing and monitoring of skin
          or wound or ulcer development status using a wireless, biocompatible RF
          powered capacitive sensing system referred to as smart SEM imager. The
 5        present invention enables the realization of smart preventive measures by
          enabling early detection of ulcer formation or inflammatory pressure which
          would otherwise have not been detected for an extended period with
          increased risk of infection and higher stage ulcer development.
   [0012]         In one beneficial embodiment, the handheld capacitive sensing imager
10        apparatus incorporates pressure sensing components in conjunction with the
          sensing electrodes to monitor the level of applied pressure on each electrode
          in order to guarantee precise wound or skin electrical capacitance
          measurements to characterize moisture content. In summary, such
          embodiment would enable new capabilities including but not limited to: 1)
15        measurement capabilities such as SEM imaging and SEM depth imaging
          determined by electrode geometry and dielectrics, and 2) signal processing
          and pattern recognition having automatic and assured registration exploiting
          pressure imaging and automatic assurance of usage exploiting software
          systems providing usage tracking.
20 [0013]         One major implication of this sensor-enhanced paradigm is the ability to
          better manage each individual patient resulting in a timelier and more efficient
          practice in hospitals and even nursing homes. This is applicable to patients
          with a history of chronic wounds, diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers or post
          operative wounds. In addition, alterations in signal content may be integrated
25        with the activity level of the patient, the position of patient's body and
          standardized assessments of symptoms. By maintaining the data collected in
          these patients in a signal database, pattern classification, search, and pattern
          matching algorithms can be developed to better map symptoms with
          alterations in skin characteristics and ulcer development. This approach is not
30        limited to the specific condition of ulcer or wound, but may have broad
          application in all forms of wound management and even skin diseases or
                                                 -3-

          treatments.
   [0014]           One aspect is apparatus for sensing sub-epidermal moisture (SEM)
          from a location external to a patient's skin. The apparatus includes a bipolar
          RF sensor embedded on a flexible substrate, and a conformal pressure pad
 5        disposed adjacent and underneath the substrate, wherein the conformal
          pressure pad is configured to support the flexible substrate while allowing the
          flexible substrate to conform to a non-planar sensing surface of the patient's
          skin. The apparatus further includes interface electronics coupled to the
          sensor; wherein the interface electronics are configured to control emission
10        and reception of RF energy to interrogate the patient's skin.
   [0015]         Another aspect is a method for monitoring the formation of pressure
          ulcers at a target location of a patient's skin. The method includes the steps of
          positioning a flexible substrate adjacent the target location of the patient's skin;
          the flexible substrate comprising one or more bipolar RF sensors; conforming
15        the flexible substrate to the patient's skin at the target location; exciting the
          one or more bipolar RF sensor to emit RF energy into the patient's skin; and
          measuring the capacitance of the skin at the target location as an indicator of
          the Sub-Epidermal Moisture (SEM) at the target location.
   [0016]          Further aspects of the invention will be brought out in the following
20        portions of the specification, wherein the detailed description is for the purpose
          of fully disclosing preferred embodiments of the invention without placing
          limitations thereon.

                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   [0035]         In one exemplary embodiment, a smart handheld capacitive sensing
          device according to the present invention employs a programmable sensing
          electrode array. This is based on methods that use an interrogator to excite
 5        the embedded electrodes.
   [0036]         FIG. 1 illustrates an SEM scanning/sensing apparatus 10 according to
          the present invention. The scanner 10 comprises five main components,
          including a top silicone edge sealing gasket 18 encircling a Kapton-based
          sensing substrate 16, which rests on a conformal silicone pressure pad 12. A
10        thick annular silicone spacer 20 is disposed under pressure pad to provide
          free space for the pressure pad to deform. The bottom layer comprises an
          interface electronics package enclosure 22 that houses interface circuitry for
          interrogating and transmitting data for evaluation. These five main components
          are described in further detail below.
15 [0037]         In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, an array 14 of individual RF
          electrode sensors 24 and 26 is embedded on a flexible biocompatible
          substrate 16. Substrate 16 may comprise a laminated Kapton (Polyimide)
          chip-on-flex.
   [0038]         FIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment of a Kapton sensor substrate 16a
20        that comprises an array 14 of differing sized concentric sensing electrodes. A
          flexible biocompatible Polyimide or Kapton substrate 32 comprises a layer of
          sensing pads 14 and 15 coated on one side with an ultra thin cover layer 30 of
          Polyimide (e.g. CA335) to isolate pads electrodes 14,15 from direct moisture
          contact and also to provide a uniform contact surface.
25 [0039]         In FIG. 2, sample capacitive sensing electrodes 14 are shown in
          different sizes (e.g. 24, 26, and 29), which are manipulated to achieve and
          sense different depths of skin. Sensing electrodes 14 may comprise any
          number of different shape and configurations, such as the concentric circles of
          array 14, or the interdigitating fingers of sensor 15.
30 [0040]         FIG. 3 illustrates a close-up top view of a concentric sensing pad 26 in
          accordance with the present invention. Pad 26 comprises a bipolar
                                                -6-

          configuration having a first electrode 36 comprising an outer annular ring
          disposed around a second inner circular electrode 38. Outer ring electrode 36
          has an outer diameter D, and an inner diameter Di that is larger than the
          diameter D, of the circular inner electrode 38 to form annular gap 40. Inner
 5        circular electrode 38 and outer ring electrode 36 are coupled electrically to
          interface electronics in the interface electronics package 22. As shown in
          greater detail in FIGS. 4 and 5, electrodes 36 and 38 are disposed on
          separate layers within the substrate assembly 16.
   [0041]        The dimensions of the sensor pads 24, 26 generally correspond to the
10        depth of interrogation into the derma of the patient. Accordingly, a larger
          diameter pad (e.g. pad 26 or 29) will penetrate deeper into the skin than a
          smaller pad. The desired depth may vary depending on the region of the
          body being scanned, or the age, skin anatomy or other characteristic of the
          patient. Thus, SEM scanner 10 may comprise an array of different sized pads
15        (e.g. small pads 24 and medium sized pads 26 shown in FIG. 1) each
          individually coupled to the interface electronics package 22.
   [0042]         FIG. 4 illustrates side view of a flex stack-up for a Kapton based
          substrate assembly 16, where thin adhesive layers 42 are used to attach a
          Kapton layer 32 in between copper layers 44 and 46, all of which are disposed
20        between upper coverlay 30 and lower coverlay 48. A stiffener 50 is disposed
          under lower coverlay 48, being positioned directly under copper layer 46 of the
          sensing pads. The stiffener 50 forms a rigid portion of the substrate where
          sensing pad array 14, connectors (e.g. connectors 66, 76, or 86 shown in FIG.
          6) and interfacing (e.g. lead wires 34) are located, so that these areas do not
25        deform, whereas the rest of the substrate is free to deform. The top copper
          layer 44 is used to etch out electrode array 14 and corresponding copper
          routing 34 to the connectors. The bottom copper layer 46 preferably comprises
          a crisscross ground plane to shield electrode array 14 from unwanted
          electromagnetic interference.
30 [0043]         In one embodiment, the flex substrate 16 assembly comprises Pyralux
          FR material from Dupont. In an exemplary configuration, approximately 5mil
                                                -7-

          thick FR9150R double-sided Pyralux FR copper clad laminate is used as the
          Kapton substrate. Top coverlay 30 comprises Pyralux 5mil FRO150 and the
          bottom coverlay 48 comprises 1 mil FRO110 Pyralux. The thickness of the top
          FRO1 50 coverlay 30 is an important parameter as it affects the sensitivity of
 5        sensing electrodes in measuring skin moisture content. Copper layers 44, 46
          are generally 1.4mil thick, while adhesive layers 42 are generally 1 mil thick.
          The stiffener 50 is shown in FIG. 4 is approximately 31 mil thick.
   [0044]         FIG. 5 shows a side view of a preferred alternative flex stack-up for a
          Kapton based substrate 120, where thin adhesive layers 42 (1 mil) are used to
10        attach an 18 mil Kapton layer 122 in between 1.4 mil copper layers 44 and 46,
          all of which are disposed between 2 mil upper coverlay 30 and 1 mil lower
          coverlay 48. A stiffener 50 is disposed under lower coverlay 48, being
          positioned directly under copper layer 46 of the sensing pad. The 31 mil FR4
          stiffener 126 forms a rigid portion of the substrate under the array 14 of
15        sensing pads, connectors 66 and interfacing 34. A 2 mil layer of PSA adhesive
          124 is used between the bottom coverlay 48 and stiffener 126. The layering of
          assembly 120 is configured to provide proper shielding from interference.
   [0045]         FIG. 6 shows a top view of three separate and adjacently arranged
          concentric bipolar electrode sensing Kapton-based flex pads 60, 70 and 80
20        having different sized capacitive sensing concentric electrodes. Pad 60
          comprises a substrate having two large concentric electrodes 62 wired through
          substrate 64 via connectors 34 to lead line inputs 66.    Pad 70 comprises a
          substrate having two medium concentric electrodes 72 wired through
          substrate 74 to lead line inputs 76. Pad 80 comprises a substrate having two
25        small concentric electrodes 82 wired through substrate 84 to lead line inputs
          86. The configuration shown in FIG. 6 is optimized for cutting/manufacturing
          and also to avoid interference between data lines and sensors. Each of the
          bipolar electrode pads is individually wired to the electronics package 22 to
          allow for independent interrogation, excitation, and data retrieval.
30 [0046]         FIG. 7 illustrates an exploded perspective component view of the SEM
          scanner 10. The silicone edge sealing gasket 18 is applied over the Kapton
                                               -8-

          sensor substrate assembly 16 to seal and shield the edge interface connectors
          through which interface electronics package 22 excite and controls the
          sensing electrode array 14. The Kapton sensor substrate assembly 16 rests
          on a conformal silicone pressure pad 12 that provides both support and
 5        conformity to enable measurements over body curvature and bony
          prominences.
   [0047]         In one beneficial embodiment, pressure sensor 11 may be embedded
          under each sensing electrode 24, 26 (e.g. in an identical array not shown),
          sandwiched between Kapton sensor substrate 26 and the conformal silicone
10        pressure pad 28 to measure applied pressure at each electrode, thus ensuring
          a uniform pressure and precise capacitance sensing.
   [0048]         Lead access apertures 28 provide passage for routing the connector
          wires (not shown) from the substrate connectors (e.g. 66, 76, 86) through the
          pressure pad 12, annular spacer 20 to the interface electronics 22.
15 [0049]         The annular silicone spacer 20 comprises a central opening 27 that
          provides needed spacing between the conformal silicone pressure pad 12 and
          the interface electronics package 22 to allow the pressure pad 12 and flexible
          substrate to conform in a non-planar fashion to conduct measurements over
          body curvatures or bony prominences.
20 [0050]         In one embodiment, the interface electronics package 22 is connected
          to a logging unit or other electronics (not shown) through wire-line USB
          connector 56.
   [0051]         The interface electronics package 22 preferably comprises an
          enclosure that contains all the electronics (not shown) needed to excite,
25        program and control the sensing operation and manage the logged data. The
          electronics package 22 may also comprise Bluetooth or other wireless
          communication capabilities to allow for transfer of sensing data to a computer
          or other remote device. Docked data transfer is also contemplated, in addition
          to real-time Bluetooth transfer. A gateway device (not shown) may be used
30        for communicating with the SEM device 10 and data formatting prior to upload
          to a computer or backend server.

   [00521         FIG. 8 is a schematic side view of the SEM scanner 10 in the nominal
          configuration, showing the edge gasket 18 over Kapton substrate 16, and lead
          access apertures 28, which provide access through annular spacer 20 and
          conformal pad 12 to electronics 22.
 5 [0053]         FIG. 9 illustrates a schematic side view of the SEM scanner 10 in
          contact with the target subject 25. The annular silicone spacer 20 provides
          enough spacing for conforming silicone pad 12 to conform to the target
          surface 25. The conforming silicone pad 12 enables continuous contact
          between the substrate 16 and patient's skin 25, thus minimizing gaps between
10        the substrate 16 and patient's skin 25 that could otherwise result in improper
          readings of the patient anatomy. Electrode array 14, which is embedded in
          substrates 6, is shown interrogating into the derma of tissue 25 by directing
          emission of an RF signal or energy into the skin and receiving the signal and
          correspondingly reading the reflected signal. The interrogator or electronics
15        package 22 excites electrode coil 14 by providing the needed energy burst to
          support the scanning/reading of the tissue. Each embedded electrode 14
          measures the equivalent sub-epidermal capacitance corresponding to the
          moisture content of the target skin 25.
   [0054]         While other energy modalities are contemplated (e.g. ultrasound,
20        microwave, etc.), RF is generally preferred for its resolution in SEM scanning.
   [0055]         FIG. 10 illustrates a perspective view of an assembled SEM scanner 10
          with an alternative substrate 16b having an array 14 of ten sensors dispersed
          within the substrate 16b. This larger array 14 provides for a larger scanning
          area of the subject anatomy, thus providing a complete picture of the target
25        anatomy in one image without having to generate a scanning motion. It is
          appreciated that array 14 may comprise any number of individual sensors, in
          be disposed in a variety of patterns.
   [0056]         The SEM scanner 10 was evaluated using a number of different sized
          and types of sensors 26. Table 1 illustrates electrode geometries are used
30        throughout the following measurements. As shown in FIG. 1 the outer ring
          electrode diameter Do varied from 5 mm for the XXS pad, to 55 mm for the
                                              -10-

          large pad. The outer ring electrode inner diameter Di varied from 4 mm for the
          XXS pad, to 40 mm for the large pad. The inner electrode diameter Dc varied
          from 2 mm for the XXS pad, to 7 mm for the large pad. It is appreciated that
          the actual dimensions of the electrodes may vary from ranges shown in these
 5        experiments. For example, the contact diameter may range from 5 mm to 30
          mm, and preferably ranges from 10 mm to 20 mm.
   [0057]         To measure the properties of each sensor size listed in Table 1, the
          sensors were fabricated using both Kapton and rigid board. In testing with the
          rigid sensor pads, lotion was applied to the thumb continuously for 15 minutes.
10 [0058]         FIG. 11 is a plot of normalized responses of the tested electrodes of the
          present invention. The four sensors' (XXS, XS, S, M) normalized responses
          are compared in FIG. 11 and Table 2.
   [0059]         As can be seen in FIG. 11 and Table 2, the S electrode appears to be
          most responsive overall to the presence of moisture. Both the M and S
15        electrodes seem to exhibit a peak. This suggests a depth dependency of the
          moisture being absorbed into the skin, as the roll-off from the M electrode
          occurs about 5 minutes after the peak for S electrode.
   [0060]         The SEM scanner 10 was also tested on the inner arm. A resistive
          pressure sensor (e.g. sensor 11 shown in FIG. 7) was also used to measure
20        pressure applied on sensor to the arm. This way, constant pressure is applied
          across measurements. First, the dry inner arm was measured using the XS, S
          and M electrodes. Then, the same area was masked off with tape, and
          moisturizer lotion was applied for 30 minutes. Subsequent measurements
          were made on the same location after cleaning the surface.
25 [0061]         FIG. 12 is a graph of measured equivalent capacitance for dry Volar
          arm for three different sized (M, S, XS) concentric sensor electrodes before
          applying the commercial lotion moisturizer.
   [0062]         FIG. 13 is a plot of time dependent fractional change in capacitance
          relative to dry skin for three different concentric sensor electrodes (after 30
30        minutes of applying lotion).
   [0063]         FIG. 14 is a plot of time dependent fractional change in capacitance

          relative to dry skin for three different concentric sensor electrodes (after 15
          minutes of applying lotion) on two subjects. This experiment was performed
          with faster sampling intervals and with lotion applied for 15 minutes only on
          forearms of two test subjects. Again, a resistive pressure sensor was used to
 5        measure pressure applied on sensor to the arm. This way, constant pressure
          is applied across measurements. First the dry inner arm was measured using
          the XS, S and M electrodes. Then the same area was masked off with tape,
          and lotion was applied for 15 minutes. Subsequent measurements were made
          on the same location every 5 minutes. Pressure was maintained at 50k Ohms,
10        and the forearm was tested again. We noticed an interesting observation for
          the case "F" in comparison to case "A" and also compared to previous
          measurements. Case "F" took a shower right before running the
          measurements and hence as a result his skin was relatively saturated with
          moisture. As a result, we observed less degree of sensitivity to the applied
15        deep moisturizer for case "F".
   [0064]         The experiment was performed again for case "F", with a time
          resolution of 3 minutes, knowing that the subject did not shower in the morning
          before the test. The lotion was applied to the inner forearm for 15 minutes.
          Pressure was maintained at 50k Ohms. The results confirm the sensitivity of
20        the measurement to the residual skin moisture.
   [0065]         FIG. 15 is a plot of results for fractional change vs. time for M, S and
          XS electrodes.
   [0066]         FIG. 16 shows a preferred embodiment of a layered SEM scanner
          electrode system 100 having a first electrode pad 102 and second electrode
25        pad 104. Pad 104 is connected to lead line inputs 116 via wiring 34 along
          curved path 112. Pad 102 is connected to lead line inputs 110 via wiring 34
          along curved path 106. A stiffener layer (e.g. layer 126 in FIG. 5) is provided
          directly under lead inputs 110 and 116 (see footprint 108 and 114 respectively)
          and under pads 102 and 104 (see footprint 122 and 120 respectively).
30 [0067]         In this embodiment, the electrode size is approximately 2300 in width
          by 3910 mil in height.

          104 response, square symbols show the lower electrode 102 response.
 5 [0069]         The SEM scanner device 10 may also include other instruments, such
          as a camera (not shown), which can be used to take pictures of the wound, or
          develop a scanning system to scan barcodes as a login mechanism or an
          interrogator.
   [0070]         Patients using the SEM scanner device 10 may wear a bracelet (not
10        shown) that contains data relating to their patient ID. This ID can be scanned
          by the camera embedded in the SEM scanner 10 to confirm correct patient ID
          correspondence. Alternatively, a separate RF scanner (not shown) may be
          used for interrogating the bracelet (in addition to the camera).
   [0071]         The SEM scanner device 10 is preferably ergonomically shaped to
15        encourage correct placement of the device on desired body location.
   [0072]         The SEM Scanner device 10 of the present invention is capable of
          generating physical, absolute measurement values, and can produce
          measurements at multiple depths.
