   game controller 150 is in data communication over a
20 network 2, such as an Ethernet, with a bank of five gaming
   devices in the form of standalone gaming machines 10. When
   a first award is made in respect of one of the gaming
   machines, for example an award of 10 free games at the
   gaming device, the gaming system determines whether to
25 make a corresponding award, for example, an award of 10
   free games, in respect of the other gaming devices. In an
   embodiment, the linked game controller 150 determines for
   each eligible gaming device whether a qualifying game
   should be awarded and the qualifying game is conducted to
30 determine whether to make the award. In an embodiment, the
   qualifying game is conducted at the gaming device.
   Gaming devices
35 Gaming devices capable of participating in the gaming
   system and method of gaming of the embodiment can take any
   suitable form including stand alone gaming machines and
   server based gaming terminals.
                                            10246151_1 (GHMatters) P79643.AU.4 15/05/18

                               - 6
   A gaming device in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
 5 displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
10 mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.  Other gaming machines may be configured for ticket
15 in that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
20 example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
25 by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.
30 A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
35 beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
                                             10246151_1 (GHMatters) P79643.AU.4 15/05/18

   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.  Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
 5 display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.  The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
   type.

   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
15 The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.  Typically, the
20 gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
25 The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
30 peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.         Persons
35 skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
                                            10246151_1 (GHMatters) P79643.AU.4 15/05/18

                                -  8
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107   (which provide a game play
 5 mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.     Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
10 implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used.
15
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
20 to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                      In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
25 module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
30 an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                  The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                  The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
35 some system or game related code.     The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
                                               10246151_1 (GHMatters) P79643.AU.4 15/05/18

                              - 9
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
 5 gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   In a client server architecture a gaming device is
10 provided by a gaming client and game server (and
   optionally other gaming network components). A gaming
   client has a similar outward appearance to gaming machine
   10 but the game server implements most or all of the game
   and as such acts as the game controller while the terminal
15 operated by the player essentially provides only the
   player interface.  The gaming terminal receives player
   instructions, pass these to the game server which will
   process them and return game play outcomes to the gaming
   machine for display.  Further details of a client/server
20 gaming architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213 and
   PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference. In such an embodiment, a
   linked game controller can be provided, for example, by a
   dedicated server in data communication with the game
25 server.
   Figure 5 shows that a gaming device may be connected
   within a gaming network 200 which provides additional
   and/or enhanced functionality.  The gaming network 200
30 includes a network 201, which for example may be an
   Ethernet network.  Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in
   three banks 203 of two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5,
   are connected to the network 201.  The gaming machines 202
   provide a player operable interface and may be the same as
35 the gaming machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3. While
   banks 203 of two gaming machines are illustrated in Figure
   5, banks of one, three or more gaming machines are also
                                            10246151_1 (GHMatters) P79643.AU.4 15/05/18

                              - 10
   envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
 5 associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
10
   A linked game controller can be provided within such a
   network 200 by linked game server 205, such that the
   linked game server may implement a linked game for a
   plurality of different banks of gaming machines rather
15 than a specific controller being provide for each bank of
   gaming machines.
   A database management server 206 may manage storage of
   game programs and associated data for downloading or
20 access by the gaming devices 202 in a database 206A.
   Typically, if the gaming system enables players to
   participate in a Jackpot game, a Jackpot server 207 will
   be provided to perform accounting functions for the
   Jackpot game.  A loyalty program server 212 may also be
25 provided.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
30 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
35 The gaming network 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
                                             10246151_1 (GHMatters) P79643.AU.4 15/05/18

                              - 11
   for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
 5 server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
10 Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
15 terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
   Figure 9 is a functional block diagram of a gaming device
20 900 in the form of a stand alone gaming machine. The
   gaming device 900 may be the same or different to gaming
   machine 10,100 described above.   In Figure 9, the
   processor 930 of game controller 920 is shown implementing
   a number of modules based on program code and data stored
25 in memory 940. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
   that various of the modules 931,932,933,934 could be
   implemented in some other way, for example as hardware by
   a dedicated circuit. In one embodiment, at least one
   embodiment at least one module is implemented as hardware.
30
   The gaming device 900 includes a player interface 910
   having a display 911 for displaying game outcomes to a
   player and a game play mechanism 912 including input
   devices such as touch screen or buttons to enable the
35 player to interact with the game by placing wagers and
   entering any other instructions required to play the game.
   Game play mechanism 912 also enables the player to
                                             10246151_1 (GHMatters) P79643.AU.4 15/05/18

                                - 12
   interact with the gaming device to learn game rules etc.
   The player interface 910 includes a credit mechanism 913
   allowing the player to input credit into the gaming device
   900 and/or be paid out any winnings or remaining credit
 5 i.e. the credit balance will be changed by playing of the
   game.   A person skilled in the art will appreciate that
   other components will be present in a gaming device 900
   such as those described in relation to Figures 2 to 4
   above.   The memory 940 includes program code for
10 implementing a game including base game rule data 941 for
   implementing the rules of a base game.
   The processor 930 when executing the program code stored
   in memory 940 is arranged to generate outcomes of the game
15 in response to the operation of the game play mechanism
   912.   The outcomes are generated with the outcome
   generator 931. The outcome evaluator 932 evaluates the
   game outcomes that are generated based on the game rules
    (as described further below) and the wager specified with
20 the game play mechanism 912 and updates meter data 942
   which stores a credit meter and a win meter for the game.
   That is, placing a wager deducts credits from the credit
   meter, any winnings are cumulatively added to the win
   meter during a play of the game. At the end of a play of
25 the game, any winnings are transferred from the win meter
   to the credit meter. The processor 930 also implements a
   communication module 933 which is intended to communicate
   by communication interface 950 with the linked game
   controller.
30
   In the embodiment, when the player initially operates the
   game play mechanism 912 the outcome generator 931 operates
   as a base game generator 931C to generate an outcome based
   on base game rules 941 and values obtained from random
35 number generator 934 which is then evaluated by outcome
   evaluator 932   (which will effectively be a base game
   evaluator 932B).   In the embodiment, the outcome evaluator
                                              10246151_1 (GHMatters) P79643.AU.4 15/05/18

                               - 13
   932 has a trigger monitor 932A arranged to determine
   whether a feature game trigger rule 943 has been satisfied
   such that an award is made to the player of a feature
   game, which may be a number of free game outcomes, a
 5 second screen feature, a re-spin feature or some other
   feature game known in the art. In the embodiment, the
   trigger monitor 932A   then causes outcome generator to act
   as a feature game generator 931B to carry out the feature
   game based on feature game data 944 and generate one or
10 more feature game outcomes evaluated by outcome evaluator
   932  (which will effectively be a feature game evaluator
   932C).  In addition, trigger monitor advises communication
   module 933 that an award has been which communicates via
   communication interface with the linked game controller
15 150.
   Linked game controller  and its  operation
   Referring to Figure 6 there is shown further detail of the
20 link game controller 150.    From Figure 6 it will be
   apparent that link game controller 150 is in data
   communication with a communal display 160 on which game
   outcomes can be displayed to the players playing the bank
   of gaming machines 10 shown in Figure 1.      In other
25 embodiments, the gaming outcomes could be displayed on a
   top box of the individual gaming machines 10, rather than
   being displayed on a communal display, or in addition to
   such a communal display.
30 Referring to Figure 6, the constitution of the linked game
   controller 150 is similar to that of the gaming device
   illustrated in relation to Figures 2 to 4 and 9 in that it
   has a processor 151 arranged to implement the linked game
   based on program code stored in memory 152 and a display
35 driver 154 for driving the display 160 to show the linked
   game outcome.   The linked game controller 150 also
   includes a communication interface 153 which is designed
                                              10246151_1 (GHMatters) P79643.AU.4 15/05/18

                              - 14
   to enable the processor 151 to communicate with each of
   the gaming devices 10.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate the above
 5 components are the core components for implementing a
   linked game but other components may be present in a
   linked game controller.  Persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that the implementation of the linked game
   controller is analogous to the implementation of bonus
10 controllers in existing gaming systems and reference may
   be made to such bonus controllers for further details of
   implementation.  While the linked game controller 150 is
   shown in Figure 1 as a separate entity to the gaming
   devices 10, on an alternative embodiment, it could be
15 provided by one of the gaming machines incorporating a
   server module arranged to implement the linked game
   controller in the manner described in Australian patent
   application 2008205413 filed 13 August 2008.
20 Figure 7 is a functional block diagram of the linked game
   controller 150 which shows that the processor 151
   implements a number of modules in a similar manner to the
   processor of the gaming device shown in Figure 9. AS
   above, in one embodiment, at least one module 703,704,705
25 is implemented by a dedicated circuit - e.g. the RNG 705.
   The processor executes program code stored in memory 152
   to instantiate a participation module 703 which
   communicates via data communication interface 153 with
   each of the gaming devices 10/900.  Participation module
30 703 includes a trigger monitor 703A which is designed to
   monitor for receipt of a trigger signal from one of the
   gaming devices indicative that an award has been made on
   that device and identifying the award. The participation
   module 703 has an eligibility module 703B that determines
35 which of the gaming devices are eligible based eligibility
   rule data 711. An eligibility rule may be that a gaming
   device has been active within a defined period or has been
                                            10246151_1 (GHMatters) P79643.AU.4 15/05/18

                              - 15
   both active and had a qualifying bet placed, for example a
   max bet or an ante bet. In one example, this is achieved
   by polling each of the gaming devices. In another example
   the gaming devices may regularly communicate their
 5 eligibility over the network and the eligibility module
   703B may process data received over the network from each
   of the individual gaming devices to determine which
   machine are eligible.
10 In any event, once eligibility has been determined, the
   participation module 703 determines based on participation
   rule data 712 which gaming devices will be eligible to
   participate in a qualifying game for the award.              In one
   embodiment, participation rule data 712 specifies that all
15 gaming devices will be eligible to participate. In another
   embodiment, participation rule data 712 causes
   participation module to employ random number generator 705
   to determine which gaming machines of the plurality of
   connected gaming machines  (other than the triggering
20 gaming machine) will participate. For example, the
   participation rules may be cause the participation module
   703 to select on average three machines out of four to
   participate.
25 Participation module 703 then communicates with at least
   the participating gaming devices to instruct them to
   conduct a qualifying game. It may optionally advise the
   non-participating gaming devices that they are not to
   participate. If necessary to the embodiment, participation
30 module 703 also communicates the award which is to be made
   if the gaming device qualifies. That is in one embodiment
   the same award may always be made such that it is not
   necessary to communicate its identity. In other
   embodiments the award may vary, for example a varying
35 number of free games may be awarded depending on the award
   on the triggering machine. Persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that the award need not be identical on each
                                             10246151_1 (GHMatters) P79643.AU.4 15/05/18

                               - 16
   gaming machine or identical to the triggering award but in
   one advantageous embodiment it is the same.
   Operation of gaming device in response to participation
 5
   Referring again to Figure 9, when the communication module
   933 of game controller 920 receives participation data via
   communication interface indicating that it is to
   participate. Award initiator 933A waits until an
10 appropriate time, such as completion of a current play and
   then advises the player that a qualifying game is to begin
   and causes outcome generator 931 to act as a qualifying
   outcome generator 931C based on qualifying game data 945.
   In one example, the qualifying game is a game of chance
15 where the player has defined odds, such as 1 in 4, of
   winning the qualifying game. Qualifying outcome evaluator
   932D of outcome evaluator 932 determines whether the
   player qualifies. If the player qualifies, game controller
   920 implements the award, in this example by feature game
20 outcome generator 931B conducting the communicated award
    (in the form of a feature game) which is evaluated by
   feature game evaluator 932C of outcome evaluator 932 with
   any prizes reflected in meter data 942.
25 The method of embodiment is summarised in Figure 8 which
   shows that the method involves a gaming device receiving
   810 an award, determining 820 eligible gaming devices,
   determining 830 which of these will participate, and
   conducting 840 any necessary qualifying games to determine
30 850 whether an award is made. An award is then made 860,
   for example by carrying out the feature game.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
35 that at least part of the method will be implemented
   digitally by a processor. Persons skilled in the art will
   also appreciate that the method could be embodied in
                                             10246151_1 (GHMatters) P79643.AU.4 15/05/18

                                - 17
   program code. The program code could be supplied in a
   number of ways, for example on a tangible computer
   readable storage medium, such as a disc or a memory (for
   example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as a
 5 data signal   (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that
   program code provides a series of instructions executable
   by the processor.
10 Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:              a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
15  (e.g. a PC) or a server.   That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory and generating outputs (for example on
   the display).   Such processors are sometimes also referred
20 to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using, for example, an
   application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field
   programmable gate array (FPGA).
25
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
30 embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
   further embodiments.
   For example, an award can be other than by gaming machine,
   for example, a system component such as a jackpot
35 controller 205 may make an award, this may be communicated
   via the gaming device to the controller 150 or directly to
   the controller 150. In this example, the award may be, for
                                              10246151_1 (GHMatters) P79643.AU.4 15/05/18

                              - 18
   example, a consolation award of five free spins. Other
   free game events may be awarded such as re-spins (where
   some reels are held while others are re-spun).
 5 In addition, it is described above that a qualifying game
   is conducted by each gaming device. In another embodiment
   a qualifying game may be conducted in some other manner,
   for example by the linked game controller individually for
   each device or as a group game. Person skilled in the art
10 will appreciate that an embodiment above, two separate
   random determinations are made which decide whether the
   award is made. In other embodiments a single random
   determination may be made. In an alternative embodiment
   the award may be made solely based on eligibility
15 criteria.
   It is to be understood that, if any prior art is referred
   to herein, such reference does not constitute an admission
   that the prior art forms a part of the common general
20 knowledge in the art in any country.
   In the claims which follow and in the preceding
   description of the invention, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
25 implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as
   "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
   i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but
   not to preclude the presence or addition of further
   features in various embodiments of the invention.
