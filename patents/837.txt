LIQUID RING PUMP WITH MODULAR CONSTRUCTION, AN INTER
STAGE BYPASS AND OVERLOAD PROTECTION
[0001] This is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2014330049, the
entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002] The present invention is in the field of liquid ring pumps.
[0003] Liquid ring pumps are well known. Liquid ring pumps include a housing that defines
at least one working chamber, a rotor within the housing having a plurality of impellers
extending radially outward from the shaft and within the working chambers, a shaft extending
into the housing wherein the rotor is fixed to the shaft, and a drive system such as a motor
operably connected to the shaft. Drive system may be an induction motor, gas motor, or any
other drive system or motor known in the art. The rotor and shaft are positioned eccentrically
within the working chamber. The working chamber is partially filled with an operating fluid
and when the motor drives the shaft and the rotor, a liquid ring is formed on the inner surface
of the radially outer wall of the chamber. The rotor and shaft are also eccentric to the formed
liquid ring. The space defined between impellers and between the shaft and liquid ring
comprises a bucket. In the portion of the ring wherein the liquid diverges from the rotor, the
resulting increase in area of the bucket during rotation of the shaft results in a reduced
pressure that acts as a fluid intake zone. The increase in pressure due to the reduction in the
volume of the bucket during rotation of the shaft comprises a fluid compression zone.
[0004] Liquid ring pumps may have a single stage comprising a single working chamber and
rotor. In addition, liquid ring pumps may be two-stage which includes a second working
chamber which intakes the discharge of the first working chamber to provide a higher
pressure discharge.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0005] A modular liquid ring pump has a liquid ring overload protection system including a
passage from a working chamber directly to the pump discharge passage and a mechanical

relief valve configured to release liquid from the working chamber during compressor
overload. The liquid ring pump, when configured to have two stages, has an inter-stage by
pass system that includes an opening in an inter-stage passage and a pressure sensitive
mechanical valve that allows the discharge of a first stage compressor to flow directly to the
pump discharge at start up or during low pressure operation. The liquid ring pump's modular
construction may be easily configured from a single stage pump to a two-stage pump and
vice versa by using the same bearings, head, and drive system and only changing the body,
cone, and rotor.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0015] The following detailed description of the present invention references the
accompanying drawing figures that illustrate specific embodiments in which the invention
can be practiced. The embodiments are intended to describe aspects of the present invention
in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other
embodiments can be utilized and changes can be made without departing from the spirit and
scope of the present invention. The present invention is defined by the appended claims and,
therefore, the description is not to be taken in a limiting sense and shall not limit the scope of
equivalents to which such claims are entitled.
[0016] As illustrated in FIG. 1, the present invention is directed towards a liquid ring pump
10 having a housing 12, rotor 14, shaft 16, first end 18 and a second end 20. The liquid ring
pump shown is a two stage liquid ring pump. The first end 18 is at the gas intake end of the
pump 10. The gas intake end can also be called the outboard end of the pump. The second
end 20 is at the drive end of the pump 10. The drive end can also be called the inboard end of
the pump 10. The housing 12 comprises a first end end cap 22 removably coupled to a first
end bearing support 24. First end bearing support 24 is removably coupled to a head 26.
Head 26 is removably coupled to a body 27. The body is a two stage body. It has a first stage
body section 28a and a second stage body section 28b. Housing 12 further comprises a
second end bearing support 30 removably coupled to body 27 and a second end end cap 32
removably coupled to second end bearing support 30. The first end bearing support 24 and
first end end cap 22 are at the first end 18 of the pump 10. The second end bearing support 30
and second end end cap 32 are at the second end 20 of the pump. The phrase liquid ring
pump is broad enough to include a liquid ring pump configured to operate in connection with
a compressor application, a liquid ring compressor. The phrase is also broad enough to
encompass a liquid ring pump configured to operate in connection with a vacuum application,
liquid ring vacuum pump. Of course a liquid ring vacuum pump could be used in a
compressor application and a liquid ring compressor could be used in vacuum application.

 [0017] Shaft 16 includes a first end 34 and a second end 36 axially opposite the first end 34.
The first end 34 is axially more towards the first end 18 of the pump relative second end 36.
The second end 36 is axially more towards the second end 20 of the pump relative first end
34. The terms axial and radial as used herein are relative to the long axis of shaft 16. Rotor
 14 is fixedly mounted on shaft 16 using rotor key 38. Rotor 14 includes hub 40 having a first
radially extending wall 41 which forms a first shroud bounding impeller 42 at an axial end. It
bounds impeller 42 at an axial end of impeller 42's first impeller 42a. The rotor has a second
radially extending wall 44 which forms a second shroud bounding an end of impeller 42 at an
axial end, opposite the end bounded by wall 41. It bounds impeller 42 at an axial end of
impeller 42's second impeller 42b. Impeller 42, including first impeller 42a and second
impeller 42b, span between the first shroud 41 and the second shroud 44 and is bounded at
axial ends by first 41 and second 44 shrouds. Impeller 42, including first impeller 42a and
second impeller 42b, have impeller blades which extend radially from and about the
circumference of shaft 16. Blades of impeller 42, including the blades of first impeller 42a
and second impeller 42b, may all be distributed equidistant around shaft 16. Shaft 16 is
journaled for rotation about its long axis and extends into housing 12. First end 34 of shaft
 16 is journaled for rotation by a first end bearing 46. First end bearing 46 may be a radial
bearing and is enclosed within bearing support 24 by first end end cap 22 and a first end inner
cap 48.
 [0018] Shaft 16 may also be joumaled for rotation by a second end radial bearing 50
proximate the second end 36 of shaft 16. A second end axial bearing 52 may also be provided
proximate the second end radial bearing 50 to accommodate axial loading in the shaft 16
during rotation. The second end radial bearing 50 and axial bearing 52 may be enclosed in
second end bearing support 30 by second end end cap 32 and second end inner cap 54. A
portion of shaft 16 extends out of housing 12 and through end cap 32. The portion may be
configured to engage, directly or indirectly, a prime mover such as an electric, pneumatic,
fuel powered, or hydraulic drive motor or engine.
 [0019] As shown in Fig. 1, head 26 comprises a first sidewall 56, a second sidewall 58, an
outer wall 60, an inner wall 62, and an interior divider wall 64. The first and second
sidewalls are walls which delimit the head 26 going in the axial direction of the axis of the
shaft. Starting from an interior center of the head, wall 56 delimits the head 26 in the axial
direction going from the second end 20 towards first end 18 of the pump. Starting from the
Doc No. 14263472 1

                                                 5
interior center of the head, wall 58 delimits the head in the axial direction going from the first
end 18 towards second end 20 of the pump. Outer wall 60 delimits the head in the direction
going radially outward from the shaft 16 axis. Inner wall 62 delimits the head 26 in the radial
direction going from the outer wall 60 towards the inner wall 62. The inner wall 62, relative
to the shaft 16 axis, is more radial inward than the outer wall 60. Head 26 comprises a shaft
opening 65 for shaft 16 to pass through head 26.
[0020] Head 26 includes a gas inlet passage 66 defined by outer wall 60, second side wall 58,
and interior divider wall 64. Gas inlet passage 66 of head 26 also includes an intake opening
76 (as shown in Fig. 4) and an outlet opening (not shown) into cone 100. Head 26 also
includes a gas discharge passage 72 defined by outer wall 60, first sidewall 56 and interior
divider wall 64. Discharge passage 72 also includes a gas discharge opening74 in second
sidewall 58. Fig. 8 shows the intake opening 76 of inlet passage 66 on housing 12 and a
discharge outlet 68 of discharge passage 72 on housing 12 where the fluid, typically gas,
enters and exits the pump head 26 respectively. Turing back to Fig. 1, head 26 also
comprises a recessed sealing area 77 in first sidewall 56 and a recessed cone seating surface
78 in a portion of second side wall 58. Recessed cone seating surface 78 may be a recessed
portion of second sidewall 58 having complementary dimensions to a flange 106 of cone 100
to seat cone 100 (described in more detail below).
[0021] Body 27 includes a wall 80, a first sidewall 82, and a second sidewall 84 that defines
chamber 120. In this case working chamber 120 includes first stage working chamber 120a
and second stage working chamber 120b. Wall 80 forms a continuous curve around axis of
shaft 16. The wall includes a curved radial outer surface 256 and a curved radial inner surface
255. Body 27 includes rotor sealing surface 86a which may be a continuously curved ledge
on the inner surface 255 of wall 80 as shown. First sidewall 82 has a radially extending
flange portion 94 and an opening 96 sized to accommodate cone 100 and rotor 14.         Second
sidewall 84 includes a shaft opening 90 and a recessed seal area 92 surrounding shaft opening
90.
[0022] Cone 100 is removably coupled to head 26 and disposed within body 27 to help direct
the flow of fluid through pump 10. Cone 100 comprises an outer wall 102, an inner wall 104,
and a flange 106, and is seated on cone seat surface 78 and removably coupled to head 26.
Inner wall 104 and outer wall 102 are configured to direct the flow of fluid into and out of
Doc No. 14263472 1

                                                 6
working chamber 120 of pump 10 as further described below. Flange 106 is orientated to
extend radially outward from the outer wall 102 and in some locations may also span from
said inner wall 104 to said outer wall 102 when such portion 118 of flange 106 of said cone is
closed. Flange 106 may also function as a cone end plate. Flange 106 may have a head side
114 that abuts second sidewall 58 of head 26 at cone seat surface 78. Flange 106 may also
have a side 116 facing second end 20 of pump 10.
[0023] To seal the housing 12, a first end seal 110 is disposed around shaft 16 and received
into recessed seal area 77 to seal shaft opening 65 of first sidewall 56 of head 26. Similarly, a
second end seal 112 is disposed around shaft 16 and received into an open area formed by
recessed seal area 92 to seal shaft opening 90. The liquid ring pump 10 operates in a known
manner to compress a fluid, most commonly gas, such as for example fumes exhausted by a
fuel refinery or ambient air, by drawing fluid into the intake passage 66 of the head 26, from
the passage 66 the fluid is drawn into cone 100. The fluid passes through cone 100 through
cone fluid inlet passage 268 and out cone inlet 267 and into chamber 120 and more
particularly into first stage working chamber 120a and even more particularly into the first
gas intake zone 1120a in the first stage 120a in the first lobe 500 formed by first stage body
section 28a. The fluid exits working chamber120, and more particularly second stage
working chamber 120b and even more particularly first compression zone 2120b. It exits by
entering cone 100 through cone outlet port 278. The fluid from outlet port 278 enters cone
outlet passage 280. From passage 280, the fluid enters the head outlet passage 72 through
head inlet 74. From the discharge passage 72 it exits pump head 26 through discharge outlet
68.
[0024] Body 27, as stated, is a two stage body which has a first stage body section 28a and a
second stage body section 28b. The first stage body section 28a delimits the first stage
working chamber 120a. The first stage body section 28a forms first lobe 500 which forms the
first stage first intake zone 1120a. The second stage body section 28b delimits the second
stage working chamber 120b. The second stage also forms the second stage first lobe 600.
The first stage working chamber 120a has a liquid ring portion 254. Two-stage body 27
includes a first wall step 1000 at rotor sealing surface 86a. Rotor sealing surface 86a is a first
stage rotor sealing surface. Two-stage body 27 also includes a second stage rotor sealing
surface 86b which is at a second outer wall step 260. The second stage working chamber
120b has a second liquid ring portion 264. Liquid ring portions 254 and 264 are the portion of
Doc No. 14263472 1

                                                  7
chambers 120a and 120b into which the liquid in the chamber is at least partially
centrifugally distributed to when the shaft 16 and rotor 14 is rotated.
[0025] The cone 100 is a two-stage cone 100. The cone inlet passage 268 is a first-stage inlet
passage 268. Cone inlet 267 is a first stage inlet. Two-stage cone 100 also includes a first
stage discharge port 272 in fluid communication with an inter-stage passage 274 in the cone
100. Inter-stage passage 274 is in fluid communication with a second stage inlet port 276 in
the cone 100. Inter-stage passage 274 puts the first stage working chamber 120a, and more
particularly the first compression zone 2120a of the first working chamber 120a, in fluid
communication with the second stage working chamber 120b of the liquid ring pump 10 and
more particularly the first intake zone 1 120b of the second stage 120b. The discharge outlet
port 278 of cone 100 is a second stage discharge outlet port 278 which leads to discharge
passage 280 in cone 100. Discharge passage 280 terminates at discharge passage outlet 282
of cone 100 which is in fluid communication with discharge inlet opening 74 of head 26.
One or more divider walls 284 is disposed between outer wall 102 and inner wall 104 of cone
100 to divide the inlet passage 268, inter-stage passage 274, and discharge passage 280. The
dashed arrows 1002 show the flow of compressible fluid, such as ambient air, as it passes
through various channels.
[0026] Rotor 14 is a two stage rotor. As stated, the impeller 42 has a first impeller 42a which
is a first stage impeller. The first stage impeller 42a, having first stage blades, spans from
wall 41 to a divider wall 300 and is bounded by divider wall 300 and wall 41. Two-stage
rotor 14 also includes the second impeller 42b which is a second stage impeller. The second
stage impeller 42b, having impeller blades, spans from divider wall 300 to an end wall 44 and
is bounded by divider wall 300 and end wall 44.
[0027] As further shown in Fig. 2, to allow for more efficient lower-pressure operation of
liquid ring pump 10, liquid ring pump 10 includes an inter-stage discharge bypass system 400
integrated into cone 100 which allows air to discharge from first stage chamber 120a through
inter-stage passage 274 out to discharge passage 72 of head 26 until a certain pressure is
present in the discharge passage 72 to close the bypass system 400 forcing and directing
discharge of first chamber 120a into second chamber 120b. The air discharged is taken in
from the first intake zone 1 120a of the first stage 120a. This feature is desirable at start-up
of liquid ring pump 10 in a two-stage configuration as it automatically allows liquid ring
Doc No. 14263472 1

                                                 8
pump 10 to come up to pressure in a more efficient manner. It is also desirable in low
pressure applications which do not need a second stage.
[0028] Bypass system 400 includes a bypass passage 402 in flange 106 of cone 100 that is in
fluid communication with both inter-stage passage 2 and discharge passage 72 of head 26 to
allow fluid flow there-through. Bypass passage 402 may be a hole in flange 106. The hole
can have a diameter. Bypass system 400 also includes a mechanical valve 404 operably
connected to bypass passage 402 wherein mechanical valve 404 is open when the pump 10 is
in operation at start up or in low pressure applications. The pressure at the inlet 402' opening
into passage 402 from inter-stage passage 2 is greater than the pressure in the discharge
passage 72. The difference in pressure ensures that the valve 404 stays open and fluid flows
out the inter-stage, through passage 402 and into passage 72. Bypass passage 402 is
positioned such that the fluid flow may continue linearly from inter-stage passage 2 as
opposed to having to turn to be diverted into second working chamber 120b through second
stage inlet 276.
[0029] One embodiment of mechanical valve 404 shown in Fig. 2 includes a ball 406 in a
cage 408. Ball 406 has a diameter larger than that of passage outlet 402'" of passage 402.
Ball 406 is slideable within cage 408 wherein when pump 10 begins operation, the positive
pressure generated in first chamber 120a, and more particularly the first compression zone
2120a, creates a fluid flow through bypass passage 402 which displaces ball 406 in cage 408
away from passage outlet 402'" and flange 106. Once the pressure in discharge passage 72
increases enough to create a sufficient pressure differential across the passage 402, the ball is
forced back against passage outlet 402'" thereby closing the bypass system. The closure
forces and directs fluid flow into second chamber 120b from inter-stage passage 2. Ball 406
and cage 408 may also be configured to keep passage 402 open until discharge passage 72
has enough pressure or if the rotor speed is less than a certain speed. A spring can also be
used to keep the valve closed until the pressure differential across the passage 402 is
sufficient to open the valve. Other mechanical valves such as a check valve or pneumatic
valve may also be used. A solenoid valve can be used to allow the valve to open and close
based on the receipt of an electrical signal. The signal can be sent based on the detection of
environmental and/or operating conditions..

[0030] In use, two-stage liquid ring pump 10 must be started prior to optimal operation.
While starting the pump 10, the pressure in the discharge passage 72 of head 26 is likely
close to atmospheric. As the drive system rotates shaft 16 and rotor 14, air is drawn into
chamber 120a, compressed, and discharged into inter-stage passage 2 of cone 100. At low
pressure, the air being discharged at the inlet 402' is of a higher pressure than atmospheric
pressure. Thus, mechanical valve 404 is actuated such that passage 402 is open allowing the
flow of air to linearly continue through the inter-stage passage 2 and through passage 402.
Thus, instead of being forced into the second working chamber 120b through second stage
inlet 276, the discharge of the first working chamber passes directly into the discharge outlet
passage 72 without passing through the second stage. The pump 10 during this flow state
essentially operates as a single stage pump.
[0031] As the prime mover, shaft 16 and rotor 14 come up to speed, the pressure in discharge
passage 72 increases to a point greater than the pressure at inlet 402' of the bypass passage
402. At this point or at another pre-determined pressure or pressure differential, the
mechanical valve 404 automatically closes passage 402 by seating against outlet 402"
wherein the gas discharged from first working chamber 120a passes through inter-stage
passage 2, changes direction, and is forced into second chamber 120b through second stage
inlet 276. Thus during this state of operation, when the pump is at running speed, both
working chambers 120a and 120b are utilized.
[0032] The position of passage 402 on flange 106 of cone 100 is such that the air flowing
through inter-stage passage 2 can flow more linearly through passage 402 as opposed to
having to be re-directed by turning 90 degrees, pass through second stage inlet 276 and into
second stage chamber 120b. Thus, the air will prefer to travel in a more linear flow through
channel 402 rather than being re-directed and turning to pass through second stage inlet 276
and into second stage working chamber 120b.
[0033] The first stage body section 28a and the second stage body section 28b each form
elliptical working chambers. The elliptical nature of the working chambers means that
chamber 120a has a first intake zone 1120a, a second intake zone 1120a', a first compression
zone 2120a, and a second compression zone 2120a'. The elliptical nature also means that the
second stage 120b has a first intake zone 1120b, a second intake zone 1120b', a first
compression zone 2120b, and a second compression zone 2120b'. A first lobe 500 formed by
Doc No. 14263472 1

                                                 10
first stage body section 28a forms the first intake zone 1120a. A second lobe 501 formed by
first stage body section 28a forms the second intake zone 1120a'. First lobe 600 formed by
second stage body section 28b forms the first intake zone 1 120b of the second stage 120b. A
second lobe 601 formed by second stage body section 28b forms the second intake zone
1120b' of the second stage 120b.
[0034] The elliptical nature of the first stage body section 28a and second stage body section
28b allows for double pumping action each time a bucket 700, 701 delimited by adjacent
impeller blades of first impeller 42a and second impeller 42b, makes a 360 degree rotation
around the axis of shaft 16. The air inters head 26 through inlet 76. From inlet 76, the air
travels into passage 66 to which inlet 76 is in fluid communication. From passage 66 the air
travels into cone first stage passage 268. The air exits from cone inlet 267 and into the first
stage first intake zone 1 120a and into the bucket 700. As the bucket sweeps past the intake
zone, the bucket 700 enters the first stage first compression zone 2120a. At this point the air
is forced out of the bucket and into inter-stage passage 274 from first stage discharge port
272. The air either enters the second stage first intake zone 1 120b through second stage inlet
port 276 or enters head 26 through the bypass system 400 as explained above. If the air enters
the second stage first intake zone 1120b it then enters into a second stage bucket 701. The
second stage bucket enters the second stage first compression zone. The air is forced from the
second stage bucket and into second stage cone outlet passage 280 through second stage cone
outlet 282. The air from the passage 280 enters head discharge passage 72 as explained
above. The first stage bucket and the second stage bucket have just finished a first pumping
action
[0035] After the first pumping action, the first stage bucket 700 enters a first stage second
intake zone 1 120a'. Air enters the first stage second intake zone from a second first stage
cone inlet passage 2268 and through a second first stage cone inlet 2267. As the first stage
bucket sweeps past the first stage second intake zone 1 120a' it enters the second first stage
compression zone 2120b'. The air in the first bucket is forced through a second first stage
cone discharge port 2272 and into a second inter-stage cone passage 2274. The air then enters
the second stage second intake zone 1 120b' through a second, second stage cone inlet port
2276 or the air bypasses the second stage intake zone 1120b' through a second bypass system
2400. The second bypass system is identical the first bypass system 400. It has a valve 2404
which includes a ball 2406 in a cage 2408. The valve 2404 is interfaced with a bypass

passage 2402 just like valve 404 is interfaces with passage 402. The second valve system
2400 works with inter-stage passage 2274 and second stage inlet port 2276 just like valve
system 400 works with inter-stage passage 274 and second stage inlet 276
[0036] If the air enters the second stage second intake zone 2120b' it enters the second stage
bucket which has now rotated to the second stage second intake zone from the second stage
first compression zone. The second stage second intake zone is formed by the second lobe
601 of the second stage body section 28b. Air in the second stage bucket is forced out of the
bucket when the bucket enters the second stage second compression zone 2120b'. From the
second stage second compression zone the air enters into a second, second stage cone outlet
passage 2280 though a second, second stage cone outlet 2282. From passage 2280 the air
enters head discharge passage 72.
[0037] To prevent stalling of or damage to liquid ring pump 10 from spikes in upstream
pressure or fluid carry over due to processing conditions, liquid ring pump 10 in either a
single stage configuration, such as that shown in figure 3, or a two-stage configuration may
include a liquid ring overload protection system 500 integrated into body 29 or 27 and head
26. As further shown in Fig. 2, overload protection system 500 includes a sidewall passage
502 opening from working chamber 120, and more particularly second chamber 120b, and
more particularly second stage intake zone 1120b through first sidewall 82 of body 27 and
being in fluid communication with liquid ring portion 264. Sidewall passage 502 may be a
circular hole or hole of other shape. Sidewall passage 502 has an inlet 502' which leads into
passage 502 from chamber 120, particularly second chamber 120b, and liquid ring portion
264. Sidewall passage 502 is in fluid communication with a formed passage 504 through
head 26. Formed passage 504 is in fluid communication with discharge passage 72. Formed
passage extends though second wall 58 of head 26.
[0038] Formed passage 502 and or 504 may have a divider wall that is a circular tube or tube
of other shape having a passageway of a substantially similar shape of sidewall passage 502.
Formed passage 504 and sidewall passage 502 are configured to align in an overlapping
manner upon securing head 26 to body 27 or 29. Formed passage 504 includes an inner
surface 508, an inlet 509 and an outlet 510 to discharge passage 72. Sidewall passage 502
and formed passage 504 may be collectively referred to as an overload relief passage. A
mechanical valve 512 sensitive to pressure of the liquid ring on inner wall 265 of wall 80
Doc No. 14263472 1

                                                 12
automatically opens to release fluid into discharge passage 72 when the fluid volume or
liquid ring overload pressure exceeds a pre-determined pressure. Mechanical valve 512 may
be a spring valve or other mechanical pressure relief valve now known or hereafter
developed. Mechanical valve 512 may be operable to close automatically when the liquid
volume or overload pressure returns to normal operating conditions. The mechanical valve
may be pneumatic or a check valve.
[0039] In use, as shown in Fig. 2, mechanical valve 512 remains closed during operation of
liquid ring pump 10. As fluid is drawn into chamber 120, first chamber 120a and/or second
chamber 120b, in some cases, liquid may be present in the gaseous fluid being drawn in and
accumulate operation. Some accumulation may be within the operational range of the pump.
However, if too much liquid fluid accumulates in the liquid ring portion 264, the added liquid
fluid may cause an overload pressure which may cause the pump to fail or may even cause
damage to the components of the pump.
[0040] As the liquid is dispersed throughout the liquid ring portion 264 of the chamber 120,
particularly second chamber 120b, during operation, an outward centrifugal force is exerted
on inner surface 255 of wall 80 and a force is exerted on an interior surface 82' of first side
wall 82. Liquid in the working chamber 120, particularly 120b, will flow into and fill
passages 502 and 504 during operation exerting a pressure upon mechanical valve 512. As
fluid builds up in the working chamber 120, particularly 120b, the centrifugal force exerted
by the mass of water will increase. At a pre-determined pressure caused by the centrifugal
force of the fluid in chamber 120, particularly 120b, the mechanical valve 512 will open
allowing fluid in the fluid ring to escape directly into discharge passage 72 of head 26 and out
of the pump 10. When a sufficient volume of fluid has been released to reduce the
centrifugal pressure in the working chamber 120, particularly 120a and 120b, to a pre
determined maximum operational value, then mechanical valve 512 closes; liquid no longer
flows through passages 502 and 504 into passage 72. This process may repeat itself
throughout the operation of pump 10 depending upon the liquid content of the gas being
compressed. The liquid flow is shown by arrow 1001
[0041] The pump may have a second overload protection system. The system would have a
passage opening a second intake zone which could be a second intake zone in a second stage.
The passage would open through first side wall 82 just like passage 502. The passage would

                                                 13
be in fluid communication with head passage 72. It would be in fluid communication with a
passage through wall 58. The passage through wall 58 would be just like passage 504. It
would have a mechanical valve just like valve 512. The system would work just like system
500.
[0042] As shown in Fig. 3, a single stage body 29 of single stage liquid ring pump 10' is used
with first end bearing support 24, head 26, second end bearing support 30 and the same
prime mover as used with two stage liquid ring pump 10. The body 29 is coupled to head 26
with fasteners 150. The second bearing support 30 and the first bearing support 24 are
coupled with fasteners 150 to body 29. The same fasteners may be used to couple head 26 to
body 27 and to couple first bearing support 24 and second bearing support 30 to body 27. The
fasteners 150 may be bolts, clamps, screws, or other known fastener in the art, or any
combination thereof. Single stage body 29 includes a single stage working chamber 120c
which has a liquid ring portion 204. Liquid ring portion 204 is the portion of chamber 120c
into which the liquid in the chamber is centrifugally distributed to when a single stage rotor
14a is rotated. Liquid ring portion 204 extends from an inner surface 205 of outer wall 81 a
radially inward a distance depending upon the volume of fluid present in the chamber 120c.
Body 29 or 27 may include one or more drain plugs 98, shown in figure 3 to drain one or
more chambers.
[0043] A single stage cone 100a is installed to be in fluid communication with head 26 and
single stage body 29. Single stage cone 100a includes an inlet passage 208, an inlet port and
an outlet port 212 from the inlet passage. First stage inlet passage 208 is in fluid
communication with inlet passage 66 of head 26 and first stage outlet 212 is in fluid
communication with single stage chamber 120c. Single stage cone 100a includes divider
wall 214 which separates the inlet passage 208 from a discharge passage 216 of cone 100a.
Discharge passage 216 of cone 100a includes a discharge passage inlet 217 and a discharge
passage outlet 218. Discharge passage inlet 217 is in fluid communication with single stage
chamber 120c and discharge passage outlet 218 is in fluid communication with discharge
inlet opening of head 26 leading into discharge passage 72 of head 26.
[0044] As further shown in Fig. 3, single stage body 29 also includes an outer wall step 220
corresponding to the location of the first stage rotor seal area 86c which seals along first wall
41a, first shroud, of first stage impeller 42c. The impeller 42c is mounted on a single-stage

                                                14
shaft 16a. The single stage shaft has a length configured for single working chamber 120c.
The impeller 42c forms part of single stage rotor 14a. The rotor includes a hub 40a. The wall
41a of rotor 16a extends radially from hub 40a. The wall 41a is an end wall. A second wall,
44a, second shroud, forms part of rotor 16a is at an end axial opposite the first wall 44a. The
walls 44a and 41a bound impeller 42c at opposite axial ends. The impeller blades extend
radially from and about single-stage shaft 16b. The impeller 42c and impeller blades span
from wall 41 a to end wall 44a. The impeller blades of impeller 42c extend radially away
form and about single stage shaft 16a.
[0045] Body 29 may be elliptical just like body 27. The elliptical construction would mean
that the body forms a first lobe and a second lobe. The first lobe would form a first intake
zone. The second lobe would form a second intake zone. The cone would have a second cone
inlet passage leading into a second cone inlet. The cone would have a second discharge port
leading into a second discharge passage. The first inlet 212 would open into the first intake
zone 1120c. The second inlet would open into the second intake zone. The second discharge
passage would open into head outlet passage 72.
[0046] Liquid ring pump 10 allows for a modular construction wherein liquid ring pump 10
may be easily changed between a two-stage pump and single stage pump (or vice-versa)
simply by replacing the body 27, the cone 100, the rotor 14 and the shaft 16. Also piping
would be changed. Put another way the configurations of single-stage body 29, cone 100a,
rotor 14a, and shaft 16a and two-stage body 27, cone 100, rotor 14 and shaft 16 are such that
two-stage pump 10 of the present invention can easily be converted into a single-stage pump
10' of the present invention and vice versa without having to change the head 26, bearing
supports 24 and 30, radial bearings 46, 52, axial bearing 50, end caps 22, 32, inner caps 48,
54, seals 110 and 112, prime mover, wiring, or and other fixed components. These
components are common to both the single stage 10' and two stage pump 10,
[0047] For example, to convert liquid ring pump 10 from a two stage compressor to a single
stage compressor, a technician may remove second end end cap 32 from bearing support 30;
second end bearing support 30 from head 26; two stage body 27 from head 26, rotor 14 from
head 26 and cone 100 from head 26. Seals 110 and 112 would also be removed.

                                                 15
[0048] Once the pump 10 has been disassembled, a technician may re-assemble the liquid
ring pump 10 using single-stage body 29 in place of two stage body 27; single stage cone
100a in place of two stage cone 100; single-stage rotor 14a in place of two stage rotor 14c,
and single-stage shaft 16a in place of two stage shaft 16. The two-stage body 27 and two
stage shaft 16 have a length that is longer than that for single stage body 29 and shaft 16a.
The technician may reassemble liquid ring pump to form a single stage pump 10' retaining
the head 26, bearing supports 24 and 30, radial bearings 46, 52, axial bearing 50, end caps 22,
32, inner caps 48, 54, seals 110 and 112, prime mover, wiring, or and other fixed components
used in the two stage pump 10.
[0049] The process of converting liquid ring pump 10' from a single-stage pump to a two
stage pump is the reverse of the above in terms of what parts are kept. The technician
replaces the single-stage body 29 with the two stage body 27; the single stage cone 100a with
the two stage cone 100; the single-stage rotor 14a with the two stage rotor 14c, and the
single-stage shaft 16a with the two stage shaft 16. The technician may reassemble liquid ring
pump to form a two stage pump 10 retaining the head 26, bearing supports 24 and 30, radial
bearings 46, 52, axial bearing 50, end caps 22, 32, inner caps 48, 54, seals 110 and 112, prime
mover, wiring, or and other fixed components used in the single stage pump 10'.
[0050] The term gas as used herein is broad enough to include ambient air, mixtures of
ambient air and other gasses, and mixtures of compressible and in compressible fluid such as
for example air and water. As is evident from the foregoing description, certain aspects of the
present invention are not limited to the particular details of the examples illustrated herein. It
is therefore contemplated that other modifications and applications using other similar or
related features or techniques will occur to those skilled in the art. It is accordingly intended
that all such modifications, variations, and other uses and applications which do not depart
from the spirit and scope of the present invention are deemed to be covered by the present
