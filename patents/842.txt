 LOTTERY PROMOTION
 TECHNICAL FIELD
 [0001]      The present invention relates to lottery promotion techniques.
 BACKGROUND
 [0002]     The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be
taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of
the common general knowledge.
 [0003]      Newsagents, convenience stores and gas stations traditionally sell lottery
tickets on behalf of lottery providers such as the New York Lottery, the Tatts Group etc.
These resellers only receive a small commission for the sale of each ticket and further
rely upon sales of other items (e.g. newspapers, drinks, etc.). In recent times, many
lottery players have taken to purchasing their lottery tickets via the Internet which has
adversely affected the revenue of resellers from not only the tickets themselves but
other items.
[0004]      Physical means of promoting lotteries such as posters, billboards, digital
signs and other forms of physical advertising are an opportunity to remind and stimulate
lottery players about promotions and upcoming draws.
[0005]      Embodiments of the present invention provide for increased patronage of
resellers by lottery players.
[0006]      Embodiments of the present invention utilize physical advertising in high
traffic areas to promote lottery play.

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 [0007]      According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a lottery
 promotional method involving the step of:
             receiving, with a server, confirmation of a ticket purchaser being at a
 geographic location to qualify for a promotional offer offered in conjunction with a lottery
 ticket purchase.
 [0008]      The geographic location may be a display, and the confirmation may be
 received responsive to scanning or reading the display. Alternatively, the geographic
 location may be a reseller store.
 [0009]      The foregoing step of receiving may involve receiving, with the server, a code
to qualify for the promotional offer.
 [00010]     In one embodiment, the code is received subsequent to the lottery ticket
purchase. The code may be received from a store at the geographic location. The code
may be received from a computer or a mobile internet device in or around the store. The
code may be scanned.
[00011]      In an alternative embodiment, the code is received prior to the lottery ticket
purchase. The code may be received subsequent to capturing or reading from the
display. The method may involve enabling online purchasing of the ticket responsive to
receiving the code.
[00012]      The method may further involve the step of establishing the promotional
offer. The step of establishing may involve linking the promotional offer with the lottery
ticket purchase.
[00013]      The method may further involve the step of enabling the lottery ticket
purchase. The lottery ticket purchase may be an online purchase. The lottery ticket
purchase may be associated with the code.
[00014]      The method may further involve the step of allocating the promotional offer to
a lottery ticket purchaser. The method may further involve the step of updating

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
(00022]     According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a
lottery promotional system 100 as shown in Figure 1. The system 100 includes a mobile
internet device (MID) 102 in the form of a mobile phone (e.g. iPhone, Android, etc.) or
Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). The MID 102 functions as a reader for reading a
Quick Response (QR) code 103 to register for a promotional offer that is offered in
conjunction with a lottery ticket purchase. The promotional offer can include any one or
more of a free game, second chance draw or an offer to purchase discounted lottery
tickets.
[00023]     The system 100 also includes a lottery server 104 administered by a lottery
provider (e.g. New York Lottery, the Tatts Group, etc.) conducting a lottery. The system
100 further includes a promoter server 106 interfaced to the lottery server 104 via the
Internet 108. The promoter server 106 is configured to sell tickets for the lottery online
to the owner of the MID 102 and to administer the promotional offer. The promoter
server 106 also includes a database for recording purchaser account details including a
ticket purchase history and any allocation and redemption of the promotional offer. The
database also includes a record of unique codes and corresponding associated
geographic locations (e.g. code A = store A; code B = store B; etc.).
[00024]     The system 100 further includes a store computer 110 located within a
reseller store. The store computer includes a hand-held code reader 112 (or scanner)
for reading the QR code 103 which can be present on a promotional display 114 located
in or near the store.
[00025]     A lottery promotional method 200 in accordance with a first embodiment of
the present invention, and performed with the system of Figure 1, is now described with
reference to Figure 2.

   WO 2013/155549                                                      PCT/AU2013/000124
                                             5
 [00026]     At step 202, the promoter server 106 is used to establish the promotional
offer. In particular, a promoter defines the nature of the promotional offer and links it
with the lottery ticket purchase.
[00027]      At step 204, the promoter server 106 completes the lottery ticket purchase for
a purchaser. The purchaser may use MID 102 or a personal computer (PC) to purchase
a lottery ticket over the internet 108 using a ticket purchasing website hosted by the
promoter server 106.
[00028]      At step 206, the promoter server 106 sends an electronic ticket to the MID
 102 or PC along with a promotional QR code and details relating to the reseller(agency)
store where the promotional offer can be redeemed.
[00029]      At step 208, a storekeeper of the reseller store uses the scanner 112 to scan
or read the QR code produced by the ticket purchaser. The QR code may be either
stored electronically on the MID or on a hard copy of the electronic ticket.
Advantageously, the purchaser is drawn into the reseller store to redeem the offer.
[00030]      At step 210, the promoter server 106 receives the code from the store
computer 110 and verifies the code so that the purchaser can be registered for the
promotional offer offered in conjunction with the lottery ticket purchase. Receipt of the
code serves as confirmation that the ticket purchaser is at the store (i.e. known
geographic location recorded in the database) so that the ticket purchaser qualifies for
the promotional offer.
[00031]      At step 212, the promoter server 106 allocates the promotional offer to the
purchaser and updates the database by recording purchaser details including allocation
and redemption of the promotional offer.
[00032]      At step 214, the purchaser can use the MID 102 to check their purchaser
account details in the database of the promoter server 106.
[00033]      A lottery promotional method 300 in accordance with a second embodiment
of the present invention, and performed with the system of Figure 1, is now described
with reference to Figure 3.

    WO 2013/155549                                                      PCT/AU2013/000124
                                                6
 [00034]     At step 302, the promoter server 106 is used to establish the promotional
 offer. In particular, a promoter defines the nature of the promotional offer and links it
 with the lottery ticket purchase.
 [00035]     At step 304, the MID 102 scans or captures the QR code 103 on a
 promotional display 114 at a known geographic location. The display 114 can be a
 poster, sign, video screen or other advertisement advertising a lotto jackpot. The display
 114 is typically located proximal a reseller store where the promotional offer can be
 redeemed.
 [00036]     At step 306 responsive to scanning or capturing the QR code 103, the
promoter server 106 receives and verifies the code from the MID 102, and connects the
purchaser's MID 102 to a ticket purchasing webpage (for the lotto jackpot draw) of a
website hosted by the promoter server 106. Receipt of the code serves as confirmation
that the ticket purchaser is at the display (i.e. known geographic location recorded in the
database) to qualify for the promotional offer.
[00037]      At step 308, the promoter server 106 completes a lottery ticket purchase in
the lotto jackpot draw for the purchaser and registers the purchaser for the promotional
offer offered in conjunction with the lottery ticket purchase.
[00038]      At step 310, the promoter server 106 allocates the promotional offer to the
purchaser and updates the database by recording purchaser details including allocation
and redemption of the promotional offer. The purchaser can be required to come to the
reseller store to redeem the promotional offer.
[00039]      At step 312, the purchaser can use the MID 102 to check their purchaser
account details in the database of the promoter server 106.
[00040]      A person skilled in the art will appreciate that many embodiments and
variations can be made without departing from the ambit of the present invention.
[00041]      In the first embodiment above, at step 208, the storekeeper of the reseller
store uses the scanner 112 to scan or read the QR code. Alternatively, the storekeeper
may provide a display 114 which can be scanned by purchasers themselves with their
MIDs 102. The promoter server 106 would then receive the code from the MID 102 and

   WO 2013/155549                                                       PCT/AU2013/000124
                                              7
verify the code so that the purchaser can be registered for the promotional offer offered
in conjunction with the lottery ticket purchase.
(00042]     In the preferred embodiment, the promotional code was a Quick Response
(QR) code. Alternatively, the code to be captured or scanned may be a.bar code, code
word or other like encrypted or decrypted code. The code may be received by the
promoter server 106 in one of many forms including a captured image of the code or a
deciphered code.
[00043]     In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language
more or less specific to structural or methodical features. It is to be understood that the
invention is not limited to specific features shown or described since the means herein
described comprises preferred forms of putting the invention into effect.
