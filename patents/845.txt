    [Background Art]
    [0002]
25 A cognitive disorder is a state in which developed
   intelligence deteriorates due to some acquired cause,
   constituting a hindrance to social adaptation. Cognitive
   disorders are classified as neurodegenerative diseases,
   vascular cognitive disorders, prion diseases,   infectious
30 diseases, metabolic/endocrine disorders, trauma and cerebral
   disorders, and toxic disorders   (NPL 1). As of 2010, there
   are currently about 2.1 million cognitive disorder patients
   in Japan, with a morbidity prevalence rate of about 8-10%,

                                 -la
   or even more than 10%, among the elderly over age 65,   and
   this has been recognized as a serious problem in the
   worldwide aging society  (NPL 2). The data on the underlying
   diseases of cognitive disorders indicate that the majority
 5 are neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and FTLD, with
   approximately 35% Alzheimer's disease   (AD), approximately
   15% a combination of AD and cerebrovascular disease, and 5%
   neurodegenerative diseases such as FrontoTemporal Lobar
   Degeneration  (FTLD) (NPL 2). Cognitive disorder due to
10 neurodegenerative disease is characterized by insidious
   onset of memory impairment and/or personality changes which
   progresses over a period of at least 6

                                   - 2
       months or more.   A consistent factor in neurodegenerative
       processes exhibiting a high degree of correlation with
       the degree of impairment of cognitive function is the
       presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) (NPL 3).
   5   [0003]
            Tau  (protein) is a protein encoded by the MAPT gene
       located on chromosome 17 (17q21) in humans, and it is
                                                                one
      of the microtubule-binding proteins abundantly expressed
      in the central nervous system. Tau has been found to
                                                               be
 10   a major constituent protein in the paired helical
      filaments and straight filaments forming NFT in AD, one
      of the most prominent neurodegenerative diseases, and its
      intracellular accumulation has been demonstrated in a
      variety of neuropathological conditions.    The diseases
 15   caused by intracellular accumulation of tau are
      collectively referred to as "tauopathies" (NPL 4).     The
      neurodegenerative diseases included among tauopathies
                                                               are
     Alzheimer's disease (AD), cortical-basal ganglia
      degeneration  (CBD or CBS),  progressive supranuclear
20   palsy, Pick's disease,    (argyrophilic grain dementia
      (argyrophilic grain disease),   Multiple system tauopathy
     with dementia   (MSTD), chromosome 17-linked frontotemporal
     dementia with Parkinsonism (PTDP-17), neurofibrillary
     tangle dementia, diffuse neurofibrillary tangles with
25   calcification   (DNTC), white matter tauopathy with
     globular glial inclusions    (WMT-GGI) and frontotemporal
     lobar degeneration with tau-positive inclusions    (FTLD
     tau),  but non-neurodegenerative diseases, including
     infectious diseases such as von Economo's
30   postencephalitic Parkinson's disease and subacute
     sclerosing panencephalitis, and trauma-induced conditions
     such as boxer's encephalopathy, are also included among
     tauopathies (NPL 4).
     [0004]
35         The structure of the MAPT gene on the genome is
     found to be a protein consisting of 13 exons, with
     multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing (NPL 4).
                                                                 A

                                      - 3
    feature of the structure of tau is that it comprises an
    N-terminal acidic domain containing 0-2 repetitive
    sequences     (N) of 29 amino acids depended on alternative
    splicing of exon 2 and exon 3          (NO-N2), an intermediate
  5 domain rich in proline, and a C-terminal microtubule
    binding domain      (encoded by exons 9 to 12)        containing 3
     (3R) or 4    (4R) repetitive sequences        (R) that contribute
    to microtubule binding        (NPL 3 and 4).      Therefore, tau has
    6 representative isoforms, 3RON           (352 amino acids) -3RlN
10   (381 amino acids) -3R2N (410 amino acids) -4RON           (383 amino
    acids) -4R1N (412 amino acids) and 4R2N            (441 amino acids),
    depending on the number of 29 amino acid repetitive
    sequences     (N) and microtubule-binding repetitive
    sequences     (R) that it contains.        Of these isotypes,     only
15  3RON is present in the embryonic brain, whereas all 6
    isotypes are present in the adult human brain, with the
    4R type being most abundant         (NPL 3).     The difference
    between the 3R and 4R isotypes is whether exon 10 is
    removed by alternative splicing           (3R) or present    (4R).
20  Several isoforms of tau exist, therefore, but the amino
    acid numbers      (1-441) of the longest isoform 4R2N         (SEQ ID
    NO:  1) are represented for identification of the amino
    acid numbers at corresponding positions.              For example,
    the designation "Ser413"        indicates the serine which is
25  the 413th amino acid residue in 4R2N            (SEQ ID NO:   1),
    although this serine is the 384th amino acid residue in
    4RlN   (SEQ ID NO:    2),  the 355th in 4RON      (SEQ ID NO:   3),
    the 382nd in 3R2N       (SEQ ID NO:   4),   the 353rd in 3R1N     (SEQ
    ID NO:   5),   and the 324th in 3RON       (SEQ ID NO:   6).
30  [0005]
          Regarding the role of tau in neurodegenerative
    diseases,    it was first discovered that a relationship
    exists between mutation of the MAPT gene and accumulation
    of tau in chromosome 17-linked frontotemporal dementia
35  with Parkinsonism       (FTDP-17), with more than 40 different
    gene mutations in the MAPT gene having been reported in
    FTDP-17    (NPL 4).    It has been suggested that such gene

    mutations may lead to alterations in the proportion of
    tau isoforms and change the interaction of mutant tau to
    microtubules, thus contributing to establishment of
    pathology.   However, unlike familial neurodegenerative
  5 diseases, mutations in MAPT are usually not found in
    sporadic neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
    Furthermore, one of the features of accumulating tau in
    neurodegenerative diseases is a high degree of
    modification by phosphorylation.    Moreover, in patients
10  exhibiting mild cognitive function impairment     (MCI), a
    correlation is seen between levels of phosphorylated tau
    in the spinal fluid and pituitary atrophy, suggesting
    phosphorylated tau as a highly reliable biomarker for
    neurodegeneration in patients with tauopathies     (NPL 5).
15  For this reason, it has been attempted to use enzyme
    inhibitors against kinases, and particularly GSK-3 beta,
    as enzymes involved in phosphorylation, in order to
    inhibit excessive phosphorylation of tau, and development
    has progressed in this area   (NPL 5).   However, because
20  kinases such as GSK-3 beta are enzymes that are
    implicated not only in disease but also in function
    control  in normal physiological processes, side-effects
    have been a source of concern.    In fact, since some of
    the sites where tau is phosphorylated by GSK-3 beta
25  coincide with the sites of tau phosphorylation seen in
    fetal and normal human brains   (NPL 3),  there are
    possibilities to affect normal tau function.
    [0006]
          The conventional wisdom has been that extracellular
30  tau leaks out of the cell as a consequence of cell death
    of degenerated neurons, but recent research has suggested
    that following excessive intracellular phosphorylation,
    tau is processed and is actively secreted out of the
    cell.   Phosphorylated tau secreted out of the cell    is
35  thought to be dephosphorylated at certain phosphorylation
    sites, subsequently acting on muscarine receptors M1 and
    M3 of surrounding cells, and thus promoting intracellular

                                   - 5
      tau phosphorylation and contributing to eliciting cell
      death (NPL 6, NPL 7).    As consensus is building that tau
      functions as a factor with extracellular activity, there
      is increasing focus on its possibilities in therapeutic
   5  agents, using drug components that are macromolecules
      such as antibodies which cannot be easily caused to
      exhibit intracellular activity. However, as mentioned
      above, extracellularly secreted tau may be partially
      processed and may become dephosphorylated, potentially
 10   undergoing further modification beyond the structural
      information for excessively phosphorylated tau that has
      been targeted in the past. It has also been suggested
      that drugs that act on portions of dephosphorylated tau
      may affect the function of normal tau. When pathology
 15   associated tau is to be targeted with antibodies or the
      like, it is even more important to select the entity that
      will act on a given pathology-specific site, i.e. tau
     phosphorylation epitope, and selection of the epitope
     becomes even more difficult due to the complexity of this
20    information.
      [0007]
            Inventions relating to immunotherapy for tauopathies
     with tau protein as the target have been reported, being
     aimed at executing specific action against tau (NPL 5,
25   PTL 1, PTL 2,   PTL 3).  Immunotherapy is conducted with
     the purpose of eliciting production of specific
     antibodies by administration of peptide vaccines and the
     like, and it is expected to have reduced side-effects due
     to its high specificity to target proteins or peptides.
30   It has been reported that motor function is improved in
     animal models expressing mutant tau, by immunization of
     the model animals by vaccination using partial peptides
     of phosphorylated tau (having the amino acid residues
     corresponding to Ser396 and Ser404 phosphorylated, and
35   having the amino acid residue corresponding to Ser262
     phosphorylated).    However, these reports are studies
     using transgenic mice   (Tg mice) with induced gene

                                   - 6
      mutations such as P301L   (a mutation from proline to
      leucine at the 301st amino acid residue of tau),   and
      although such Tg mice serve as gene mutation models for
      FTDP-17, a type of familial neurodegenerative disease,
   5  they do not represent most neurodegenerative diseases
      among tauopathies that are not accompanied by tau gene
      mutations, and particularly sporadic neurodegenerative
      diseases.   In addition, since P30lLtg mice are models of
      motor function impairment and are not models representing
 10   cognitive function impairment, which is the problem with
      human cognitive disorders (NPL 8), it is difficult to
      know whether the results in these animal models can be
      applied to treatment of human cognitive disorders.    In
      PTL 4, the effect of tauopathy treatment is examined,
 15   administering an antibody that participates in antigen
     antibody reaction with tau peptide having Ser409
     phosphorylated.    However, peptide vaccines are costly,
     require high total dosages and require long periods to
     exhibit their effects. Furthermore, the effects of
20   peptide vaccines and the reactivity of the immune
     response in administered humans and animals differ
     according to genetic background, and effective antibody
     production cannot always be elicited in every individual.
     Therefore, while immunotherapy by passive immunization
25   with antibodies has potential, a very large number of
     sites are phosphorylated in tau, and virtually no
     information exists regarding which antibodies for which
     phosphorylation sites are effective to use.    In addition,
     the currently available antibodies cannot at all be
30   considered to have sufficient function for use in
     therapy, based on their effects   in animal models.
     (0008]
           Furthermore, when an antibody is to be used as a
     base compound for a therapeutic agent or prophylactic
35   agent it is necessary to also consider the amount of
     antibody used for treatment, in order to avoid side
     effects and minimize problems of medical cost, and this

                                  - 7
     is especially important in relation to doses for chronic
     diseases or genetic diseases.    For example, the dose for
     treatment with ActemraR   (tocilizumab), which is human
     anti-IL-6R antibody, is 8 mg per 1 kg of body weight for
  5  1 to 4 weeks, and the dose for treatment with SolirisR
      (eculizumab), which is humanized anti-complement C5
     antibody, is 600-900 mg per adult per administration, for
     2 to 4 weeks.   These are superior antibodies developed by
     selection from among a large number of antibodies, but
 10  their dosages are relatively large compared to the
     currently used antibody drugs. Thus, an effect must be
     exhibited with dosages equal to or less than these, for
     antibody drugs that will be developed in the future. In
    addition, while the brain is the organ to be treated in
15  cognitive disorders such as AD, systemic administration
    by intravenous or subcutaneous routes is generally
    thought to result in a low migration rate of antibody
    from the blood to the brain, due to the presence of the
    blood-brain barrier, and therefore antibodies used for
20  treatment of cognitive disorders are expected to have
    lower pharmacological effects compared to treatment for
    diseases   involving other organs, and this has constituted
    a major problem.
     [0009]
25        The major symptoms in human cognitive disorders are
    memory impairment and cognitive function impairment, and
    since cognitive function is especially important for
    exhibiting memory-based judgment, communication and
    performance, the symptoms of cognitive disorders are of
30  major importance.    Motor function, on the other hand,
    while being a symptom found in chromosome 17-linked
    frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism     (FTDP-17) and
    end-stage Alzheimer's disease, is not necessarily a major
    symptom exhibited in cognitive disorders.      Consequently,
35  the main issue to be considered for treating cognitive
    disorders is improvement of cognitive function.      At the
    current time, however, there is no means of obtaining a

                                  -  8
     therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent for cognitive
    disorders that exhibits a superior improvement on
    cognitive function, using suitable animal models for
    taupathy-associated cognitive function impairment which
  5 are necessary to solve the problem outlined above, nor
    does any therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent for
    cognitive disorders exist that exhibits a specific and
    superior effect against cognitive disorders.
           In light of these circumstances,    therefore, a demand
 10 exists for a therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent with
    a powerful effect for improving cognitive function.

     Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention

                                    - 17
       [0017]
             The present inventors have prepared antibody that
       participates in antigen-antibody reaction specifically
       with tau that has been phosphorylated at the amino acid
   5   residue corresponding to Ser413 of SEQ ID NO: 1, which is
       the site specifically phosphorylated in AD, have
      administered it to Tg mice exhibiting maturation
      associated cognitive function impairment, and have found
      that cognitive function can be recovered to approximately
 10   the same level as a control     group.  On the other hand,
      adequate amelioration of cognitive function was not seen
      using, for comparison, a comparable concentration of
      antibody for tau that has been phosphorylated at the
      amino acid residue corresponding to Ser396 of SEQ ID NO:
 15   1, which has higher affinity for equivalent antigen than
      the antibody of the invention.      The portion in the
      vicinity of the amino acid residue corresponding to
      Ser413 of SEQ ID NO: 1 is a region for which no
     particular information is     known in terms of the
20    relationship between tau structure and function, and it
     was a completely unexpected result to find that an
     antibody that participates in antigen-antibody reaction
     specifically with this portion has such a powerful
     improving effect on cognitive function.       Thus, the site
25   in the vicinity of the amino acid residue corresponding
     to Ser413 of SEQ ID NO: 1, which has not hitherto been a
     focus of interest, has first been elucidated by the
     present invention as an important site for onset of
     cognitive function impairment in tauopathies, and the
30   invention has thereupon been completed.
      [0018]
      [Anti-phosphorylated tau antibody]
           Tau   (protein), for the purpose of the invention,
     includes not only human tau protein as represented by SEQ
35   ID NO: 1-6, but also genetic mutants thereof.       As
     explained above under Background Art, more than 40
     mutations are known in FTDP-17, a familial

                               - 18
    neurodegenerative disease associated with cognitive
    disorder, but the mutation sites are not necessarily
    limited thereto.   Furthermore, proteins with mutations at
    amino acids in 1 to 50 locations, preferably 1 to 30
  5 locations and more preferably 1 to 10 locations, as the
    number of mutations in SEQ ID NOs:   1-6, are also treated
    as tau for the purpose of the invention.    In addition,
    proteins exhibiting at least 80% homology (Identity) with
    the human tau protein listed as SEQ ID NO:   1 according to
10  the BLAST method (default conditions for NCBI PBLAST),
    and their isoforms, are also included.    Such proteins
    also include tau of species other than humans, such as
    chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, horse, pig, dog, mouse, rabbit
    and rat, and can be used to prepare therapeutic agents or
15  prophylactic agent targeting those tau proteins, for the
    purpose of ameliorating cognitive function in those
    animals.
     [0019]
          The amino acid numbers according to the invention,
20  i.e. the positions of the amino acid residues, are
    designated based on the sequence listed as SEQ ID NO:    1,
    for convenience.   Thus, for example, if the amino acid
    residue corresponding to Ser413 of SEQ ID NO:   1 is
    mentioned, this refers to the serine which is the 413th
25  amino acid residue of SEQ ID NO:  1 (4R2N),  the 384th of
    SEQ ID NO: 2 (4RlN),  the 355th of SEQ ID NO: 3 (4RON),
    the 382nd of SEQ ID NO: 4 (3R2N), the 353rd of SEQ ID NO:
    5 (3RlN) or the 324th of SEQ ID NO: 6 (3RON).    Table 1
    shows the positions of the amino acid residues that are
30  in the same mutual positions, for each isoform.    In Table
    1, the positions of the amino acid residues for each
    isoform are shown corresponding to 410-421 of SEQ ID NO:
    1, and the mutual positional relationships of the amino
    acid residues at other positions will be easily
35  understood based on Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, for example.

             The term "anti-phosphorylated tau antibody" refers
  5 to an antibody that participates in antigen-antibody
    reaction with tau that has been phosphorylated on an
    amino acid residue at one or more locations of the amino
    acid sequence of tau referred to above. The
    phosphorylated amino acid residues may be serine                                     (Ser),
 10 threonine (Thr), tyrosine                    (Tyr), or the like.               Also, the
    site on phosphorylated tau in which the anti
    phosphorylated tau antibody of the invention participates
    in antigen-antibody reaction is preferably the site that
    is specifically phosphorylated in neurodegenerative
15  diseases such as AD. In addition, as another preferred
    mode for the site of phosphorylated tau where the anti
    phosphorylated tau antibody of the invention participates
    in antigen-antibody reaction, it is preferably an
    antibody that participates in antigen-antibody reaction
20  with tau that has been phosphorylated at one or more
    sites selected from among the amino acid residues
    corresponding to Ser412, Ser413, Thr414 adnSer416 of SEQ
    ID NO: 1, it is more preferably an antibody that
    participates in antigen-antibody reaction with tau that
25  has been phosphorylated at an amino acid residue
    corresponding to Ser412 or Ser413 of SEQ ID NO:                                  1, or

                                 - 20
     both sites, and it is even more preferably an antibody
     that participates in antigen-antibody reaction with tau
     that has been phosphorylated at the site of the amino
     acid residue corresponding to Ser413 of SEQ ID NO:   1.
  5  Here, an amino acid residue corresponding to Ser412,
     Ser413, Thr414 or Ser416 of SEQ ID NO:  1 refers to the
     site corresponding to the amino acid number in human 4R2N
     tau  (SEQ ID NO: 1), and as explained under Background
     Art, the corresponding site in isoforms, or the
 10  corresponding site in non-human homologs, is treated in
     the same manner regardless of the amino acid number
     assigned from that amino acid sequence.   The
     corresponding sites  in isoforms or homologs can be
     determined by a person skilled in the art through
 15  appropriate analysis by a Pairwise Sequence Alignment
    method such as the Needleman-Wunsch method or Smith
    Waterman method, or by Multiple Sequence Alignment such
    as the ClustaiW method or PRRP method.    An example of an
    analysis method of a corresponding site is shown in Fig.
20   1 and Fig. 2, with the amino acid sequences (single
    letter representation) of 6 different isoforms in humans
    aligned using ClustalW.    As seen here, the structure in
    the vicinity of the amino acid residues corresponding to
    Ser412, Ser413, Thr414 and Ser416 of SEQ ID NO: 1 is
25  conserved in the 6 isoforms, and it can be easily
    discerned which are the corresponding amino acids.

           The antibody of the invention can be obtained using
      techniques known to those skilled in the art.       The
      antibody of the invention may be a polyclonal antibody or
 10  monoclonal antibody (Milstein et al., Nature (England),
      October 6, 1983, Vol.305, No. 55934, p. 5 3 7 -540).    For
      example, polyclonal antibody can be obtained using as
      antigen tau protein that has been phosphorylated on at
      least one amino acid residue corresponding to positions
 15   410 to 421 of SEQ ID NO:   1, tau protein that has been
     phosphorylated at one or more sites selected from among
     Ser412, Ser413, Thr414    and Ser416 of SEQ ID NO:    1, tau
     protein that has been phosphorylated at the Ser413 site
     of SEQ ID NO:   1, or a peptide having complete homology
20   with at least a portion of the amino acid sequence from
     positions 410 to 421 of tau protein of SEQ ID NO:       1, or
     homology with at least 80%     of the sequence, and that has
     been phosphorylated at these amino acid residues, to
     sensitize a mammal, and the antibody recovered from the
25   serum of the animal.    When the peptide is to be used as
     antigen, the antigen may be used in a form conjugated
     with a carrier protein such as BSA or KLH, or with
     polylysine.   Specific examples of peptides to be used as
     antigens include the peptides of SEQ ID NO:      31 or 32 that
30   have been phosphorylated at the site corresponding to
     Ser413 of SEQ ID NO:   1, as described in Examples 1 and 2,
     but there is no limitation to these.      For a monoclonal
     antibody according to the invention, a hybridoma
     established by using immunocytes from a mammal sensitized
35   with the antigen and fusing them with myeloma cells or
     the like, may be cloned and the antibody recovered from
     the culture.   A method for obtaining such monoclonal

                                    -  28
      antibodies is described in Example 2, and the monoclonal
      antibodies obtained thereby may be monoclonal antibodies
      containing the VH amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:       18
      to 24 and the VL sequences of SEQ ID NO: 25 to 30
   5   (Ta1501, 1502,   1505-1509),   but there is no limitation
      thereto.

            For the obtained monoclonal antibody, it is possible
      to obtain a nucleic acid molecule having a gene sequence
 10   coding for the amino acids of the antibody protein, and
      it is possible to prepare the antibody by genetic
      engineering techniques using such a nucleic acid
     molecule.     Introducing modifications to increase the
      bindability or specificity of an antibody, using genetic
 15   information of the antibody, such as information for the
     H chain, L chain or their variable regions or CDR
      sequences, and preparing antibodies having a structure
     suitable for use in treatment by modifying an antibody of
     an animal such as a mouse to a human-type antibody, are
20   techniques that are well known to those skilled in the
     art.     Furthermore, by using non-human transgenic animals
     in which a human antibody gene has been transferred, as
     the animals for sensitization with antigen, it is
     possible to obtain human-type monoclonal antibodies.         In
25   addition, techniques in which a phage library expressing
     the antigen-binding region of a human antibody or a
     portion thereof     (human antibody phage display) is used to
     obtain antibody specifically binding with the
     corresponding antigen, or a phage clone comprising a
30   specific amino acid sequence, human antibodies are
     prepared from that information, can be appropriately
     carried out by a person skilled in the art, as a method
     that does not require sensitization of animals.(See
     Taketo Tanaka et al.,     Keio J. Med., Vol.60, p. 3
                                                          7-46, for
35   example).

           Moreover, as the aforementioned method of producing

                              - 29
   monoclonal antibodies, a hybridoma producing the antibody
   to be obtained may be cultured and the antibody purified
   and obtained by common methods from the resulting culture
   supernatant.   As a different production method, a gene
 5 coding for an antibody, and more specifically a gene
   coding for the immunoglobulin heavy chain and/or light
   chain, may be obtained from a hybridoma that produces the
   antibody of interest, or from a phage clone or the like
   obtained by a human antibody phage display, and a vector
10 for expression of the gene prepared and transferred into
   host cells  (mammalian cells, insect cells, microbes or
   the like) to produce the antibody.   During this
   procedure, a person skilled in the art may carry out
   publicly known techniques for gene modification of the
15 gene coding for the immunoglobulin heavy chain and/or
   light chain, for introduction of desired traits, or may
   create a human-type antibody, antibody chimera protein,
   low-molecular antibody or scaffold antibody, using
   structural information for the variable region or CDR of
20 the immunoglobulin heavy chain and/or light chain.    In
   addition, in order to improve the antibody performance or
   avoid side-effects, techniques well known to those
   skilled in the art may be appropriately employed for
   introducing modifications into the structure of the
25 constant region of the antibody, or modifying its sugar
   chain portions.

   [Phosphorylated peptide with tau-derived amino acid
   sequence]
30      The invention encompasses peptides that contain
   portions of the amino acid sequence of tau and that have
   been phosphorylated at one or more amino acid residues.
   A "phosphorylated"  amino acid residue is one that is
   ester bonded to a phosphate group on a side chain of the
35 amino acid residue, typical phosphorylated amino acid
   residues being serine, threonine and tyrosine.   The
   phosphorylated peptide is a peptide with a length of at

                                  -   30
     least 8 amino acids containing at least 3 contiguous
     amino acids among the amino acid sequence consisting of
     the amino acid residues corresponding to amino acid
    numbers 410-421 of SEQ ID NO:        1, preferably a peptide
  5 with a length of at least 8 amino acids containing at
     least 5 contiguous amino acids, and more preferably a
    peptide with a length of at least 8 amino acids
    containing at least 8 contiguous amino acids.         Also, the
    phosphorylated amino acid residues in the phosphorylated
10  peptides may be any of the amino acid residues
    corresponding to amino acid numbers 410-421 of SEQ ID NO:
    1, preferably any of the amino acid residues
    corresponding to amino acids Ser412, Ser413, Thr414        and
    Ser416 of SEQ ID NO:    1, and more preferably the amino
15  acid residue corresponding to Ser413 of SEQ ID NO:        1.   A
    typical  example of such a phosphorylated peptide is the
    phosphorylated peptide used for antibody preparation in
    Example 1   (SEQ ID NO:  31),   but there is no limitation to
    this one.
20   [0037]
          A phosphorylated peptide having a tau-derived amino
    acid sequence according to the invention may be used in a
    therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent for cognitive
    disorders that comprises antigen for preparation of anti
25  phosphorylated tau antibody according to the invention,
    or the peptide itself.     The phosphorylated peptide may
    also be modified with substances providing other
    functions, according to the purpose, at the N-terminus
    and/or C terminus of the sequence.         For example, it may
30  have a methionine residue, acetyl or pyroglutamic acid
    added to the N-terminus of the phosphorylated peptide, or
    it may be modified with a fluorescent substance or the
    like.   Substances used to modify the N-terminus and/or C
    terminus of the phosphorylated peptide may also be
35  peptides or proteins, examples of which include peptides
    with amino acid sequences of appropriate tag sequences
     (typically histidine tag or FLAG tag),       recognition

                                - 31
     sequence of T cell receptors   (TCR) or major
     histocompatibility antigens  (MHC), and viral or bacterial
     proteins, or peptides with sequences derived therefrom,
     added to the N-terminus or C-terminus.       The
  5  phosphorylated peptide of the invention also includes
     those modified with compounds or peptides at one or more
     amino acid residues other than at the N-terminus or C
     terminus.  Such phosphorylated peptide modification can
     be accomplished using methods known to those skilled in
 10  the art, such as the method described by Hermanson et al.
     (Bioconjugate techniques, USA, 1996, Academic Press).
     [0038]
          The phosphorylated peptide of the invention can be
    produced by a person skilled in the art using appropriate
 15  synthesis or genetic engineering methods.       Examples of
    methods for producing phosphorylated peptides by
    synthesis include Boc methods    (Wakamiya T. et al.,
    Chemistry Letters, Vol.22 P.1401, 1993),       Fmoc methods
     (PERICH, J. W., International Journal of Peptide and
20  Protein Research, vol.40, P.134-140,    1992),    and the
    method described in Japanese Patent No. 3587390, although
    other appropriate methods may be implemented by a person
    skilled in the art.   Also, production methods by genetic
    engineering may involve preparation of genetic material
25   (DNA, RNA) having a nucleotide sequence coding for the
    peptide to be produced or its precursor, and insert into
    an appropriate expression vector with addition of a
    promoter sequence and the like, for introduction into a
    suitable host for expression, or production using a cell
30  free protein synthesis system.     In this case, the
    phosphorylated peptide that has been phosphorylated at
    the site of interest can be produced by appropriate
    phosphorylation reaction in a host by a kinase that is in
    the host or induced by genetically engineered expression,
35  or the peptide of interest may be collected first and
    then reacted with kinase or the like in vitro       for
    phosphorylation reaction.   For such in   vitro

                                 - 32
      phosphorylation reaction, the enzyme used may be one
      whose function in tau phosphorylation reaction for
      peptides of interest is known, such as GSK3 or CDK5.    In
      order to obtain peptides with the amino acid residues of
   5  interest phosphorylated, among the phosphorylated
      peptides that have been phosphorylated in this manner in
      a host or in vitro, there may be used methods for
      recovery of phosphorylated peptides specifically bound to
      antibody in antibody-antigen reaction using the anti
 10   phosphorylated tau antibodies mentioned above.

      [Therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent for cognitive
      disorders comprising anti-phosphorylated tau antibody or
      phosphorylated tau peptide)
 15        The term "cognitive disorders" for humans means a
      condition of impairment in intellectual function that has
      been developed or acquired, and it is considered a type
      of intellectual disturbance   (Kamijima, K., Niwa, S.,
     Nankodo's Essential Well - Advanced Series, New Seishin
20    Igaku, p.69-70, 2008), and in a wider sense they are
      considered diseases exhibiting intellectual disturbance
     and/or memory impairment.    In neurodegenerative diseases
     such as AD, "neurodegeneration" can be ascertained
                                                           by

     based on information obtained from cranial CT, cranial
35   MRI, SPECT or PET, as imaging examination, to diagnose
     cognitive disorder and specifically neurodegenerative

                                - 33
     agent for cognitive disorders of the invention is
     administered to a patient diagnosed with cognitive
     disorder by a physician, and it has an improving effect
     in comparison to before administration, for at least one
  5  item of diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease, or an
     effect of inhibiting progression of symptoms or
     maintaining or recovering the state before
     administration.
     [0040]
 10       Patents to be administered the therapeutic agent or
    prophylactic agent for cognitive disorders of the
     invention are patients with cognitive disorders, and
     especially patients with tauopathies, which include
    patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), cortical-basal
 15 ganglia degeneration (CBD or CBS), progressive

            The therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent for
      cognitive disorders of the invention may also be
      considered to have an effect of improving cognitive
 10   function or inhibiting loss of or maintaining cognitive
      function in non-human animals.     Such non-human animals
      include animals such as chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys,
      horses, pigs, dogs, mice, rabbits, rats, cats and the
      like expressing tau with high homology for human tau,

      [Animal models for cognitive disorder]
            Animals for research on the therapeutic agent or
     prophylactic agent for cognitive disorders of the
20    invention include animal models for cognitive disorders,
     among which animal models of tauopathies may be mentioned
     in particular.    Animal models for tauopathies are animals
     expressing normal-type or gene mutant tau in the brain,
     and particularly animal models exhibiting impairment in
25   cognitive function. Such animals expressing normal-type
     or gene mutant tau in the brain can be prepared by
     genetic engineering, a typical example being transgenic
     mice (Tg mice).    Animal models such as Tg mice that
     express gene mutant tau are useful as models of genetic
30   familial tauopathies, but for examination of the effect
     of a therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent for sporadic
     tauopathies that constitute the majority of cases among
     humans, preferably an effect is exhibited in Tg mice
     expressing normal-type tau.    Most suitable as Tg mice
35   expressing normal-type tau are mice prepared in the
     production examples of the present invention, but there
     may also be used the Tg mice reported by Kambe et al.

                                 - 35
      (Neurobiology of Disease, Vol.42, P.404-414,   2011) and
     Kimura et al.  (The EMBO J. vol.26. P.5143-5152, 2007).
     However, although cognitive function impairment is    seen
     in the mice of Kambe et al. and Kimura et al.,    it appears
  5  after 14 months of age and 20 months of age,
     respectively, and therefore the onset is well into
     senescence and aging effects may also be contributing
     factors, while the effects and labor of long-term
     breeding are also issues.    In contrast, the mice prepared
 10  in the production examples of the present invention
     express human normal-type tau and exhibit onset of
     cognitive function impairment at the relatively early
     stage of about  6 months of age, and they are therefore
     most suitable as cognitive disorder models for which
 15  factors such as aging can be excluded, and using such
    models allows more accurate evaluation of therapeutic
     agents or prophylactic agent   for cognitive disorders that
     have improving effects on cognitive function.
     [0043]
20        The preferred method of examining the effect of a
    therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent for cognitive
    disorders according to the invention in an animal model
    is a method of testing cognitive function,    such as a
    memory learning test.    Such a method may be a Morris
25  water maze test, a step-through learning test or a novel
    object recognition test, but preferably it is a
    combination of behavioral measurement tests such as an
    Open Field Test, in order to take into account the
    conditions of behavior quantity and animal anxiety.
30   (0044]
          As methods for examining the effect of a therapeutic
    agent or prophylactic agent for cognitive disorders
    according to the invention, it is possible to use methods
    of examining the levels of tau protein or phosphorylated
35  tau in brain tissue, during administration to an animal
    model of the cognitive disorder.     In AD and other
    neurodegenerative diseases, expression levels of tau

                                    - 36
    protein or increased abnormal phosphorylated tau are
    associated with pathology (Khalid Iqbal et al.,          Curr.
    Alzheimer Res.,   Vol.7, p.654-664, 2010).         It is also well
     known that reducing tau expression and abnormal
  5 phosphorylated tau levels in some pathological model
    animals produces improvement in cognitive function and
    motor function   (K. Santa Cruz et al.,        Science, 30, Vol.9,
    p.476-481, 2005; Sylvie Le Corre et al.,          Proc. Nat. Acad.
    Sci. USA, 10, Vol.3,   p. 9 6 7 3-96 7 8, 2006).   As a method of
10  examining changes in tau protein or phosphorylated tau,
    this can be accomplished by a method such as Western
    blotting using a brain tissue homogenate, as described in
    the examples, but a person skilled in the art can select
    another appropriate method such as ELISA (Xiyun Chai et
15  al., J. Biol. Chem., Vol.286, p. 3 4 4 5 7 -34467, 2011) or an
    immunohistochemical method (David J. Irwin et al.,          BRAIN,
    Vol.135, p.807-818, 2012).

          The effect of a therapeutic agent or prophylactic

30  preferably an antibody that participates in antigen
    antibody reaction specifically with tau protein that has
    been phosphorylated on at least one amino acid residue
    corresponding to positions 410 to 421 of SEQ ID NO: 1 in
    tau protein, more preferably an antibody that
35  participates in antigen-antibody reaction with tau
    protein that has been phosphorylated at one or more sites
    selected from among the amino acid residues corresponding

                                - 37
    to Ser412, Ser413, Thr414 and Ser416 of SEQ ID NO: 1,
    more preferably an antibody that binds competitively
    against an antibody whose VH amino acid sequence is SEQ
    ID NO: 20 and whose VL amino acid sequence is SEQ ID NO:
  5 26 (1505),  and even more preferably an antibody that
    participates in antigen-antibody reaction with tau
    protein that has been phosphorylated at the site of the
    amino acid residue corresponding to Ser413 of SEQ ID NO:
    1.   Such antibodies were explained above under the
10  heading [Anti-phosphorylated tau antibody].
     [0047]
          Another form of the therapeutic agent or
    prophylactic agent for cognitive disorders of the
    invention is one containing a peptide that includes a
15  portion of the tau sequence and has been phosphorylated
    at one or more amino acid residues, the peptide being a
    phosphorylated peptide which is a peptide with a length
    of at least 8 amino acids containing at least 3
    contiguous amino acids among the amino acid sequence
20  consisting of the amino acid residues corresponding to
    amino acid numbers 410-421 of SEQ ID NO: 1, preferably a
    peptide with a length of at least 8 amino acids
    containing at least 5 contiguous amino acids, and more
    preferably a peptide with a length of at least 8 amino
25  acids containing at least 8 contiguous amino acids.
    Also, the phosphorylated amino acid residues in the
    phosphorylated peptides may be any of the amino acid
    residues corresponding to amino acid numbers 410-421 of
    SEQ ID NO:  1, preferably any of the amino acid residues
30  corresponding to amino acids Ser412, Ser413, Thr414 and
    Ser416 of SEQ ID NO:  1, and more preferably the amino
    acid residue corresponding to Ser413 of SEQ ID NO:  1.
    Such peptides were explained above under the heading
    [Phosphorylated peptide with tau-derived amino acid

          The therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent for

                                 - 38
      cognitive disorders of the invention may also contain
      pharmaceutically acceptable additives.     Formulations
      using pharmaceutically acceptable additives can be
      prepared by the method described in "Remington: The
   5  Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition,
      University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, Williams &
      Wilkins, December 15, 2000". One form for such a
      therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent is a liquid drug
      prepared by dissolution, suspension or emulsification in
 10   an aseptic aqueous solution or oily solution. Solvents
      for this include distilled water for injection and
      physiological saline, for aqueous solutions, with
      addition of an osmoregulating agent (for example, D
      glucose, D-sorbitol, D-mannitol, sodium chloride and the
 15   like), often used in combination with a suitable
     dissolving aid such as an alcohol (for example, ethanol),
     a polyalcohol (for example, propylene glycol or
     polyethylene glycol),  or a nonionic surfactant    (for
     example, polysorbate 80 or polyoxyethylene hydrogenated
20   castor oil 50).   Oily solutions are also sometimes used
     as solvents, examples of such oily solutions including
     sesame oil and soybean oil, which are often used in
     combination with benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol or the
     like as dissolving aids.   In such liquid drugs, there are
25   often used appropriate additives such as buffering agents
      (for example, phosphate buffering agents and acetate
     buffering agents), soothing agents (for example,
     benzalkonium chloride and procaine hydrochloride),
     stabilizers (for example, human serum albumin and
30   polyethylene glycol),  preservatives   (for example,
     ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, and their salts),
     coloring agents (for example, copper chlorophyll
     carotene, Red #2 and Blue #1),   antiseptic agents   (for
     example, paraoxybenzoic acid esters, phenol, benzethonium
35   chloride and benzalkonium chloride), thickeners (for
     example, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl
     cellulose, and their salts),   stabilizers  (for example,

                                 - 39
     human serum albumin mannitol and sorbitol),     and odor
     correctives  (for example, menthol and citrus aromas).
     Different forms of therapeutic agents or prophylactic
     agent include solid formulations such as powders,
  5  tablets, granules, capsules, pills, suppositories,
     lozenges and the like.    For a solid formulation to be
    administered in oral form, there may be used additives
     such as excipients (for example, crystalline cellulose,
     lactose and starch), lubricants (for example, magnesium
 10 stearate and talc),   binders  (hydroxypropyl cellulose,
    hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, macrogol and the like),
    and disintegrators (for example, starch and carboxymethyl
    cellulose calcium).    If necessary, additives such as
    antiseptic agents   (for example, benzyl alcohol,
15  chlorobutanol, methyl paraoxybenzoate and propyl
    paraoxybenzoate), antioxidants, coloring agents,
    sweeteners and the like may be used.      Other alternative
    forms include therapeutic agents or prophylactic agent
    for application onto mucous membranes, such formulations
20  often containing additives such as pressure-sensitive
    adhesives, pressure-sensitive enhancers, viscosity
    regulators, thickening agents and the like (for example,
    mucin, agar, gelatin, pectin, carrageenan, sodium
    alginate, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, tragacanth gum,
25  gum arabic, chitosan, pullulan, waxy starch, sucralfate,
    cellulose and its derivatives     (such as hydroxypropyl

          The therapeutic or prophylactic agent for cognitive

                                - 40
     disorders according to the invention also encompasses the
     concept of a therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent
     comprising existing substances with effects of inhibiting
     development of cognitive disorder, in addition to the
  5  aforementioned anti-phosphorylated tau antibody or
    phosphorylated peptide.    Also, the therapeutic or
    prophylactic agent for cognitive disorders according to
    the invention encompasses a kit for combined use of a
    therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent containing the
10  anti-phosphorylation antibody or phosphorylated peptide
    and a therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent containing
    an existing substance with effects of inhibiting
    development of cognitive disorder.    Examples of
    substances that inhibit development of cognitive disorder
15  include, but are not limited to, donepezil, galantamine,
    memantine and rivastigmine.    The dosage of the substance
    with an effect of inhibiting development of cognitive
    disorder that  is to be added, or the therapeutic agent or
    prophylactic agent containing the substance with an
20  effect of inhibiting development of cognitive disorder,
    may be a commonly employed dosage for treatment, which
    may be varied according to the conditions.

          Also, while the results of the examples demonstrate
25  that the antibody to be used for carrying out the
    invention exhibits a drug effect by acting on the brain
    through the blood-brain barrier even when administered
    peripherally by intraperitoneal administration, it is
    possible to prepare a formulation that efficiently
30  supplies an anti-phosphorylated tau antibody, which can
    also be used as a cognitive disorder therapeutic or
    prophylactic agent of the invention, to brain tissue, and
    such formulations are also encompassed by the therapeutic
    or prophylactic agent for cognitive disorders according
35  to the invention.   Methods for efficiently supplying
    antibodies or peptides to brain tissue through the blood
    brain barrier are known,  such as methods of adding

                                 - 41
     targeting substances or methods of encapsulating in
     liposomes or nanoparticles.     Substances to be used for
     targeting include those that undergo total or partial
     change in charge characteristics by binding with
  5  antibody, or peptides, proteins or other compounds having
     a property of binding with a specific receptor or
     transporter.   Examples of peptides, proteins or other
     compounds having a property of binding with a specific
     receptor or membrane protein include ligands that bind to
 10  receptor ligands or membrane proteins, and their analogs,
     and antibodies, agonist compounds/antagonist
     compounds/allosteric modulators that bind to receptor
     ligands or membrane proteins, and their analog compounds.
     Examples of receptor ligands or membrane proteins as
 15  targets for a peptide, protein or other compound having
     the property of binding to a specific receptor or
     transporter include transferrin receptor (TfR), insulin
     receptor (IR), insulin-like growth factor receptor
     (IGFR), LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) and diphtheria
20  toxin receptor (HB-EGF), with no particular limitation to
    these   (Angela R. Jones et al.,   Pharm. Res., Vol.24,
    p.1759-1771, 2007).    A substance for targeting may be
    chemically added to the antibody to be used for the
    therapeutic or prophylactic agent for cognitive disorders
25  according to the invention, the method being one that can
    be appropriately carried out by a person skilled in the
    art with reference to a known method such as described
    in, for example, Hermanson et al.,     Bioconjugate
    techniques, USA 1996, Academic Press.      The substance for
30  targeting may also be bound to liposomes or nanoparticles
    encapsulating the antibody or peptide (Sonu Bhaskar et
    al., Particle and Fibre Toxicology, Vol.7, No.3, 2010).
    In addition, when the substance for targeting is a
    peptide or protein, it can be produced as an appropriate
35  fusion protein by a person skilled in the art using
    genetic engineering techniques, either by producing a
    fusion peptide by peptide chemical synthesis, or by

                                   - 42
      combining a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence
      coding for the amino acid sequence of a peptide or
      protein with a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide
      sequence coding for the amino acid sequence for the
   5  antibody or peptide to be used.

             An agent for treatment or prevention according to
      the invention may be administered orally or parenterally,
      for the purpose of improving symptoms.      For oral
 10   administration, a dosage form such as granules, powder,
      tablets, capsules, liquid drug, syrup, emulsion,
      suspending agent or elixir may be selected.      For
      parenteral administration, a transnasal agent may be
      prepared, and a liquid drug, suspension or solid
 15   formulation may be selected.     An injection may be
      prepared as a different form of parenteral
      administration, the injection being selected as
      hypodermic injection, intravenous injection, dropping
      injection, intramuscular injection,
20    intracerebroventricular injection or intraperitoneal
      injection.    Other formulations used for parenteral
     administration include suppositories, sublingual agents,
     percutaneous agents and transmucosal administration
     agents other than transnasal agents.      In addition,
25   intravascular local administration is possible by a mode
     of addition or coating onto a stent or intravascular
     obturator.
      [0052]
            The dose for an agent for treatment or prevention
30   according to the invention will differ depending on the
     patient age, gender, body weight and symptoms, the
     therapeutic effect, the method of administration, the
     treatment time, or the types of active ingredients in the
     medical composition, but normally it may be administered
35   in the range of 0.1 mg to 1 g and preferably in the range
     of 0.5 mg to 200 mg of active compound per administration
     for adults.     However, since the dose will vary depending

                                 - 43
     on a variety of conditions,   lower doses than those
     mentioned above may be   sufficient, or doses exceeding
     these ranges may be necessary.
           The agent for treatment or prevention according to
  5  the invention can exhibit an effect within a short
     administration period.

           The present invention will now be explained in
 10  greater detail by examples, with the understanding that
     the examples are not limitative on the invention in any
     way.   The experiments were conducted with the approval of

     [Example 1]  Preparation of rabbit polyclonal antibody for
    pSer413 peptide
          The antigen used to prepare antibody for pSer413
    peptide was a synthetic peptide    (SEQ ID NO: 31,
20  synthesized by Medical & Biological Laboratories Co.,
    Ltd.   [MBL]) having Cys attached at the C-terminal site of
    the amino acid sequence corresponding to the region from
    the 410th Asn to the 416th Ser of the amino acid sequence
    of SEQ ID NO:   1 for human tau protein, phosphorylated at
25  Ser corresponding to position 413    (this peptide will
    hereunder be referred to as pSer4l3(S) peptide).
     [0055]
    pSer4l3(S) peptide:   N-AsnValSer(pSer)ThrGlySerCys-C   (SEQ
    ID NO:   31)
30   [0056]
          Following synthesis, the pSer413(S) peptide was
    purified with HPLC and covalently bonded with KLH
     (Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin).   The obtained conjugate was
    used for immunization with 0.1 mg per dose per rabbit.
35  For the first immunization, 0.2 mL of conjugate solution
    (conjugate concentration:   0.5 mg/mL) was mixed with an
    equal amount of Freund's complete adjuvant, and the

                                  - 44
     dorsal area of a shaved Japanese white rabbit was
     intradermally injected at 8 locations with 50 tL each.
     For the second and subsequent immunizations, Freund's
     incomplete adjuvant was used for two more similar
  5  immunizations every 2 weeks. At 2 weeks after the final
     immunization, a blood sample was taken and the antibody
     titer of the serum was confirmed by ELISA using immunized
     peptide conjugate, and the animal was sacrificed after 1
     week and the whole blood was taken.       Serum was prepared
 10  from the obtained blood, and antibodies were purified
     from the serum using an affinity column of pSer4l3(Af)
     peptide (SEQ ID NO:   32).
     [0057]
          The serum titer was confirmed by the following
 15 method.    The pSer413(S) peptide was diluted to 5 pg/mL
    with PBS, and then dispensed in a plate at 100 pL/well
    and allowed to stand overnight at      4C.   After removing the
     solution, blocking buffer    (MBL Co.) was dispensed at
    250pLL/well, and the plate was allowed to stand overnight
20  at  40C.  The dilution series for the pre-immunization
    rabbit serum and post-immunization rabbit serum was 100,
    500, 2,500, 12,500 and 62,500 folds, with a PBS-diluted
    sample added at 100 pL/well, and reaction was conducted
    at 250 C for 60 minutes.    After rinsing, anti-rabbit IgG
25  peroxidase labeling (product of MBL) diluted 8,000-fold
    with Buffer   (MBL) was added at 100 pL/well, and reaction
    was conducted at 25"C for 60 minutes.       After rinsing,
    coloring solution (MBL) was added at 100 pL/well for
    coloration for 3 to 10 minutes, and then 2N sulfuric acid
30  was added at 100 pL/well to terminate the reaction.
    After the reaction was terminated, the absorbance was
    measured at a measuring wavelength of 450 nm and a
    reference wavelength of 620 nm.
    [0058]
35        The antibody reactivity of the purified antibody was

                                  - 45
      confirmed by the following method. The pSer413(L)
      peptide [pSer413(S) peptide (underlined) further extended
      in the N-terminal and C-terminal directions (SEQ ID NO:
      33, synthesized by Biosynthesis Co.): N
   5  ProArgHisLeuSerAsnValSer(pSer)ThrGlySerIleAspMetValAsp-C]
      or NonP(L) peptide having the same amino acid sequence
      but not phosphorylated at the site corresponding to
      Ser413 (SEQ ID NO:   34, synthesized by Biosynthesis Co.)
     was diluted to 1 pg/mL with PBS and then dispensed into a
 10  plate at 50 pL/well, and allowed to stand overnight at
      4*C.  After removing the solution, blocking buffer (3%
     BSA-PBS) was dispensed at 250 pL/well, and the mixture
     was allowed to further stand at 37*C for 1 hour or longer.
     The purified antibody diluted with PBS and serialized was
 15  added at 50 pL/well, and reaction was conducted at 25*C
     for 90 minutes. After rinsing, goat anti-rabbit IgG
     alkaline phosphatase labeling     (Bioscience) was diluted
     2,000-fold with dilution buffer     (3% BSA-PBS) and added at
     50 ptL/well,  and reaction was conducted at 25*C for 60
20   minutes.    After rinsing, coloring solution    (2.5 mM MgCl 2
     containing 0.1 M diethanolamine buffer solution, with 1
     mg/mL PNPP [para-nitrophenyl phosphate] added to pH 9.8)
     was added at 100 pL/well for coloration for 30 minutes,
     and the absorbance was measured at a measuring wavelength
25   of 405 nm and a reference wavelength of 550 nm.
     [0059]
     <Results>
           As shown in Fig. 3, the purified antibody had high
     specificity for pSer4l3(L) peptide, while virtually no
30   reaction was observed with nonP(L) peptide. Therefore,
     the antibody is an antibody that participates in antigen
     antibody reaction specifically with pSer413(L)
     (throughout the present specification, this may also be
     referred to as "pSer413-labeled rabbit polyclonal
35   antibody" or "pS413AB").

     [Example 2]  Preparation of monoclonal antibody for
     pSer413 peptide   (Tal5 Series)
          The antigen used was synthetic peptide pSer413(Im)
     (SEQ ID NO:  35),  having GlyCysSerGly attached at the N
  5  terminus of the sequence corresponding to the region from
     the 403rd Thr to the 423rd Pro, phosphorylated on the
    amino acid residue corresponding to Ser at position 413
    of the amino acid sequence of human tau protein
     represented by SEQ ID NO:    1.    Following synthesis, the
 10 pSer4l3(Im) peptide was purified with HPLC and covalently
    bonded with KLH    (Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin).     The
    obtained conjugate was used for immunization with 0.04 mg
    per dose per mouse.     The immunization was conducted by
    intraperitoneal injection into 10 mice at 200 psL each of
15  a mixture of 0.4 ml of conjugate solution       (1.1 mg/ml in
    terms of peptide),    0.7 mL of saline and 1.1 mL of
    Freund's complete adjuvant.       Three more similar
    immunizations    (with the same immunization location and
    antigen dose, using Freund's incomplete adjuvant) were
20  conducted every 2 weeks.     One month after the final
    immunization, 100 pIL of a 0.5 mg/mL antigen solution
     (dissolved in saline) in terms of peptide was injected
    into the caudal vein of the one mouse among the ten that
    had increased serum antibody titer for the antigen, and
25  on the third day the animals were sacrificed and the
    spleens recovered.     Two 18G injection needles were used
    to break up the spleens, and then the broken-up spleens
    were gently mashed with a rubber stopper surface.        The
    mashed splenocytes were suspended in approximately       10 mL
30  of cold RPMI 1640 medium, the supernatant was filtered
    with a 40 pm cell strainer, and the filtrate was
    collected in a 50 mL tube.      The spleen cell debris was
    further mashed with a rubber stopper surface, and
    similarly suspended in cold RPMI 1640 medium, filtered,
35  and the filtrate collected.      Cold RPMI 1640 medium   (or
    cold PBS) was added to a final volume of 40 mL for the

                                     -    47
    spleen cell suspension.         The lymphocyte concentration in
    the suspension was measured with a hemacytometer, and
    lymphocytes in a final amount corresponding to 2 x 107
    cells were transferred to a 50 mL tube.             To this there
  5 was   added an equivalent of 4 x 107 cells          of the mouse
    myeloma cell line P3X63Ag8-U1            (P3-Ul) in the logarithmic
    growth stage, that had been cultured in culture solution
    B   (RPMI 1640  + 10%    fetal bovine serum + 2 mM glutamine +
    100 Vg/mL streptomycin + 100 unit/mL penicillin),               and
10  after centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes, the
    supernatant was discarded.            The cell pellet was
    thoroughly dispersed by tapping the tube.               To this there
    was added 0.5 mL of a polyethylene glycol solution
     (composed of RPMI 1640       (2.3 mL) + polyethylene glycol
15  2000   (1.4 mL) + dimethyl sulfoxide          (0.3 mL),   hereunder
    abbreviated as "PEG solution"),            and the cells were gently
    suspended.     After 1 minute, 0.5 mL of PEG solution was
    slowly added dropwise over a period of 1 minute,               1.0 mL
    of RPMI 1640 was slowly added dropwise over a period of 1
20  minute, and then 2 mL of RPMI            1640 was slowly added
    dropwise over a period of 2 minutes.             Next, 4 mL of
    HAT/GIT culture solution        (GIT medium     [Nihon
    Pharmaceutical Co.,       Ltd.]  + 5% fetal bovine serum + 100
    pg/mL streptomycin + 100 unit/mL penicillin + 95 pM
25  hypoxanthine + 0.4 pM aminopterin + 16 pM thymidine) was
    added dropwise over a period of 2 minutes, and then 4 mL
    of HAT/GIT culture solution was added dropwise over a
    period of 2 minutes.        Finally, HAT/GIT culture solution
    was added to obtain 40 to 50 mL of cell suspension.
30  After   incubation in     a thermostatic bath at        37'C for 30
    minutes, the suspension was seeded onto 7 culture plates
     (96 wells).    The culture plates used were 96-well plates
     (feeder plates) on which mouse           (ICR) abdominal cavity
    macrophages    (feeder cells) had been cultured for several
35  days   (> 1 x 10 5 /well).    The plates were then cultured for
    7 to 10 days at 37'C,       5% CO 2 .

                                  - 48
     [00611
           Half of the culture solution was replaced with fresh
     HT culture solution (HAT/GIT culture solution without
     aminopterin) once every week, and hybridomas were
  5  obtained.
          Antibody screening was carried out by the following
    method.    The pSer4l3(L) peptide was diluted to 1 ptg/mL
    with PBS, and then dispensed in a 96-well plate at 50
    pL/well and allowed to stand overnight at 4"C.        After
 10 removing the solution, blocking buffer (3% BSA-PBS) was
    dispensed at 250 pL/well, and the mixture was left to
    stand at room temperature for 1 hour or longer. The
    blocking buffer (3% BSA-PBS) was aspirated, the hybridoma
    supernatant was added at 30-50 jL/well, and reaction was
15  conducted at 25*C for 60 minutes.       After rinsing with
    phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween20        (PBS
    Tween), secondary antibody (a solution containing
    alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse TgG-Fc
    antibody [SouthernBiotech], diluted 2000-fold with
20  blocking buffer) was added at 100 jL/well, and reaction
    was conducted at 250 C for 60 minutes.       After rinsing,
    substrate solution    (2.5 mM MgCl 2 -containing  0.1 M
    diethanolamine buffer, with 0.7 to 1.2 mg/mL PNPP [para
    nitrophenyl phosphate] added to pH 9.8) was added at 100
25  pL/well   for coloration at 25'C for 60 minutes,     after which
    the absorbance was measured at a measuring wavelength of
    405 nm.
    [0062]
          In this screening, cells were recovered from the
30  positive wells and counted with a hemacytometer, and then
    seeded onto a 96-well plate     (the previous feeder plate)
    at 1-3 cells/well, for cloning by the limiting dilution
    method (Ta1501, Ta1502, Tal505-1509).        For subsequent
    analysis, the clones were mass cultured and the antibody
35  was purified with a protein C column. Ta1505 is the same
    as Tal505-2.    The isotypes were determined using a kit by

                                        -   49
      AbD Serotec.
       [0063]
            The purified antibody was reacted with an ELISA
      plate coated with partial peptide corresponding to the
   5  different phosphorylation sites of tau, to determine the
      phosphate group specificity.             The method was as follows.

      [SEQ ID NO:    44]-BSA) was diluted to 1 pg/mL with PBS              (pH
     7) and added to a 96-well plate              (MaxiSorp: Nunc) at 50
 15  pL/well,    and then incubated overnight at 40 C for
     immobilization.        Next, the peptide        solution was removed
     and rinsed 3 times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween20,
     after which 3% BSA/PBS was added at 280 pL/well and
     blocking was performed        at 37*C      for 1 hour.

            The blocking solution was aspirated off, rinsing was
     performed 3 times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween20, and
     then 1 ptg/mL of each Ta15 Series monoclonal antibody
     solution in 3% BSA-PBS was added at 50 pL/well, and

             These antibodies        (hereunder referred to as "Ta15

    examined peptides, and the phosphate group specificity
    was extremely high.
     [0067]
     [Example 3]       Measurement of Tal5 Series antibody binding
15  affinity
             In order to evaluate the binding affinity between
    the Ta15 Series antibodies and antigen peptide                    (pSer413
    peptide        (Tm):  see Example     2),    a Biacore Surface Plasmon

                                  -   51
     Resonance  (SPR) system   (BIACORE3000, code# BR-1100-45, by
     GE Healthcare, Japan) and each Biacore product were used
     for measurement according to the manufacturer's manual.
     One method of measurement used was a method of
  5  immobilizing  (code# BR-1006-33) anti-mouse antibody
     (code# BR-1008-38) on a CM5 chip (carboxymethyldextran
     layer-formed chip, code# BR-1100-14) by covalent bonding
     through amine coupling reaction, binding the Ta15 Series
     antibody to the immobilized anti-mouse antibody, and
 10 measuring the binding behavior of the antigen peptide to
     the bound Ta15 Series antibody.
     [0068]
          The specifically-binding reaction mixture was used
    with HBS-EP buffer    (code# BR-T-1001-88),    and the CM5 chip
 15 was activated by a mixed solution of N-ethyl-N'-(3
    dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride         (EDC) and
    N-hydroxysuccinimide    (NHS).     A solution of anti-mouse
    antibody diluted to 0.001 mg/mL with 10 mM sodium acetate
    buffer at pH 5.0 was reacted with 4 flow cells on the
20  chip, and after covalently bonding the anti-mouse
    antibody to the CMS chip, it was subjected to blocking
    with ethanolamine.    Of the 4 flow cells immobilizing
    anti-mouse antibody, one trapped negative antibody (mouse
    IgG2a isotype control, code# MAB003, by R&D Systems)
25  while the other flow cells trapped Ta15 Series antibody,
    at a density of about 1000 RU each.        HBS-EP buffer (0.01
    M HEPES pH 7.4,   0.15 M NaCl,     3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v
    Surfactant P20) with added 1 M NaCi was reacted for 3
    minutes and the nonspecific adsorbed antibody was
30  removed, and then HBS-EP buffer was reacted for 10
    minutes at a flow rate of 50 pL/min to stabilize the
    baseline.   The peptide was    serially diluted with HBS-EP
    buffer from a concentration of 100 pM to 5 mM        (near the
    estimated binding dissociation constant [KD]),        the
35  obtained peptide solutions      (5 concentrations) were
    reacted for between 4 minutes and 6 minutes        (uniform) at
    intervals of 6 minutes each continuously from the low

                                     -  52
     concentration end, and the binding behaviors were
    measured.
     [0069]
           As the specific binding behavior data for the
  5  antigen peptide, the binding behavior data was obtained
     for a non-phosphorylated peptide           (non pSer413 peptide) as
    a negative peptide, and this was subtracted from the
    binding behavior data for the antigen peptide, in order
    to eliminate the effects of noise produced by the
 10 procedure. No binding of non-phosphorylated peptide to
    antibody was observed at the measuring concentrations.
    The specific binding behavior data was fitted with Single
    Cycle Kinetics 1:1, Binding with drift model, using
    Biacore analysis software         (BIA evaluation: Single Cycle
 15 Kinetics Analysis, code# AP-4000-01),              and the kinetic
    association rate (Ka) and dissociation rate               (Kd) were
    simultaneously obtained        (Karlsson, R.,       Katsamba, P. S.,
    Nordin, H.,   Pol, E. and Myszka, D. G. (2006). "Analyzing
    a kinetic titration series using affinity biosensors."
20  Anal.Biochem. 349(1): 136-47).            The equilibrium
    dissociation constant        (KD) value, as the affinity
    measurement for the Ta15 Series antibodies, was
    calculated as Kd/Ka.

     [0074]
           After synthesis of the pSer396/pSer404 peptide, it
    was purified by HPLC and covalently bonded to maleimide
20  activated KLH    (Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin) (Thermo
    Scientific).     The obtained conjugate was used for
    immunization of Balb/c mice with approximately 0.04 mg
    per dose per mouse. The immunization was conducted by
    intraperitoneal injection into 4 mice at 100 pL each of a
25  mixture of 0.3 ml of conjugate solution (0.77 mg/ml in
    terms of peptide) and 0.3 mL of Freund's complete
    adjuvant.    Two of the mice were immunized by
    intraperitoneal immunization (with the same antigen
    amount, using Freund's incomplete adjuvant) and foot sole
30  immunization (antigen + Titer Max adjuvant), while the
    other two were immunized only by intraperitoneal
    immunization, and this was repeated twice at 2 week
    intervals. The mice immunized by intraperitoneal
    immunization and foot sole immunization, which had
35  increased serum antibody titers for antigen, were
    injected with antigen solution (dissolved in saline)
    through the caudal vein 15 days after the final

                                  - 54
     immunization, and after 3 days the animals were
     sacrificed and the spleens extracted. Two 18G injection
     needles were used to break up the spleens, and then the
    broken-up spleens were gently mashed with a rubber
  5  stopper surface.   The mashed splenocytes were suspended
     in approximately 10 mL of cold RPMI 1640 medium, the
     supernatant was filtered with a 40 gm cell strainer, and
    the filtrate was collected in a 50 mL tube. The spleen
    cell debris was further mashed with a rubber stopper
 10 surface, and similarly suspended in cold RPMI 1640
    medium, filtered, and the filtrate collected. Cold RPMI
    1640 medium (or cold PBS) was added to a final volume of
    40 mL for the spleen cell suspension. The lymphocyte
    concentration in the suspension was measured with a
15  hemacytometer, and lymphocytes in a final amount
    corresponding to 2 x 107 cells were transferred to a 50 mL
    tube.   To this there was added an equivalent of 4   x 107
    cells of mouse myeloma cell line P3 -U1 in the logarithmic
    growth stage, that had been cultured in culture solution
20  B (RPMI 1640 + 10%   fetal bovine serum + 2 mM glutamine +
    100 pg/mL streptomycin + 100 unit/mL penicillin),    and
    after centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes, the
    supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was
    thoroughly dispersed by tapping the test tube.     A 0.5 mL
25  PEG solution was added thereto and the cells were gently
    suspended. After 1 minute, 0.5 mL of PEG solution was
    slowly added dropwise over a period of 1 minute, 1.0 mL
    of RPMI 1640 was slowly added dropwise over a period of 1
    minute, and then 2 mL of RPMI 1640 was slowly added
30  dropwise over a period of 2 minutes.     Next, 4 mL of
    HAT/GIT culture solution    (GIT medium [Nihon
    Pharmaceutical Co.,   Ltd.]  + 5% fetal bovine serum + 100
    jg/mL streptomycin + 100 unit/mL penicillin + 95 pM
    hypoxanthine + 0.4 pM aminopterin + 16 pM thymidine) was
35  added dropwise over a period of 2 minutes, and then 4 mL
    of HAT/GIT culture solution was added dropwise over a

                                      -   55
    period of 2 minutes.          Finally, HAT/GIT culture solution
    was added to obtain 40 to 50 mL of cell suspension.
    After incubation       in  a thermostatic bath at 37 0 C for 30
    minutes, the suspension was seeded onto 7 culture plates
  5  (96-well).   The culture plates used were 96-well plates
     (feeder plates) on which mouse          (ICR) abdominal cavity
    macrophages    (feeder cells) had been cultured for several
    days   (> 1 x 10 5 /well).     The plates were then cultured for
    7 to 10 days at      37*C,   5% C0 2 .
10        Half of the culture solution was replaced with fresh
    HT culture solution         (HAT/GIT culture solution without
    aminopterin) once every week, and hybridomas were
    obtained.
     [0075]
15        Monoclonal antibody screening was carried out in the
    following manner.         The screening antigens used were
    pSer396/pSer4O4 peptide-BSA, having BSA conjugated to the
    N-terminal Cys of pSer396/pSer4O4 peptide            (N-GlyCys

    conjugated to the N-terminal Cys of a non-phosphorylated
    peptide   (N-GlyCys
    ArgGluAsnAlaLysAlaLysThrAspHisGlyAlaGluIleValTyrLysSerPro

    The non-phosphorylated peptide-BSA or pSer396/pSer4O4
    peptide-BSA was diluted to 1 pg/mL with PBS,             and then
    dispensed in a 96-well plate at 50 RL/well and allowed to
    stand overnight at 40 C.        After removing the solution,
30  blocking buffer      (3% BSA-PBS) was dispensed at 250
    pL/well,   and the mixture was left to stand at room
    temperature for 1 hour or longer.            The blocking buffer
    (3% BSA-PBS) was aspirated, the hybridoma supernatant was
    added at 30-50 pL/well,        and reaction was conducted at 250 C
35  for 60 minutes.       After rinsing with phosphate-buffered
    saline containing 0.05%        Tween20    (PBS-Tween),   a detection

                                   - 56
      reagent    (a solution containing added alkaline
      phosphatase-labeled Protein A, diluted 2000-fold with
      blocking buffer) was added at 100 pL/well, and reaction
      was conducted at 250 C for 60 minutes. After rinsing,
   5  substrate solution (2.5 mM MgCl 2 -containing 0.1 M
      diethanolamine buffer, with 0.7 to 1.2 mg/mL PNPP [para
      nitrophenyl phosphate] added to pH 9.8) was added at 100
      pL/well   for coloration at 250 C for 60 minutes, after which
      the absorbance was measured at a measuring wavelength of
 10   405 nm.
      [0076]
            The cells were recovered from the wells that had low
      reactivity with non-phosphorylated peptide-BSA and high
      reactivity with pSer396/pSer4O4 peptide-BSA, and were
 15   seeded in a 96-well plate    (the previous feeder plate) at
      1-3 cells/well, for cloning by the limiting dilution
     method.     Clones producing Ta9 antibody (IgG3/K) were
      selected from among these. For subsequent analysis, the
      clones were mass cultured and the antibody was purified
20   with a protein G column.
           Upon measuring the KD value of Ta9 antibody for
     pSer396/pSer4O4 peptide by the method described in
     Example 3, it was found to be 1.08 x 1010, with affinity
     for peptide that was higher than the TalS Series
25   antibodies.

           For the experiment there were used male hetero
    mutant Tau-Tg mice     (line 609 or line 784),     and non-Tg
    littermates,    9-14 months of age.      The groups were divided
    so that there was no difference in average weight between
 10 the groups.     The hetero mutant Tau-Tg mice were
    administered antibody diluted with PBS or citrate buffer
     (pH 5),  once per week, for a total of 5 times,        into the
    abdominal cavity at 1 mg per mouse per administration.
    As a negative control group, the buffer used to prepare
15  the antibody, or mouse IgG monoclonal antibody with no
    reactivity for tau, was administered into the abdominal
    cavity at the same dosage.       As a positive control, non-Tg
    littermates were administered the buffer used to prepare
    the antibody, into the abdominal cavity at the same
20  dosage.

     <Water maze test:     Same for groups (1) to      (3)>
            Preparation: A black pool with an inner diameter of
     100 cm and a height of 45 cm was filled with water to a
     depth of 16 cm. The water temperature was adjusted to
25   21-23 degrees, maintaining colorless transparency without
     coloration with titanium oxide or the like. No chlorine
     was added, and after every trial day the feces were
     removed and approximately 10 L of water was replaced.
            Trial  (Acquisition) test: A 15 cm-high transparent
30   platform was immersed at a position 20 cm from the wall
      (30 cm from the center).      With partitioning into 4
     quadrants including the location where the platform was
     submersed, the mice were introduced randomly from one of
     the 3 quadrants without the platform. The limit for each
35   test was 60 seconds, with 5 tests being conducted per
     day.    The interval between tests was approximately 5
     minutes. The "escape time" to reaching the platform was

                                  - 59
     recorded as data.    Mice that did not escape within 60
     seconds were directed to the platform by the operator's
     hand, and the escape time was treated as 60 seconds. The
     mouse on the platform was removed from the pool after 10
  5  seconds and allowed to behave freely until the next test,
     drying the body.    The results for each mouse on each day
     were recorded as the average number of seconds for the
     escape times of the 5 tests.
            The acquisition test was completed when the results
 10  for the control group (nonTg) stabilized, and a probe
     test was conducted on the following day.
            Probe test: On the day following the last day, the
    platform was removed from the pool and the free swimming
    was photographed with a video camera for 60 seconds.      The
15  photographed video was observed, and the time during
    which the freely swimming mice swam in the quadrant that
    had contained the platform (target quadrant) among the 4
    quadrants, was measured and expressed as a percentage of
    the 60 seconds.     During this time, the swimming up to 30
20  seconds after introduction into the pool was also
    analyzed.
           The significant test for the trial   (acquisition)
    test was done by repeated measure and Fisher's PLSD, and
    significant test for the probe test was done by Fisher's
25  PLSD.

    <Open Field test:    Same for groups (1) to  (3)>
          Apparatus: A 5 mm-thick transparent acrylic board
    was used to create a 30 x 30 x 30 cm square box, and it
30  was stored in a soundproof environment. A 40W
    incandescent lamp was placed over the storage environment
    and the floor face was irradiated with an illuminance of
    110 lux.
          Behavior quantity:   (i) Infrared beams were set on
35  the outside of the sides of the acrylic box at locations
    1.5 cm from the floor surface, at a spacing of 10 cm.
    When the mouse continuously blocked 2 beams the

                                  -  60
      locomotion was detected, and was counted.
      (ii) Infrared beam surfaces were provided on locations of
      two opposite sides, 3.5 cm from the floor surface.       When
      the mouse blocked a portion of the beam surface,     rearing
   5  was detected and counted.
            Test:  Each mouse was subjected to a single 20-minute
      session.    The mouse was introduced into the center
      section of the acrylic box and, upon rapidly closing the
     door to create a soundproof environment, the session was
 10   initiated.
           The first   10 minutes of the session were free
     activity under light conditions, while for the last 10
     minutes, illumination was ceased for free activity under
     dark conditions.
 15        Analysis: The behavior quantity of each mouse each
     minute was indicated on a line graph, for locomotion and
     rearing.
           Normal visual perception was defined as reaction to
     the change in environment to dark conditions 10 minutes
20   after the start of the session, whereby the mouse
     exhibited a change in behavior quantity.
           The each behavior quantity under light and dark
     conditions, and the total behavior quantity during 20
     minutes, were represented in a bar graph.
25         A significant test was conducted between the groups,
     for total behavior quantity of locomotion and rearing.
           Locomotion is a major spontaneous behavior quantity
     while rearing is a major exploratory behavior, but      in
     fact both indicators are mutually influential     (example:
30   even when locomotion appears to be reduced, if rearing is
     increased during that time then the behavior quantity
     cannot be said to be reduced).

                                   -  61
     prepared from the brain using a microtome and treated 4
     times with xylene and ethanol every 10 minutes, as
     deparaffinization treatment.        It was then boiled for 30
     minutes in citric acid buffer        (pH 6) (antigen activating
  5  treatment) and returned to room temperature, after which
     it was rinsed twice with Tris buffer-physiological saline
      (TS) for 10 minutes.    After blocking for 60 minutes at
     room temperature with TS containing 20%        bovine serum,
    mouse anti-human synaptophysin antibody         (SVP-38 diluted
 10  200-fold with TS containing 10% bovine serum, by Sigma)
    was mounted and treatment was conducted overnight at 40C.
    After rinsing twice with TS for 10 minutes, FITC-labeled
    anti-mouse IgG antibody      (the antibody diluted 20-fold
    with TS containing 10% bovine serum, by Vector) was
15  mounted, and treatment was conducted at room temperature
    for 60 minutes.     After rinsing twice with TS for 10
    minutes, VECTASHIELD     (Vector) was mounted, and
    observation was made with a microscope.          The fluorescence
    intensity was quantified and digitized with NIH imageJ,

          The results for    (2-1) to   (2-3) are shown in Fig. 8
35  to Fig. 11.    To summarize, passive immunization with
    anti-pSer413 monoclonal antibody notably improved memory
    impairment in the model mice to the same level as non-Tg.

                                  -  62
      In  (2-3), no significant difference in active movement
      and visual perception was seen between the groups.
             Based on the results of (2-1) and (2-2), the pSer413
      epitope was concluded to be a satisfactory epitope as a
   5  target of passive immunization therapy, for both
      polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies.
       (3) pSer396 mouse monoclonal antibody (Ta9 antibody)
            The results for (3-1) to    (3-3) are shown in Fig. 12

 10   significantly improved memory impairment to the same
      level as non-Tg. In (3-3), no significant difference in
      active movement and visual perception was seen between
      the groups.
            When Ta9 is compared with Ta1505, however, its drug
 15   effect was found to be weaker. Although the antigen
      affinity was Ta9 > Ta1505 (see Examples 2 and 3), the
      drug effect was Ta9 < Ta1505    (Example 5),  suggesting a
      significant difference in drug effect due to differences
      in the phosphorylation epitope.

     which is a center of memory. The fluorescence intensity
     was quantified by NIH-Image J.
           The results are shown in Fig. 16. With

          Anti-tau antibodies   (Tal505, AT8) diluted to 1 pg/mL
25  with 10% bovine serum-containing TS were mounted, for
    treatment overnight at 44C.    After rinsing twice with TS
    for 10 minutes, biotin-labeled anti-mouse antibody
    (Vector Co.) diluted 500-fold with TS containing 10%
    bovine serum was mounted, for treatment at room
30  temperature for 60 minutes.
          After rinsing twice with TS for 10 minutes, HRP
    labeled ABC solution (Vector Co.) was mounted for
    reaction at room temperature for 30 minutes, and after
    additional rinsing, coloring was performed with
35  diaminobenzidine (DAB).    This was encapsulated with

          The results of immunohistostaining with Ta1505 are
     shown in Fig. 22 to Fig. 24.
          As seen in Fig. 22, Ta1505-positive Tau staining was
  5 observed in the hippocampus CA3 region (first column from
    left) and the hippocampus CA23 region (second column from
    left) in 5 individuals of the control IgG-administered
    group, but the staining levels in the hippocampus CA3
    region   (third column from left) and hippocampus CA23
 10 region (fourth column from left) in 5 individuals of the
    Ta1505-administered group were clearly lower than the
    control TgG-administered group.      This confirmed that
    Ta1505 administration reduced Ta1505-positive Tau, i.e.
    Ser413-phosphorylated Tau, in the hippocampus CA3 region
15  and hippocampus CA23 region.      More specifically, the
    control IgG group showed accumulated fine brown points,
    staining in a thick line from left to right in CA3. With
    CA23, a thick curve stained from the top right toward the
    left side. The Ta1505-administered group had very fine
20  thin brown points, with a thick staining line from the
    top left toward the bottom right in CA3. With CA23, a
    thick curve stained from the top right toward the left
    side. Virtually no staining was seen in four CA3 regions
    and three CA23 regions.
25        In Fig. 23 and Fig. 24, AT8-positive Tau staining
    was seen in the cortex regions (Perirhinal Cortex (first
    column from left in Fig. 23),    Lateral Entorhinal Cortex
    (second column from left in Fig. 23),     and Medial
    Entorhinal Cortex (third column from left in Fig. 23)),
30  for five individuals in the control IgG-administered
    group.(Staining as brown spots in Fig. 23.)
          The staining levels in the cortex regions
    (Perirhinal Cortex   (first column from left in Fig. 24),
    Lateral Entorhinal Cortex (second column from left in
35  Fig. 24) and Medial Entorhinal Cortex (third column from
    left in Fig. 24)),   were clearly reduced below the control
    IgG-administered group, for five individuals in the

                                - 70
     Tal505-administered group, to a level which exhibited no
     staining.
          This confirmed that Tal505 administration reduced
     TalO5-positive Tau, i.e. Ser413 phosphorylated Tau, in
  5  the cortex regions  (Perirhinal Cortex, Lateral Entorhinal
    Cortex, Medial Enotrhinal Cortex),
          Brown spot staining is present in Fig. 23, but
    virtually no brown spot staining can be seen in Fig. 24.
          Ta1505 antibody administration was confirmed to
 10 reduce Ser413 phosphorylated Tau levels in the brain (=
    hippocampus CA3 region, hippocampus CA23 region, PRh, Ent
     (Lateral, Medial)).
          PRh = Perirhinal Cortex
          Ent = Entorhinal Cortex
15        The results of immunohistostaining with AT8 are
    shown in Fig. 25 to Fig. 27.
          As seen in Fig. 25, AT8-positive Tau staining was
    observed in the hippocampus CA3 region (first column from
    left) and the hippocampus CA23 region    (second column from
20  left) in 5 individuals of the control IgG-administered
    group, but the staining levels in the hippocampus CA3
    region (third column from left) and hippocampus CA23
    region (fourth column from left) in 5 individuals of the
    Tal505-administered group were clearly lower than the
25  control IgG-administered group.    This confirmed that
    Ta1505 administration reduced AT8-positive Tau, i.e.
    Ser202/Thr2O5-phosphorylated Tau, in the hippocampus CA3
    region and hippocampus CA23 region. More specifically,
    in Fig. 25, the control IgG group shows accumulated fine
30  brown points, staining in a thick line from the top left
    to bottom right, with CA3.    With CA23, a thick curve
    stained from the top right toward the left side.     The
    Ta1505-administered group had very fine thin brown
    points, with a thick staining line from the top left
35  toward the bottom right with CA3. With CA23, a thick
    curve stained from the top right toward the left side.
          In Fig. 26, AT8-positive Tau staining is seen in the

                                     -  71
      cortex regions     (Perirhinal Cortex     (first column from left

      from left in Fig. 26),     and Medial Entorhinal Cortex
       (third column from left in Fig. 26)),        for five
   5  individuals in the control IgG-administered
      group.(Staining as brown spots in Fig. 26.)
            In Fig. 27,   the staining levels in the cortex
      regions   (Perirhinal Cortex     (first column from left in
      Fig. 27),   Lateral Entorhinal Cortex       (second column from
 10   left in Fig. 27)    and Medial Entorhinal Cortex       (third
      column from left    in Fig. 27))     are clearly reduced below
      the control IgG-administered group,         for five individuals
      in the Ta1505-administered group.(Staining as thin brown
      spots in Fig. 27.)
 15         This confirmed that Tal505 administration reduced
     AT8-positive Tau, i.e. Ser202/Thr2O5 phosphorylated Tau,
     in the cortex regions (Perirhinal Cortex, Lateral
     Entorhinal Cortex, Medial Entorhinal Cortex).
           Ta1505 antibody administration was confirmed to tend
20   to reduce AT8-recognizing Ser202/Thr2O5 phosphorylated
     Tau levels in the brain      (=  hippocampus CA3 region,
     hippocampus CA23 region, PRh, Ent         (Lateral, Medial)).
           This result provides support that antibody
     administration ameliorates pathology in the brain and has
25   an improving effect for memory impairment.           The results
     indicate that intraperitoneally administered antibody
     acts in the brain.

     administration on Tau and hyperphosphorylated Tau levels
     in brain homogenates was examined by Western blotting
     using antibody-administered Tau-Tg mice brain
  5  homogenates.
            Sonication was performed on 100 to 200 mg of mouse
     cerebral hemisphere in a 5-fold amount of TBS (containing
    protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor
     cocktail).    This was centrifuged at 100,000 g for 15
 10 minutes at 4*C, and the supernatant was collected as the
    TBS soluble fraction.
           The precipitate was suspended in 1% sarkosyl/TBS
     (containing protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase
    inhibitor cocktail), and incubated for 1 hour at room
15  temperature.     This was centrifuged at 100,000 g for 15
    minutes at room temperature, and the supernatant was used
    as the sarkosyl soluble fraction.
           The TBS soluble fraction and sarkosyl soluble
    fraction were electrophoresed with 7% Tris-Acetate Gel
20  and separated, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and
    subjected to blocking overnight at room temperature with
    1% BSA/3% SkimMilk/0.05% Tween20/TBS. Next, the antibody
    solution was reacted using HRP conjugate antibody as the
    secondary antibody, reaction was conducted by the ECL
25  method, and analysis was performed with an LAS3000 image
    analyzer for quantification.
     [0097]
          The results are shown in Fig. 28 and Fig. 29.
           For the TBS soluble fraction, it was confirmed that
30  Ta1505 antibody administration significantly reduced
    human Tau    (recognized by G2 antibody),
    hyperphosphorylated Tau    (recognized by AT8  (pS202/pT205
    epitope) and PHF1    (pS396/pS404 epitope)) and pS413Tau
    (recognized by Ta1505) in Tau-Tg mice brain.

    that Ta1505 antibody administration significantly reduced
    hyperphosphorylated Tau    (recognized by AT8) in Tau-Tg

       [Production Example 1] Tg mice expressing human normal
      type tau (Tau-Tg mice), as cognitive function impairment
 10   model
            The pharmacological effect of antibodies of the
      invention on improving cognitive function was examined
      using Tg mice having the characteristic of expressing
      human normal type tau, and particularly the same
 15   expression pattern as in ontogenesis in humans, which is
      expression of only type 3R tau during the embryonic stage
      and both types 3R and 4R tau with continuing growth, and
      exhibiting onset of cognitive function impairment at
      about 6 months after birth. The Tg mice were prepared by
20   the following method.
      [0099]
            The gene structure used for preparation of the Tg
     mice was tau gene-conferring nucleic acid having the
     structure shown in Fig. 17,      comprising the Simian virus
25   40   (SV4O) 5'-intron (0.3 kb), tau gene (Tau; 7.3 kb),
     SV40 3'-intron (0.8 kb) and SV40 polyA signal (0.3 kb) in
     that order, downstream from the a-calmodulin kinase IIac
      (CaMKII) promoter   (8.5 kb).    The tau gene used was
     obtained by the same method described by Yamashita T. et
30   al. (FEBS Letters, Vol.579, P.241-244, 2005), as a 7.3
     kb-length gene comprising the nucleotide sequence of the
     portion corresponding to exons 1 to 9 from cDNA coding
     for human tau, a nucleotide sequence including the
     portion of the first 18 nucleotides and the last 3 kb of
35   intron 9, the nucleotide sequence of exon 10, the portion
     of the first 3 kb and the last 38 nucleotides of intron
     10(with cytosine substituting for thymine at base number

                                  - 74
       16 from the 5'-end of intron 10) and the nucleotide
       sequence of cDNA corresponding to exons 11 to 13.    The
      tau gene was cloned at the restriction enzyme EcoRV site
      of pNN265, a vector including the SV40 5'-intron and 3'
   5  intron and poly(A) signal sequence (Choi T et al., Mol.
      Cell. Biol. vol.11, pp.3070-3074, 1991).     A DNA fragment
      containing the SV40 5'-intron, the tau gene, the SV40 3'
      intron and the poly(A) signal sequence was cut out from
      the obtained plasmids with restriction enzymes XhoI and
 10   NotI, and the DNA fragment was cloned in pMM403 vector
      including CaMKII promoter   (Mayford M et al.,  Cell vol.81
      pp.891-904, 1995).   Also, a gene fragment having the
      structure shown in Fig. 17, containing the tau gene, was
      cut out from the obtained plasmids with restriction
 15   enzyme SfiI (17.2 kb), isolated by agarose
      electrophoresis, and purified from the corresponding gel
      region using QIAGEN (R) QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Cat.
     No.28704).   The obtained gene (DNA) fragment was
      incubated with pronuclear-stage embryos obtained by
20   breeding male/female C57BL/6 mice, according to a known
     method [Hogan, B et al., "Manipulating the mouse embryo.
     A Laboratory Manual,"   Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
      (1986)].  These were implanted into the uterine tubes of
     female C57BL mice rendered pseudopregnant by injection.
25   Portions of the tails of the born mice were amputated,
     PCR was conducted to confirm whether the introduced gene
     had been transferred, and the female or male mice with
     the transferred gene were bred with normal female or male
     mice to establish Tg mice hetero for the transferred tau
30   gene, which were used for experimentation. The Tau-Tg
     mice mentioned in line 609 and line 784 of the examples
     are mice produced by the same method and exhibiting
     equivalent traits (possibly delete reference to lines in
     examples).
