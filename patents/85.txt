                                   GOVERNMENT SUPPORT
[0003]            This invention was made with federal funding under Grant No. PO 1-CA
80124 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The U.S. government has certain rights
in the invention.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0004]            The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be
taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that such art forms part of the
common general knowledge at it relates to the claims defining the invention. Advances in
biomedical research have led to the introduction of several novel systemically administered
molecular and nanotherapeutic agents in both preclinical and clinical settings (Jones, D.
(2007) Nat Rev Drug Discov 6, 174-175; Moghimi, S. M. et al. (2005) Faseb J 19, 311-330).
While these new agents act on unique targets that afford greater specificity to tumor cells or
improved pharmacodynamic properties, their effectiveness suffers from limitations in their
delivery owing to the properties of the tumor microenvironment (Jain, R. K. (1998) Nat Med
4, 655-657; Sanhai, W. R. et al. (2008) Nat Nanotechnol 3, 242-244; Chauhan, V et al.
(2011) Annu Rev Chem Biomol Eng. 2(1):281-98). For example, pegylated liposomal
doxorubicin (DOXIL*), approved by the FDA, and oncolytic viruses, currently in multiple
clinical trials, represent two nanotherapeutics whose size (~ 100 nm) hinders their
intratumoral distribution and therapeutic effectiveness (Nemunaitis J, et al. (2001) J Clin
Oncol 19:289-298).
[0005]            At least two processes governing drug delivery following systemic
administration, namely, vascular transport throughout tissues and transvascular transport into
tissues, are hindered by physiological barriers in tumors for all classes of therapeutics (Jain,
                                                   I

 WO 2013/169739                                                               PCT/US2013/039901
R. K. & Stylianopoulos (2010) Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 139; Chauhan, V. P. et al. (2009)
Biophysical Journal 97, 330-336). These barriers impact therapy, particularly, for patients
with desmoplastic, fibrotic tumors, such as pancreatic (Olive, K. P. et al. (2009) Science 324,
 1457-1461), colorectal (Halvorsen, T. B. & Seim, E. (1989) J Clin Pathol 42, 162-166), lung
and breast cancer (Ronnov-Jessen, L. et al. (1996) Physiol Rev 76, 69-125). Fibrotic tumors
typically have a dense collagen network, which causes small interfibrillar spacing in the
interstitium to retard the movement of particles larger than 10 nanometers (Netti PA, et al.
(2000) CancerRes 60:2497-2503; Pluen A, et al. (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:4628
4633; Ramanujan S, et al. (2002) Biophys J83:1650-1660; and Brown E, et al. (2003) Nat
Med 9:796-800) These barriers limit the amount of drug that reaches the target cancer cells
and leads to poor drug effectiveness.
 [0006]          Currently, there are limited approaches to overcome these delivery barriers for
nanotherapeutics and for low molecular weight drugs. Thus, the need exists for identifying
new cancer therapies, in particular new agents that enhance the delivery and distribution of
cancer therapies, including nanotherapeutics (e.g., lipid- or polymeric nanoparticles and
viruses), protein and nucleic acid drugs, small molecule chemotherapeutic agents and
immune cells.
                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 [0007]         The invention is based, in part, on the discovery that losartan, an angiotensin II
receptor antagonist drug approved for the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension),
improves the delivery and efficacy of cancer therapeutics.
The inventors have discovered, inter alia, that losartan normalizes the collagen, interstitial
matrix of solid tumors and facilitates the distribution and/or penetration of
chemotherapeutics, including large molecular weight chemotherapeutics, e.g.,
nanotherapeutics. For example, losartan reduced collagen I levels in (e.g., reduced collagen
production by) carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from breast cancer biopsies,
and caused a dose-dependent reduction in stromal collagen in desmoplastic models of human
breast, pancreatic and skin tumors in mice. Losartan also improved the distribution,
therapeutic efficacy and/or penetration of nanopartices (e.g., oncolytic herpes simplex viruses
(HSV) and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (DOXIL*)). The inventors have also discovered
that losartan facilitates decompression of blood vessels and vascular normalization, and
improves tumor perfusion and delivery of low molecular weight chemotherapeutics and
oxygen, thus enhancing the therapeutic effect of cancer therapies, including but not limited to
radiation, photodynamic therapy, chemotherapeutics and immunotherapies. Examples

 WO 2013/169739                                                                PCT/US2013/039901
disclosed herein further demonstrate a reduction in collagen levels and tumor solid stress
using angiotensin inhibitors other than losartan, including, for example, angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARBs), such as candesartan and valsartan, as well as angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), such as lisinopril.
 [0008]          Thus, methods and compositions for improving the delivery and/or efficacy of
therapeutics (e.g., cancer therapeutics) are disclosed. Methods and compositions for treating
or preventing a cancer (e.g., a solid tumor such as a desmoplastic tumor) by administering to
a subject an anti-hypertensive and/or collagen modifying agent, as a single agent or in
combination with a microenvironment modulator, and/or a therapeutic agent (for example, a
cancer therapeutic agent ranging in size from an immune cell or a large nanotherapeutic to a
low molecular weight chemotherapeutics and/or oxygen radicals) are disclosed.
 [0009]          Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention features a method of treating or
preventing a disorder, e.g., a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., a cancer) in a subject, or of
improving the delivery and/or efficacy of a therapy (e.g., a cancer therapy) to a subject. The
method includes:
         administering an anti-hypertensive and/or a collagen modifying agent ( referred to
herein as "AHCM" or "AHCM agent") to the subject;
         optionally, administering a microenvironment modulator; and
         optionally, administering the therapy (e.g., the cancer therapy),
under conditions, e.g., of dosage of AHCM and anti-cancer agent, sufficient to treat or
prevent the disorder (e.g., the cancer or tumor), in the subject, or to improve the delivery
and/or efficacy of the therapy (e.g., the cancer therapy) provided to the subject.
 [00010]         In one embodiment, the method includes one or more of the following:
         a) selecting or identifying the subject as being in need of receiving the AHCM or
microenvironment modulator (or both) on the basis of the need for improved delivery and/or
efficacy of the therapy (e.g., the cancer therapy);
         b) administering the AHCM, the microenvironment modulator, or the therapy (e.g.,
the cancer therapy), or any combination thereof, as an entity having a hydrodynamic diameter
of greater than about 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 45, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 nm, but less than
300 nm, e.g., as a nanoparticle;
         c) the subject has a history of treatment (or lack of treatment) for hypertension, as
described herein, e.g., the subject has not been administered a dose of an AHCM, e.g., an
AHCM named herein, or any AHCM (e.g., either of a dose sufficient to substantially lower
the subject's blood pressure or a sub-anti-hypertensive dose) , within 5, 10, 30, 60 or 100
days of the diagnosis of cancer or the initiation of the AHCM dosing. In one embodiment,
                                                  3

 WO 2013/169739                                                                   PCT/US2013/039901
the subject is not hypertensive, or has been hypertensive, prior to administration of the
AHCM;
         d) treating the subject with a dosing regimen described herein, e.g., administration of
the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is initiated prior to the initiation of
administration of the cancer therapy, e.g., it is initiated at least one, two, three, or five days,
or one, two, three, four, five or more weeks prior to cancer therapy (e.g., the AHCM and/or
the microenvironment modulator is administered at a minimum of two weeks prior to cancer
therapy);
         e) providing the AHCM, and/or the microenvironment modulator, and the cancer
therapy according to a dosing regimen described herein, e.g., providing a first course of
treatment with an AHCM at a sub-anti-hypertensive dose followed by a second, higher dose,
course of treatment with an AHCM, e.g., at a dose that is at or above a standard anti
hypertensive dose (e.g., wherein the second course is administered in a time course that will
counteract a hypertensive affect of an anti-cancer therapy);
         f) administering the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator substantially
continuously over a period of at least 1, 5, 10, or 24 hours; at least 2, 5, 10, or 14 days; at
least 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 weeks; at least 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 months; or at least 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 years, or
longer;
         g) administering the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator sequentially
and/or concurrently with the therapy, e.g., the cancer therapy. The AHCM, the
microenvironment modulator and the therapy can be administered (at the same or different
dosages) in any order and/or overlap with the therapy. In one embodiment, the AHCM
and/or the microenvironment modulator is administered before the therapy (e.g., as described
in step d)). In other embodiments, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is
administered sequentially and/or concurrently with the therapy (e.g., the AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator is administered prior to the therapy (e.g., as described in step d)
and concurrently with the therapy). In yet other embodiments, the therapy is administered
first, and the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is administered after initiation
of the therapy, or is administered after cessation of the therapy. In other embodiments, the
administration of the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator starts after cessation of
the therapy. In other embodiments, the administration of the AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator continues after cessation of the therapy. In embodiments where
administration of the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulatorand the therapy is
concurrent, the administration of the AHCM, the microenvironment modulator and the
therapy can be continued as clinically appropriate, for example, (i) as a combination therapy,

 WO 2013/169739                                                                 PCT/US2013/039901
(ii) with a period of therapy with either the AHCM or the therapy, or (iii) as a combination of
(i) and (ii) in any order.
 [00011]         In one embodiment, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator alters
(e.g., enhances), (e.g., is administered in an amount sufficient to alter (e.g., enhance)), the
distribution or efficacy of the therapy, e.g., the cancer therapy. In some embodiments, the
AHCM does not inhibit or prevent (e.g., is administered in an amount insufficient to inhibit
or prevent) tumor growth by itself, but sufficient to alter (e.g., enhance) the distribution or
efficacy of the therapy, e.g., the cancer therapy.
 [00012]         In an embodiment, the AHCM results in (e.g., is administered at a dose that
causes), one or more of: decreases the level or production of an extracellular matrix
component, such as a fiber (e.g., collagen, procollagen), and/or a polysaccharide (e.g., a
glycosaminoglycan such as hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid); decreases the level or production
of collagen or procollagen; decreases the level or production of hyaluronic acid; decreases
tumor fibrosis; increases interstitial tumor transport; improves tumor perfusion; increases
tumor oxygenation; decreases tumor hypoxia; decreases tumor acidosis; enables immune cell
infiltration; decreases immunosuppression; increases antitumor immunity; decreases the
production of cancer stem cells (also referred to herein as tumor-initiating cells); or enhances
the efficacy (e.g., penetration or diffusion), of the therapy, e.g., the cancer therapy (e.g.,
radiation, photodynamic therapy, chemotherapeutics and immunotherapies) in a tumor or
tumor vasculature, in the subject.
 [00013]         In an embodiment, the AHCM and/or microenvironment modulator is
administered in a dosage sufficient to improve the delivery or effectiveness of the therapy.
 [00014]         In an embodiment the method results in, or comprises (e.g., the AHCM and/or
microenvironment modulator is administered in a dosage sufficient to result in) improvement
of a disorder-related parameter in said subject, as compared to a subject treated with said
therapy but without administration of the AHCM and/or microenvironment modulator.
"Disorder-related parameter," as used herein, refers to a parameter that varies with the
alleviation of the disorder or a symptom of the disorder.
 [00015]         In an embodiment, an AHCM (and, in embodiments not a microenvironment
modulator) is administered and the improvement is as compared to a subject treated with said
therapy but without administration of the AHCM.
 [00016]         In an embodiment, a microenvironment modulator (and, in embodiments not
an AHCM) is administered and the improvement is as compared to a subject treated with said
therapy but without administration of the microenvironment modulator.
 [00017]         In an embodiment, an AHCM and a microenvironment modulator are
                                                  5

administered and the improvement is as compared to a subject treated with said therapy but
without administration of the AHCM and the microenvironment modulator.
 [00018]         In an embodiment, the parameter comprises relief of a symptom of said
disorder.
 [00019]         In an embodiment, the parameter comprises outcome of a patient scored
evaluation of symptoms or quality of life, e.g., a quality of life questionaire, e.g., outcome on
an evaluation of number of meals consumed on the day prior to the evaluation. pain, weight
loss or gain.
 [00020]         In an embodiment, the parameter comprises one or more or all of:
         a) objective response rate (ORR);
         b) progression free survival (PFS);
         c) overall survival (OS), or
         d) reduction in toxicity (whether or not accompanied by an increase on OS. ORR
evaluations will differ between disorder but such evaluations are within the skill of the art.
For an example, see Willett et al. (2009) Journalof Clinical Oncology 27: 3020-6, which
discusses the use of pathological response estimated from evaluation of tissue after surgical
resection. Evaluation of PFS is within the skill of the art. For an example, for brain tumors,
APF6 (alive and progression-free at 6 months) has been used, see Batchelor et al. (2010) J
Clinical Oncology 28: 2817-23. For radiation therapy, criteria such as "Disease-free
survival" and "Freedom from metastasis" have been used, see, e.g., Willett et al, 2010, The
Oncologist,15:845-851. Some evaluations of ORR and PFS rely on imaging methods, e.g.,
PET, PET-MRI, or PET-CT. Evaluation of toxicity will vary by disorder and treatment
modality. One example can be seen in Willett et al. (2010) The Oncologist 15:845-851.
 [00021]         In an embodiment, the parameter comprises one or more or all of: a) drug
concentration, e.g., at a disorder or disease site, e.g., in a solid tumor; b) tumor response; c)
blood perfusion, e.g., at a disorder or disease site, e.g., in a solid tumor; d) oxygenation, e.g.,
at a disorder or disease site, e.g., in a solid tumor; e) interstitial fluid pressure at a disorder or
disease site, e.g., in a solid tumor; or f) extracellular matrix content or composition, e.g., level
of collagen, hyaluronic acid.

AHMC Dosage and DosageForm
 [00051]        Methods of the invention use an AHCM to potentiate a therapy (e.g., a cancer
therapy).
 [00052]        In one embodiment, the AHCM is administered at a dose that corresponds to a
standard of care dose. Standard of care doses of the AHCM are available in the art. For
example, if the AHCM is the AT 1 inhibitor, losartan, the standard of care dose for anti
hypertensive use in a human is about 25-100 mg day'. In the present methods, losartan can
be administered orally in a daily schedule (once or twice a day), alone or in combination with
a cancer therapy described herein. Losartan can be provided in a dosage form (e.g., an oral
tablet) of about 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg.
 [00053]        Exemplary standard of care doses for other AT1 inhibitors for anti
hypertensive or anti-heart failure use in humans are as follows: 4 to 32 mg day-1 of
candesartan (ATACAND@) (e.g., available in a dosage form for oral administration
containing 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg, or 32 mg of candesartan); 400 to 800 mg day' of eprosartan
mesylate (TEVETEN@) (e.g., available in a dosage form for oral administration containing
400 or 600 mg of eprosartan); 150 to 300 mg day- of irbesartan (AVAPRO@) (e.g., available
in a dosage form for oral administration containing 150 or 300 mg of irbesartan); 20 to 40 mg
day-1 of olmesartan (BENICAR@) (available in a dosage form for oral administration
containing 5 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg of olmesartan); 20 to 80 mg day1 of telmisartin
(MICARDIS@) (e.g., available in a dosage form for oral administration containing of 20 mg,
40 mg or 80 mg of telmisartin); and 80 to 320 mg day- of valsartan (DIOVAN®) (e.g.,
available in a dosage form for oral administration containing 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg or 320
mg of valsartan).
 [00054]        In an embodiment, the AHCM is administered at a sub-anti-hypertensive dose
(e.g., a dose that has no significant effect on mean arterial blood pressure when administered
to a hypertensive subject; or a dose that is below a standard of care anti-hypertensive dose).
In an embodiment, the AHCM is administered in an amount that does not substantially lower
the mean arterial blood pressure of the subject, e.g., as measured after a pre-selected number
of administrations at that dosage, e.g., at the steady state plasma level for a given dosage. In
an embodiment, the AHCM is administered, at least once, at a dose that reduces mean arterial
blood pressure in the subject by less than 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 2 0%, 2 5%, 3 0%, 35%, 4 0 %,

 120 systolic and about 80 diastolic, or a dose that would bring the subjects blood pressure
into the range of to 120+/-5 systolic and 80+/-5 diastolic.
 [00055]          In an embodiment, the AHCM is administered at a dose that is less than the
standard of care dose for anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure use (e.g., a dose that is less
than 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, that of
the standard of care dose for anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure use). Standard of care
doses of the AHCM are available in the art. For example, if the AHCM is the AT1 inhibitor,
losartan, and the standard of care dose is about 25-100 mg day-1 , the suboptimal anti
hypertensive drug can range from 0.25 to 17.5, 0.5 to 15, 1.3 to 12, 1.5 to 12, 2 to 12, 2 to 10,
2 to 5, 2 to 3 mg day-1 , typically, 2 mg day-'. In one embodiment, the AHCM is losartan and
is administered at a dose less than 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 mg day'. Losartan can be
administered orally in a daily schedule (once or twice a day) at a sub-anti-hypertensive dose
of 2-3 mg day-, alone or in combination with a cancer therapeutic described herein.
Exemplary standard of care doses for other AT 1 inhibitors are as follows: 4 to 32 mg day- of
candesartan (ATACAND@), 400 to 800 mg day-l of eprosartan mesylate (TEVETEN@), 150
to 300 mg day-1 of irbesartan (AVAPRO@), 20 to 40 mg day-1 of olmesartan (BENICAR@),
20 to 80 mg day- of telmisartin (MICARDIS@), and 80 to 320 mg day-' of valsartan
(DIOVAN@). In an embodiment, the AHCM is administered at a dose that is less than the
standard of care dose of the anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure dose (e.g., a dose that is
less than 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7,
that of the standard of care dose of the anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure dose for other
AT 1 inhibitors such as candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, telmisartin, and
valsartan).
In certain embodiments, the AHCM is formulated in a dosage form that is less than the
standard of care anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure dosage form (e.g., a dosage form that
is less than 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.15, 0.16, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,
0.5, 0.6, 0.7, that of the standard of care dosage form). For example, if the AHCM is
losartan, the dosage form can be of about 0.5 mg-Il mg; 1 mg -10 mg; 1-5 mg, or 1 mg, 2
mg, 3 mg, 4 mg, 5 mg, 6 mg, 7 mg, 8 mg, 9 mg or 10 mg. In some embodiments, losartan

In one embodiment, the AHCM is formulated and/or dosed for oral administration. In one
embodiment, the AHCM is formulated as a tablet (e.g., an oral tablet). In other
embodiments, the AHCM is formulated and/or dosed for other routes of administration, e.g.,
subcutaneous, intravenous, or intraperitoneal administration. In certain embodiments, the
AHCM can be formulated and/or dosed for extended, delayed, or controlled release, e.g., in
an extended release formulation (e.g., an oral formulation) for substantially continuous
release over a period of hours (e.g., at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, or 24 hours); days (e.g., at least 1,
2, 5, 10, 14 days, or longer), weeks, months or years.
 [00056]         In some embodiments, the sub-anti-hypertensive dose of the AHCM or a dose
of the AHCM that is less than the standard of care dose for anti-hypertensive or anti-heart
failure use can be a dose that is insufficient to inhibit or prevent tumor growth or progression
if it is administed to a subject by itself.
 [00057]         In yet another embodiment, the AHCM is administered at a dose that is greater
than the standard of care dose for anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure use (e.g., a dose that
is greater than 1.1, 1.5, 1.7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10-fold or higher, that of the standard of care dose for
anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure use). Standard of care doses of the AHCM are
available in the art; some of which are exemplified herein.
 [00058]         In other embodiments, the AHCM is formulated in a dosage form that is
greater than the standard of care anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure dosage form (e.g., a
dosage form that is greater than 1.1, 1.5, 1.7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10-fold or higher, that of the standard
of care dosage form). Standard of care dosage forms of the AHCM are available in the art;
some of which are exemplified herein.
 [00059]         In some embodiments, a dose of the AHCM that is comparable to, or greater
than the standard of care anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure dose can be a dose that is
insufficient to inhibit or prevent tumor growth or progression if it is administed to a subject
by itself
 [00060]         In other embodiments, the anti-cancer agent is administered at a greater
dosage, or in a regimen that results in higher levels of the anti-cancer agent, as compared with
a reference, e.g., the dosage on a package insert, the standard of care dosing, or the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD).
 [00061]         In certain embodiments, the anti-cancer agent is administered at a lesser

some embodiments, the anti-cancer agent is administered in an amount such that it is not
effective to inhibit or prevent tumor growth or progression when administered by itself, but in
an amount sufficient to inhibit or prevent tumor growth or progression when administered in
combination with the AHCM.
 [00062]         In some embodiments, the cancer therapy or cancer therapeutic, when
administered in combination with an AHCM, is administered to the subject at a dose that is
less than the lowest dose that would be used in the absence of the AHCM, to treat or prevent
cancer in a subject.
 [00063]         In some embodiments, when both the AHCM agent and cancer therapy or
cancer therapeutic are administered to the subject, the dose of the anti-hypertenisve and/or
collagen modifying agent can be a dose that is less than the lowest dose that would be used to
treat a hypertensive-associated disorder or heart failure, while the dose of the cancer therapy
or cancer therapeutic can be a dose that is less than the lowest dose that would be used in the
absence of the AHCM, to treat or prevent cancer in a subject.
 [00064]         In some embodiments, while the dose of the cancer therapy or cancer
therapeutic administered to the subject is less than the lowest dose that would be used alone
to treat a patient with cancer, the dose of the AHCM agent administered to the subject as an
adjuvant can be less than the lowest dose that would be used alone to treat cancer. In such
embodiments, the dose of the AHCM agent administered to the subject as an adjuvant can be
sub-anti-hypertensive dose or comparable to, or greater than the standard care dose for
treatment of hypertension or heart failure.
 [00065]         In some embodiments, while the dose of the cancer therapy or cancer
therapeutic administered to the subject is less than the lowest dose that would be used in the
absence of the AHCM, to treat a patient with cancer, the dose of the AHCM agent
administered to the subject as an adjuvant can be less than the lowest dose that would be used
alone to treat cancer, but is sufficient to improve efficacy of a cancer therapy or delivery of a
cancer therapeutic to a tumor. In such embodiments, the dose of the AHCM agent
administered to the subject as an adjuvant can be sub-anti-hypertensive dose or comparable
to, or greater than the standard care dose for treatment of hypertension or heart failure.
 [00066]         Methods to determine the lowest dose of any agent, e.g., an anti-cancer agent
and/or an AHCM, for treatment are well known within one of skill in the art. For example, a
skilled artisan can determine the lowest dose of an AHCM and/or an anti-cancer agent
effective for treatment in an animal model corresponding to a specific type of cancer, e.g., by

combination, e.g., sequentially and/or concurrently, as described herein. The AHCM and the
therapy can be administered (at the same or different dosages) in any order and/or overlap
with the therapy. In one embodiment, the AHCM is administered before the therapy. In
other embodiments, the AHCM is administered sequentially and/or concurrently with the
therapy (e.g., the AHCM is administered prior to the therapy and concurrently with the
therapy). In yet other embodiments, the cancer therapy is administered first, and the AHCM
is administered after initiation of the cancer therapy, or is administered after cessation of the
therapy. In other embodiments, the administration of the AHCM starts after cessation of the
therapy (e.g., with or without a gap between the cessation of the therapy and the beginning of
the AHCM). In other embodiments, the administration of the AHCM continues after
cessation of the therapy. In embodiments where administration of the AHCM and therapy is
concurrent, the administration of the AHCM and the cancer therapy can be continued as
clinically appropriate (i) as a combination therapy, (ii) with a period of therapy with either the
AHCM or the cancer therapy, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii) in any order.
 [00068]         The administration of the AHCM can be substantially continuous. For
example, administration of the AHCM can be substantially continuously over a period of at
least 1, 5, 10, 24 hours; 2, 5, 10, 14 days, or longer. As described in the Examples herein,
substantially continuous administration of an AHCM (e.g., via a subcutaneous pump) causes
a greater reduction in collagen content and/or tumor size than single or pulsatile
administration (e.g., single or multiple subcutaneous administrations) of the AHCM.
 [00069]         In some embodiments, the AHCM administration continues after the therapy
has ceased, e.g., over a period of hours, days, months or years.
 [00070]         In other embodiments, the administration of the AHCM can be intermittent,
e.g., can have gaps at pre-determined intervals, during the course of therapy. In certain
embodiments, two or more doses of the AHCM are administered, alone or in combination
with the therapy (e.g., the cancer therapy). In one embodiment, the AHCM is administered at
a suboptimal anti-hypertensive dose and an anti-hypertensive dose during the course of
therapy. For example, a suboptimal anti-hypertensive dose of the AHCM can be
administered prior to, or at the time, of therapy (e.g., cancer therapy) (e.g., treatment with an
anti-cancer agent that increases mean arterial blood pressure, e.g, treatment with an anti
angiogenic drug (e.g., Avastin, sunitinib or sorafenib)); then followed by a second

Size of therapeutic entities
 [00071]         The methods described herein allow for enhanced flexibility in the range of
treatment modalities used or selected, e.g., in the size of the therapeutic entity or entities.
Accordingly, in one embodiment, an AHCM is administered as an entity having a
hydrodynamic diameter of greater thanabout 1, 5, 10, 100, 500, or 1,000 nm. E.g., the
AHCM can be a protein, e.g., an antibody. The AHCM can also be administered as a
nanoparticle, e.g., a polymeric nanoparticle or a liposome, that includes the AHCM as a small
molecule therapeutic or a protein, e.g., an antibody.
 [00072]         In an embodiment, the therapy is a cancer therapeutic (also referred to herein
as "an anti-cancer agent") or second therapeutic agent is administered as an entity having a
hydrodynamic diameter of greater than about 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 500, or
 1,000 nm. E.g., the second therapeutic agent (e.g., the anti-cancer agent) can be a protein,
e.g., an antibody. The second therapeutic agent (e.g., the anti-cancer agent) can also be
administered as a nanoparticle, e.g., a polymeric nanoparticle or a liposome, that includes the
agent as a small molecule therapeutic (i.e., a molecule having a hydrodynamic diameter of
about 1 nm or less) or a protein, e.g., an antibody.
 [00073]         In an embodiment, an AHCM is administered as an entity having a
hydrodynamic diameter of greater than about 1 nm (e.g., greater than about 1, 5, 10, 20, 50,
75, 100, 150, 200, 500, or 1,000 nm) and a second therapeutic agent (e.g., an anti-cancer
agent) is administered as an entity having a hydrodynamic diameter of about m or less. In
one embodiment, the AHCM is present in the entity without a second therapeutic agent (e.g.,
a chemotherapeutic agent). The AHCM can be formulated for extended release, e.g., in an
extended release formulation for substantially continuous release for hours, days, weeks,
months or years.
 [00074]         In an embodiment, an AHCM is administered as an entity having a
hydrodynamic diameter of about 1 nm, or less, and a second therapeutic agent (e.g.,an anti
cancer agent) is administered as an entity having a hydrodynamic diameter of about 1 nm or
greater (e.g., greater than about 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 500, or 1,000 nm).
 [00075]         In an embodiment, an AHCM is administered as an entity having a
hydrodynamic diameter of less than, or equal to, about 1 un and a second therapeutic agent
(e.g.,an anti-cancer agent) is administered as an entity having a hydrodynamic diameter of
less than about 1 nm.
 [00076]         In an embodiment, an AHCM is administered as an entity having a
                                                 16

75, 100, 150, 200, 500, or 1,000 nm), and a second therapeutic agent (e.g., an anti-cancer
agent) is administered as an entity having a hydrodynamic diameter of greater than about 1
mn (e.g., greater than about 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 500, or 1,000 nm). The
AHCM and the second therapeutic agent (e.g., the anti-cancer agent) can be in separate or the
same entity. For example, if provided as separate entities the AHCM can be provided as a
first nanoparticle and the second therapeutic agent (e.g., the anti-cancer agent) provided as a
second nanoparticle (e.g., where the second nanoparticle has a structural property (e.g., size
or composition) or a functional property (e.g., release kinetics or a pharmacodynamic
property) that differs from the first nanoparticle). Alternatively, an AHCM and a second
therapeutic agent (e.g., an anti-cancer agent) can be provided on the same entity, e.g., in the
same nanoparticle.

not have a medical history of high blood pressure, or has not been treated with an anti
hypertensive agent. In one embodiment, the subject treated has normal or low mean arterial
blood pressure. In other embodiments, the subject treated has not undergone, or is not being
treated with anti-hypertensive therapy.
 [00091]          In certain embodiments, the subject has a disorder chosen from one or more of
a hyperproliferative disorder, a cancer, a fibrotic disorder, an inflammatory disorder or an
autoimmune disorder.
 [00092]          In one embodiment, the subject is in need of cancer therapy. In another
embodiment, the subject is in need of, or being considered for, anti-cancer therapy (e.g.,
treatment with any of the anti-cancer therapeutics described herein). In certain embodiments,
the method includes the step of determining if the subject has a cancer (e.g., a solid or fibrotic
cancer), and, responsive to said determination, administering the AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator, and the anti-cancer agent.
 [00093]          In other embodiments, the subject is at risk of developing, or having a
recurrence of, a cancer, e.g., a subject with pre-neoplasia or a genetic pre-disposition for
cancer (e.g., a subject having a BRCA1 mutation; or a breast cancer patient treated with in an
adjuvant setting (e.g., with tamoxifen)).
 [00094]          In other embodiments, the subject has early-cancer, or more progressive (e.g.,
moderate), or metastatic cancer.

metastastatic form of a cancer disclosed herein (one or more of pancreatic (e.g., pancreatic
adenocarcinoma), breast, colorectal, lung (e.g., small or non-small cell lung cancer), skin,
ovarian, or liver cancer.
 [00099]         In one embodiment, the subject is a patient having treatment-resistant cancer
or hyperproliferative disorder.
 [000100]        In some embodiments, the subject being selected for subjecting to the methods
or pharmaceutical compositions herein does not have a renal disease or a disease associated
with kidneys.
 [000101]        In one embodiment, the subject treated is a mammal, e.g., a primate, typically
a human (e.g., a patient having, or at risk of, a cancer or tumor as described herein).

pulmonary disease, asthma, aortic aneurysm, radiation-induced fibrosis, skeletal-muscle
myopathy, diabetic nephropathy, and/or arthritis.
Combination therapies
 [000106]        In one embodiment, the AHCM is administered in combination with a
microenvironment modulator, and/or a therapy, e.g., a cancer therapy (e.g., one or more of
anti-cancer agents, immunotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), surgery and/or radiation).
The terms "chemotherapeutic," "chemotherapeutic agent," and "anti-cancer agent" are used
interchangeably herein. The administration of the AHCM and the therapy, e.g., the cancer
therapy, can be sequential (with or without overlap) or simultaneous. Administration of the
AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator can be continuous or intermittent during the
course of therapy (e.g., cancer therapy). Certain therapies described herein can be used to
treat cancers and non-cancerous diseases. For example, PDT efficacy can be enhanced in
cancerous and non-cancerous conditions (e.g., tuberculosis) using the methods and
compositions described herein (reviewed in, e.g., Agostinis, P. et al. (2011) CA Cancer J.
Clin. 61:250-281).
 [000107]        In an embodiment, administration of the AHCM and/or the microenvironment
modulator is initiated prior to the initiation of administration of the therapy (e.g., the cancer
therapy), e.g., it is initiated at least one, two, three, or five days, or one, two, three, four, five
or more weeks prior to cancer therapy (e.g., the AHCM and/or the microenvironment
modulator is administered at a mimimum of two weeks prior to cancer therapy). In an
embodiment, it is intiated no more than 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 or 120 days prior to initiation of the
therapy, e.g., the cancer therapy. In an embodiment, administration of the AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator is initiated prior to the therapy, e.g., the cancer therapy, and the
therapy is not initiated until a criterion is met, e.g., a time-based criterion, e.g., administration
of AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator for a predetermined number of days or for
a predetermined number of administrations. In an embodiment, the criterion is meeting a
preselected level of AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator, e.g., a preselected level
in serum, plasma or tissue. In one embodiment, the criterion is meeting a preselected level of
a biomarker in plasma, serum or tissue, including but not limited to, an angiotensin receptor
(e.g., angiotension-II type-I receptor; ATIA receptor (ATIAR)), collagen I, collagen III,
collagen IV, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-$ 1), connective tissue growth factor

(CTGF), or thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). In another embodiment, the criterion is meeting a
preselected level of alteration in tumor morphology.
 [000108]         In one embodiment, the administration of the AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator is sequential and/or concurrent with the therapy, e.g., the cancer
therapy, as described herein.
 [000109]         In an embodiment, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is
administered, or a preselected level, e.g., a plasma level, of AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator is maintained for a preselected portion of the time the subject
receives the therapy, e.g., the cancer therapy. By way of example, the AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator therapy is maintained for the entire period in which the therapy,
e.g., the cancer therapy, is administered, or for the entire period in which a preselected level
of the therapy (e.g., an anti-cancer agent) persists in the subject.
 [000110]         Typically, therapy with the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator
continues during the entire therapy, e.g., cancer therapy, schedule. In yet other embodiments,
administration of the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is discontinued prior to
cessation of the therapy, e.g., the cancer therapy. In other embodiments, administration of the
AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is continued after cessation of the the
therapy, e.g., the cancer therapy, e.g., the administration continues hours, days, months or
more, after cessation of the cancer therapy.
 [000111]         In an embodiment, two or more doses of the AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator are administered, alone or in combination with the therapy, e.g.,
the cancer therapy. In one embodiment, the AHCM is administered at a sub-anti
hypertensive dose and an anti-hypertensive dose during the course of therapy. For example, a
sub-anti-hypertensive dose of the AHCM can be administered prior to, or at the time, of the
therapy, e.g., the cancer therapy (e.g., treatment with an anti-cancer agent that increases mean

release dosage form or formulation. In one embodiment, the AHCM is administered via an
implantable device, e.g., a pump (e.g., a subcutaneous pump), an implant or a depot. The
delivery method can be optimized such that an AHCM dose as described herein (e.g., a
standard, sub-hypertensive, or higher than standard dose) is administered and/or maintained
in the subject for a pre-determined period (e.g., a period of, or at least: 15, 30, 45 minutes; 1,
5, 10, 24 hours 2, 5, 10, 14 days; 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 weeks; 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 months; 1,
2, 3, 4, 5 years, or longer). The substantially continuously or extended release delivery or
formulation of the AHCM (with or without the combination of the microenvironment
modulator and/or therapy) can be used for prevention or treatment of cancer for a period of
hours, days, weeks, months or years. In one embodiment, the therapy is chosen from one or
more of: nanotherapy (e.g., a viral cancer therapeutic agent (e.g., an oncolytic herpes simplex
virus (HSV), a lipid nanoparticle (e.g., a liposomal formulation (e.g., pegylated liposomal
doxorubicin (DOXIL*)), or a polymeric nanoparticle); an antibody that binds to a cancer
target; an RNAi or antisense RNA agent;, a chemotherapeutic agent (e.g., a cytotoxic or a
cytostatic agent); PDT, immunotherapy, radiation; or surgery; or any combination thereof.
Additional examples of anti-cancer therapies that can be used in combination with the
AHCM are provided below.

hyperproliferative therapy) are administered to a subject, e.g., a subject as described herein,
in combination with the microenvironment modulator. In certain embodiments, the
microenvironment modulator causes one or more of: reduces solid stress (e.g., growth
induced solid stress in tumors); decreases tumor fibrosis; reduces interstitial hypertension or
interstitial fluid pressure (IFP); increases interstitial tumor transport; increases tumor or
vessel perfusion; increases vascular diameters and/or enlarges compressed or collapsed blood
vessels; reduces or depletes one or more of: cancer cells, or stromal cells (e.g., tumor
associated fibroblasts or immune cells); decreases the level or production of extracellular
matrix components, such as fibers (e.g., collagen, procollagen), and/or polysaccharides (e.g.,
glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid); decreases the level or
production of collagen or procollagen; decreases the level or production of hyaluronic acid;
increases tumor oxygenation; decreases tumor hypoxia; decreases tumor acidosis; enables
immune cell infiltration; decreases immunosuppression; increases antitumor immunity;

of the hedgehog pathway, e.g., IPI-926, GDC-0449, cylopamine or an analogue thereof, or
GANT58.
 [000117]       In another embodiment, the microenvironment modulator includes an agent
that improves drug penetration in tumors. In one embodiment, the agent is a disulfide-based
cyclic RGD peptide peptide (iRGD) or an analogue thereof.
 [000118]       In yet another embodiment, the microenvironment modulator includes a
taxane therapy (e.g.,taxane-induced apoptosis as described in Griffon-Etienne, G. et al.
(1999) CancerRes. 59(15):3776-82).
 [000119]       In another embodiment, the microenvironment modulator includes an agent
that modulates (e.g, inhibits) a hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), for example, an agent that
inhibits hypoxia-inducible factors 1a and 2a (HIF-la and HIF-2a). In one embodiment, the
agent is an antibody against an HIF. In another embodiment, the agent is an HIF chemical
inhibitor, such as phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC).
 [000120]       In another embodiment, the microenvironment modulator includes an agent

 [000122]       In another embodiment, the AHCM and/or the cancer therapy is administered
in combination with an anti-fibrotic agent, for example, a pirfenidone (PFD, 5-methyl-I
phenyl-2-(lH)-pyridone), as further described herein..
 [000123]       The administration of the AHCM, the cancer therapy, the microenvironment
modulator and/or the profibrotic pathway inhibitor can be sequential (with or without
overlap) or simultaneous (e.g., a described herein).
Cancer Therapies
 [000124]       In one embodiment, the cancer treated is an epithelial, mesenchymal or
hematologic malignancy. In an embodiment, the cancer treated is a solid tumor (e.g.,
carcinoid, carcinoma or sarcoma), a soft tissue tumor (e.g., a heme malignancy), and a
metastatic lesion, e.g., a metastatic lesion of any of the cancers disclosed herein. In one
embodiment, the cancer treated is a fibrotic or desmoplastic solid tumor, e.g., a tumor having
one or more of: limited tumor perfusion, compressed blood vessels, high interstitial fluid
pressure (IFPs), or fibrotic tumor interstitium. In one embodiment, the solid tumor is chosen
from one or more of pancreatic (e.g., pancreatic adenocarcinoma (e.g., pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDA)), breast, gastric, colorectal, lung (e.g., small or non-small cell lung
cancer), skin, ovarian, prostate, or liver cancer. Additional examples of cancers treated are
described herein below.
 [000125]       In certain embodiments, the cancer treated contains (e.g., has elevated levels
of) extracellular matrix components, such as fibers (e.g., collagen, procollagen) and/or
polysaccharides (e.g., glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid). The
levels of the extracellular matrix components in the cancer can vary depending on the
particular cancer type, the stage of maligancy, and/or in response to cancer therapy. For
example, certain cancer may show elevated levels of extracellular matrix components in
response to chemotherapy and/or radiation. In such cancers, the AHCM alone or in
combination with the microenvironment modulator can be administered at any time before,
during or after the cancer therapy.

 [000126]         In another embodiment, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is
administered in combination with a cancer therapy (e.g., one or more of anti-cancer agents,
photodynamic therapy (PDT), immunotherapy, surgery and/or radiation). In one
embodiment, the cancer therapy includes one or more of: a cancer therapeutic, including, for
example, a nanotherapy (e.g., one or more nanotherapeutic agents, including viral cancer
therapeutic agents (e.g., an oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV)) a lipid nanoparticle (e.g., a
liposomal formulation (e.g., pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (DOXIL*)), or a polymeric
nanoparticle); one or more cancer therapeutic antibodies (e.g., anti-HER2, anti-EGFR, anti
CD20 antibodies); RNAi and antisense RNA agents; one or more chemotherapeutic agents
(e.g., low molecular weight chemotherapeutic agents, including a cytotoxic or a cytostatic
agent)); photodynamic therapy; immunotherapy; radiation; or surgery, or any combination
thereof. Any combination of one or more AHCMs and one or more therapeutic modalities
(e.g., first, second, third) nanotherapeutic agent, antibody agent, low molecular weight
chemotherapeutic agent, radiation can be used. Exemplary cancer therapeutics include, but
are not limited to, nanotherapeutic agents (e.g., one or more lipid nanoparticles (e.g., a
liposomal formulation (e.g., pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (DOXIL*) or liposomal
paclitaxel (e.g., Abraxane®)), or a polymeric nanoparticle); one or more low molecular
weight chemotherapeutics (e.g., gemcitabine, cisplatin, epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel,
oxaliplatin, or leucovorin); one or more antibodies against cancer targets (e.g., growth factor
receptor such as HER-2/neu, HER3, VEGF)); one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors, e.g.,
including low molecular weight and antibody agents, such as sunitinib, erlotinib, gefitinib,
sorafenib, icotinib, lapatinib, neratinib, vandetanib, BIBW 2992 or XL-647, anti-EGFR
antibody (e.g., cetuximab, panitumumab, zalutumumab, nimotuzumab necitumumab or
matuzumab)). Additional examples of chemotherapeutic agents used in combination
therapies are described hereinbelow.
 [000127]         In one embodiment, the chemotherapeutic agent used in combination with the
AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is a cytotoxic or a cytostatic agent.
Exemplary cytotoxic agents include antimicrotubule agents, topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g.,
irinotecan), or taxanes (e.g., docetaxel), antimetabolites, mitotic inhibitors, alkylating agents,
intercalating agents, agents capable of interfering with a signal transduction pathway, agents
that promote apoptosis and radiation. In yet other embodiments, the methods can be used in
combination with immunodulatory agents, e.g., IL-1, 2, 4, 6, or 12, or interferon alpha or
gamma, or immune cell growth factors such as GM-CSF.
 [000128]         In other embodiments, the cancer therapy includes an immune or
immunotherapy used in combination with the AHCM, other cancer therapies, and/or the
                                                 26

microenvironment modulator, described herein. Without wishing to be bound by theory,
factor such as hypoxia and/or limited perfusion are believed to cause immunosuppression
and/or limit the efficacy of certain immune therapies. AHCM, alone or in combination with
therapies described herein, can be used to improve the efficacy of said immune therapies.
Examples of immune therapies include, but are not limited to, CTLA-4 blockade (e.g., an
anti-CTLA-4 antibody (e.g., ipilimumab)); immune-based therapies (including, e.g., immune
or dendritic cell- based vaccines and antagonists of immune inhibitory signals or
checkpoints); cancer vaccines, e.g., Sipuleucel-T (APC8015, trade name Provenge); and
adoptive T-cell-based therapies. Exemplary immune-based therapies include, but are not
limited to, e.g., immune or dendritic cell- based vaccines (Seton-Rogers, S. (2012) Nature
Reviews Cancer 12:230-23 1; Palucka, K. et al. (2012) Nature Reviews Cancer 12:265-277);
effector memory CD8+ T cells (Bird, L. (2012) Nature Reviews Immunology 12:227);
engineered tumor cells to activate Toll like Receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like Receptors
(NLRs) (Leavy, 0. (2012) Nature Reviews Immunology 12:227); antagonists of immune
inhibitory signals or checkpoints (Pardoll, D.M. (2012) Nature Reviews Cancer 12:252-264).
In one embodiment, the therapy is a cell-based immunotherapy wherein immune cells are
expanded ex vivo and injected into the subject.
 [000129]        In yet other embodiments, the cancer therapy includes PDT used in
combination with the AHCM, other cancer therapies, and/or the microenvironment
modulator, described herein. In certain embodiments, PDT includes administration of a
photosensitizing agent (e.g., a porhyrin, a porpyrin precursor, a chorlin, or a phthalocyanine)
followed by irradiation at a wavelength corresponding to an absorbance band of the
photosensitizing agent. In the presence of oxygen, a series of events lead to one or more of:
cell death (e.g., tumor cell death), damage to the microvasculature, or induction of a local
inflammatory reaction). PDT is reviewed in, e.g., Agostinis, P. et al. (2011) CA Cancer J.
Clin. 61:250-281.
 [000130]        In other embodiments, the cancer therapy includes an inhibitor of a cancer
stem cell (also referred to herein as a "cancer initiating cell"), used in combination with the
AHCM, other cancer therapies and/or the microenvironment modulator, described herein.
Without wishing to be bound by theory, hypoxia and cancer drugs (including anti-angiogenic
drugs) and radiation therapy are believed to increase the number of cancer stem cells.
AHCM, alone or in combination with, e.g., an inhibitor of a cancer stem cell, can be used to
reduce the production of these stem cells. Exemplary inhibitors of cancer stem cells that can
be used in combination include, but are not limited to, hedgehog (e.g., SMO) antagonists; and
Wnt pathway antagonists (e.g., antibody, OMP-18R5). In one embodiment, the AHCM

and/or the microenvironment modulator, alone or in combination with one or more cancer
therapies described herein, are administered for cancer prevention (e.g., alone or in
combination with cancer-prevention agents), during periods of active disorder, or during a
period of remission or less active disorder. The AHCM and/or the microenvironment
modulator, alone or in combination with one or more cancer therapies described herein, can
be administered for cancer prevention, before treatment or prevention, concurrently with
treatment or prevention, post-treatment or prevention, or during remission of the disorder. In
one embodiment, the cancer therapy is administered simultaneously, sequentially, or a
combination of both,with the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator.
 [000131]         In one embodiment, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is
administered alone or in combination with cancer-prevention agents, e.g., to treat or prevent
cancer in high risk subjects (e.g., a subject with pre-neoplasia or a genetic pre-disposition for
cancer (e.g., a subject having a BRCA1 mutation); or a breast cancer patient treated with
tamoxifen).
 [000132]         In some embodiments, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator,
alone or in combination with the cancer therapy, is a first line treatment for the cancer, e.g., it
is used in a subject who has not been previously administered another drug intended to treat
the cancer.
 [000133]         In other embodiments, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator,
alone or in combination with the cancer therapy, is a second line treatment for the cancer,
e.g., it is used in a subject who has been previously administered another drug intended to
treat the cancer.
 [000134]         In other embodiments, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator,
alone or in combination with the cancer therapy, is a third, fourth, or greater than fourth, line
treatment for the cancer, e.g., it is used in a subject who has been previously administered
two, three, or more than three, other drugs intended to treat the cancer.
 [000135]         In other embodiments, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is
administered as adjunct therapy, e.g., a treatment in addition to a primary therapy.
 [000136]         In one embodiment, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is
administered as adjuvant therapy.
 [000137]         In other embodiments, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is
administered as neoadjuvant therapy.
 [000138]         In some embodiments, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is
administered to a subject prior to, or following surgical excision/removal of the cancer.

administered to a subject before, during, and/or after radiation treatment of the cancer.
 [000140]       In some embodiments, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is
administered to a subject, e.g., a cancer patient who will undergo, is undergoing or has
undergone cancer therapy (e.g., treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent, radiation therapy
and/or surgery).
 [000141]       In other embodiments, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is
administered prior to the cancer therapy. In other embodiments, the AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator is administered concurrently with the cancer therapy. In yet
other embodiments, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is administered prior
to the cancer therapy and concurrently with the cancer therapy. In instances of concurrent
administration, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator can continue to be
administered after the cancer therapy has ceased.
 [000142]       In other embodiments, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is
administered sequentially with the cancer therapy. For example, the AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator can be administered before initiating treatment with, or after
ceasing treatment with, the cancer therapy. In one embodiment, the administration of the
AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator overlaps with the cancer therapy, and
continues after the cancer therapy has ceased. In one embodiment, the AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator is administered concurrently, sequentially, or as a combination
of concurrent administration followed by monotherapy with either the cancer therapy, the
AHCM, and/or the microenvironment modulator.
 [000143]       In one embodiment, the method includes administering the AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator as a first therapeutic agent, followed by administration of a
cancer therapy (e.g., treatment with a second therapeutic agent, radiation therapy and/or
surgery). In another embodiment, the method includes administering a cancer therapy first
(e.g., treatment with a first therapeutic agent, radiation therapy and/or surgery), followed by
administering the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator as a second therapeutic
agent. In yet other embodiments, the method includes administering the AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator in combination with a second, third or more additional
therapeutic agents (e.g., anti-cancer agents as described herein).
 [000144]       The AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator and/or the anticancer
agent described herein can be administered to the subject systemically (e.g., orally,
parenterally, subcutaneously, intravenously, rectally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally,
intranasally, transdermally, or by inhalation or intracavitary installation). Typically, the
AHCMs are administered orally. In certain embodiments, the AHCM and/or the

microenvironment modulator and/or the anticancer agent are administered locally or
intratumorally (e.g., via an oncolytic virus).
 [000145]                In some embodiments, the AHCM is administered as a pharmaceutical
composition comprising one or more AHCMs, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
 [000146]        In an embodiment, the AHCM is administered, or is present in the
composition, e.g., the pharmaceutical composition (e.g., the same nanoparticle composition).
 [000147]        In other embodiments, the AHCM, the microenvironment modulator and/or
the cancer therapy are administered as separate compositions, e.g., pharmaceutical
compositions (e.g., nanoparticle compositions). In other embodiments, the AHCM, the
microenvironment modulator, and the cancer therapy are administered separately, but via the
same route (e.g., orally or intravenously). In some embodiments, the AHCM, the
microenvironment modulator, and the cancer therapy are administered by different routes
(e.g., AHCM is administered orally; the microenvironment modulator is administered
subcutaneoulsy; and a cancer therapeutic is administered intravenously). In still other
instances, the AHCM, the microenvironment modulator, and the cancer therapy are
administered in the same composition, e.g., pharmaceutical composition.
Evaluating or Monitoring the Subject
 [000148]        The methods of the invention can further include the step of evaluating, or
monitoring the subject, e.g., for one or more of: tumor size; the level or signaling of one or
more of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF$ 1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF),
thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), or an angiotensin receptor (e.g., angiotension-II type-i receptor;
ATIA receptor (ATIAR)); tumor collagen I levels; fibrotic content, interstitial pressure; a
plasma, serum or tissue biomarker, e.g., collagen I, collagen III, collagen IV, TGF$ 1, CTGF,
TSP-1; levels of one or more cancer markers; the rate of appearance of new lesions,
metabolism, hypoxia evolution; the appearance of new disease-related symptoms; the size of
tissue mass, e.g., a decreased or stabilization; quality of life, e.g., amount of disease
associated pain; histological analysis, lobular pattern, and/or the presence or absence of
mitotic cells; tumor aggressivity, vascularization of primary tumor, metastatic spread; tumor
size and location can be visualized using multimodal imaging techniques; or any other
parameter related to clinical outcome. The subject can be evaluated or monitored in one or
more of the following periods: prior to beginning of treatment; during the treatment; or after
one or more elements of the treatment have been administered. Monitoring can be used to
evaluate the need for further treatment with the same AHCM, alone or in combination with,

treatment with additional agents. Generally, a decrease in one or more of the parameters
described above is indicative of the improved condition of the subject.
 [000149]       In one embodiment, the method includes evaluating (e.g., detecting) the level
of an angiotensin receptor (e.g., angiotension-II type-i receptor; AT1A receptor (ATlAR) in
the subject, e.g., in a tumor from the subject. Detection of the angiotensin receptor in the
tumor from the subject indicates that the subject is likely to respond to the AHCM.
 [000150]       The methods of the invention can further include the step of analyzing a
nucleic acid or protein from the subject, e.g., analyzing the genotype of the subject. The
analysis can be used, e.g., to evaluate the suitability of, or to choose between alternative
treatments, e.g., a particular dosage, mode of delivery, time of delivery, inclusion of
adjunctive therapy, e.g., administration in combination with a second agent, or generally to
determine the subject's probable drug response phenotype or genotype. The nucleic acid or
protein can be analyzed at any stage of treatment, but preferably, prior to administration of
the AHCM and/or anti-cancer agent, to thereby determine appropriate dosage(s) and
treatment regimen(s) of the AHCM (e.g., amount per treatment or frequency of treatments)
for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of the subject.
Dosage Forms
 [000151]       In another aspect, the invention features a pharmaceutically acceptable
composition comprising, in a single dosage form, an AHCM and an anti-cancer agent, e.g., a
small molecule or a protein, e.g., an antibody. In another embodiment, one or both of the
AHCM and the anti-cancer agent are provided in a nanoparticle. The AHCM and anti-cancer
agent can be in separate or the same entity. For example, if provided as separate entities the
AHCM can be provided as a first nanoparticle and the anti-cancer agent provided as a second
nanoparticle (e.g., where the second nanoparticle has a structural property (e.g., size or
composition) or a functional property (e.g., release kinetics or a pharmacodynamic property)
that differs from the first nanoparticle). Alternatively, an AHCM and an anti-cancer agent
can be provided on the same entity, e.g., in the same nanoparticle.
 [000152]       In another aspect, the invention features a pharmaceutically acceptable
composition (e.g., nanoparticle) comprising an AHCM, e.g., an AHCM described herein. In
one embodiment, the AHCM is in a dosage described herein, e.g., a standard of care dosage
form, a sub-anti-hypertensive dosage form, or a greater than a standard of care dosage form.
 [000153]       In one embodiment, the AHCM is formulated in a dosage form that is
according to the standard of care anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure dosage form, e.g., a
standard of care dosage form as described herein.

 [000154]        In certain embodiments, the AHCM is formulated in a dosage form that is less
than the standard of care anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure dosage form (e.g., a dosage
form that is less than 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.15, 0.16, 0.2,
0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7-fold, that of the standard of care dosage form, e.g., a standard of care
dosage from as described herein).
 [000155]        In other embodiments, the AHCM is formulated in a dosage form that is
greater than the standard of care anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure dosage form (e.g., a
dosage form that is greater than 1.1, 1.5, 1.7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10-fold or higher, that of the standard
of care dosage form, e.g., a standard of care dosage from as described herein).
 [000156]        In another aspect, the invention features a pharmaceutically acceptable
composition comprising an anti-cancer agent, e.g., an anti-cancer agent described herein, as a
nanoparticle, e.g., a nanoparticle configured for a method described herein.
 [000157]        In another aspect, the invention features a therapeutic kit that includes the
AHCM, alone or in combination with a therapy, e.g., an anti-cancer agent, described herein,
and optionally, instructions for use, e.g., for the treatment of cancer. In an embodiment, the
kit comprises one or more dosage for or pharmaceutical preparation or nanoparticle described
herein

tissue, e.g., a cancer, or optimizing delivery to a target tissue, e.g., a cancer, of an agent, e.g.,
a systemically administered agent, e.g., a diagnostic or imaging agent. The method
comprises:
                 administering an anti-hypertensive and/or a collagen modifying agent
("AHCM") to the subject; and
                 optionally, administering an agent, e.g., a diagnostic or imaging agent to said

 WO 2013/169739                                                                  PCT/US2013/039901
administration is initiated prior to administration of the agent, e.g., for at least one, two, three,
or five days, or one, two, three, four, five or more weeks prior to administration of the agent.
 [000160]       In an embodiment, the AHCM is administered in an amount sufficient to alter
(e.g., enhance) the distribution or efficacy of the agent. In one embodiment, the AHCM is
administered in an amount sufficient to alter (e.g., enhance) the distribution or efficacy of the
agent, but in an amount insufficient to inhibit or prevent tumor growth or progression by
itself.
 [000161]       In an embodiment, the AHCM is administered at a dose that causes one or
more of the following: a decrease in the level or production of collagen, a decrease in tumor
fibrosis, an increase in interstitial tumor transport, improvement of tumor perfusion, or
enhanced penetration or diffusion, of the cancer therapeutic in a tumor or tumor vasculature,
in the subject.
 [000162]       In an embodiment, the subject is further treated with a cancer therapy, e.g., as
therapy as described herein.
 [000163]       In an embodiment, the subject is a human, or a non-human animal, e.g., a
mouse, a rat, a non-human primate, horse, or cow.
 [000164]       In another aspect, the invention features a diagnostic kit that includes the
AHCM, alone or in combination with the agent, e.g., a diagnostic or imaging agent, described
herein, and optionally, instructions for use, e.g., for the diagnosis of cancer.
Screening Assays
 [000165]       In another aspect, the invention features a method, or assay for, identifying an
AHCM. The method, or assay, includes providing a cancer or a cancer-associated cell (e.g., a
culture of a carcinoma associated fibroblast cell); contacting said cancer or a cancer
associated cell with a candidate agent; detecting a change in the cancer cell in the presence, or
absence, of the candidate agent. In one embodiment, the detected change includes one or
more of an increase or decrease of TGF1 level, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)
level, or collagen (e.g., collagen 1) level. In one embodiment, the candidate agent is chosen
from one or more of: an antagonist of renin angiotensin aldosterone system ("RAAS
antagonist"), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, an angiotensin II receptor
blocker (AT 1 blocker), a thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) inhibitor, a transforming growth factor
beta 1 (TGF-p31) inhibitor, and a connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) inhibitor. A
suitable candidate agent reduces one or more of TGF$ 1 level (e.g., total and/or activated
TGF$ 1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) level, or collagen level.
 [000166]       The method, or assay, can further include the step of comparing the treated
                                                  33

methods or assays to a reference value, e.g., a value obtained in the absence of the candidate
agent, or by addition of a control agent, e.g., a positive agent (e.g., losartan), or a negative
agent (e.g., saline control), and comparing the difference between the treated and control
methods.
 [000167]        The method, or assay, can be performed in vitro, in vivo, or a combination of
both. In one embodiment, the method, or assay, includes: evaluating the candidate agent in
vitro, e.g., using a culture of carcinoma associated cells. In such embodiments, the candidate
agent is added to the culture medium; and the condition medium is analyzed for an increase
or decrease of TGF1 level, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) level, or collagen level.
 [000168]        In another embodiment, the candidate agent is administered to a subject, e.g.,
an animal model, e.g., an animal tumor model. In such embodiments, the candidate agent is
administered to the subject under suitable conditions; and the subject is analyzed for an
increase or decrease of TGF$1I level, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) level, or
collagen level. In one embodiment, the levels of these parameters are analyzed as described
in the appended Examples.
 [000169]        In yet other embodiments, candidate agents evaluated using the in vitro assays
are tested in vivo.
 [000170]        In another aspect, the invention features a composition for use, or the use, of a
AHCM agent, alone or in combination with an anti-cancer agent described herein for the
treatment of a cancer or tumor described herein.

                         BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
 [000174]        Fig. 1 is a panel a bar graphs depicting the effects of losartan (10 pimol/L) in
total and active TGF$ levels, and collagen I synthesis by carcinoma associated fibroblasts
(CAFs) in vitro.
 [000175]        Figs. 2A-2B shows the effects of Losartan on collagen production in tumors.
 [000176]        Fig. 2A shows a panel of photographs showing a dose-dependent reduction in
                                                 34

 WO 2013/169739                                                                PCT/US2013/039901
collagen levels assessed by SHG imaging in losartan-treated HSTS26T tumors, as compared
to the control, over a period of two weeks, (10, 20 and 60mg/kg/day). Scale bar = 200 pLm.
 [000177]        Fig. 2B shows a dose response curve of the effect of losartan doses of 10, 20
and 60 mg/kg/day in decreasing the SHG levels by 20, 33 and 67%, respectively, at the end
of 15 days, indicating a dose-dependent reduction in collagen levels in Losartan-treated
tumors. There was a statistically significant difference (*) between the control group and the
two higher doses (20 and 60mg/kg/day). There was also a statistically significant difference
(t) between the 20 and 60 mg/kg/day groups.
 [000178]        Fig. 3 is a bar graph showing a dose response of losartan vs. collagen content
in HSTS26T tumors. Losartan treatment at 20 and 60 mg/kg/day led to 42% and 63%
reduction in collagen I staining respectively. The staining in each treatment group was
compared to a control group that received saline.
 [000179]        Fig. 4 is a bar graph showing the effect of losartan in decreasing the mean
arterial blood pressure (MABP) in mice in a dose-dependent manner. Although 20mg/kg/day
decreased MABP by 10 mm Hg (*p<0.04), the MABP remained within the normal range for
SCID mice (70mmHg - 95mmHg)(13). Conversely, when animals were treated with
60mg/kg/day, the 35 mm Hg (**p<0.04) drop in MABP was lower than the normal range
MABP in SCID mice.
 [000180]        Figs. 5A-5D shows the effects of Losartan in collagen levels in tumors.
 [000181]        Fig. 5A shows the results of Collagen-I and nuclei immunostaining in tumor
sections in L3.6pl and MMTV control and losartan (20mg/kg/day) treated tumors. Scale bar        =
 100 pm. Losartan treatement (e.g., at 20 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced the collagen levels
in the treated tumors.
 [000182]        Fig. 5B is a bar graph summarizing the effects after two weeks losartan
treatment at 20mg/kg/day; losartan treatment significantly reduced the collagen I
immunostaining in L3.6pl (p< 0.03) and FVB MMTV PyVT by 50% (p<0.05) and 47%
(p<0.05), respectively.
 [000183]        Fig. 5C is a panel of photographs showing collagen-I and nuclei
immunostaining in tumor sections in HSTS26T and Mu89 control and losartan
(20mg/kg/day) treated tumors. Note that there is no detectable reduction in collagen I
immunostaining at 200pnm from the edge of HSTS26T tumors. This phenomenon is less
obvious in treated Mu89 tumors where there is some persistent staining both at the edge and
in central tumor areas. Scale bar = 100 pm.
 [000184]        Fig. 5D is a bar graph summarizing the effects of Losartan in significantly
reducing the collagen-I immunostaining in HSTS26T and Mu89 by 44% (p<0.02) and 20%
                                                 35

 WO 2013/169739                                                                PCT/US2013/039901
(p<0.05), respectively.
 [000185]        Fig. 6 is a panel of bar graphs showing the effects of losartan on TSP-1, active
and total TGF-p31, and collagen I in HSTS26T tumors. Treated animals received losartan (15
mg/kg/day) in drinking water. Tumors were excised after two weeks of treatment,
homogenized and analyzed for total and activated TGF-PlI levels by ELISA. Note a 3.5 fold
reduction in TSP-1, a 4 fold reduction in active TGF-plI and a two fold reduction in collagen
 1 after losartan treatment (p<0.05).
 [000186]        Fig. 7A shows the effects of losartan in decreasing tumor TSP-I
immunostaining in both MU89 and HSTS26T tumors. In HSTS26T tumors, the changes in
TSP-I after losartan treatment correspond with changes in collagen I immunostaining; TSP-I
levels decrease in the tumor center but remain high within a 200 pim from the edge of the
tumor. The TSP-I margin was larger (500 pim from the edge) in MU89 tumors. Scale bar          =
 100 pm.
 [000187]        Fig. 7B is a bar graph summarizing the effects of losartan treatment in
significantly reducing the TSP-I immununostaining in HSTS26T and MU89 tumors by 730%
(p<0.04 ) and 24% (p<0.0 3 ), respectively.
 [000188]        Figs. 8A-8C shows the effects of: Losartan in increasing the delivery of
nanoparticles and nanotherapeutics.
 [000189]        Fig. 8A shows two photograhs (control and losartan) and a bar graph
summarizing the distribution of intratumorally (i.t.) injected 100 nm diameter nanoparticles
in HSTS26T tumors. Losartan significantly increased (p<0.001) the distribution of i.t.
injected nanoparticles in both tumor types (1.5 fold in HSTS26T and 4 fold in Mu89). An
analysis of the distribution pattern shows control tumors with fewer intratumoral
nanoparticles and a majority of nanoparticles that backtracked out of the needle track and
accumulated at the tumor surface. In contrast, treated tumors have a significant number of
intratumoral nanoparticles. Scale bar = 100 pm.
 [000190]        Fig. 8B shows two photograhs (control and losartan) and a bar graph
summarizing the distribution of viral infection 24 hrs after the intratumoral injection of HSV
expressing the green fluorescent protein. HSV infection in control tumors is limited to the
cells in close proximity to the injection site whereas losartan treated tumors have a more
extensive spread of HSV infection within the tumors. Scale bar = Imm. Losartan
significantly increased (p<0.05) the virus spread in HSTS26T and Mu89 tumors.
 [000191]        Fig. 8C shows two photograhs (control and losartan) and a bar graph
summarizing the distribution of intravenously (i.v.) injected I00nm diameter nanoparticles in
L3.6pl tumors. The nanoparticles are localized around perfused vessels. There is a two-fold
                                                  36

 WO 2013/169739                                                                 PCT/US2013/039901
increase (p<0.05) in nanoparticle content in losartan-treated tumors compared to control
tumors. Scale bar = 100 pm.
 [000192]        Fig. 9 is a bar graph showing the changes in diffusion coefficient in HSTS26T
tumors after losartan treatment. The diffusion coefficient of IgG was measured in HSTS26T
tumors implanted in the dorsal window chamber of SCID mice. Treated animals received (40
mg/kg/day) losartan by i.p. injection while control animals received saline. The results show
a significant increase (p<0.04) in diffusion coefficient as measured by multiphoton
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP).
 [000193]        Fig. 10 is a representative distribution profile depicting fractions of injected
nanospheres present as a function of the distance from a tumor vessel (penetration depth).
The nanosphere penetration depth was analyzed in frozen sections from tumors resected 24
hrs after the intravenous nanosphere injection. The mean characteristic penetration length
increased from 18±5gm (mean±SE) in control to 37± 6 gm in losartan-treated tumors. Ten
areas per tumor were analyzed in 6 control and 6 treated tumors.
 [000194]        Fig. 11A-11D shows the effects of Losartan in significantly delaying the
growth of tumors treated with DOXIL@ or HSV.
 [000195]        Figs. 11A-11B shows linear graphs of the results from mice bearing HSTS26T
(A) and Mu89 (B) tumors treated for 2 weeks with either losartan or saline prior to the i.t.
injection of HSV. Losartan alone did not affect the growth of Mu89 or HSTS26T tumors. The
growth delay was significantly longer in HSTS26T tumors treated with losartan and HSV
compared to tumors treated with HSV alone. The i.t. injection of HSV did not delay the
growth of Mu89 tumors, but the combined losartan and HSV treatment significantly retarded
the growth of Mu89 tumors.
 [000196]        Fig. 11C shows the effect in tumor volume in mice that received losartan
treatment prior to i.v. DOXIL@ infusion (losartan and DOXIL@) have smaller tumors than
those that received DOXIL@ alone (DOXIL@ alone) in L3.6pl tumors. Note that there is no
difference in tumor size between saline and losartan-treated mice.
 [000197]        Fig. 11D is an image showing a clear difference in size between control
tumors (left column) and losartan treated tumors (right column) at 1 week after DOXIL@
infusion. Scale bar = 1cm. The losartan treated tumors (right column) were smaller than the
control tumors (left column) at 1 week after DOXIL@ infusion.
 [000198]        Figs. 12A-12B shows the relationship between the collagen structure and the
virus infection and necrosis.
 [000199]        In Fig. 12A, Mu89 tumors collagen bundles are seen around the tumor margin.
Occasionally, these bundles project into the tumor (black arrows) and divide the tumor into
                                                  37

 WO 2013/169739                                                               PCT/US2013/039901
separate compartments. These compartments seem to confine movement of HSV; evident
from the containment of the necrotic region within the region bounded by collagen bundles.
When these tumors were treated with losartan the collagen bundles at the margins of the
tumor remained intact but the projections became less organized (insert). This presumably
allowed virus propagation and necrosis to extend across the boundaries. Scale bar = 100 pim.
 [000200]        In Fig. 12B, HSTS26T, the dense mesh-like collagen network confined virus
infection to the immediate area surrounding the injection point. With losartan treatment, there
was a reduction in the density of the network that presumably allowed virus particles to infect
a larger area and thus more tumor cells. Arrows indicate viable and virus infected cells,
respectively. Scale bar = 10 pim.
 [000201]        Figs. 13A-13B shows a schematic of virus distribution and infection in Mu89
(A) and HSTS26T (B) tumors. The schematics show how the different collagen network
structures affect virus propagation and distribution. The collagen fibers (1) restrict the
movement of virus particles (round spheres, 2) and the infection (3) of non-infected (4)
cancer cells.
 [000202]        In Fig. 13A, Mu89 tumors, collagen bundles divide the tumor into isolated
regions that cannot be traversed by virus particles. Losartan treatment destabilizes the
collagen bundles and allows virus particles to move from one region to another.
 [000203]        In Fig. 13B, HSTS26T tumors, the collagen structure is a mesh-like sieve.
Virus particles can still propagate through the sieve but do not extend very far from the
injection site. Losartan treatment significantly destabilizes the mesh structure in the internal
regions of the tumor and allows the virus to propagate and infect a larger area.
 [000204]        Fig. 14A shows virus infection (HSV immunostaining) and necrosis 21 days
after HSV injection in HSTS26T and MU89. Hematoxylin staining of intact tumor areas,
necrosis, and HSV immunostaining is shown. Necrotic regions are indicated by black
arrows. Even though there was no detectable difference in necrotic area between HSTS26T
and MU89, necrosis is confined to specific regions in MU89 while there is necrotic tissue
(bounded by HSV immunostaining) throughout HSTS26T tumors. Scale bar = 2 mm.
 [000205]        Fig. 14B is a bar graph showing that there is a two-fold increase (p<0.05) in
necrosis in tumors (both HSTS26T and MU89) that received losartan prior to HSV injection.
 [000206]        Fig. 15 shows the in vivo proliferation rates for HSTS26T and MU89 after
losartan treatment. Tumors were resected and stained for Ki67 to assess proliferation rates.
There was no statistically significant difference in positive Ki67 staining after losartan

 [000207]       Fig. 16 shows the results of PCR analysis of AGTR1 expression in CAF,
MU89 and HSTS26T cells. MU89 cells and CAF express AGTR1 while HSTS26T cells do
not. HUVECs were used as a positive control. GAPDH levels revealed that all three samples
had roughly the same amount of cDNA.
 [000208]       Figs. 17A-17D shows the effects of angiotensin blockade with AT 1 blockers
or ACE inhibitors in normalizing the tumor microenvironment. Studies with an ARB,
losartan, are shown. Angiotensin blockade (A) diminishes interstitial matrix density in
mammary (MMTV) and pancreatic (L3.6PL) tumors in mice, (B) reducing compressive
stress in mammary (E0771) and pancreatic (Pan-02) tumors. (C) This increases the fraction
of perfused vessels (arrows) in tumors (E0771 shown), resulting in (D) a normalized vascular
network (E0771 shown) that is more efficient and effective at drug and oxygen delivery.
 [000209]       Figs. 18A-18D shows the effects of angiotensin blockade with AT 1 blockers
or ACE inhibitors in improving drug transport and distribution in tumors. Studies with an
ARB, losartan, are shown here. Through tumor normalization, angiotensin blockade (A)
improves tumor oxygenation (E0771 shown) through enhanced perfusion while (B) making
blood vessels deliver drugs more rapidly. Reorganization of the interstitial matrix also (C)
improves penetration of nanoparticles in desmoplastic tumors (L3.6PL shown) (D).
 [000210]       Figs. 19A-19E shows the effect of angiotensin blockade with AT 1 blockers or
ACE inhibitors in improving the effectiveness of cancer therapy. Studies with an ARB,
losartan, are shown. Angiotensin blockade, given in combination with chemotherapy (A)
improves the effectiveness of the low MW chemotherapeutic doxorubicin in breast cancer
models, (B) slowing tumor growth and (C) increasing animal survival (E0771 shown).
Similarly, angiotensin blockade (D, E) improves the effectiveness of the nanoparticle
DOXIL@ in pancreatic tumors (L3.6PL shown), e.g., by decreasing the tumor weight (D)
and/or tumor size or volume (E).
 [000211]       Figs. 20A-20B shows the compression of tumor blood vessels in human breast
cancer. Biopsies of tumors from breast ductal adenocarcinoma patients were stained for
CD3 1-positive vessels. Unbridled cell proliferation in the confined microenvironment of
these tumor and stromal cells results in vessel compression in the stroma (A) and within
tumor nodes (B). All vessels appear to be compressed to some degree, with many completely
collapsed.
 [000212]       Figs. 21A-21D are histology images of mouse tumors showing collagen I
(blue), CD3 1-positive vessels (red), and lectin-positive vessels (green), with CD31-lectin co

In Figs. 21A-21D, angiotensin inhibitors improve perfusion of tumor blood vessels. Control
E0771 breast tumors (A) are dense with collagen I and vessels, yet only a small fraction of
these vessels are perfused. Control AK4.4 pancreatic tumors (C have higher collagen I levels
and a lower vessel density, with vessels that are also poorly perfused. Losartan improves
perfusion in E0771 (B) and AK4.4 (D) by decreasing collagen I levels, without anti
angiogenic effects. Scale bar, 100gm.
 [000213]       Figs. 22A-22D are bar graphs showing that angiotensin inhibitors improve
vascular perfusion.
 [000214]       In Fig. 22A, the perfused vessel fractions, measured by histology with lectin
and CD31 co-staining after angiotensin inhibition using losartan, are shown. Following lectin
injection and animal sacrifice, perfusion was quantified as the fraction of vessels that are both
lectin- and CD3 1-positive out of all CD3 1-positive vessels. Losartan increases the fraction of
vessels that are perfused in orthotopic E0771 breast (P=0.038, Student's t-test) and AK4.4
pancreatic (P=0.039, Student's t-test) tumors.
 [000215]       In Fig. 22B, the CD3 1-positive vessel diameter, measured using histology
after angiotensin inhibition with losartan, is shown. Losartan also increases vessel diameter
in E0771 tumors (P=0.047, Student's t-test), indicating decompression as the mechanism.
 [000216]       In Figs. 22C-22D, the CD3 1-positive vessel density, measured using histology
following angiotensin inhibition using losartan, is shown. Losartan does not affect vessel
density, as quantified by the vessel number density (C) and the total vessel length (D),
indicating no anti-angiogenic effect at this 40mg/kg dose. Animal number n=7-9 for all
groups.
 [000217]       Fig. 23 is a bar graph showing that angiotensin inhibitors do not decrease
blood pressure at certain doses. Mean arterial blood pressure measured by coronary artery
cannulation in mice bearing AK4.4 pancreatic tumors. Losartan and lisinopril treatment at a
40mg/kg dose does not lower blood pressure in these tumor-bearing mice. Overall, blood
pressure in these diseased mice is lower than in healthy FVB mice (-90mmHg).
 [000218]       Figs. 24A-24D show the effect of angiotensin inhibitors on decompressing
vessels by reducing solid stress.
 [000219]       In Figs. 24A-24B, the tumor matrix levels following angiotensin inhibition
with losartan are shown. Losartan decreases matrix production, quantified by collagen I area
fraction (A), in orthotopic E0771 breast (P=0.043, Student's t-test) and AK4.4 pancreatic
(P=0.018, Student's t-test) tumors. Losartan also reduces the concentration of collagen I (B)
in E0771 (P=0.048,Student's t-test) and AK4.4 (P=0.050, Student's t-test) tumors,
confirming a reduction in matrix levels.

 [000221]        In Fig. 24D, the solid stress levels in tumors after angiotensin inhibition using
losartan are shown. Solid stress was assessed using an ex vivo technique involving the
measurement of the extent of tumor tissue relaxation (tumor opening relative to tumor
diameter) following a stress-releasing incision, with larger openings indicating higher stress.
Through its anti-matrix effects, losartan reduces solid stress in E0771 (P=0.049, Student's t
test) and AK4.4 (P=0.043, Student's t-test). Animal numbers n=5-7 (E0771 collagen), n=4-6

 [000222]        Fig. 25 is a bar graph showing that angiotensin inhibitors decrease stress in
multiple tumor models. Solid stress levels in tumors after angiotensin inhibition using
losartan are shown. Through its anti-matrix effects, losartan reduces solid stress in 4T1
breast tumors (P=0.036, Student's t-test) and Pan-02 pancreatic tumors (P=0.0092, Student's
t-test). Animal numbers n=10- 11 (4T1 stress), n=4-8 (Pan-02 stress).
 [000223]        Figs. 26A-26B are bar graphs showing that the ACE-I lisinopril decreases
matrix levels and solid stress.
 [000224]        In Fig. 26A, the tumor matrix levels following angiotensin inhibition with
lisinopril are shown. Lisinopril decreases matrix production, quantified by collagen I area
fraction in orthotopic E0771 breast (P=0.048, Student's t-test) and AK4.4 pancreatic
(P=0.031, Student's t-test) tumors.
 [000225]        In Fig. 26B, the solid stress levels in tumors after angiotensin inhibition using
lisinopril are shown. Through its anti-matrix effects, lisinopril reduces solid stress in E0771
(P=0.050, Student's t-test). Animal numbers n=6 (E0771 collagen), n=4 (AK4.4 collagen),

Solid stress levels in tumors after angiotensin inhibition using the ARBs losartan,
candesartan, and valsartan are shown. Doses were chosen based on their relative doses in
patients for hypertension indications (40mg/kg losartan, 3.2mg/kg candesartan, 32mg/kg
valsartan). Losartan (P=0.0069, Student's t-test) candesartan (P=0.0091, Student's t-test),
and valsartan (P=0.0091, Student's t-test) all reduce solid stress to a similar degree. Animal
numbers n=6-7. Statistical tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm
Bonferroni method.

 [000227]       Figs. 28A-28B are bar graphs showing that angiotensin inhibitors result in a
normalized network of perfused vessels. Mathematical analysis of perfused vessel network
efficiency for delivery was conducted. Perfused vessel networks of E0771 tumors were
imaged in three dimensions using multiphoton microscopy pre- and post-treatment (days 2
5). Analysis of the distance from each point in the tumor to the nearest perfused vessel (A)
indicates that losartan decreases the maximum distance drugs and oxygen must travel to
reach tumor cells. Fractal analysis of vessel network structure (B) shows that losartan
increases the fractal dimension from a typical 1.89 in tumors toward the usual 2.0 of normal
capillary beds. Together, these data suggest that increasing perfusion with angiotensin
inhibitors leads to a more normal vascular network structure.
 [000228]       Figs. 29A-29E are graphs showing that angiotensin inhibitors increase drug
and oxygen delivery.
 [000229]       Fig. 29A shows small-molecule drug delivery to tumors and various organs
after angiotensin inhibition with losartan. Losartan increases the accumulation of the small
molecule chemotherapeutic 5-FU in AK4.4 pancreatic tumors by 74% (P=0.0063, Student's
t-test) while not affecting accumulation in the normal organs.
 [000230]       Figs. 29B-29C show oxygen delivery to tumors measured by phosphorescence
quenching microscopy during angiotensin inhibition using losartan. Losartan maintains the
level of oxygenation (B) in the tissue, versus control tumors that become progressively more
hypoxic with time (P=0.030, Student's t-test). Losartan increases oxygenation in some
tumors (C), whereas all control tumors decrease in oxygen levels. Losartan also appears to
result in a more homogenous distribution of well-oxygenated tumor tissue. Scale bar, 100
gim.
 [000231]       Fig. 29D shows the hypoxic fraction in tumors measured by pimonidazole
injection and staining following angiotensin inhibition with losartan. Losartan decreases the
hypoxic fraction in E0771 tumors (P=0.027, Student's t-test) due to the increase in oxygen
delivery.
 [000232]       Fig. 29E shows the penetration rates for nanoparticles after angiotensin
inhibition with losartan. Penetration rates are quantified as effective permeability, which is
the transvascular mass flux per unit vascular surface area and transvascular concentration
difference. Closed symbols (top) denote averages by mouse, while open symbols (bottom)
are individual tumors. Losartan enhances nanoparticle delivery in a largely size-independent
manner, improving the penetration of 12nm (P=0.039, Student's t-test), 60nm (P=0.013,
Student's t-test), and 125nm (P=0.022,Student's t-test) nanoparticles. Animal numbers n=4

(yellow) denoting perfused vessels. Representative stainings were shown by arrows. Control
E0771 breast tumors (A) show pronounced hypoxia away from the few vessels that are
perfused. Losartan improves perfusion, reducing hypoxia (B). Scale bar, 100gm.
 [000234]       Fig. 31 is a bar graph showing that angiotensin inhibitors increase fluid flow
in tumors. Interstitial hydraulic conductivity was measured by the flow rate of media through
freshly excised tumor tissue. Losartan increases fluid flow through E0771 breast tumors,
demonstrating a large increase in the interstitial hydraulic conductivity (P=0.035, Student's t
test). Animal number n=6.
 [000235]       Fig. 32 is a line graph showing that increasing fluid flow in tumors can
improve nanoparticle penetration. Predictions of physiologically-based mathematical model
of how modulating interstitial hydraulic conductivity can improve nanoparticle penetration
are shown. Increasing interstitial hydraulic conductivity results in more rapid penetration
rates (effective permeability) for all sizes of nanoparticles by allowing for more rapid fluid
flow driven by the difference in the microvascular pressure and the interstitial fluid pressure
at the tumor margin.
 [000236]       Fig. 33 is a bar graph showing that angiotensin inhibitors synergistically
enhance chemotherapy effectiveness. Volumes of orthotopic AK4.4 pancreatic tumors on
day 7 in response to treatment with losartan or saline control (40mg/kg daily from day 0-7) in
combination with either the small-molecule chemotherapeutic 5-FU or saline control
(60mg/kg on days 2 and 6) are shown. 5-FU and losartan monotherapy induce no significant
growth delay versus the control treatment, whereas their combination greatly inhibited tumor
growth (P=0.0085, Student's t-test). Animal number n=5-6 for all groups. Statistical tests
were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Bonferroni method.
 [000237]       Fig. 34 is a survival curve showing that angiotensin inhibitors do not decrease
survival. Animal survival following tumor implantation, with initiation of treatment with
losartan on day 11, is whon. Losartan monotherapy does not affect survival versus saline.

 [000240]        In Fig. 35B, the quantification of tumor growth rates, based on the time to
reach double the initial volume, is shown. Doxorubicin and losartan monotherapy induce no
significant growth delay versus the control treatment in these aggressive tumors. In contrast,
their combination greatly limits tumor growth (P=0.024,Student's t-test).
 [000241]        In Fig. 35C, the animal survival following the initiation of treatment is shown.
Doxorubicin monotherapy improves survival versus the control (P=0.045, log-rank test),
while the combination of doxorubicin and losartan enhances this survival increase versus
doxorubicin monotherapy (P=0.050, log-rank test). Animal number n=6-7 for all groups.

(P=0.049,Student's t-test), while not improving delivery for larger nanoparticles.
Normalization also reduces the flux of large nanoparticles to zero in several individual

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 [000249]        The invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that anti-hypertensive
and/or collagen-modifying (AHCM) agents (including angiotensin inhibitors, e.g.,
angiotensin receptor blockers (e.g., losartan) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACE-I) improve the delivery and efficacy of cancer therapeutics.
 [000250]        The abnormal matrix of tumors limits the delivery of nano-therapeutics in
many types of cancer, e.g., pancreatic, breast, lung, colorectal. The overgrowth of fibrous
tissue impedes the movement of nanotherapeutics in tumors two mechanisms - viscoelastic
and steric hindrances. Fibrous tissue is highly viscoelastic, meaning it is quite thick and stiff,
and therefore slows the movement of these drugs to a small fraction of their typical speed.
This tissue is basically an extremely dense mesh, with small pores that are about the same
size as nanotherapeutics, thus it does not allow much space for these drugs and often halts
their movements by confining them close to blood vessels (in case of intravenous injection)
or near the site of injection (in case of intra-tumor injection). This barrier is found in all solid
tumors, with possible exception of brain tumors, though it is most prominent in pancreatic,
breast, lung, and colorectal cancers. Nanotherapeutics, owing to their large size relative to
the pores that form the tumor microenvironment, are especially hindered by fibrous tissue.
 [000251]        In certain embodiments disclosed herein, administration of losartan prevents
the production of matrix molecules like collagen, which are a component of the dense mesh
of fibrous tissue. Without being bound by theory, losartan is believed to act on fibroblasts and
tumor cells by inhibiting the TGF-beta and CTGF pathways, thus limiting their pro-fibrotic
activity. It does so by blocking the activity of the angiotensin-JI type-I receptor (AT1), which
is highly expressed on both fibroblasts and tumor cells in a variety of cancers. Thus losartan
blocks activity downstream of ATI in various signaling pathways, including the activation of
TGF-beta and CTGF. Since these two pathways promote the production of collagen and other
components of fibrotic tissue, blocking them will allow the fibrosis to subside. The result is
tissue that is much more like the normal surrounding organ, and is therefore easier to
                                                  45

 WO 2013/169739                                                                 PCT/US2013/039901
penetrate.
 [000252]        Treatment with losartan is shown herein to significantly reduce collagen levels
- a marker of fibrosis - in several types of tumors, including pancreatic, breast, skin, and soft
tissue tumors. Furthermore, reduction in fibrosis leads to improved mobility of
nanotherapeutics in tumors, allowing them to penetrate tumors more easily, and allows these
drugs to distribute more widely throughout tumors, making them more effective at fighting
tumor growth. Hence, losartan makes nanotherapeutics more effective against cancer.
 [000253]        In embodiments, it has been discovered that losartan normalizes the collagen,
interstitial matrix of several solid tumors, thus facilitating the penetration of
chemotherapeutics, such as large molecular weight (e.g., nano-) chemotherapeutics. For
example, losartan reduced collagen I levels in carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
isolated from breast cancer biopsies, and caused a dose-dependent reduction in stromal
collagen in desmoplastic models of human breast, pancreatic and skin tumors in mice.
Losartan also improved the distribution, therapeutic efficacy and/or penetration of
nanopartices (e.g., oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (HSV) and pegylated liposomal
doxorubicin (DOXIL*)).
 [000254]        Low molecular weight therapeutics, which are much smaller than
nanotherapeutics, are not as limited by the interstitial matrix barriers, but are similarly
affected by other barriers such as abnormal and collapsed blood vessels.
 [000255]        In other embodiments, losartan is shown to facilitate decompression of blood
vessels, thus improving tumor perfusion and delivery of low molecular weight
chemotherapeutics, thus facilitating radiation and chemotherapeutic delivery through vascular
normalization.
 [000256]        Thus, these agents improve delivery of molecules as small as oxygen - a
radiation and chemo sensitizer - through vascular normalization (Figs. 18A-18B), while also
enhancing the penetration of larger agents through interstitial matrix normalization (Fig. 18C,
18D). Through this repair of the entire tumor microenvironment, these agents enhance the
effectiveness of low molecular weight chemotherapeutics, as well as nanotherapeutics in
breast and pancreatic cancer models - leading to reduced tumor growth and longer animal
survival (Figs. 19A-19E).
 [000257]        Further examples disclosed herein demonstrate a reduction in collagen levels
and tumor solid stress using angiotensin inhibitors (other than losartan), including, for
example, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as candesartan and valsartan, as well as
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), such as lisinopril (see e.g., Figs. 26-27).
 [000258]        Therefore, angiotensin inhibitors (e.g., angiotensin receptor blockers) and

ACE inhibitors can enhance the delivery of a therapy, and thus have broad applicability for
combination therapy with all classes of anti-cancer agents, including low molecular weight,
small-molecule chemotherapeutics, biologics, nucleic acid agents and nanoparticle therapies.
 [000259]       The AHCM described herein (e.g., angiotensin inhibitors, such as angiotensin
receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors) can be used in combination with a microenvironment
modulator to enhance penetration and/or diffusion, of a cancer therapy in a tumor or tumor
vasculature, in a subject. Such combination may cause one or more of: reduce solid stress
(e.g., growth-induced solid stress in tumors); decrease tumor fibrosis; reduce interstitial
hypertension or interstitial fluid pressure (IFP); increase interstitial tumor transport; increase
tumor or vessel perfusion; increase vascular diameters and/or enlarge compressed or
collapsed blood vessels; reduce or deplete one or more of: cancer cells, or stromal cells (e.g.,
tumor associated fibroblasts or immune cells); decrease the level or production of
extracellular matrix components, such as fibers (e.g., collagen, procollagen), and/or
polysaccharides (e.g., glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid); decrease
the level or production of collagen or procollagen; decreases the level or production of
hyaluronic acid; increases tumor oxygenation; decreases tumor hypoxia; decreases tumor
acidosis; enable immune cell infiltration; decreases immunosuppression; increases antitumor
immunity; or decreases cancer stem cells, thereby enhancing the penetration and/or
distribution of the cancer therapy.
 [000260]       Exemplary microenvironment modulators are disclosed herein, and include,
but are not limited to, an anti-angiogenic therapy, for example, an inhibitor of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway; an agent that decreases the level or production of
hyaluronic acid; an inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway; an agent that improves drug
penetration in tumors (e.g., a disulfide-based cyclic RGD peptide peptide (iRGD) or an
analogue thereof); a taxane therapy (e.g., taxane-induced apoptosis); an agent that decreases
the level or production of collagen or procollagen; and/or a profibrotic pathway inhibitor as
described herein.
 [000261]       Angiotensin blockers offer numerous advantages over other approaches,
including anti-angiogenic therapies, anti-collagen agents and other matrix modifiers. For
example, anti-angiogenic therapies normalize the vasculature alone and have been approved
for only a limited number of indications. Meanwhile, ARBs and ACE-Is are FDA-approved
as anti-hypertensives with manageable adverse effects. Morover, anti-angiogenics, which are
FDA-approved adjuncts that enhance drug delivery to tumors, tend not to improve the
delivery for larger particles as they can reduce the size of "pores" in vessel walls. More
specifically, vascular normalization with anti-angiogenic therapies can typically enhance the
                                                 47

delivery and effectiveness of small therapeutics, including small molecule
chemotherapeutics, biologics and small nanoparticles (e.g., in the range of 1-12 nm), while
not substantially affecting the delivery of larger therapeutics (e.g., about 50 mn to about 100
m, e.g., about 60 nm or larger) (data shown in Figs. 36A-36C). In addition, anti-collagen
agents, such as relaxin, can improve transport through the tumor matrix, but not facilitate the
delivery of low molecular weight agents (see e.g., US 6,719,977). In contrast, AHCM (e.g.,
angiotensin blockers) can improve delivery for a broader size range and class of anti-tumor
diagnostics and therapies, including low molecular weight, small-molecule
chemotherapeutics, biologics, nucleic acid agents and nanoparticle therapies (as described in
the Examples herein).
 [000262]       Matrix modifiers like bacterial collagenase, relaxin, and matrix
metalloproteinase-1 and -8 have been used to modify the collagen or proteoglycan network in
tumors and have improved the efficacy of intratumorally (i.t.) injected oncolytic viruses
(Brown E, et al. (2003) Nat Med 9:796-800; McKee TD, et al. (2006) CancerRes 66:2509
2513; Mok W, et al. (2007) CancerRes 67:10664-10668; Ganesh S, et al. (2007) CancerRes
67:4399-4407; and Kim J-H, et al. (2006) JNatl CancerInst 98:1482-1493). However,
these agents may produce normal tissue toxicity (e.g., bacterial collagenase) or increase the
risk of tumor or metastatic progression (e.g., relaxin, matrix metalloproteinases). For
example, matrix-degrading enzymes, which can normalize the collagen matrix, are not
selective for tumors and can increase invasion and metastasis. Other approaches for
improving interstitial transport may also cause increased metastasis. For example, relaxin, a
hormone produced during pregnancy that modulates collagen fiber structure to improve
diffusion of nano-sized probes (Brown, E. et al. (2003) Nat Med. 9(6):796-800; Perentes, J.Y.
et al. (2009) Nat. Methods 6(2):143-5), may lead to increased metastasis, perhaps due to the
mechanism of relaxin as a matrix-degrading therapy.
 [000263]       In contrast, ARBs and ACE-Is have no significant complications associated
with matrix remodeling in normal tissues, leading to their safety as anti-hypertensives. In the
cancer context, Applicants show that losartan monotherapy did not significantly increase
metastasis in the cancer model tested, AK4.4; and losartan combination with 5-FU appeared
to reduce the incidence and size of metastases (Table 2). Thus, angiotensin inhibitors, such as
ARBs and ACE-Is, are likely to cause less metastasis than other anti-collagen agents, such as
matrix-degrading enzymes and relaxin.
 [000264]       Another advantage of ARBs and ACE-Is, as small-molecule agents, is that
they can also be delivered via nanovectors containing chemotherapeutics (e.g., liposomes,
nano-particles) to enhance their localization to tumors to further limit toxicity.

 [000265]        Thus, methods and compositions for improving the delivery and/or efficacy of
cancer therapeutics are disclosed. Methods and compositions for treating or preventing a
cancer (e.g., a solid tumor such as a desmoplastic tumor) by administering to a subject an
anti-hypertensive agent, as a single agent or combination with a microenvironment modulator
and/or a cancer therapeutic agent (for example, a therapeutic agent ranging in size from a
large nanotherapeutic to a low molecular weight chemotherapeutics and/or oxygen) are
disclosed.
 [000266]        Certain terms are first defined.
 [000267]        "About" and "approximately" shall generally mean an acceptable degree of
error for the quantity measured given the nature or precision of the measurements.
Exemplary degrees of error are within 20 percent (%), typically, within 10%, and more
typically, within 5 %, 4%, 3%, 2 % or 1% of a given value or range of values.
 [000268]        "Delivery," as used herein in the context of delivery of an agent(s) to a tumor,
refers to the placement of the agent(s) in sufficient proximity to one or more (or all) of: the
tumor vasculature, the tumor interstitial matrix, or tumor cells or tumor-associated cells (e.g.,
fibroblasts), to have a desired effect. The agent(s) can be, e.g., a cancer therapy (e.g., a
cancer therapeutic agent(s) as described herein), or a diagnostic or imaging agent(s). Unless
noted otherwise, the term "agent" or "agent(s)" as used generically herein can include one,
two or more agents.
 [000269]        In one embodiment, the cancer therapeutic agent includes, e.g., one or more of
a small molecule, a protein or a nucleic acid drug, an oncolytic virus, a vaccine, an antibody
or a fragment thereof, or a combination thereof The cancer therapeutic agent can be "free"
or packaged or formulated into a delivery vehicle, e.g., a particle, e.g., a nanoparticle (e.g., a
lipid nanoparticle, a polymeric nanoparticle, or a viral particle). Delivery of a therapeutic
agent is characterized by placement of the therapeutic agent in sufficient proximity to the cell
to alter an activity of the cell, e.g., to kill the cell and/or reduce its ability to divide.
 [000270]        In other embodiments, the agent is a diagnostic or an imaging agent (e.g., one
or more of a radiologic agent, an NMRA agent, a contrast agent, or the like). The diagnostic
or imaging agent can be "free" or packaged or formulated into a delivery vehicle. Delivery
of a diagnostic or imaging agent is characterized by placement of the agent in sufficient
proximity to a target cell or tissue to allow detection of the target cell or tissue.
 [000271]        In embodiments, increased (or improved) delivery (as compared with a
delivery which is the same or similar except that it is carried out in the absence of an AHCM)

interstitial matrix; or
         decrease hyaluronan levels in the tumor, e.g., the tumor vasculature interstitial or
stromal matrix.
[000272]         In some embodiments, increased (or improved) delivery (as compared with a
delivery which is the same or similar except that it is carried out in the absence of an AHCM)
can also include increased amount of the agent distributed to at least a portion of the tumor.
In some embodiments, the increased amount of the agent delivered to the tumor in the
presence of the AHCM can be distributed homogenously or heterogeneously throughout the

 [000273]         "Efficacy" as used herein in the context of therapy, e.g., cancer therapy, can be
characterizes as the extent to which a therapy has a desired effect, including but not limited
to, alleviation of a symptom, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized state of disease,
delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and
remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable.
 [000274]         Improved efficacy, in the context of efficacy of cancer therapy, can be
characterized by one or more of the following: an increase in an anti-tumor effect, of the
cancer therapy, and/or a lessening of unwanted side effects (e.g., toxicity), of the cancer
therapy, as compared with a treatment which is the same or similar except that it is carried
out in the absence of treatment with an AHCM. In one embodiment, the increase in the anti
tumor effect of the cancer therapy includes one or more of: inhibiting primary or metastatic
tumor growth; reducing primary or metastatic tumor mass or volume; reducing size or
number of metastatic lesions; inhibiting the development of new metastatic lesions; reducing
one or more of non-invasive tumor volume or metabolism; providing prolonged survival;
providing prolonged progression-free survival; providing prolonged time to progression;
and/or enhanced quality of life.
 [000275]         In some embodiments, the term "improved efficacy" as used herein, with
respect to a cancer therapy in combination with an AHCM, can refer to an increase in
reduction of primary or metastatic tumor growth by at least about 5 %, at least about 10%, at
least about 2 0%, at least about 3 0%, at least about 4 0%, at least about 50%, at least about
6 0% , at least about 7 0%, at least about 8 0%, at least about 9 0%, at least about 9 5 %, up to and
including 100%, as compared to the reduction of primary or metastatic tumor growth during
a cancer therapy alone (i.e., in the absence of an AHCM). In some embodiments, the
administration of an AHCM in combination with a cancer therapy can increase the reduction
of primary or metastatic tumor growth by at least about 1-fold, at least about 2-fold, at least
about 3-fold, at least about 5-fold, at least about 6-fold, at least about 7-fold, or higher, as
compared to the reduction of primary or metastatic tumor growth during a cancer therapy
alone (i.e., in the absence of an AHCM). Methods for monitoring tumor growth in vivo are
well known in the art, e.g., but not limited to, X-ray, CT scan, MRI and other art-recognized
medical imaging methods.
 [000276]         In some embodiments, the term "improved efficacy" as used herein, with
respect to a cancer therapy in combination with an AHCM, can refer to an increase in
perfusion of an anti-cancer agent (e.g., low molecular weight therapeutics or nanotherapeutics
such as DOXIL@ or immune cells) into a tumor, e.g., by at least about 5%, at least about

to and including 100%, as compared to perfusion of an anti-cancer agent alone (i.e., in the
absence of an AHCM). In some embodiments, the administration of an AHCM in
combination with a cancer therapy can increase perfusion of an anti-cancer agent (e.g., low
molecular weight therapeutics or nanotherapeutics such as DOXIL@) into a tumor, by at least
about 1-fold, at least about 2-fold, at least about 3-fold, at least about 5-fold, at least about 6
fold, at least about 7-fold, or higher, as compared to the perfusion efficiency of an anti-cancer
agent alone (i.e., in the absence of an AHCM). Methods to measure tumor perfusion in vivo
are well established in the art, including, but not limited to, positron emission tomography
(PET), and ultrasound or contrast-enhanced ultrasound.
 [000277]         In some embodiments, the term "improved efficacy" as used herein, with
respect to a cancer therapy in combination with an AHCM, can refer to an increase in
reduction in expression level of at least one biomarker, e.g., at least one cancer biomarker
(e.g., in a biological sample such as a blood sample, a serum sample, a plasma sample or a
tissue biopsy), e.g., by at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 2 0%, at least about

the reduction in expression level of the at least one cancer biomarker when administered with
a cancer therapy, alone (i.e., in the absence of an AHCM). In some embodiments, the
administration of an AHCM in combination with a cancer therapy can increase the reduction
in expression level of at least one biomarker (e.g., in a biological sample such as a blood
sample, a serum sample, a plasma sample or a tissue biopsy) by at least about 1-fold, at least
about 2-fold, at least about 3-fold, at least about 5-fold, at least about 6-fold, at least about 7
fold, or higher, as compared to the reduction in expression level of the at least one cancer
biomarker when administered with a cancer therapy alone (i.e., in the absence of an AHCM).
Examples of a biomarker in the serum, plasma or tissue can include, but are not limited to,
TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2, CTGF, TSP-1, collagen I, collagen II, collagen III, or collagen IV.
Expression levels of biomarkers can be measured on a transcript level and/or a protein level,
using any art-recognized analytical methods, e.g., PCR, western blot, ELISA, and/or
immunostaining.
 [000278]         "Blood pressure" is usually classified based on the systolic and diastolic blood
pressures. "Systolic blood pressure" or Psys refers to the blood pressure in vessels during a
heart beat. "Diastolic blood pressure" or Pdias refers to the pressure between heartbeats. A
systolic or the diastolic blood pressure measurement higher than the accepted normal values
                                                  52

 WO 2013/169739                                                                PCT/US2013/039901
for the age of the individual is classified as prehypertension or hypertension. A systolic or
the diastolic blood pressure measurement lower than the accepted normal values for the age
of the individual is classified as hypotension. A "normal" systolic pressure for an adult is
typically in the range of 90-120 mmHg; a "normal" diastolic pressure is usually in the range
of 60-80 mmHg. In the population, the average blood pressure (Psys/Pdias ratio) can range
from 110/65 to 140/90 mmHg for an adult; 95/65 mmHg for a 1 year infant, and 100/65
mmHg for a 6-9 year old.
 [000279]       Hypertension has several subclassifications including, prehypertension
(120/80 to 139/89 mmHg); hypertension stage 1 (140/90 to 159 to 99 mmHg), hypertension
stage II (greater or equal to 160/100 mmHg, and isolated systolic hypertension (greater or
equal to 140/90 mmHg). Isolated systolic hypertension refers to elevated systolic pressure
with normal diastolic pressure and is common in the elderly. These classifications are made
after averaging a patient's resting blood pressure readings taken on two or more office visits.
 [000280]       Hypertension is generally diagnosed on the basis of a persistently high blood
pressure. Usually this requires three separate sphygmomanometer measurements at least one
week apart. Often, this entails three separate visits to the physician's office. Initial assessment
of the hypertensive patient should include a complete medical history and physical
examination.
 [000281]       As used herein, "hypertension" or "high blood pressure," refers to a
prehypertensive or a hypertensive stage having a systolic pressure of 120 or greater
(typically, 140 or greater) and a diastolic pressure of 80 or greater (all blood pressures herein
are expressed as mmHg).
 [000282]       As used herein, the term "mean arterial pressure" (MAP) is art recognized and
refers to the average over a cardiac cycle and is determined by the cardiac output (CO),
systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and central venous pressure (CVP), MAP = (CO x SVR)
+ CVP. MAP can be approximately determined from measurements of the systolic pressure
(Psys) and the diastolic pressure (Pdias), while there is a normal resting heart rate, MAP is
approximately Pdias + 1/3(Psys -Pdias).
 [000283]       "Anti-hypertensive agent," as used herein refers to an agent (e.g., a compound,
a protein) that when administered at a selected dose (referred to herein as "an anti
hypertensive dose") reduces blood pressure, typically in a patient (e.g., a hypertensive
patient). Anti-hypertensive agents are routinely used clinically to treat patients with high
blood pressure at doses known in the art. Exemplary anti-hypertensive agents, include but
are not limited to, renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists ("RAAS antagonists"),
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (AT1
                                                 53

herein.
[000284]            "Sub-anti-hypertensive dose," as used herein, refers to a dose of an anti
hypertension agent that is typically less than the lowest dose that would be used to treat a
patient for high blood pressure. In an embodiment, a sub-anti-hypertensive dose has one or
more of the following properties:
          it does not substantially lower blood pressure, e.g., the mean arterial blood pressure,

          it is less than a standard of care anti-hypertensive dose.
          In certain embodiments, the ability of a dose to meet one or more of these standards
can be made as measured after a preselected number of dosages, e.g., 1, 2, 5, or 10, or after
sufficient dosages that a steady state level, e.g., plasma level, is attained.

[000285]         Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail below. The
word "comprise" and its variations, such as "comprises" and "comprising", means including,
but not limited to, whatever follows the word. Additional definitions are set out throughout
the specification.
Anti-Hypertensive and/or Collagen Modifying Agents (AHCM Agents)
[000286]         In certain embodiments, the AHCM agent used in the methods and
compositions of the invention can be chosen from one or more of: an antagonist of renin
angiotensin aldosterone system ("RAAS antagonist"), an angiotensin converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitor, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (AT 1 blocker), a thrombospondin 1 (TSP
1) inhibitor, a transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-1) inhibitor, and a connective tissue
growth factor (CTGF) inhibitor. The method can include one, two, three or more AHCM
agents, alone or in combination with one or more cancer therapeutics.
[000287]         Exemplary antagonists of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)
include, but are not limited to, aliskiren (TEKTURNA@, RASILEZ@), remikiren (Ro 42
5892), enalkiren (A-64662), SPP635, and derivatives thereof.
[000288]         Exemplary angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors include, but are
not limited to, benazepril (LOTENSIN@), captopril (CAPOTEN@), enalapril (VASOTEC@),
fosinopril (MONOPRIL@), lisinopril (PRINIVIL@, ZESTRIL@), moexipril (UNIVASC@),

[000290]         In one embodiment, the AT 1 blocker is losartan, or a derivative thereof.
Losartan is an anti-hypertensive agent with miminal safety risks (Johnston CI (1995) Lancet
346:1403-1407). Furthermore, in addition to its antihypertensive properties, losartan is also
an antifibrotic agent that has been shown to reduce the incidence of cardiac and renal fibrosis
(Habashi JP, et al. (2006) Science 312:117-121; and. Cohn RD, et al. (2007) Nat Med
13:204-210). The antifibrotic effects of losartan are caused, in part, by the suppression of
active transforming growth factor-pl (TGF-1) levels via an angiotensin II type I receptor

 [000299]       In one embodiment, the AHCM agent is administered at a standard of care
anti-hypertensive and anti-heart failure doses and dosage formulations, e.g., a dose or dosage
formulation as described herein.
 [000300]       In certain embodiments, a sub-anti-hypertensive dose or dosage formulation of
the AHCM agent is desirable, e.g., a dose of the AHCM agent that is less than the standard of
care dose or dosage formulation. In one embodiment, the sub-anti-hypertensive dose or
dosage formulation has a minimal effect in blood pressure in a hypertensive subject (e.g.,
decreases the mean arterial blood pressure in a hypertensive subject by less than 2 0%, 10%,
or 5% or less). In certain embodiments, the AHCM agent is administered at a dose or dosage
formulation that is less than 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, that of the

standard of care anti-hypertensive dose (e.g., the lower standard of care dose). In one
embodiment, the dose or dosage formulation is in the range of, for example, 0.01-0.9-fold,
0.02-0.8-fold, 0.05-0.7-fold, 0.1-0.5 fold, 0.1-0.2-fold, that of the standard of care dose or
dosage formulation for anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure use. Standard of care doses or
dosage formulation of the AHCM are available in the art, some of which are exemplified
herein.
 [000301]         In yet other embodiments, the AHCM agent is administered at a dose or
dosage formulation that is greater than the standard of care dose or dosage formulation for
anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure use (e.g., a dose or dosage form that is greater than 1.1,
 1.5, 1.7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10-fold or higher, that of the standard of care dose for anti-hypertensive or
anti-heart failure use). In one embodiment, the dose or dosage formulation is in the range of,
for example, 1.1 to 10-fold, 1.5-5-fold, 1.7 to 4-fold, or 2-3-fold, that of the standard of care
dose or dosage formulation for anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure use. Standard of care
doses or dosage formulation of the AHCM are available in the art, some of which are
exemplified herein.
 [000302]         The standard of care dose and dosage forms are provided herein for a number
of AHCMs, e.g., losartan. In an embodiment, the dose and/or dosage form is less than (or
higher than) the standard of care dose and/or dosage form. In an exemplary embodiment, it is
less than 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9-fold, that of the standard of care dose or
dosage form. In embodiments, the dose or dosage form contains an amount of AHCM that is
within a range of the reduced amounts of the standard of care dose and/or dosage form. E.g.,
an AHCM dosage form that is 0.01-0.9-fold, 0.02-0.8-fold, 0.05-0.7-fold, 0.1-0.5 fold, 0.1
0.2-fold, that of the standard of care dose or dosage form. In certain embodiments, the range
of the dose or the dosage form is 0.5-2.0 times a reduced dose or dosage form recited herein,
so long as the dose or dosage form value is less than the standard of care dose or dosage
form. By way of example, a standard of care dosage form for losartan is 12.5 mg. Thus, in
embodiments, the dosage form is 0.125 mg (.01x12.5 mg); 0.625 mg (0.05 x 12.5 mg); 1.25
mg (0.1 x 12.5 mg); 2.5 mg (0.2 x 12.5 mg); or 6.25 mg (0.5 x 12.5 mg). In an embodiment,
the AHCM dosage form is in the range 0.5-2.0 (.125 mg)          = 0.0625-0.25 mg; 0.5-2.0(.625 mg)
= 0.312-1.25 mg; and so on, so long as the dose or dosage form value is less than the standard
of care dose or dosage form. This calculation can be applied to any standard of care dose
and/or dosage form for any AHCM described herein. In certain embodiment, the value is less
than the standard of care values. In other embodiments, the value is greater than the standard
of care values.
 [000303]         In one embodiment, the dose of the AHCM agent is calculated based on the
                                                    58

severity of the fibrosis in the tumor sample.
 [000304]        In some embodiments, the dose of the AHCM agent can be a sub-anti
hypertensive dose, which does not have any anti-tumor effect, e.g., no significant effect on
inhibiting or preventing tumor growth or progression when administered alone. In some
embodiments, the dose of the AHCM agent can be comparable to or greater than the standard
of care dose or dosage formulation for anti-hypertensive or anti-heart failure use, and does
not have any anti-tumor effect, e.g., no significant effect on inhibiting or prevening tumor
growth or progression when administered alone.
Therapeutic Methods
 [000305]        In one aspect, the invention relates to a method of treating a disorder, e.g., a
hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., a cancer) by administering to a patient an AHCM agent,
alone or in combination with a therapy or a therapeutic agent, e.g., an anti-cancer agent as
described herein.
 [000306]        As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the terms "treat," "treating"
and "treatment" refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative
measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological
change or disorder, such as the development or spread of cancer. Beneficial or desired
clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of
extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease
progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or
total), whether detectable or undetectable. "Treatment" can also mean prolonging survival as
compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include
those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or
disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.
 [000307]        For example, in the case of treating cancer, in some embodiments, therapeutic
treatment can refer to inhibiting or reducing tumor growth or progression after administration
in accordance with the methods or administration with the pharmaceutical compositions
described herein. For example, tumor growth or progression is inhibited or reduced by at least
about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about    2 0 %, at least about 30 %, at least about 4 0 %, or
at least about 50%, after treatment. In another embodiment, tumor growth or progression is
inhibited or reduced by more than 50%, e.g., at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, after
treatment. In one embodiment, tumor growth or progression is inhibited or reduced by at least
about 8 0%, at least about 9 0% or greater, as compared to a control (e.g. in the absence of the
                                                  59

 WO 2013/169739                                                                   PCT/US2013/039901
pharmaceutical composition described herein).
 [000308]       In another embodiment, the therapeutic treatment refers to alleviation of at
least one symptom associated with cancer. Measurable lessening includes any statistically
significant decline in a measurable marker or symptom, such as measuring a cancer
biomarker, such as serum/plasma cancer biomarker in a blood sample, after treatment. In one
embodiment, at least one cancer biomarker or sympton is alleviated by at least about 10%, at
least about 15%, at least about  2 0 %, at least about 3 0 %, at least about 4 0 %, or at least about
50%. In another embodiment, at least one cancer biomarker or sympton is alleviated by more
                               60                        70
than 50%, e.g., at least about     %, or at least about     %. In one embodiment, at least one
cancer biomarker or sympton is alleviated by at least about 80%, at least about 90% or
greater, as compared to a control (e.g. in the absence of the pharmaceutical composition
described herein).
 [000309]       As used herein, unless otherwise specified, the terms "prevent," "preventing"
and "prevention" contemplate an action that occurs before a patient begins to suffer from the
regrowth of the cancer and/or which inhibits or reduces the severity of the cancer.
 [000310]       As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, a "therapeutically effective
amount" of a compound is an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic benefit in the
treatment of the disorder (e.g., cancer), or to delay or minimize one or more symptoms
associated with the disorder (e.g., cancer). A therapeutically effective amount of a compound
means an amount of therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents,
which provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of the disorder. The
term "therapeutically effective amount" can encompass an amount that improves overall
therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of the disorder (e.g., cancer), or enhances the
therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutic agent.
 [000311]       As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, a "prophylactically effective
amount" of a compound is an amount sufficient to prevent a disorder (e.g., regrowth of the
cancer, or one or more symptoms associated with the cancer, or prevent its recurrence). A
prophylactically effective amount of a compound means an amount of the compound, alone
or in combination with other therapeutic agents, which provides a prophylactic benefit in the
prevention of the disorder. The term "prophylactically effective amount" can encompass an
amount that improves overall prophylaxis or enhances the prophylactic efficacy of another
prophylactic agent.
 [000312]       As used herein, the term "patient" or "subject" refers to an animal, typically a
human (i.e., a male or female of any age group, e.g., a pediatric patient (e.g, infant, child,
adolescent) or adult patient (e.g., young adult, middle-aged adult or senior adult) or other

mammal, such as a primate (e.g., cynomolgus monkey, rhesus monkey); commercially
relevant mammals such as cattle, pigs, horses, sheep, goats, cats, and/or dogs; and/or birds,
including commercially relevant birds such as chickens, ducks, geese, and/or turkeys, that
will be or has been the object of treatment, observation, and/or experiment. When the term is
used in conjunction with administration of a compound or drug, then the patient has been the
object of treatment, observation, and/or administration of the compound or drug. The
methods and/or pharmaceutical compositions described herein can also be used to treat
domesticated animals or pets such as cats and dogs.
 [000313]        As used herein, "cancer" and "tumor" are synonymous terms.
 [000314]        As used herein, "cancer therapy" and "cancer treatment" are synonymous
terms.
 [000315]        As used herein, "chemotherapy," "chemotherapeutic," "chemotherapeutic
agent" and "anti-cancer agent" are synonymous terms.
 [000316]        In some embodiments, the AHCM agent, alone or in combination, is a first
line treatment for the cancer, i.e., it is used in a subject who has not been previously
administered another drug intended to treat the cancer.
 [000317]        In other embodiments, the AHCM agent, alone or in combination, is a second
line treatment for the cancer, i.e., it is used in a subject who has been previously administered
another drug intended to treat the cancer.
 [000318]        In other embodiments, the AHCM agent, alone or in combination, is a third or
fourth line treatment for the cancer, i.e., it is used in a subject who has been previously
administered two or three other drugs intended to treat the cancer.
 [000319]        In some embodiments, the AHCM agent is administered to a subject before,
during, and/or after radiation or surgical treatment of the cancer.
 [000320]        In some embodiments, the AHCM agent is administered, alone or in
combination with a cancer therapy or an anti-cancer agent, to a subject who previously did
not respond to at least one cancer therapy or anti-cancer agent, including at least two, at least
three, or at least four cancer therapies or anti-cancer agents. In such embodiments, the
AHCM agent can be administered to a subject in combination with the cancer therapy or anti
cancer agent to which he/she previously did not respond, or in combination with a cancer
therapy or anti-cancer agent different from the one(s) he/she has been treated with.
 [000321]        In other embodiments, the AHCM agent is administered as adjunct therapy,
i.e., a treatment in addition to primary therapy. In embodiments, the adjuvant effect of the
AHCM administered in combination with a primary therapy can be additive.

Disorders
 [000322]       The AHCM, alone or in combination with a microenvironment modulator
and/or a therapy or a therapeutic agent, e.g., an anti-cancer agent as described herein can be
used to treat or prevent a disorder, e.g., a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., a cancer).
 [000323]       In certain embodiments, the disorder is chosen from one or more of a
hyperproliferative disorder, a cancer, a fibrotic disorder, an iinflammatory disorder or an
autoimmune disorder.
 [000324]       In certain embodiments, the cancer is an epithelial, mesenchymal or
hematologic malignancy. In certain embodiments, the cancer treated is a solid tumor (e.g.,
carcinoid, carcinoma or sarcoma), a soft tissue tumor (e.g., a heme malignancy), and a
metastatic lesion, e.g., a metastatic lesion of any of the cancers disclosed herein. In one
embodiment, the cancer treated is a fibrotic or desmoplastic solid tumor, e.g., a tumor having
one or more of: limited tumor perfusion, compressed blood vessels, fibrotic tumor
interstitium, or increased interstitial fluid pressure. In one embodiment, the solid tumor is
chosen from one or more of pancreatic (e.g., pancreatic adenocarcinoma or pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma), breast, colon, colorectal, lung (e.g., small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or non
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)), skin, ovarian, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, endometrial
cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, kidney, or prostate cancer.
 [000325]       By "hyperproliferative cancerous disease or disorder" is meant all neoplastic
cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, including all transformed cells
and tissues and all cancerous cells and tissues. Hyperproliferative diseases or disorders
include, but are not limited to, precancerous lesions, abnormal cell growths, benign tumors,
malignant tumors, and "cancer."
 [000326]       As used herein, the terms "cancer," "tumor" or "tumor tissue" refer to an
abnormal mass of tissue that results from excessive cell division, in certain cases tissue
comprising cells which express, over-express, or abnormally express a hyperproliferative cell
protein. A cancer, tumor or tumor tissue comprises "tumor cells" which are neoplastic cells
with abnormal growth properties and no useful bodily function. Cancers, tumors, tumor
tissue and tumor cells may be benign or malignant. A cancer, tumor or tumor tissue may also
comprise "tumor-associated non-tumor cells", e.g., vascular cells which form blood vessels to
supply the tumor or tumor tissue. Non-tumor cells may be induced to replicate and develop
by tumor cells, for example, the induction of angiogenesis in a tumor or tumor tissue.
 [000327]       Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma,
blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of
such cancers are noted below and include: squamous cell cancer (e.g. epithelial squamous
                                                  62

cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer,
adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum,
hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic
cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma,
breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer or uterine
carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer,
thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, as well as head and
neck cancer. The term "cancer" includes primary malignant cells or tumors (e.g., those whose
cells have not migrated to sites in the subject's body other than the site of the original
malignancy or tumor) and secondary malignant cells or tumors (e.g., those arising from
metastasis, the migration of malignant cells or tumor cells to secondary sites that are different
from the site of the original tumor).

above.
[000329]        In other embodiements, the AHCM agent, as described above and herein, is
used to treat a hyperproliferative disorder, e.g., a hyperpoliferative connective tissue disorder
(e.g., a hyperproliferative fibrotic disease). In one embodiment, the hyperproliferative
                                                 64

 WO 2013/169739                                                               PCT/US2013/039901
fibrotic disease is multisystemic or organ-specific. Exemplary hyperproliferative fibrotic
diseases include, but are not limited to, multisystemic (e.g., systemic sclerosis, multifocal
fibrosclerosis, sclerodermatous graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplant
recipients, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, scleroderma), and organ-specific disorders (e.g.,
fibrosis of the eye, lung, liver, heart, kidney, pancreas, skin and other organs). In other
embodiments, the disorder is chosen from liver cirrhosis or tuberculosis.
 [000330]        In other embodiment, the subject treated has a hyperproliferative genetic
disorder, e.g., a hyperproliferative genetic disorder chosen from Marfan's syndrome or
Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Losartan has been shown to treat human Marfan syndrome, a
connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the extracellular
matrix protein, fibrillin- 1 (Dietz, H.C. et al. (2010) New Engl JMed 363(9):852-863).
Fibrillin-1 comprises the microfibrils of elastic tissue and a component of many other
connective tissues. Affected patients with Marfan syndrome have blood vessel abnormalities
such as aortic aneurysms. The vascular disease can result in blood vessel rupture and death in
childhood and later in life. Dietz et al. first found in mouse models of Marfan syndrome that
excessive activation of latent TGF-p has an important role in the pathophysiology. They used
losartan in the affected mice and showed striking effects in improving blood vessel
architecture and prevented the development of aortic aneurysms. They have also used
losartan to treat children with Marfan syndrome and demonstrated that the drug can strikingly
prevent progression of aortic and muscular lesions. Aortic diseases other than Marfan
syndrome can also benefit from the use of losartan. Inhibition of activation of latent TGF-p
locally and decreasing circulating levels of active TGF-P thus can have effects on
components of connective tissues other than collagen in the extracellular matrix of cancer
tissues that alter delivery and efficacy of nanotherapeutics.
 [000331]        In other embodiments, the hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., the
hyperproliferative fibrotic disorder) is chosen from one or more of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, asthma, aortic aneurysm, radiation-induced fibrosis, skeletal-muscle
myopathy, diabetic nephropathy, and/or arthritis.
 [000332]        Additional exemplary hyperproliferative disorders that can be treated by the
methods and compositions of the invention are disclosed in Sounni, N.E. et al. (2010)
Diseases Models & Mechanisms 3:317-332.
 [000333]        In yet other embodiments, the disorder is chosen from an inflammatory or an
autoimmune disorder chosen from multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease,
scleroderma, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.
 [000334]        In certain embodiments, the inflammatory disorder is an inflammatory
                                                   65

 WO 2013/169739                                                                   PCT/US2013/039901
disorder of: the gastrointestinal tract or a gastrointestinal organ, e.g., colitis, Crohn's disease,
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Barrett's esophagus and chronic gastritis; the lung (e.g.,
asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); the skin (e.g., psoriasis), the
cardiovascular system (e.g., atherosclerosis, cholesterol metabolic disorders, oxygen free
radical injury, ischemia), the nervous system (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis),
liver (e.g., hepatitis), kidney (e.g., nephritis), and the pancreas (e.g., pancreatitis).
 [000335]        In other embodiments, the inflammatory disorder is associated with an
autoimmune disorder, e.g., arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus-associated arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis or
ankylosing spondylitis); scleroderma; lupus; systemic lupus erythematosis; HIV; Sjogren's
syndrome; vasculitis; multiple sclerosis; dermatitis (including atopic dermatitis and
eczematous dermatitis), myasthenia gravis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's
disease, colitis, diabetes mellitus (type I); acute inflammatory conditions (e.g., endotoxemia,
sepsis and septicaemia, toxic shock syndrome and infectious disease); transplant rejection and
allergy.
Combination Therapy
 [000336]        It will be appreciated that the AHCM agent, as described above and herein,
can be administered in combination with one or more additional therapies, e.g., such as
radiation therapy, PDT, surgery, immune therapy,and/or in combination with one or more
therapeutic agents, to treat the cancers described herein.
 [000337]        By "in combination with," it is not intended to imply that the therapy or the
therapeutic agents must be administered at the same time and/or formulated for delivery
together, although these methods of delivery are within the scope of the invention. The
pharmaceutical compositions can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent
to, one or more other additional therapies or therapeutic agents. In general, each agent will
be administered at a dose and/or on a time schedule determined for that agent. In will further
be appreciated that the additional therapeutic agent utilized in this combination can be
administered together in a single composition or administered separately in different
compositions. The particular combination to employ in a regimen will take into account
compatibility of the inventive pharmaceutical composition with the additional therapeutically
active agent and/or the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved.
 [000338]        In general, it is expected that additional therapeutic agents utilized in
combination be utilized at levels that do not exceed the levels at which they are utilized
individually. In some embodiments, the levels utilized in combination will be lower than
                                                    66

 WO 2013/169739                                                                 PCT/US2013/039901
those utilized individually.
 [000339]        In certain embodiments, the AHCM and/or the therapy (e.g., the cancer or
hyperproliferative therapy) is administered in combination with a microenvironment
modulator. The combined administration of the AHCM and the microenvironment modulator
can be used to enhance the efficacy (e.g., penetration and/or diffusion), of a therapy, e.g., a
cancer therapy, in a tumor or tumor vasculature in a subject. Such combination may cause
one or more of: reduce solid stress (e.g., growth-induced solid stress in tumors); decrease
tumor fibrosis; reduce interstitial hypertension or interstitial fluid pressure (IFP); increase
interstitial tumor transport; increase tumor or vessel perfusion; increase vascular diameters
and/or enlarge compressed or collapsed blood vessels; reduce or deplete one or more of:
cancer cells, or stromal cells (e.g., tumor associated fibroblasts or immune cells); decrease the
level or production of extracellular matrix components, such as fibers (e.g., collagen,
procollagen), and/or polysaccharides (e.g., glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronan or
hyaluronic acid); decrease the level or production of collagen or procollagen; decreases the
level or production of hyaluronic acid; increases tumor oxygenation; decreases tumor
hypoxia; decreases tumor acidosis; enables immune cell infiltration; decreases
immunosuppression; increases antitumor immunity; decreases cancer stem cells (also referred
to herein as tumor initiating cells), thereby enhacing the penetration and/or distribution of the
therapy, e.g., the cancer therapy.
 [000340]        Exemplary microenvironment modulators are disclosed herein, and include,
but are not limited to, an anti-angiogenic therapy, for example, an inhibitor of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway; an agent that decreases the level or production of
hyaluronic acid; an inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway; an agent that improves drug
penetration in tumors. In one embodiment, the agent is a disulfide-based cyclic RGD peptide
peptide (iRGD) or an analogue thereof; a taxane therapy (e.g., taxane-induced apoptosis); an
agent that decreases the level or production of collagen or procollagen; an anti-fibrotic agent
and/or a profibrotic pathway inhibitor.
 [000341]        In one embodiment, the microenvironment modulator includes an anti
angiogenic therapy, for example, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
pathway. Exemplary VEGF pathway inhibitors include, but are not limited to, an antibody
against VEGF (e.g., bevacizumab); a VEGF receptor inhibitor (e.g., an inhibitor of VEGFR- 1
inhibitor, a VEGFR-2 inhibitor, or a VEGFR-3 inhibitor (e.g., VEGFR inhibitors such as
Cediranib (AZD2171)); a VEGF trap (e.g., a fusion protein that includes a VEGFR domain
(e.g., a VEGFR1 domain 2 and a VEGFR2 domain 3) fused to an Fc fragment of an IgG);
and an anti-VEGF aptamer (or a pegylated derivative thereof (e.g., MACUGEN@).
                                                67

 WO 2013/169739                                                             PCT/US2013/039901
 [000342]       In another embodiment, the microenvironment modulator includes an agent
that decreases the level or production of hyaluronic acid (HA). Enzymatic targeting of the
stroma using systemic administration of a pegylated derivative of hyaluronidase (PEGPH20)
has been shown to ablate stromal HA in a model for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA)
and increase vessel diameter in pancreatic tumors; hyaluronidase derivatives, in combination
with standard chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., gemcitabine), can remodel the tumor
microenvironment and increase overall survival (see e.g., Provenzano, P. et al. (2012) Cancer
Cell 21: 418-429). Thus, combined administration of the AHCM and the microenvironment
modulator can be used to enhance penetration and/or diffusion of a cancer therapy in a tumor
or tumor vasculature, by for example, decreasing certain matrix components, e.g., HA, in the
stroma. Exemplary HA-depleting agents include, but are not limited to, an anti-hyaluronan
enzymatic therapy such as hyaluronidase or a derivative thereof (e.g., pegylated recombinant
human hyaluronidase) (e.g., PH20, PEGPH20); and an antibody against hyaluronic acid.
 [000343]       In another emdodiment, the microenvironment modulator includes an inhibitor
of the hedgehog pathway. Hedgehog inhibitors have been shown to increase vessel density in
pancreatic tumors (Olive, K.P. et al. (2009) Science 324:1457-61), presumably by reducing
stromal cell density and solid stress. Exemplary hedgehog inhibitors include, but are not
limited to, IPI-926, GDC-0449, cylopamine or an analogue thereof, and GANT58.
 [000344]       In another embodiment, the microenvironment modulator includes an agent
that improves drug penetration in tumors. In one embodiment, the agent is a disulfide-based
cyclic RGD peptide peptide (iRGD) or an analogue thereof (e.g., described in Sugahara, KN
et al. (2010) Science 328:1031-5; Ye, Y. et al. (2011) Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 21(4):1146
50).
 [000345]       In yet another embodiment, the microenvironment modulator includes a
taxane therapy (e.g.,taxane-induced apoptosis as described in Griffon-Etienne, G. et al.
(1999) CancerRes. 59(15):3776-82).
 [000346]       In another embodiment, the microenvironment modulator includes an agent
that modulates (e.g, inhibits) a hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), for example, an agent that
inhibits hypoxia-inducible factors Ia and 2a (HIF-la and HIF-2a). HIF activity has been
shown to be involved in inflammation (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) and angiogenesis associated
with cancer tumor growth. HIF inhibitors, such as phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) are
under investigation for anti-cancer effects (Syed Alwi SS, et al. (2010) Br. J. Nutr. 104 (9):
 1288-96; Semenza GL (2007). DrugDiscov. Today 12 (19-20): 853-9; Melillo G (2006).
Mol. CancerRes. 4 (9): 601-5. In one embodiment, the agent is an antibody against an HIF.
In another embodiment, the agent is an HIF chemical inhibitor, such as phenethyl
                                               68

 WO 2013/169739                                                               PCT/US2013/039901
isothiocyanate (PEITC).
 [000347]       In another embodiment, the microenvironment modulator includes an agent
that decreases the level or production of collagen or procollagen. For example, an agent that
degrades collagen, e.g., collagenase.
 [000348]       In one embodiment, the AHCM and/or the therapy (e.g., the cancer or
hyperproliferative therapy) is administered in combination with a microenvironment
modulator chosen from an anti-fibrotic agent or an inhibitor of a profibrotic pathway (a
"profibrotic pathway inhibitor") (e.g., a pathway dependent- or independent of TGF-beta
and/or CTGF activation). In one embodiment, the AHCM and/or the cancer therapy is
administered in combination with one or more of: an inhibitor of endothelin- 1, PDGF,
Wnt/beta-catenin, IGF-1, TNF-alpha, and/or IL-4. In another embodiment, the AHCM
and/or the cancer therapy is administered in combination with an inhibitor of endothelin- 1
and/or PDGF. In other embodiments, the AHCM and/or the cancer therapy is administered in
combination with an inhibitor of one or more of chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) (e.g.,
AMD3 100, MSX- 122); stromal-derived-factor- 1(SDF- 1) (e.g., tannic acid); hedgehog (e.g.,
IPI-926, GDC-0449, cylopamine or an analogue thereof, or GANT58).
 [000349]       In certain embodiments, an inhibitor of a CXCR4 receptor and/or its ligand,
SDF- 1, is administered in combination with a therapy (e.g., a cancer or hyperproliferative
therapy as described herein). Certain embodiments may further include administration of a
further AHCM and/or a microenvironment modulator as described herein. Without wishing
to be bound by theory, inhibition of CXCR4 receptor and/or its ligand, SDF-1, alone or in
combination with an AHCM, e.g., an angiotensin II receptor blocker, can be used to reduce
the desmoplasia in certain fibrotic or desmoplastic cancers, e.g., a fibrotic or a desmoplastic
solid tumor, such as pancreatic cancers (e.g., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)).
For example, activation of SDF- 1a/CXCR4 and angiotensin II (ATII) signaling pathways is
known to promote carcinoma activated fibroblasts (CAF) recruitment, activation, and matrix
production in PDAC. Hypoxia, which is associated with PDAC, can induce SDF-la and
CXCR4 expression in cancer cells and CAFs through HIF-la activation (Schioppa, T., et al.
(2003) JExp Med, 198: 1391-1402) while promoting growth and metastasis (Chang,          Q., et
al. (2011) CancerResearch, 71: 3110-3120). These effects arise, at least in part, through
SDF-la/CXCR4-dependent activation of CAFs (Gao, Z. et al. (2010) Pancreatology10: 186
 193; Moriyama, T. et al. (2010) Cancer 116: 3357-3368) and a CD133+/CXCR4+ cancer
stem cell population (Hermann, P. C. et al. (2007) Cell Stem Cell 1: 313-323), which also
confers chemoresistance (Singh, S. et al. (2010) Br J Cancer 103: 1671-1679). High SDF-la
levels (Liang, J. J., et al. (2010) CancerEpidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention 19: 259 8
                                                69

 WO 2013/169739                                                              PCT/US2013/039901
2604) and CXCR4 levels (Marechal, R. et al. (2009) Br J Cancer,100: 1444-1451) can be
predictive of poor prognosis in PDAC patients. On the other hand, ATII signaling can
stimulate CAF proliferation (Hama, K. et a;. (2006) Biochemical and Biophysical Research
Communications, 340: 742-750; Hama, K. et al. (2004) Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 315:
905-911; Shimizu, K. et al. (2008) J GastroenterolHepatol, 23 Suppl 1: S119-121), and
ATII signaling through ATII-receptor type 1 (AT1) can stimulate CAF matrix production via
TGF-p1 and ERK-dependent mechanisms (Rodriguez-Vita, J. et al. (2005) Circulation111:
2509-2517; Yang, F. et al. (2009) Hypertension, 54: 877-884). ATII also induces TGF-p1
(Elenbaas, B. and Weinberg, R. A. (2001) Experimental Cell Research, 264: 169-184) and
SDF-la (Chu, P. Y. et al. (2010) Am JPathol,176: 1735-1742) expression by both cancer
cells and CAFs, which can promote CAF proliferation and matrix production. Thus,
inhibition of a CXCR4 receptor and/or its ligand, SDF-1, can be used (alone or with an
inhibitor of ATII signaling) to enhance the distribution of a therapy in fibrotic or
desmoplastic cancers.
 [000350]        Exemplary SDF- 1/CXCR4 inhibitors that can be used include, but are not
limited to, 2,2'-bicyclam; 6,6'- bicyclam; AMD3 100 (IUPAC name: 1,l'-[l,4-phenylene
bis(methylene)]-bis-1,4,8,1 1-tetraazacyclotetradecane), as described in e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos.
5,021,409, 6,001,826 and 5,583,131; Plerixafor (trade name: Mozobil; IUPAC name: 1,1'
[1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)]bis [1,4,8,11 -tetraazacyclotetradecane); CXCR4 peptide
inhibitors or analogs, e.g., T-140 analogs (e.g., 4                      TC14012, TE14011,
TC14003), CTCE-0214; CTCE-9908; and CP-1221, as well as other inhibitors such as
antibodies against SDF-1 or CXCR4, RNA inhibitors (e.g., antisense, siRNAs), among
others. Exemplary inhibitors are described in, for example, Tamamura, H. et al. Org. Biomol.

 [000351]        In another embodiment, the AHCM and/or the cancer therapy is administered
in combination with an anti-fibrotic agent, for example, a pirfenidone. Pirfenidone (PFD or
5-methyl-1-phenyl-2(lH)-pyridone,commercially available from Marnac, Inc.) is an agent
that is being investigated for use in patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Pirfenidone has been
shown to produce anti-fibrotic effects in several organs such as the heart, liver, lung and
kidney. For example, PFD has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on fibroblast growth

sunitinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, or sorafenib. In one embodiment, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor
is sunitinib.
 [000365]        In one embodiment, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is
administered in combination with one of more of: an anti-angiogenic agent, or a vascular
targeting agent or a vascular disrupting agent. Exemplary anti-angiogenic agents include, but
are not limited to, VEGF inhibitors (e.g., anti-VEGF antibodies (e.g., bevacizumab); VEGF
receptor inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole); inhibitors of cell proliferatin and/or migration of
endothelial cells (e.g., carboxyamidotriazole, TNP-470); inhibitors of angiogenesis
stimulators (e.g., suramin), among others. A vascular-targeting agent (VTA) or vascular
disrupting agent (VDA) is designed to damage the vasculature (blood vessels) of cancer
tumors causing central necrosis (reviewed in, e.g., Thorpe, P.E. (2004) Clin. CancerRes.
Vol. 10:415-427). VTAs can be small-molecule. Exemplary small-molecule VTAs include,
but are not limited to, microtubule destabilizing drugs (e.g., combretastatin A-4 disodium
phosphate (CA4P), ZD6126, AVE8062, Oxi 4503); and vadimezan (ASA404).
 [000366]        It will be appreciated that anti-tumor antibodies labeled with isotopes have
been used successfully to destroy cells in solid tumors, as well as lymphomas/leukemias in
animal models, and in some cases in humans. Exemplary radioisotopes include:             90
                                                                                            Y, 1251131

producing ionizing radiation which causes multiple strand breaks in nuclear DNA, leading to

 WO 2013/169739                                                                   PCT/US2013/039901
cell death. The isotopes used to produce therapeutic conjugates typically produce high energy
a-or p-particles which have a short path length. Such radionuclides kill cells to which they
are in close proximity, for example neoplastic cells to which the conjugate has attached or has
entered. They have little or no effect on non-localized cells. Radionuclides are essentially
non-immunogenic.
 [000367]         It will also be appreciated that, in accordance with the teachings herein,
binding molecules can be conjugated to different radiolabels for diagnostic and therapeutic
purposes. To this end the aforementioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,682,134, 6,399,061, and 5,843,439
disclose radiolabeled therapeutic conjugates for diagnostic "imaging" of tumors before
administration of therapeutic antibody. "In2B8" conjugate comprises a murine monoclonal
antibody, 2B8, specific to human CD20 antigen, that is attached to        111 n via a bifunctional
chelator, i.e., MX-DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), which comprises a 1:1
mixture of 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyl-DTPA and 1-methyl-3-isothiocyanatobenzyl
DTPA.    111In is particularly preferred as a diagnostic radionuclide because between about I to
about 10 mCi can be safely administered without detectable toxicity; and the imaging data is
generally predictive of subsequent      90Y-labeled  antibody distribution. Most imaging studies
utilize 5 mCi   1 1 In-labeled  antibody, because this dose is both safe and has increased imaging
efficiency compared with lower doses, with optimal imaging occurring at three to six days
after antibody administration. See, for example, Murray, J. Nuc. Med 26: 3328 (1985) and
Carraguillo et al., J Nuc. Med. 26: 67 (1985).
 [000368]         In other embodiments, the cancer therapy includes an immune therapy used in
combination with the AHCM, other cancer therapies, and/or the microenvironment
modulator, described herein. Without wishing to be bound by theory, hypoxia and/or limited
perfusion are believed to cause immunosuppression and/or limit the efficacy of certain
immune therapies. AHCM, alone or in combination with therapies described herein can be
used to improve the efficacy of said immune therapies. Examples of immune therapies
include, but are not limited to, CTLA-4 blockade (e.g., an anti-CTLA-4 antibody (e.g.,
ipilimumab)); immune-based therapies (including, e.g., immune or dendritic cell- based
vaccines and antagonists of immune inhibitory signals or checkpoints); cancer vaccines, e.g.,
Sipuleucel-T (APC8015, trade name Provenge, manufactured by Dendreon Corporation) is a
therapeutic cancer vaccine for prostate cancer (CaP)); and adoptive T-cell-based therapies.
Exemplary immune-based therapies include, but are not limited to, e.g., immune or dendritic
cell- based vaccines (Seton-Rogers, S. (2012) Nature Reviews Cancer 12:230-231; Palucka,
K. et al. (2012) Nature Reviews Cancer 12:265-277); effector memory CD8+ T cells (Bird,

 [000369]        In yet other embodiments, the cancer therapy includes PDT used in
combination with the AHCM, other cancer therapies, and/or the microenvironment
modulator, described herein. In certain embodiments, PDT includes administration of a
photosensitizing agent (e.g., a porhyrin, a porpyrin precursor, a chorlin, or a phthalocyanine)
followed by irradiation at a wavelength corresponding to an absorbance band of the
sensitizer. In the presence of oxygen, a series of events lead to one or more of: cell death
(e.g., tumor cell death), damage to the microvasculature, or induction of a local inflammatory
reaction). PDT is reviewed in, e.g., Agostinis, P. et al. (2011) CA CancerJ Clin. 61:250
281.
 [000370]        In other embodiments, the cancer therapy includes an inhibitor of a cancer
stem cell (also referred to herein as a "cancer initiating cell"), used in combination with the
AHCM, other cancer therapies and/or the microenvironment modulator, described herein.
Without wishing to be bound by theory, hypoxia and cancer drugs (including anti-angiogenic
drugs) and radiation therapy are believed to increase the number of cancer stem cells.
AHCM, alone or in combination with, e.g., an inhibitor of a cancer stem cell, can be used to
reduce the production of these stem cells. Exemplary inhibitors of cancer stem cells that can
be used in combination include, but are not limited to, hedgehog (e.g., SMO) antagonists; and
Wnt pathway antagonists (e.g., antibody, OMP-18R5).
 [000371]        In certain embodiments, the AHCM agent, the microenvironment modulator
and/or the additional anti-cancer agent are administered concurrently (e.g., administration of
the two agents at the same time or day, or within the same treatment regimen) and/or
sequentially (e.g., administration of one agent over a period of time followed by
administration of the other agent for a second period of time, or within different treatment
regimens).
 [000372]        In one embodiment, the AHCM and/or the microenvironment modulator is
administered prior to the anti-cancer agent. In other embodiments, the AHCM and/or the
microenvironment modulator is administered prior to the anti-cancer agent, and followed by
concurrent administration of the AHCM, the microenvironment modulator and/or the anti
cancer agent.
 [000373]        In certain embodiments, the AHCM agent, the microenvironment modulator
and/or and the additional anti-cancer agent are administered concurrently. For example, in
certain embodiments, the AHCM agent, the microenvironment modulator and/or and the
                                                 79

 WO 2013/169739                                                             PCT/US2013/039901
additional anti-cancer agent are administered at the same time, on the same day, or within the
same treatment regimen. In certain embodiments, the AHCM agent and/or the
microenvironment modulator is administered before the additional anti-cancer agent on the
same day or within the same treatment regimen.
 [000374]       In certain embodiments, the AHCM agent and/or the microenvironment
modulator is concurrently administered with additional anti-cancer agent for a period of time,
after which point treatment with the additional anti-cancer agent is stopped and treatment
with the AHCM agent continues.
 [000375]       In other embodiments, the AHCM agent and/or the microenvironment
modulator is concurrently with the additional anti-cancer agent for a period of time, after
which point treatment with the AHCM agent and/or the microenvironment modulator is
stopped and treatment with the additional anti-cancer agent continues.
 [000376]       In certain embodiments, the AHCM agent, the microenvironment modulator
and/or the additional anti-cancer agent are administered sequentially. For example, in certain
embodiments, the AHCM agent is administered after the treatment regimen of the additional
anti-cancer agent and/or microenvironment modulator has ceased. In certain embodiments,
the additional anti-cancer agent is administered after the treatment regimen of the AHCM
agent and/or microenvironment modulator has ceased.
 [000377]       In some embodiments, the AHCM agent, microenvironment modulator and/or
the anti-cancer agent can be administered in a pulse administration. In other embodiments,
they can be administered as a pulse-chase administration, e.g., where an AHCM agent is
administered for a brief period of time (pulse), followed by administration of an anti-cancer
agent for a longer period of time (e.g., chase), or vice versa.
Diagnostic Methods and Assays
 [000378]       AHCM agents can be used to improve diagnosis, treatment, prevention and/or
prognosis of cancers in mammals, preferably humans. These diagnostic assays can be
performed in vivo or in vitro, such as, for example, on blood samples, biopsy tissue or
autopsy tissue.
 [000379]       Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of a
cancer, which involves measuring the expression level of target protein or transcript in tissue
or other cells or body fluid from an individual and comparing the measured expression level
with a standard target expression levels in normal tissue or body fluid, whereby an increase in
the expression level compared to the standard is indicative of a disorder.
 [000380]       One embodiment provides a method of detecting the presence of abnormal
                                                80

 WO 2013/169739                                                                 PCT/US2013/039901
hyperproliferative cells, e.g., precancerous or cancerous cells, in a fluid or tissue sample,
comprising assaying for the expression of the target in tissue or body fluid samples of an
individual and comparing the presence or level of target expression in the sample with the
presence or level of target expression in a panel of standard tissue or body fluid samples,
where detection of target expression or an increase in target expression over the standards is
indicative of aberrant hyperproliferative cell growth.
 [000381]       One aspect of the invention is a method for the in vivo detection or diagnosis
of a cancer in a subject, preferably a mammal and most preferably a human. In one
embodiment, diagnosis comprises: a) administering (for example, parenterally,
subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally) to a subject an effective amount of a labeled antibody or
fragment thereof against a cancer antigen, to a subject that has been treated with an AHCM or
is being treated with the AHCM; b) waiting for a time interval following the administering
for permitting the labeled antibody to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where
target is expressed (and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level); c)
determining background level; and d) detecting the labeled molecule in the subject, such that
detection of labeled molecule above the background level indicates that the subject has a
particular disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of target. Background level
can be determined by various methods including comparing the amount of labeled molecule
detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.
 [000382]       It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging
system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic
images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of
radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of, e.g.,    99Tc. The
labeled binding molecule, e.g., antibody or antibody fragment, will then preferentially
accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging
is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., "Immunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies
and Their Fragments." (Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging: The RadiochemicalDetection of
Cancer, S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982).
 [000383]       Depending on several variables, including the type of label used and the mode
of administration, the time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled
molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject and for unbound labeled
molecule to be cleared to background level is 6 to 48 hours or 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours.
In another embodiment the time interval following administration is 5 to 20 days or 7 to 10
days.
 [000384]       Presence of the labeled molecule can be detected in the patient using methods
                                                 81

 WO 2013/169739                                                              PCT/US2013/039901
known in the art for in vivo scanning. These methods depend upon the type of label used.
Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate method for detecting a particular
label. Methods and devices that may be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention
include, but are not limited to, computed tomography (CT), whole body scan such as position
emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and sonography, X
radiography, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR), CAT-scans or electron spin
resonance imaging (ESR).
Pharmaceutical Compositions
 [000385]       The compositions described herein can be incorporated into a variety of
formulations for administration. More particularly, the compositions can be formulated into
pharmaceutical compositions by combination with appropriate, pharmaceutically acceptable
carriers or diluents, and can be formulated into preparations in semi-solid, liquid or gaseous
forms; such as capsules, powders, granules, gels, slurries, ointments, solutions, suppositories,
injections, inhalants and aerosols. As such, administration of the compositions can be
achieved in various ways, including oral, buccal, rectal, parenteral, intraperitoneal,
intradermal, transdermal, intratracheal administration. Moreover, the compositions can be
administered in a local rather than systemic manner, in a depot or sustained release
formulation.
 [000386]       In addition, the compositions can be formulated with common excipients,
diluents or carriers, and compressed into tablets, or formulated as elixirs or solutions for
convenient oral administration, or administered by the intramuscular or intravenous routes.
The compositions can be administered transdermally, and can be formulated as sustained
release dosage forms and the like. Compositions can be administered alone, in combination
with each other, or they can be used in combination with other known compounds (discussed
herein).
 [000387]       Suitable formulations for use in the present invention are found in
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1985). Moreover, for a review of methods for drug
delivery, see, Langer (1990) Science 249:1527-1533. The pharmaceutical compositions
described herein can be manufactured in a manner that is known to those of skill in the art,
e.g., by mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying,
encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes. The following methods and excipients
are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.
 [000388]       For oral administration, the compositions can be formulated by combining
with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that are known in the art. Such carriers enable the
                                                82

 WO 2013/169739                                                                PCT/US2013/039901
compounds to be formulated as pills, capsules, emulsions, lipophilic and hydrophilic
suspensions, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a
patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by mixing the
compositions with an excipient and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable
auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular,
fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations
such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum
tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium
carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).
 [000389]        For administration by inhalation, the compositions for use according to the
present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation
from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g.,
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide
or other suitable gas, or from propellant-free, dry-powder inhalers. In the case of a
pressurized aerosol the dosage unit can be determined by providing a valve to deliver a
metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, e.g., gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator
can be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such
as lactose or starch.
 [000390]        The compositions can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection,
e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection can be presented in
unit dosage form, e.g., in ampules or in multidose containers, with an added preservative. The
compositions can take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous
vehicles, and can contain formulator agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing
agents.
 [000391]        The compositions can also be formulated in rectal compositions such as
suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as
cocoa butter, carbowaxes, polyethylene glycols or other glycerides, all of which melt at body
temperature, yet are solidified at room temperature.
 [000392]        In addition, the compositions can also be formulated as a depot preparation.
Such long acting formulations can be administered by implantation (for example
subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the
compounds can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example
as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble
derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.
 [000393]        Lipid particles (e.g., liposomes) and emulsions are known examples of
                                                  83

 WO 2013/169739                                                                PCT/US2013/039901
delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic drugs. Long-circulating, e.g., stealth, liposomes
can be employed. Such liposomes are generally described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556. The
compounds of the present invention can also be administered by controlled release means
and/or delivery devices such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899;
3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719.
 [000394]        Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention include
compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in a therapeutically effective
amount. The amount of composition administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject
being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of
administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician. Determination of an effective
amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the
detailed disclosure provided herein. In general, a suitable daily dose of an AHCM agent
and/or a cancer therapeutic can be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose
effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose can generally depend upon
the factors described above.
 [000395]        The subject receiving this treatment is any animal in need, including primates,
in particular humans, equines, cattle, swine, sheep, poultry, dogs, cats, mice and rats.
 [000396]        The compounds can be administered daily, every other day, three times a
week, twice a week, weekly, or bi-weekly. The dosing schedule can include a "drug
holiday," i.e., the drug can be administered for two weeks on, one week off, or three weeks
on, one week off, or four weeks on, one week off, etc., or continuously, without a drug
holiday. The compounds can be administered orally, intravenously, intraperitoneally,
topically, transdermally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally, sublingually, or by
any other route.
 [000397]        Since the AHCM agents are administered in combination with other
treatments (such as additional chemotherapeutics, radiation or surgery) the doses of each
agent or therapy can be lower than the corresponding dose for single-agent therapy. The
determination of the mode of administration and the correct dosage is well within the
knowledge of the skilled clinician.
 [000398]        In certain embodiments, the AHCM (alone or in combination with the
microenvironment modulator and/or cancer therapy) is formulated for oral, subcutaneous,
intravenous or intraperitoneal administration. In one embodiment, the AHCM (alone or in
combination with the microenvironment modulator and/or cancer therapy) is formulated for
oral administration (e.g., an oral tablet or pill).
 [000399]        As described in the Examples herein, substantially continuous administration
                                                   84

 WO 2013/169739                                                                      PCT/US2013/039901
of an AHCM (e.g., via a subcutaneous pump) causes a greater reduction in collagen content
and/or tumor size than single or pulsatile administration of the AHCM. Thus, it may be
desirable to formulate and/or administered the AHCM (alone or in combination with the
microenvironment modulator and/or cancer therapy) substantially continuously.
 [000400]         In one embodiment, the AHCM (alone or in combination) is administered
substantially continuously over a pre-determined period of, or at least 15, 30, 45 minutes; a
period of, or at least, 1, 5, 10, 24 hours; a period of, or at least, 2, 5, 10, 14 days; a period of,
or at least, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 weeks; a period of, or at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 months; a

such that an AHCM dose as described herein (alone or in combination) is administered and/or
maintained in the subject for a pre-determined period (e.g., a period as described herein).
 [000401]         The AHCM (alone or in combination with the microenvironment modulator
and/or cancer therapy) is in a controlled- or extended release formulation, dosage form, or
device. Exemplary formulations and devices for controlled or extended release are known in
the art. For example, formulations containing polymer matrices, such as
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, gels, osmotic systems, liposomes and combination thereof
can be used to provide the desired release kinetics.
 [000402]         In one embodiment, the AHCM is administered via an implantable infusion
device, e.g., a pump (e.g., a subcutaneous pump), an implant or a depot. Implantable infusion
devices typically include a housing containing a liquid reservoir which can be filled
transcutaneously by a hypodermic needle penetrating a fill port septum. The medication
reservoir is generally coupled via an internal flow path to a device outlet port for delivering
the liquid through a catheter to a patient body site. Typical infusion devices also include a
controller and a fluid transfer mechanism, such as a pump or a valve, for moving the liquid
from the reservoir through the internal flow path to the device's outlet port.
Nanoparticles
 [000403]         AHCM agents described herein, the anti-cancer agents (e.g., low molecular
weight, mid-molecular weight anti-cancer agents described herein), or both, can be packaged
in nanoparticles.
 [000404]         Typically nanoparticles are from 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 45, 50, 75, 100, 150 or
200 nm or 200-1,000, e.g., 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 45, 50, 75, 100, 150, or 200, or 20 or 30 or
50-400 mn in diameter. Smaller particles tend to be cleared more rapidly form the system.
Drugs can be intrapped within or coupled, e.g., covalent coupled, or otherwise adhered, to
nanoparticles.

nanoparticles and can be used to can be used to deliver agents described herein. DOXIL@ is
 an example of a liposomic nanoparticle. Solid lipid nanoparticles for the delivery on anti
 cancer agents are descripbed in Serpe et al. (2004) Eur. J Pharm.Bioparm. 58:673-680 and
Lu et al. (20060 Eur. J Pharm. Sci. 28: 86-95. Polymer-based nanoparticles, e.g., PLGA
 based nanoparticles can be used to deliver agents described herein. These tend to rely on
 biodegradable backbone with the theraeutic agent intercalated (with or without covalent
 linkage to the polymer) in a matrix of polymer. PLGA is a widely used in polymeric
nanoparticles, see Hu et al. (2009) J. Control. Release 134:55-61; Cheng et al. (2007)
Biomaterials 28:869-876, and Chan et al. (2009) Biomaterials 30:1627-1634. PEGylated
PLGA-based nanoparticles can also be used to deliver anti-cancer agents, see, e.g., Danhhier
 et al., (2009) J Control. Release 133:11-17, Gryparis et al (2007) Eur. J Pharm.Biopharm.
 67:1-8. Metal-based, e.g., gold-based nanoparticles can also be used to dleiver anti-cancer
 agents. Protien-based, e.g., albumin-based nanoparticles can be used to deliver agents
 described herein. E.g., an agent can be bound to nanoparticles of human albumin. An
 exemplary anti-cancer agent/protein nanoparticle is Abraxane®, in which paclitaxel is pund
to nanparticles of albumin.
 [000406]          Nanoparticles can employ active targeting, passive targeting or both. Active
targeting can rely on inclusion of a ligand tht binds with a target at or near a preselected site,
 e.g., a solid tumor. Passive targeting nanoparticles can diffuse and accumalte at sites of
 interest, e.g., sites characterized by excessivley leaky micorvasculatiure, e.g., as seen in
tumors and sites of inflammation.

                                           EXAMPLES
 [000409]        The invention now being generally described, it will be more readily
understood by reference to the following examples, which are included merely for purposes
of illustration of certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not
intended to limit the invention.
 [000410]        In Examples 1-6 below, the inventors assessed if an AHCM agent, for
example, losartan - a clinically approved angiotensin II receptor antagonist generally for
treatment of hypertension - can enhance the penetration and efficacy of nanomedicine, e.g.,
via an anti-fibrotic effect. Although nanotherapeutics have offered new hope for cancer
treatment, their clinical efficacy is modest (Jain RK, et al. (2010) Nat Rev Clin Oncol 7:653
664; Davis ME, et al. (2008) Nat Rev DrugDiscov 7:771-782; Peer D, et al. (2007) Nat
Nanotechnol 2:751-760; and Torchilin VP (2005) Nat Rev Drug Discov 4:145-160). Without
wishing to be bound by theory, the dense collagen network in tumors can generally reduce
the penetration and efficacy of nanotherapeutics. This is partly because their penetration is
hindered specially in fibrotic tumors where the small interfibrillar spacing in the interstitium
retards the movement of particles larger than 10 nanometers (Netti PA, et al. (2000) Cancer
Res 60:2497-2503; Pluen A, et al. (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:4628-4633;
Ramanujan S, et al. (2002) Biophys J83:1650-1660 and Brown E, et al. (2003) Nat Med
9:796-800). Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (DOXIL*), approved by the FDA, and
oncolytic viruses, currently in multiple clinical trials, represent two nanotherapeutics whose
size (~ 100 nm) hinders their intratumoral distribution and therapeutic effectiveness
(Nemunaitis J, et al. (2001) J Clin Oncol 19:289-298). Matrix modifiers like bacterial
                                                 98

 WO 2013/169739                                                                 PCT/US2013/039901
collagenase, relaxin, and matrix metalloproteinase -1 and -8 have been used to modify the
collagen or proteoglycan network in tumors and have improved the efficacy of intratumorally
(i.t.) injected oncolytic viruses (Brown E, et al. (2003) Nat Med 9:796-800; McKee TD, et al.
(2006) CancerRes 66:2509-2513; Mok W, et al. (2007) CancerRes 67:10664-10668;
Ganesh S, et al. (2007) CancerRes 67:4399-4407; and Kim J-H, et al. (2006) JNatl Cancer
Inst 98:1482-1493). In addition, relaxin can improve transport through the tumor matrix, but
may not facilitate the delivery of low molecular weight agents (US 6,719,977). However,
these agents may produce normal tissue toxicity (e.g., bacterial collagenase) or increase the
risk of tumor progression (e.g., relaxin, matrix metalloproteinases).
 [000411]        Losartan (Johnston CI (1995) Lancet 346:1403-1407) - approved to control
hypertension in patients - does not have many of these safety risks. Furthermore, in addition
to its antihypertensive properties, losartan is also an antifibrotic agent that has been shown to
reduce the incidence of cardiac and renal fibrosis (Habashi JP, et al. (2006) Science 312:117
 121; and. Cohn RD, et al. (2007) Nat Med 13:204-210). The antifibrotic effects of losartan
are caused, in part, by the suppression of active transforming growth factor-plI (TGF-p1)
levels via an angiotensin II type I receptor (AGTR1) mediated down-regulation of TGF-p31
activators like thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) (Habashi JP, et al. (2006) Science 312:117-121;
Cohn RD, et al. (2007) Nat Med 13:204-210; Lavoie P, et al. (2005) JHypertens 23:1895
 1903; Chamberlain JS (2007) Nat Med 13:125-126; and Dietz HC (2010) J Clin Invest
 120:403-407).
 [000412]        As demonstrated below, an AHCM agent, e.g., losartan inhibited collagen I
production by carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from breast cancer biopsies.
Additionally, an AHCM agent, e.g., losartan, led to a dose-dependent reduction in stromal
collagen in desmoplastic models of human breast, pancreatic and skin tumors in mice.
Furthermore, an AHCM agent, e.g., losartan improved the distribution and therapeutic
efficacy of intratumorally injected oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (HSV). Further, an
AHCM agent, e.g., losartan also enhanced the efficacy of intravenously injected pegylated
liposomal doxorubicin (DOXIL*). Accordingly, administration of an AHCM agent, e.g.,
losartan, in combination with a cancer therapeutic (e.g., a cancer nanotherapeutic) can
enhance the efficacy of nanotherapeutics in patients with desmoplastic tumors.
 [000413]        Using a dose that has minimal effects on mean arterial blood pressure
(MABP), the inventors have shown below that an AHCM agent, e.g., losartan reduces
collagen I levels in four tumor models - a spontaneous mouse mammary carcinoma (FVB
MMTV PyVT), an orthotopic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (L3.6pl), and subcutaneously
implanted fibrosarcoma (HSTS26T) and melanoma (Mu89). Further, the inventors have
                                                 99

 WO 2013/169739                                                                PCT/US2013/039901
shown below that an AHCM agent, e.g., Losartan, can also improve the intratumoral
penetration of nanoparticles injected intratumorally (i.t.) or intravenously (i.v.).
 [000414]        Additionally, the inventors assessed how an AHCM agent, e.g., losartan, can
affect the distribution and efficacy of oncolytic HSV administered i.t. - a widely used method
of administration in patients for gene therapy (Hu JC, et al. (2006) Clin Cancer Res 12:6737
6747; Senzer NN, et al. (2009) J Clin Oncol 27:5763-5771; Breitbach CJ, et al. (2010)
Cytokine Growth FactorRev 21:85-89) - and the efficacy of i.v.-administered DOXIL*. As
shown below, an AHCM agent, e.g., Losartan, improved the efficacy of both i.t.-injected
oncolytic HSV and i.v. -administered, DOXIL*. The results from the intratumoral (i.t.)
experiments indicate that an AHCM agent, e.g., losartan, can enhance nanoparticle
penetration in the interstitial space by improving interstitial transport. Additionally, the
findings from the intravenous (i.v.) studies indicate that an AHCM agent (e.g., losartan) can
improve the efficacy of systemically administered nanotherapeutics to fibrotic solid tumors,
even highly fibrotic solid tumors, such as pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Accordingly, an
AHCM agent, e.g., losartan, an FDA approved antihypertensive drug, can be used to improve
the efficacy of various nanotherapeutics in multiple tumor types.
Example 1: Losartan inhibits collagen I synthesis by carcinoma associated fibroblasts
(CAFs)
 [000415]        The effect of losartan on the expression and activation of TGF-p31, and
collagen I production by mammary CAFs was examined (Fig. 1). Losartan reduces TGF-p1
activation and collagen I production in carcinoma associated fibroblasts in vitro. Cells were
treated with 10 pimol/L of losartan for 24 hrs. Losartan reduced by 9 0% the active-TGF-p31
levels while total TGF-p31 levels were unaffected. There was a corresponding       2 7 % decrease
in collagen I levels. The reduction in active-TGF-p 1 and collagen I was statistically
significant (student t-test p<0.05). Since collagen in tumors is mostly produced by CAFs, the
effect of losartan in the collagen content in tumors was examined.
Example 2: Losartan decreases collagen I in tumors in a dose-dependent manner
 [000416]        To determine the dose-response of losartan on intratumoral collagen levels,
 10, 20, and 60 mg/kg/day of losartan were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.), and performed
second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging of fibrillar collagen in HSTS26T tumors in
dorsal skin fold chambers (Figs. 2A-2B) and collagen I immunostaining of tumor sections
(Figs. 3A-3D). While the SHG signal intensity can include signals contributed from collagen
I and other fibril-forming collagens (e.g., collagen III or V), collagen I is generally the
                                                 100

 WO 2013/169739                                                              PCT/US2013/039901
predominant collagen type in most soft tissues (Gelse K, et al. (2003) Adv Drug Deliv Rev
55:1531-1546), and thus contributes as the main source of the SHG signal. Additionally, in
human pancreatic tumors collagen I is the main fibrillar collagen with significantly lower
levels of collagen V (Mollenhauer J, et al. (1987) Pancreas2:14-24). Losartan doses of 20
and 60 mg/kg/day significantly reduced the intratumoral SHG signal intensity, whereas the
lowest dose of 10 mg/kg/day did not have a significant effect on the SHG signal intensity
(Figs. 2A and 2B). The injection of losartan at 60 and 20 mg/kg/day also significantly
reduced the collagen I immunostaining in HSTS26T tumors by 65% and 42%, respectively
(Fig. 3). Treatment with the 60mg/kg/day dose led to the highest reduction in collagen I, with
a reduction in the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) by 35 mm Hg (p<0.04; Fig. 4). In the
following Examples, 20 mg/kg/day dose was used (but it by no means limits the use of other
doses in the methods described herein). After 2 weeks of losartan treatment, the 20
mg/kg/day dose reduced the MABP by 10 mm Hg (Fig. 4), thus maintaining the MABP
within the normal range (70 - 95 mmHg) for SCID mice (Kristjansen PE, et al. (1993)
CancerRes 53:4764-4766). It also had no detectable effect on mouse weight (average of
26±lg treated vs. 26±lg control). The 20mg/kg/day dose decreased collagen I
immunostaining in four tumor types - FVB MMTV PyVT, L3.6pl, HSTS26T, and Mu89 - by
47% (p<0.05), 50% (p<0.0 3 ), 44% (p<0.04), and 20% (p<0.02), respectively (Figs. 5A-5D).
Example 3: Losartan decreases TSP-1 expression in tumors
 [000417]        TSP-I is a key regulator of TGF-p31 activation and losartan has been reported
to reduce TSP-I expression and TGF-p31 activation in mouse models of Marfan's syndrome
and muscular dystrophy (Dietz HC (2010) JClin Invest 120:403-407). As shown herein, the
measurement of protein levels in homogenized HSTS26T tumors showed that losartan did not
affect total TGF-plI levels but significantly reduced TSP-1, active TGF-p31, and collagen I
levels (Fig. 6). Losartan also decreased the TSP-I immunostaining in HSTS26T (73%
p<0.04) and Mu89 (24% p<0.03) (Figs. 7A-7B). In both Mu89 and HSTS26T tumors the
immunostaining patterns for TSP-I (Figs. 7A-7B) and collagen I (Figs. 5C-5D) were closely
matched. The inventors detected high levels of TSP-I and collagen I in the tumor margin,
while losartan induced obvious reductions in TSP-I and collagen I levels in the tumor center
(Figs. 5C, 7A). These data indicate that the reduction in collagen I levels can result in part
from the decreased activation of TGF-p1 due to the losartan-induced reduction in TSP-I
expression.

WO 2013/169739                                                                PCT/US2013/039901
Example 4: Losartan improves the intratumor distribution of nanoparticles and
nanotherapeutics
[000418]         Based on the previous studies on the tumor interstitial matrix (Pluen A, et al.
(2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:4628-4633 and Brown E, et al. (2003) Nat Med 9:796
800), the inventors then sought to determine if a decrease in collagen content by Losartan can
improve the intratumoral distribution of nanoparticles. The inventors therefore measured the
intratumoral distribution of fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles (100 mn diameter) in three
different tumor types - HSTS26T, Mu89, and L3.6pl - after an i.t. or i.v. injection. In mice
injected i.t. with nanoparticles, losartan improved nanoparticle accumulation and penetration
in the tumor center (Fig. 8A; HSTS26T p<0.001, Mu89 p<0.00 1). Conversely, there was
little or no nanoparticle accumulation in the center of control tumors. Most of the injected
nanoparticles in control tumors were found in the tumor margin and around the needle
insertion point (Fig. 8A). The inventors also determined the effects of losartan on the
intratumoral distribution of oncolytic HSV. In both HSTS26T and Mu89, losartan
significantly increased the intratumoral spread of HSV injected intratumorally (Fig. 8B).
While these findings show that losartan increases the distribution of large nanoparticles, the
inventors also determined that in HSTS26T, losartan increased interstitial diffusion of IgG
(Fig. 9) and the mean interstitial matrix pore radius - from 9.91±0.43nm to 11.78±0.41nm,
calculated based on IgG diffusion data (Nugent U, et al. (1984) CancerRes 44:238-244).
[000419]         The inventors then assessed the effect of losartan on blood vessel perfusion
and the intratumoral distribution of i.v. injected nanoparticles in mice with orthotopic
pancreatic tumors (L3.6pl). The intratumoral accumulation and penetration of beads away
from blood vessels was significantly higher in losartan-treated tumors (Fig. 8C and Fig. 10).
These results indicate that losartan improves the transport and distribution of both i.t. and/or
i.v. injected nanoparticles.
Example 5: Losartan improves the efficacy of DOXIL* and oncolytic HSV
[000420]         The inventors then determined if losartan could improve the efficacy of i.t.
injected oncolytic HSV and i.v. injected DOXIL@. The effect of losartan combined with the
i.t. injection of HSV was determined in HSTS26T and Mu89 tumors. The administration of
losartan alone did not affect the tumor growth rate (Figs. 11A and 11B). However, when
animals were treated with losartan for two weeks before i.t. injection of HSV, losartan
significantly delayed the growth in both Mu89 and HSTS26T tumors-(Figs. 11A and 11B).
The volume of HSTS26T tumors remained stable for up to 9 weeks in 5 0% of mice treated
with losartan and HSV. For the Mu89 tumors, mice treated with losartan and HSV had a
                                                 102

delay in tumor growth. However, the growth delay in Mu89 tumors was only transient, 4
weeks after the virus injection all the tumors were 3-fold larger than the starting treatment
size.
 [000421]        To determine if losartan could increase the efficacy of a nanotherapeutic
injected i.v., mice with orthotopic pancreatic tumors (L3.6pl) were treated with DOXIL@ and
losartan. Four weeks after tumor implantation and two weeks after initiation of losartan
treatment (20mg/kg/day), the inventors treated mice with a sub-anti-tumor dose (i.e., a dose
that is not effective for treatment of cancer, e.g., a dose that is not effective to inhibit or
prevent tumor growth and/or progression) of DOXIL@ (4mg/kg, i.v.). After 7 days, losartan
or DOXIL alone did not affect the mean tumor weight (Fig.         I1C). However, in mice treated
with losartan and DOXIL@ the tumors were significantly smaller (p<O.001) than in mice that
received DOXIL@ alone (Figs. 11C and 11D).
Example 6: The pattern of collagen distribution regulates the effectiveness of losartan
 [000422]        To investigate the differences in response between HSTS26T and Mu89 to the
losartan-HSV combination therapy, the inventors determined the HSV infection and necrosis
patterns 21 days after the i.t. injection of HSV. Figs. 12A and 12B show striking differences
between the collagen structure in Mu89 (Fig. 12A) and HSTS26T (Fig. 12B) tumors,
respectively. Without wishing to be bound by theory, these differences in the collagen
structure altered the virus propagation in these tumor types. In Mu89 tumors the collagen
fiber network was well organized and formed finger-like projections into the tumor (Figs.
12A and 13A). These projections divided the tumor into distinct compartments, which could
not be crossed by HSV particles, thus the virus infection and resulting necrosis was restricted
to the infected compartments (Fig. 14A). Losartan treatment disrupted the collagen
projections to some extent but did not completely eliminate them (Fig. 12A). As a result,
there was some crossover of virus particles between compartments in losartan-treated Mu89
tumors. By varying Losartan and/or HSV concentration the amount or extent of collagen
projections to be disrupted (e.g., partial or complete disruption) can be modulated, and thus in
turn affect the distribution of the HSV particles within the tumor. In contrast, in HSTS26T
tumors the dense collagen network was more diffuse, less fibrillar and less
compartmentalized (Figs. 12B and 13B). The dense collagen network seemed to slow down
virus propagation but did not completely impede it, resulting in increased virus propagation
and a more diffuse pattern of necrosis in this tumor (Fig. 14A).

 [000423]       The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been reported to play a
role in the regulation and production of extracellular matrix components (Cook KL, et al.
(2010) CancerRes 70:8319-8328; Rodriguez-Vita J, et al. (2005) Circulation111:2509
2517; and Wolf G (2006) Kidney Int 70:1914-1919). Angiotensin II has been reported to
stimulate collagen production via both TGF-$31 dependent and independent pathways (Yang
F, et al. (2009) Hypertension 54:877-884). Losartan and other RAAS inhibitors have
reported to reduce the levels of collagen I and III, and basement membrane collagen IV in
various experimental models of fibrosis (Toblli JE, et al. (2002) J Urol 168:1550-1555 and
Boffa JJ, et al. (2003) JAm Soc Nephrol 14:1132-1144), and reverse renal and cardiac
fibrosis in hypertensive patients (Lim DS, et al. (2001) Circulation103:789-791 and Khalil
A, et al. (2000) J Urol 164:186-191). Using four different tumor types, the inventors have
demonstrated herein for the first time that losartan also inhibits collagen I production in
tumors.
 [000424]        Other matrix modifiers like bacterial collagenase, relaxin, and matrix
metalloproteinase -1 and -8 have been reported to modify the collagen or proteoglycan
network in tumors and have improved the efficacy of oncolytic virus injected intratumorally
(Brown E, et al. (2003) Nat Med 9:796-800; McKee TD, et al. (2006) CancerRes 66:2509
2513; Mok W, et al. (2007) CancerRes 67:10664-10668; Ganesh S, et al. (2007) CancerRes
67:4399-4407; and Kim J-H, et al. (2006) JNatl CancerInst 98:1482-1493). However, these
agents may produce normal tissue toxicity (e.g., bacterial collagenase) or increase the risk of
tumor progression (e.g. relaxin, matrix metalloproteinases). In contrast, losartan (Johnston CI
(1995) Lancet 346:1403-1407) has limited side effects. Losartan has been reported to reduce
the incidence of metastasis in some tumor types (Arafat HA, et al. (2007) JAm Coll Surg
204:996-1005).
 [000425]       As shown in the Examples above, an AHCM agent, e.g., losartan, can reduce
collagen content and in turn improve interstitial transport and the intratumoral distribution of
nanoparticles and nanotherapeutics. The inventors also discovered that the organization of the
collagen fibrillar network can affect nanoparticle distribution. This was striking because of
significant differences in the structural organization of fibrillar collagen I between Mu89 and
HSTS26T. In Mu89 tumors, thick bundles of fibrillar collagen I surround the tumor margins
and form finger-like projections, which subdivide the tumor mass into isolated compartments
and confine the viral infection to the injection site / isolated compartments (Figs. 12A and
13A). In contrast HSTS26T tumors have a mesh-like collagen structure, which hinders the
virus spread but does not restrict viral particles to the injection site (Figs. 12B and 13B). The
slower growth rate of HSTS26T than Mu89 tumors could also explain in part the enhanced
                                                 104

 WO 2013/169739                                                                  PCT/US2013/039901
efficacy of losartan combined with HSV in HSTS26T tumors. Accordingly, not only the
collagen content but also the collagen network organization plays an important role in
limiting the penetration of large therapeutics in tumors. Depending on the content and/or
organization of the collagen network within certain tumors, doses, administration methods
and/or frequency of an AHCM agent (e.g., losartan) and/or a cancer therapeutic (e.g., HSV)
can be adjusted accordingly.
 [000426]        Pancreatic cancer patients treated with cytotoxic agents have a very high
frequency of relapse with a 5 year survival of less than 5% (Li J, et al. (2010) AAPS J
 12:223-232). The poor vascular supply and increased fibrotic content of pancreatic tumors
most likely play a significant role in limiting the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxics (Olive
KP, et al. (2009) Science 324:1457-1461). The inventors show - in a mouse orthotopic
model of human pancreatic cancer (L3.6pl) - that losartan increases both the intratumoral
dispersion and extravascular penetration distance of i.v. injected nanoparticles. The increased
distribution and extravasation of nanoparticles indicate that losartan can not only improve
interstitial transport - as shown with the i.t. injections of nanoparticles and virus - but also
transvascular transport. When used alone, losartan did not affect the growth of pancreatic
tumors or the weight of treated mice. However, losartan combined with DOXIL@ reduced the
tumor sizes by 50% compared to DOXIL* treatment alone. These findings indicate that
losartan increased the tumor penetration and distribution, and enhanced efficacy of DOXIL*
injected i.v. in orthotopic pancreatic carcinomas in mice.
 [000427]        The effects of losartan are not limited to the interstitial space. Modifications to
the RAAS system can also inhibit angiogenesis (Fujita M, et al. (2005) Carcinogenesis
26:271-279) or alter tumor blood flow (Jain R, et al. (1984) IEEE Trans Son Ultrason
31:504-526 and Zlotecki RA, et al. (1993) CancerRes 53:2466-2468). Losartan-blockade of
AGTR1 can also reduce the production of VEGF by cancer cells and the expression of
VEGFR1 in endothelial cells, and inhibit tumor angiogenesis and growth (Otake AH, et al.
(2010) Cancer Chemother Pharmacol66:79-87 and Noguchi R, et al. (2009) Oncol Rep
22:355-360). As shown herein, losartan did not affect tumor growth or the vascular density in
HSTS26T tumors. Losartan can also reduce the proliferation of tumor cells expressing
AGTR1 (Rhodes DR, et al. (2009) ProcNatl Acad Sci USA 106:10284-10289). The
inventors did not find a decrease in cancer cell proliferation (Fig. 15) or tumor size in the
human melanoma Mu89, which express AGTR1 (Fig. 16). The difference between their
study and other prior studies might be due to differences in dosage. For example, in prior
studies the dose of losartan was up to 15 fold higher than what was used in the inventors'
study (Otake AH, et al. (2010) Cancer Chemother Pharmacol66:79-87). The inventors have
                                                  105

 WO 2013/169739                                                               PCT/US2013/039901
shown herein that a low dose of losartan that is ineffective for treatment of cancer by itself
alone, can be used to improve the efficacy of a cancer therapy or an anti-cancer agent (even at
a sub-therapuetic level) for treatment of cancer. Further, the low dose of losartan can allow
for a more clinically translatable protocol and avoid hypotensive complications.
 [000428]       Patients receiving RAAS antagonists have reduced incidence of breast and
lung cancer (Lever AF, et al. (1998) Lancet 352:179-184). Different mechanisms have been
reported to discuss the anti-tumor properties of RAAS antagonists when used at high
concentrations (Ager El, et al. (2008) Carcinogenesis29:1675-1684; Lindberg H, et al.
(2004) Acta Oncol 43:142-152; Miyajima A, et al. (2002) CancerRes 62:4176-4179 and
Rosenthal T, et al. (2009) JHum Hypertens 23:623-635). AGTR1 signaling has been
reported to increase the proliferation of stromal and tumor cells, and the transcription of
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that promote cancer cell migration and
dissemination (Deshayes F, Nahmias C (2005) EndocrinolMetab 16:293-299). The
reduction in active TGF-Bl levels by RAAS antagonists administered at high concentrations
have been reported to reduce metastasis (Jakowlew SB (2006) CancerMetastasisRev
25:435-457). Accordingly, in addition to improving the delivery of antitumor agents, losartan
can also inhibit tumor progression and metastasis. By way of example only, losartan
administered at a low dose (e.g., a dose not effective to reduce or prevent metastasis if
administered alone) with an anti-metatstic agent (e.g., at a dose less than what is typically
administered by itself for treatment and/or prevention of metastasis) can be used to inhibit
tumor progression and metastasis.
 [000429]       In order to use losartan as an adjunct in the treatment of cancer patients it is
important to consider dosing and treatment schedules along with potential side effects.
Results from the dose and time dependent studies presented herein indicate a minimum of
two weeks of losartan administration prior to anti-tumor treatment. To obtain maximum
effects in patients, it might be prudent to initiate losartan treatment two weeks prior to and
continue it during the entire antitumor treatment schedule. Since long-term losartan therapy
in hypertensive patients has been shown to have limited and manageable side effects and
many antitumor agents (e.g., anti-VEGF drugs) have been shown to increase blood pressure
(Ager El, et al. (2008) Carcinogenesis29:1675-1684), extended losartan co-therapy can be
beneficial to cancer patients. In some embodiments, patients can be treated with a dose of
2mg/kg/day losartan, which is generally used for the treatment of patients with Marfan's
syndrome (Brooke BS, et al. (2008) NEngl JMed 358:2787-2795).
 [000430]       Although losartan and ARBs have limited side effects, losartan therapy is not
recommended for patients with known renal disease. Losartan can induce renal insufficiency
                                                  106

WO 2013/169739                                                                 PCT/US2013/039901
in patients with renal microvascular or macrovascular disease, or congestive heart failure
(Sica DA, et al. (2005) Clin Pharmacokinet44:797-814). Hyperkalemia can also occur in
patients with poor renal function or patients who are concomitantly receiving potassium
supplements or potassium sparing diuretics. Finally, angioedema caused by high levels of
circulating angiotensin II can occur in patients treated with losartan (Sica DA, et al. (2005)
Clin Pharmacokinet44:797-814).
[000431]        Tumor drug resistance is generally believed to occur at many levels including
increased drug efflux, drug inactivation, evasion from apoptosis, and alterations in target
pathways (Longley DB, et al. (2005) JPathol205:275-292). Since losartan is not an
antitumor agent, tumor resistance to losartan therapy after extended treatment can result from
other mechanisms. Given that TGF-Bl activation is induced by different agents like MMPs
and integrins in addition to TSP-1, tumor resistance to losartan could result from changes in
TGF-B 1 activation and signaling. However, long-term losartan therapy after myocardial
infarction has been reported as not being associated with a reduction in antifibrotic properties
(Schieffer B, et al. (1994) Circulation89:2273-2282).
[000432]        As shown in Examples 1-6, the inventors show that losartan reduces the
stromal collagen content in tumors and improves the penetration and therapeutic efficacy of
nanoparticles (DOXIL*, HSV) delivered both i.t. and i.v. Losartan also exhibits vasoactive
and anti-metastatic properties that could increase its clinical application. Furthermore, since
losartan is already approved for clinical use, it represents a safe and effective adjunct for
improving the efficacy of nanotherapeutics in cancer patients.
Exemplary Experimental Protocols for Examples 1-6
Exemplary Materialsand Methods
[000433]        A more detailed description of techniques is presented in the Additional
Materials and Methods section below.
[000434]        Briefly, CAFs isolated from human breast cancer biopsies were treated with
losartan for 24 hrs prior to measurements of collagen and cytokine levels. Protein assays were
done with commercial ELISA kits. All animal experiments were done with approval of the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Losartan was administered i.p. at
concentrations of 10, 20 or 60 mg/kg/day for up to 2 weeks. Mice were treated with HSV
(i.t.) and DOXIL* (i.v. via tail vein) after 2 weeks of losartan treatment. Excised tumors were
either snap frozen for biochemical analyses or fixed in paraformaldehyde, and embedded in
paraffin or optimum cutting temperature compound (OCT) for immunohistochemistry.

Cell culture
 [000435]        CAFs were isolated from human breast cancer biopsies using an art
recognized protocol, e.g., the protocol described in Orimo A, et al. (2005) Cell 121:335-348.
CAFs were plated in 24 well plates at a concentration of 500K cells/well. Cells were allowed
24 hrs to adhere to the plates before the addition of losartan at 10 gmol/l for 24 hrs (Schiittert
JB, et al. (2003) Pflugers Arch 446:387-393). Treatment was done in low serum to reduce
background collagen levels. Conditioned medium was collected at the end of the 24-hr
treatment period and analyzed for collagen levels.
Proteinassays
 [000436]        Collagen I measurements were done with a type I C-terminal collagen
propetide Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit (Quidel, San Diego, CA) and
the Sircol soluble collagen assay (Biocolor Ltd., United Kingdom). TGF-plI assays were
performed with a human TGF-p31 ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The assay
only measures the free-form of mature TGF- f 1. To measure total levels of TGF- f 1 the
latent form of TGF- f 1 was activated with IN HCl. TSP-I assays were performed with a
human TSP-I ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).
Mice and tumor models
 [000437]       All experiments were done with approval of the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. Human soft tissue sarcoma (HSTS26T) and human melanoma (Mu89)
tumors were grown subcutaneously in the legs and dorsal skin fold chamber of severe
combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Leunig M, et al. (1992) Cancer Res 52:65 53
6560). Human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (L3.6PL) were grown orthotopically in the
pancreas of SCID mice. L3.6PL tumors were induced with a sub-capsular injection of one
million cells in the tail of the pancreas. Tumor sizes were monitored in spontaneous FVB/N
Tg(MMTV-PyVT) 634MUl/J mice and tumors selected for treatment when they reached a
size of 4 to 6 mm in diameter (Guy CT et al. (1992) Mol Cell Biol 12:954-96 1).
Losartanpreparationand treatment
 [000438]        Cozaar (losartan potassium) tablets were ground using a mortar and pestle.
The powder was then dissolved in water to obtain a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. The solution
was then filtered and stored in a sterile container. Losartan was administered by daily i.p.
injections at a concentration of 10, 20 or 60 mg/kg/day for up to 2 weeks (Melo LG, et al.
(1999) Am JPhysiol277:R624-R63 0).

Tissue collection, embedding and staining
 [000439]       Tumors for immunostaining analysis and quantification were harvested from
mice, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin or optimum cutting
temperature compound (OCT) (Sakura Finetek Torrance, CA). OCT embedded tumors were
soaked in sucrose solution for 24 hrs prior to embedding and freezing.
Collagen I and TSP-I immunostaining stainingin frozen sections
 [000440]       Frozen sections were cut into 10 gm sections for immunohistochemistry and
imaging. Collagen I was detected using the LF-67 antibody (1:100 dilution) with a
previously described protocol (Znati CA, et al. (2003) Clin CancerRes 9:5508-5513). TSP
 1 was detected with a goat anti-human antibody (1:50 dilution), which cross-reacts with mice
(sc-12312, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). For collagen and TSP-I
analysis, images at 20x magnification were taken randomly from each slide. The collagen
and TSP-I content was determined by measuring the number of pixels above a threshold
value that was set based on the average intensity value of pixels from all slides under
analysis. The background-signal intensity for both collagen I and thrombospondin- 1
immunostaining was low and uniform. The inventors confirmed that the average signal
intensity threshold lead to an accurate representation of the collagen and thrombospondin- 1
immunostaining and did not include the background signal.
Second Harmonic Imaging of Collagen Fibers
 [000441]       Second Harmonic Imaging (SHG) imaging was performed in dorsal chamber
tumors with a custom-built multiphoton laser-scanning microscope (Brown E, et al. (2003)
Nat Med 9:796-800). Polarized light from a Ti:Sapphire laser (Mai-Tai Broadband: Spectra
Physics, Mountain View, CA) was converted to circularly polarized light using a zero order
quarter wave plate (Newport Corporation, Irvine, CA). An excitation wavelength of 810 nm
and detected SHG signals at 405 nm was used. SCID mice bearing HSTS26T tumors in
dorsal chambers were either treated with losartan (10, 20 or 60 mg/kg/day) or saline for the
duration of the dose response experiment (15 days). Vascular markers were used to locate 4
regions of interest in each mouse and periodically returned to the same region of SHG
imaging. SHG images were analyzed with a custom-built Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc.,
Natick, MA) code. The fraction of the region of interest (ROI) that was positive for the SHG
signal was normalized to the amount of SHG signal obtained on day 1 of the dose response
study (before initiation of losartan or saline treatment).

Analysis of HSV infection and nanoparticledistribution
 [000442]       Intratumoralinjection: Nanoparticles and oncolytic HSV were infused with a
syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus Standard Pump 22, Holliston, Massachusetts) at a flow
rate of 4 pl / min. The inventors injected 10 pl of HSV (2.5 x 105 t.u.) expressing the green
fluorescent protein (GFP), or 10 pl of fluorescent nanoparticles (diameter of 100 pLm;
                         13
concentration of 1x10       nanoparticles / ml). The injected tumors were resected 30 min after
the nanosphere injection and 24 hrs after the HSV infusion. Resected tumors were bisected at
an angle perpendicular to the needle track, fixed in paraformaldehyde and frozen in OCT.
All tumor sections were obtained perpendicular to the angle of the needle track. The entire
tumor section was imaged with a confocal microscope (Olympus BX6 IWI) at 2x and images
were reconstituted as mosaics. The nanosphere distribution and GFP-positive areas (HSV
infected cells) corresponds to the fraction of pixels brighter than the background signal.
 [000443]       Intravenous injection: A total volume of 10 pl at a concentration of 3.6 x 1013
nanoparticles / ml was injected via the tail vein. Twenty-four hrs later 50 pl of FITC-lectin
was injected to identify functional vessels. Five min after the lectin-injection tumors were
resected, fixed in paraformaldehyde and embedded in OCT. Tumors were then sectioned
before confocal imaging and analysis. The extent of nanosphere distribution was determined
by measuring the fraction of pixels brighter than the background signal. Nanosphere
penetration was determined by drawing contours around perfused vessels and recording the
fraction of pixels positive for nanospheres in each contour. Contours extended out to 30 pum
for each perfused vessel. Using a previously described algorithm (Tong RT, et al. (2004)
CancerRes 64:3731-3736), the inventors fit the plot of nanosphere fraction and distance
away from the vessel to an exponential and obtained a relative penetration depth of
nanospheres from each vessel.
Diffusion measurements by fluorescence recovery afterphotobleaching
 [000444]       Mice with HSTS26T tumors implanted in a dorsal skin fold chamber were
treated with i.p. injections of losartan (40mg/kg/day) for 1 week. Fluorescence recovery
after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements were done with a custom built multiphoton
microscope based on a previously described protocol (Chauhan VP, et al. (2009) Biophys J
97:330-336). IgG labeled fluorescein isothiocyanate (0.5 ml; 2mg/ml) was injected i.t. and
used as the tracer. Diffusion was measured by multiphoton FRAP (MP-FRAP) and spatial
Fourier analysis FRAP (SFA-FRAP) about 10 min after the injection. Matrix pore sizes were
calculated using the SFA-FRAP data, using the equation

Analysis of HSV infection, necrosis and collagen structure
 [000445]       To determine the relationship between virus infection, necrosis and collagen
structure 21 days after the HSV injection, consecutive paraffin sections were stained with
either a polyclonal HSV- 1 antibody (DAKO, Glostrup Denmark) or a collagen I antibody
(LF-67). For collagen I staining in paraffin sections, slides were treated with 3% hydrogen
peroxide prior to antigen retrieval with Target Retrieval Solution, pH 9 (DAKO, Carpinteria,
CA). The slides were then treated with 0.05% trypsin before the primary collagen I antibody
was applied at a dilution of 1:500. Sections stained with collagen I or HSV were imaged with
a light microscope.
PCR Analysis
 [000446]       RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and
converted to cDNA using an RT 2 first strand kit (SuperArray Biosciences Corporation,
Frederick, MD). The cDNA quality and concentration were measured with an ND-200
Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). For the PCR reaction,
cDNA from all samples were standardized to 1gg/gl. The reaction was performed with a
HotStarTaq Plus DNA Polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For AGTR1 primers, the
inventors used: forward primer- GTCCCGCCTTCGACGCACAA (SEQ ID NO: 1), reverse
primer- GGGGCGGTAGGAAAGCGTGC (SEQ ID NO: 2).
Ki67 staining, imaging and analysis
 [000447]       Ki67 staining was done on paraffin sections 21 days after HSV injection.
Slides were microwave processed with Target Retrieval Solution (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA)
prior to primary antibody detection.   The entire tumor section was imaged at 2x
magnification and reconstituted as a mosaic. Twenty regions were randomly selected in each
tumor. The fraction of Ki67 positive cells in each region was determined by manual count.
DOXIL     treatment and tumor growth delay

mice were randomly selected for losartan or saline treatment. A sub-anti-tumor dose of
DOXIL* (4 mg/kg) was infused i.v. via the tail vein after two weeks of losartan treatment (20
mg/kg/day).       One week after the DOXIL injection, the tumors were resected and measured.
 Virus treatment and tumor growth delay
 [000449]         Scid mice bearing subcutaneous HSTS26T and MU89 tumors were randomly
divided into control and losartan treated groups. Each arm (control and treated) was
subsequently divided into HSV treated and non-HSV treated groups. Tumors that had
reached 60 mm3 after two weeks were selected for i.t. HSV injections. Tumors were treated
with 10 pLl i.t. injections of either PBS or 2.5 x 105 transducing units (t.u.) of oncolytic HSV
MGH2 (gift from E. Antonio Chiocca, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). Two i.t.
injections of oncolytic HSV separated by 24 hrs were administered. The injections were done
with a Harvard Apparatus Standard Pump 22 infusion/withdraw syringe pump system
(Holliston, Massachusetts) at a flow rate of 4 pl / min. Tumors were measured every 2 to 3
days. Tumor volume was estimated as: V=AB 2 /2, where V is the tumor volume; A and B are
the maximum and minimum diameters of the tumor as measured with calipers.
Statistics
 [000450]         All the animal experiments were conducted with at least 6 mice in each
treatment arm. The tumor growth delay studies in HSTS26T and MU89 tumors were done
with at least 8 mice in each group. The rational for the number of mice used was based on
power calculations in the inventors' previous studies (McKee TD, et al. (2006) CancerRes
66:2509-2513 and Mok W, et al. (2007) Cancer Res 67:10664-10668), which showed that
the inventors needed at least 8 mice in each group to reach statistical significance (p<0.05).
All statistical analyses involving two groups were done using a Student's t-test. A p-value
lower than 0.05 was considered significant. For multiple groups, a one-way Anova test
followed by a Tuskey's post-hoc test was used to determine statistical significance between
groups. Statistical significance in figures is identified by an asterix ("*").
Example 7: Angiotensin blockade improves drug delivery by normalizing the tumor
microenvironment
 [000451]         Advances in biomedical research have led to the introduction of several novel
systemically-administered molecular and nanotherapeutics in both preclinical and clinical
settings (Jones, D. (2007) Nat Rev DrugDiscov 6, 174-175; Moghimi, S. M. et al. (2005)
Faseb J 19, 311-330). While these new agents act on unique targets that afford greater

specificity to tumor cells or improved pharmacodynamic properties, their effectiveness
suffers from limitations in their delivery owing to the properties of the tumor
microenvironment (Jain, R. K. (1998) Nat Med 4, 655-657; Sanhai, W. R. et al. (2008) Nat
Nanotechnol 3, 242-244). Growth-induced mechanical forces compress and collapse blood
vessels limiting tumor perfusion, while abnormal vasculature leads to heterogeneous drug
extravasation. A third determinate of delivery - interstitial transport through tissues - is
particularly hindered for nanomedicine in tumors by an abnormally dense and tortuous tumor
interstitium (Jain, R. K. & Stylianopoulos (2010) Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 139; Chauhan, V. P. et
al. (2009) Biophysicaljournal97, 330-336). These barriers impact therapy, particularly, for
patients with desmoplastic, fibrotic tumors, including pancreatic (Olive, K. P. et al. (2009)
Science 324, 1457-1461), colorectal (Halvorsen, T. B. & Seim, E. (1989) J Clin Pathol 42,
 162-166), lung and breast cancer (Ronnov-Jessen, L. et al. (1996) Physiol Rev 76, 69-125)
limiting the amount of drug that reaches the target cancer cells leading to poor effectiveness.
Currently, there are limited approaches to overcome these delivery barriers for
nanotherapeutics and low molecular weight drugs. Previously, the inventors discovered that
relaxin can improve transport through the tumor matrix, but may not facilitate the delivery of
low MW agents (B. Seed and R. K. Jain. "Methods to Potentiate Cancer Therapies", Patent
number US 6,719,977, April 13, 2004.)
 [000452]        Presented herein is a class of FDA-approved agents that can normalize the
tumor microenvironment and improve delivery of both low and high molecular weight drugs.
Specifically, the inventors showed that angiotensin blockade "normalizes" interstitial matrix
in solid tumors, including breast and pancreatic tumors (Fig. 17A). The inventors assessed
whether FDA-approved angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), through this mechanism, can alter the tumor microenvironment
to enhance drug delivery. The inventors also determined that ARBs and ACE-Is can
decompress blood vessels to improve perfusion (Figs. 17B-17D), increase tumor hydraulic
conductivity to repair vessel function (Fig. 18B), and decrease interstitial matrix density to
enhance penetration of nanotherapeutics (Fig. 18D). These agents improve delivery of
molecules as small as oxygen - a radiation and chemo sensitizer - through vascular
normalization (Figs. 18A-18B), while also enhancing the penetration of larger agents through
interstitial matrix normalization (Figs. 18C-18D). Through this repair of the entire tumor
microenvironment, these agents enhance the effectiveness of low molecular weight
chemotherapeutics as well as nanotherepeutics in breast and pancreatic cancer models
leading to reduced tumor growth and longer animal survival (Figs. 19A-19E). The inventors
showed that ARBs and ACE-Is can enhance the delivery of therapeutics, and thus have broad
                                                 113

 WO 2013/169739                                                              PCT/US2013/039901
applicability for combination therapy with all classes of anti-cancer agents including small
molecule chemotherapeutics, biologics, and nanoparticle therapies.
 [000453]        Angiotensin blockers offer numerous advantages over other approaches. Anti
angiogenic therapies normalize the vasculature alone and have been approved for only a
limited number of indications. Meanwhile, ARBs and ACE-Is are FDA-approved as anti
hypertensives with manageable adverse effects. Matrix-degrading enzymes, which can
normalize the collagen matrix, are not selective for tumors and can increase invasion and
metastasis. ARBs and ACE-Is generally have no complications associated with matrix
remodeling in normal tissues, leading to their safety as anti-hypertensives. ARBs and ACE
Is, as small-molecule agents, can also be delivered via nanovectors containing
chemotherapeutics (e.g., liposomes, nano-particles) to enhance their localization to tumors to
further limit toxicity. Anti-angiogenics, the only FDA-approved adjuncts that enhance drug
delivery to tumors, generally cannot improve delivery for larger particles as they can reduce
the size of "pores" in vessel walls. On the contrary, angiotensin blockers presented herein can
improve delivery for all classes of anti-tumor diagnostics and therapies.
Example 8: In vitro screen to identify anti-hypertensive agents to lower collagen in solid
tumors
 [000454]        This Example provides an assay to rank anti-hypertensive (AH) agents based
on their ability to lower collagen I level in tumors.
 [000455]        Since most collagen I is produced by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs),
a skilled artisan can measure the level of collagen I - along with its molecular determinants
[active-TGF-p1, thrombospondin 1 (TSP 1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)] - in
the supernanants of CAFs after AH treatment.
 [000456]        For example, the inventors determined that losartan reduced TGF-p31
activation and collagen I production in breast CAFs in vitro. Cells were treated with 10
pimol/L of losartan for 24 hrs. Losartan reduced by 90% the active-TGF-p31 levels (p<0.05),
while total TGF- P1 levels were unaffected. There was a corresponding     27 % decrease in
collagen I levels (p<0.0 5 ). (See Fig. 1).
Exemplary Experimental design:

collagen, they do not target the receptor on cells and hence the inventors did not measure
their effects on collagen I. Calcium channel blockers can also be evaluated for the collagen
lowering effects.
Cell culture
 [000459]       Isolate carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from human cancer biopsies
using a previously described protocol ( Orimo A, et al. (2005) Cell 121(3):335-348). CAFs
should be plated in 24 well plates at a concentration of 500K cells/well and allowed 24 hrs to
adhere to the plates before the addition of anti-hypertensive drug. For example, all the
losartan studies were performed at 10 gmol/l for 24 hrs, based on a published protocol
(Schuttert JB, et al. (2003) PflugersArch 446(3):387-393). Treatment can be done in low
serum to reduce background collagen levels. Conditioned medium can be collected at the
end of the 24-hr treatment period and analyzed for total and activated TGF-p1, TSP-1, CTGF
and collagen levels.
Proteinassays
 [000460]       In the losartan study (Schuttert JB, et al. (2003) Pflugers Arch 446(3):3 87
393), Collagen I measurements were done with a type I C-terminal collagen propetide
Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit (Quidel, San Diego, CA) and the Sircol
soluble collagen assay (Biocolor Ltd., United Kingdom). TGF-plI assays were performed
with a human TGF-PlI ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The assay only
measures the free-form of mature TGF-pl. To measure total levels of TGF-pl the latent form
of TGF-p31 was activated with IN HCl. TSP-I assays were performed with a human TSP-I
ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). CTGF ELISA kit can be purchased from
Leinco (www.leinco.com).

Example 9: Combination of angiotensin blockade with inhibition of alternate
profibrotic pathways to improve drug delivery to tumors
 [000466]       The inventors have discovered that normalization of the interstitial matrix
through angiotensin signaling blockade improves drug delivery, at least partly, through two
mechanisms: it relaxes the inherent compressive force in tumors to improve vessel perfusion,
and it reduces the viscoelastic and steric hindrance on drug transport directly imparted by the
matrix. Angiotensin signaling blockade can safely inhibit activation of the profibrotic TGF
beta and CTGF pathways downstream to produce these changes. In some embodiments,
partnering angiotensin blockers with inhibitors of profibrotic pathways that are independent
of TGF-beta and CTGF activation - including endothelin-1, PDGF, Wnt/beta-catenin, IGF-1,
TNF-alpha, and IL-4 -can enhance these effects, further improving drug delivery and
effectiveness. For example, endothelin receptor blockers (ERBs) and PDGF inhibitors
(PDGF-Is) can be used in combination with angiotensin blockers. ERBs treat pulmonary
arterial hypertension and can be used as a class of therapy for cancer (Nelson et al. (2003)
Nature Reviews Vol. 3:110-116), for example with angiotensin blockers. PDGF-Is haven
been reported for their potential anti-vascular effects in tumors (Baluk et al. (2005) Current
Opinion in Genetics & Development 15:102-111, Andrae et al. (2008) Genes & Development
22:1276-1312). Endothelin blockade has been reported to reduce fibrogenesis in the liver
(Binder et al. (2009) Mol. Cancer Ther. 8:2452-2460), lung (Park et al. (1997) Am J. Respir
Crit Care Med Vol. 156:600-608), and heart through inhibition of TGF-beta synthesis (Ogata
et al. (2002) Clinical Science 103 (Suppl. 48):284S-288S), and has been reported to reduce
tumor progression and metastasis in tumor models (Nelson et al. supra; Binder et al. supra).
Meanwhile, PDGF inhibition have been reported to prevent fibrogenesis in idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis and scleroderma (Grimminger et al. (2010) Nature Reviews Vol. 9:956
970; Andrae et al. (2008) Genes & Development 22:1276-1312), and the inventors have
determined that it can reduce collagen levels in tumors (data not shown). ERBs have been
reported to be well-tolerated with a potential to improve overall survival in prostate cancer
(James et al. (2009) European Urology 55:1112-1123) and non-small cell lung cancer
(Chiappori et al. (2008) Clin CancerRes 14:1464-1469). Accordingly, the combination of an
angiotensin blockade with endothelin- 1 and/or PDGF blockade - with careful dosing
                                                116

should produce an additive improvement to drug delivery with minimal additional toxicity. In
some embodiments, endothelin- 1 and/or PDGF blockade can be used at a sub-therapuetic
dose in combination with an angiotensin blockade, which can be used at a sub-anti
hypertensive dose and/or sub-anti-tumor dose, for improved drug delivery and/or treatment of
cancer.
Example 10: Angiotensin inhibitors decompress tumor vessels to enhance drug delivery
Introduction
 [000467]        Retrospective analysis of clinical data shows that the use of angiotensin
receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) to manage
hypertension in cancer patients receiving standard therapies associated with longer survival
(Keizman D, et al., Eur J Cancer.2011; 47(13): 1955-61; Nakai Y, et al., Br J Cancer.2010;
 103(11): 1644-8; Wilop S, et al., Journalof CancerResearch and Clinical Oncology. 2009;
 135(10): 1429-35). However, a causal relationship between the use of ARBs/ACE-Is and
clinical benefit, as well as the mechanism behind this potential effect, has not been
demonstrated.
 [000468]        From the retrospective studie described above, it is unclear whether ARBs and
ACE-Is directly potentiate standard therapies, and if so, if they have synergistic or additive
effects. It is assumed that their indirect anti-angiogenic properties, through downstream
VEGF inhibition (George AJ, et al., Nat Rev Cancer. 2010; 10(11): 745-59), benefit survival
additively. However, malignant tumors, and in particular pancreatic cancers, have a
notoriously poor blood perfusion. Indeed, a specific anti-VEGF inhibitor (the antibody
bevacizumab) showed no overall survival benefit when added to chemotherapy in
randomized, double-blind, phase-III trials for breast, pancreatic, kidney and non-small cell
lung cancers (Escudier B, et al., Journalof Clinical Oncology. 2010; 28(13): 2144-50;
Kindler HL, et al., Journal of Clinical Oncology. 2010; 28(22): 3617-22; Miles DW, et al.,
Cancer research.2009; 69(24): 495S; Reck M, et al., Ann Oncol. 2010; 21(9): 1804-9).
 [000469]        On the other hand, angiotensin inhibition can also modulate the non-vascular
tumor microenvironment (Table 1). Therefore, angiotensin inhibitors could synergistically
enhance chemotherapy by increasing drug and oxygen delivery to the tumor. Chemotherapy
effectiveness is dependent on drug delivery (Jain RK. Science. 2005; 307(5706): 58-62).
Furthermore, inadequate oxygen delivery can lead to hypoxia-induced drug resistance
(Wilson WR, et al., Nat Rev Cancer. 2011; 11(6): 393-410), selection for aggressive cells
(Harris AL. Nature reviews. 2002; 2(1): 38-47), and immune suppression in tumors
(Facciabene A, et al., Nature. 2011; 475(7355): 226-Ul41). By alleviating hypoxia and
                                                 117

improving drug delivery, this mechanism would position ARBs and ACE-Is as a new class of
safe anti-cancer adjuncts.

 10004701           Drug and oxygen delivery is dependent solely on perfused vessels. Solid
stress (Guyton AC, et al., PhysiologicalReviews. 1971; 51(3): 527), which accumulates in
tumors due to unbridled cell proliferation and matrix production in a confined
microenvironment (Helmlinger G, et al., Nat Biotechnol. 1997; 15(8): 778-83; Stylianopoulos
T, et al., Growth-induced mechanical stress in murine and human tumors: causes,
consequences and remedies. under review. 2012; Roose T, et al., Microvasc Res. 2003; 66(3):
204-12), collapses blood vessels and limits perfusion (Padera TP, et al., Nature. 2004;
427(6976): 695). This impacts therapy by reducing the drug doses that reach cancer cells,
hindering effectiveness. Indeed, patients with low tumor perfusion, presumably with hypoxia
and low drug delivery, show poorer chemotherapy responses and shorter survival versus
patients with high perfusion (Sorensen AG, et al., Cancer research. 2012; 72(2): 402-7; Park
MS, et al., Radiology. 2009; 250(1): 110-7). Most solid tumors in patients have hypoxic
regions and collapsed vessels, e.g., breast cancer (Fig. 20) and pancreatic cancer (Olive KP,
et al., Science. 2009; 324(5933): 1457-6 1). Therefore, this example illustrates the hypothesis
that angiotensin inhibitors may increase perfusion. As described in this example, this
hypothesis was tested in orthotopic breast and pancreatic tumor models using the ARB
losartan.

Results
 [000471]       To assess how losartan affects blood vascular perfusion in orthotopic breast
and pancreatic tumors, mice were injected with lectin as a marker for perfused (patent and
functional) vessels before tumor excision, and then immunostained tissue sections with an
anti-CD31 antibody, which marks both perfused and non-perfused vessels (Olive KP, et al.,
Science. 2009; 324(5933): 1457-6 1). These tumors were found to be severely hypo-perfused
                 23                                         2
(Fig. 21): only     % of vessels in E0771 breast tumors and   1% in AK4.4 pancreatic tumors
were perfused with blood (Figs. 17D and 22A). A 40mg/kg dose of losartan, which does not
decrease blood pressure in tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 23), significantly improved the perfused
vessel fraction to 43% in E0771 and 45% in AK4.4 (Figs. 17D and 22A). Losartan treatment
increased vessel diameters in E0771 (Fig. 22B), suggesting vascular decompression as the
mechanism of action. Despite the previous classification of ARBs and ACE-Is as anti
angiogenics (George AJ, et al., Nat Rev Cancer. 2010; 10(1 1):745-59), losartan did not affect
the CD3 1+ vessel density in these tumors (Figs. 22C-22D). Thus, losartan can increase
blood supply in tumors by opening existing collapsed blood vessels.
 [000472]       The mechanism responsible for the increase in tumor vessel perfusion by
losartan was investigated. Desmoplasia, high stromal cell and matrix density, is a major
contributor to the solid stress accumulation that compresses vessels (Stylianopoulos T, et al.,
Growth-induced mechanical stress in murine and human tumors: causes, consequences and
remedies. under review. 2012). Since angiotensin inhibitors reduce matrix production in
tumors (Diop-Frimpong B, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011; 108(7): 2909-14), it was
hypothesized that they decompress vessels and increase perfusion by decreasing solid stress.
Collagen levels were used as a metric of matrix production as described in Diop-Frimpong et
al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2011; 108(7): 2909-14, and losartan was found to reduce the
collagen I levels in E0771 and AK4.4 tumors (Fig. 24A and 24C). Moreover, losartan
decreased collagen I concentration, measured based on staining intensity, in E0771 and
AK4.4 tumors (Figs. 24B-24C). Of note, dense collagen seemed to colocalize with low
perfusion areas (Fig. 24C). Next, solid stress in these tumors was measured using recently
established technique described in Stylianopoulos T, et al., Growth-induced mechanical
stress in murine and human tumors: causes, consequences and remedies. under review. 2012.
Losartan reduced solid stress in both E0771 and AK4.4 tumors (Fig. 24D), as well as in 4T1
breast and Pan-02 pancreatic tumors (Fig. 25). Similarly, the ACE-I lisinopril reduced
collagen I levels in E0771 and AK4.4 tumors and solid stress in E0771 tumors (Fig. 26),
indicating that the mechanism of action is via angiotensin signaling inhibition rather than an
                                               119

off-target effect of losartan. Furthermore, a panel of ARBs were tested, and they all reduced
solid stress (Fig. 27). These data show that angiotensin blockers can indirectly improve
vascular perfusion in desmoplastic tumors by decompressing blood vessels through their anti
matrix effects.
 [000473]        Since drug and oxygen delivery is chiefly controlled by vascular perfusion, the
effects of losartan on delivery to tumors were tested. A mathematical approach was used to
analyze the efficiency of the vascular network for delivery. Using multiphoton microscopy,
the perfused vessel networks of E0771 tumors were imaged (Fig. 17D). Based on fractal
analysis and metrics of intervascular spaces (Baish JW, et al., Proc Nati Acad Sci U S A.
2011; 108(5): 1799-803), it was found that losartan reorganizes networks toward the structure
of normal capillary beds and reduces the maximum distance drugs and oxygen must travel to
reach tumor cells (Figs. 28A-28B).
 [000474]       The accumulation of the small-molecule chemotherapeutic fluorouracil (5-FU)
was then measured. Losartan improved 5-FU delivery to AK4.4 tumors, while not affecting
delivery to normal organs (Fig. 29A). These data imply that this strategy for enhancing
delivery selectively affects tumors because solid stress does not accumulate in normal organs.
 [000475]        Oxygenation was then studied using phosphorescence quenching microscopy.
It was found that losartan treatment maintained tumor oxygen levels in E0771 tumors, while
control-treated tumors showed a typical growth-dependent drop in oxygenation (Figs. 29B
29C). This decrease in tumor hypoxia was confirmed by using pimonidazole staining (Figs.
29D and 30). To determine if losartan also increases nanomedicine delivery, which is
dependent on both vascular supply and penetration across vessel walls into tumor tissue,
nanoparticle penetration was measured using intravital multiphoton microscopy.
Nanoparticle penetration rates were quantified as transvascular mass flux per unit vascular
surface area and transvascular concentration difference, termed as the effective permeability.
It was found that losartan improved effective permeability for 12nm, 60nm, and 125nm
nanoparticles (Fig. 29E), i.e., for the entire size range of nanomedicines in clinical use.
Penetration rates are largely dependent on fluid flow through the viscoelastic and tortuous
tumor interstitium, which is a function of interstitial hydraulic conductivity. It was
determined that losartan also increases the hydraulic conductivity of E0771 tumors (Fig. 31),
likely through its anti-matrix effects, and a mathematical model (Chauhan VP, et al., Nature
Nanotechnology. 2012; advance online publication) was used to confirm that this can
improve the penetration rate of all sizes of nanomedicines (Fig. 32). Thus,
"microenvironmental normalization" with ARBs and ACE-Is increases the delivery of
oxygen and all sizes of therapeutics to tumors.

 [000476]       Given these effects on delivery, angiotensin inhibitors could act as adjunct
therapies to synergistically improve the effectiveness of small-molecule chemotherapeutics.
Thus, losartan was tested in combination with doxorubicin in E0771 and 4T1 tumors, or with
5FU in AK4.4 tumors. It was found that whereas losartan or doxorubicin given alone had no
significant effect on tumor growth rate, the combination significantly delayed E0771 and 4T1
tumor growth (Figs. 19A-19B and 35). Similarly, while losartan or 5-FU monotherapy had
no significant effect on tumor growth rate in the highly chemoresistant AK4.4 tumors, their
combination greatly slowed tumor growth (Fig. 33). Moreover, the combination of losartan
and doxorubicin increased median survival of mice bearing E0771 tumors from 12 days with
saline alone to 23.5 days, compared with only 16 days with doxorubicin alone (Fig. 19C).
Similarly, the combination improved survival in mice with 4T1 tumors (Fig. 35).
Importantly, losartan alone, despite increasing blood perfusion in tumors, did not shorten
survival in mice bearing E0771, 4T1 or AK4.4 tumors (Figs. 19C, 34-35). Furthermore,
losartan monotherapy did not increase metastasis in AK4.4, and its combination with 5-FU
appeared to reduce the incidence and size of metastases (Table 2). Together, these data
demonstrate that angiotensin inhibitors can improve the effectiveness of small molecule
chemotherapeutics through anti-matrix effects.

  Discussion
   [000477]        Several attempts at developing adjunct therapies to enhance drug and
  oxygen delivery have been made in the past. For example, anti-VEGF therapies shrink
  vessel pores (Chauhan VP, et al., Nature Nanotechnology. 2012; advance online
  publication), reduce interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) (Tong RT, et al., Cancerresearch.
  2004; 64(11): 3731-6); Goel S, et al., Physiol Rev. 2011; 91(3): 1071-121) and increase
  perfusion in patients (Sorensen AG, et al., Cancer research.2012; 72(2): 402-7). This
  "vascular normalization" approach is suited to well-perfused tumors (Sorensen AG, et al.,
  and Goel S, et al.), but may not work in desmoplastic tumors such as in pancreatic cancer
  when a significant fraction of tumor vessels are collapsed. Moreover, most anti
  angiogenic drugs lead to hypertension in a significant number of cancer patients and this
  hypertension is currently managed with a variety of anti-hypertensive drugs (Keizman D,
  et al., Eur J Cancer. 2011; 47(13): 1955-61.). Another example is anti-hyaluronan
  enzymatic therapy, which can also increase vessel diameter in pancreatic tumors
  (Provenzano Paolo P, et al., Cancer Cell. 2012; 21(3): 418-29.), possibly through
  decompression (Stylianopoulos T, et Growth-induced mechanical stress in murine and
  human tumors: causes, consequences and remedies. under review. 2012). Though this
  strategy is quite promising, it is limited to tumors with high hyaluronan levels and may
  lead to hyaluronan degradation in normal organs. Anti-Hedgehog pathway treatment with
  IPI-926 increases vessel density in pancreatic tumors (Olive KP, et al., Science. 2009;
  324(5933): 1457-6 1), presumably by reducing stromal cell density and hence solid stress
  (Stylianopoulos T, et al., Growth-induced mechanical stress in murine and human tumors:
  causes, consequences and remedies. under review. 2012). While this strategy is attractive
  for these poorly perfused tumors, IPI-926 failed in a recent randomized phase II clinical
  trial. Finally, co-administration of therapeutics with the peptide iRGD improves drug
  penetration in tumors by an active transport mechanism (Sugahara KN, et al., Science.
  2010; 328(5981): 1031-5). Still, this does not address the problem of poor vascular
  supply and thus its effect in desmoplastic, hypovascularized tumors is not known.
   [000478]        ARBs and ACE-Is would be compatible with all these strategies, due to
  the differences in their targets and mechanisms. Moreover, in contrast to the other drugs
  and agents that can improve drug delivery, ARBs and ACE-Is are the only FDA-approved
  drugs that can reduce solid stress thus far. Despite this great promise, ARBs and ACE-Is
  may be limited in usage by several factors. Notably, the activity of these drugs should be
  most effective in desmoplastic tumors, such as in breast, stomach, and pancreatic cancer.

WO 2013/169739                                                             PCT/US2013/039901
  In addition, not all breast tumors are desmoplastic, which could explain how the disease is
  sometimes curable with chemotherapy, and thus not all patients may be candidates for
  ARBs and ACE-Is. Additionally, these agents will only work in patients with
  angiotensin-II receptor type-I positive tumors. Furthermore, ARBs and ACE-Is would be
  contraindicated for patients with low blood pressure or certain other co-morbidities.
   [000479]       In summary, ARBs and ACE-Is were found to increase the delivery of
  oxygen, small-molecule chemotherapeutics, and nanomedicine through
  "microenvironmental normalization" mechanisms in desmoplastic tumors. In comparison,
  only "vascular normalization," as with direct and indirect anti-angiogenic therapy (Jain
  RK. Science. 2005; 307(5706): 58-62), has been shown to increase delivery nearly so
  comprehensively (Tong RT, et al., Cancerresearch.2004; 64(11): 3731-6; Chauhan VP,
  et al., Nature Nanotechnology. 2012; advance online publication; Goel S, et al., Physiol
  Rev. 2011; 91(3): 1071-121). Nevertheless, the safety and low cost of these drugs - along
  with their synergistic improvement of cancer therapy - makes a strong case for
  repurposing ARBs and ACE-Is as cancer therapies.
  Methods
   [000480]       Drug preparation: Angiotensin inhibitors (losartan, lisinopril, valsartan,
  and candesartan) were obtained as pills. The pills were crushed using a mortar and pestle
  and the powder was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) over 24 hours. The
  solutions were then sterile filtered for injection. Doxorubicin and 5-FU were obtained as
  solutions for injection, and were injected without modification. All drugs were purchased
  from the pharmacy at Massachusetts General Hospital.
   [000481]       Tumor models: AK4.4 was kindly provided by Dr. Nabeel Bardeesy, and
  was isolated from mice generating spontaneous pancreatic tumors (KrasG12 and p53w/).
  Orthotopic pancreatic tumors were generated by implanting a small piece (1mm 3) of
  viable tumor tissue (from a source tumor in a separate animal) into the pancreas of a male
  FVB mouse (AK4.4 model) or C57BL/6 (Pan-02 model) mouse. Orthotopic breast
  tumors were similarly generated by implanting a chunk of viable tumor tissue into the
  mammary fat pad of a female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse. All
  animal procedures were carried out following the Public Health Service Policy on
  Humane Care of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
  Use Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital.

  after implantation and size-matched for tumor volume at this time (~100mm 3 ). For
  pancreatic tumors, mice bearing orthotopic AK4.4 were split into treatment groups, size
  matched for tumor volume (~22mm 3 ), 6 days after implantation. The mice were then
  treated with 40mg/kg losartan or an equal volume of PBS intraperitoneally each day for 6
  (E0771) or 7 (AK4.4) days. On the day of the last treatment, mice were slowly (~2min)
  injected with 100pL of lmg/mL biotinylated lectin (Vector Labs), administered retro
  orbitally 5min prior to tumor removal. For hypoxia studies, the mice were also injected
  with 60mg/kg of 10mg/mL pimonidazole lhr prior to tumor removal. The tumors were
  then excised, fixed in 4 % formaldehyde in PBS (30min/mm diameter of tissue), incubated
  in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4'C, and frozen in optimal cutting temperature
  compound (Tissue-Tek). Transverse tumors sections, 40gm thick, were immunostained
  with antibodies to endothelial marker CD3 1, and counterstained by mounting with DAPI
  containing medium (Vector Labs). For matrix staining, collagen I was detected using the
  LF-67 antibody provided by Dr. Larry Fisher (National Institute of Dental Research,
  Bethesda, MD).
   [000483]       Histological image analysis: Eight random images (four interior, four
  periphery) at 20x magnification were taken from each slide using a confocal microscope
  (Olympus). For vascular analysis, vessels were skeletonized and segmented using a
  custom, semi-automated tracing program developed in MATLAB (The MathWorks)
  allowing the removal of structures under thirty pixels and regions of autofluorescence.
  For perfusion, the number of vessels counted by this program with colocalization of lectin
  and CD31 staining was divided by the number of vessels counted with CD31 staining.
  For vessel metrics, including diameter and density, the program determined the average
  size of all counted vessels and their length, as well as the count per area. Images of
  collagen I stained sections were analyzed based on the area fraction of positive staining
  and on the average staining intensity (concentration) in each image. The concentration
  data were normalized to the average control intensity. Images of hypoxia staining with
  pimonidazole were similarly analyzed for the area fraction of positive staining, counting
  the fraction of pixels above a threshold based on background intensity. Identical analysis
  settings and thresholds were used for all tumors.
   [000484]       Solid stress: Solid stress was measured using the tumor opening technique
  as described previously (Stylianopoulos T, et al., Growth-induced mechanical stress in
  murine and human tumors: causes, consequences and remedies. under review. 2012).
  When the tumors reached a size of ~Icm in diameter, the mice were anesthetized.
  Subsequently, each tumor was excised, washed with Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution

  (HBSS) and its three dimensions were measured. Each tumor was cut along its longest
  axis, to a depth of 80% of its shortest dimension, using a scalpel. The tumors were
  allowed to relax for 10 minutes in HBSS to diminish any transient, poro-elastic responses.
  Afterwards, the opening resulting from the cut was measured at the middle of the cut at
  the surface of the tumor. Solid stress is proportional to the size of the opening relative to
  the size of the dimension perpendicular to the cut.
   [000485]       Drug delivery: Mice bearing orthotopic AK4.4 were split into treatment
  groups, size-matched for tumor volume (~22mm 3 ), 6 days after implantation. The mice
  were then treated with 40mg/kg losartan or an equal volume of PBS intraperitoneally
  each day for 7 days. On the day of the last treatment, mice were injected with 100mg/kg
  5-FU, administered retro-orbitally 30min prior to tumor and organ removal. The tissue
  was dabbed of excess blood then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for analysis. 5-FU was
  isolated from the tissues and measured using liquid-liquid extraction followed by reverse
  phase high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass- spectrometry.
   [000486]       In vivo imaging: For imaging studies, E0771 tumors were implanted in
  mice bearing mammary fat pad chambers (124) and allowed to grow to ~3mm in
  diameter. Multiphoton imaging was carried out as described previously (124) on a
  custom-built multiphoton laser-scanning microscope using confocal laser-scanning
  microscope body (Olympus 300, Optical Analysis) and a broadband femtosecond laser
  source (High Performance MaiTai, Spectra-Physics). Images were taken at ~60mW at
  sample surface. Mosaic images were taken in raster pattern using a motorized stage
  (H101, Prior Scientific) and customized automation software (LabView, National
  Instruments). Imaging studies were performed with a 20X magnification, 0.95NA water
  immersion objective (Olympus XLUMPlanFl, 1-UB965, Optical Analysis).
   [000487]       Tissue oxygenation: p02 in the tumors was measured using
  phosphorescence quenching microscopy (Helmlinger G, et al., Nature medicine. 1997;
  3(2):177-82), which was adapted to multiphoton microscopy (Sakadzic S, et al., Nature
  Methods. 2010; 7(9): 755-U125). An oxygen-sensitive porphyrin, Oxyphor R2 (Oxygen
  Enterprises) was injected retro-orbitally 12hrs prior to imaging, and was reinjected
  immediately prior to imaging along with 2MDa FITC-dextran (Sigma-Aldrich) for
  functional vascular tracing. A mosaic image of the tumor was collected, and oxygen was
  then measured in an evenly spaced 12x12 grid at four depths (60, 120, 180, and 240gm)
  in the tumor. At each point in the grid, the phosphorescence lifetime of the probe was
  measured after each of several repeated brief intense pulses of 1020nm laser light, and
  these lifetime measurements were combined. A two-component model was used to
                                              126

WO 2013/169739                                                                 PCT/US2013/039901
  calculate the oxygen tension from each lifetime measurement, accounting for binding and
  quenching of the probe by both oxygen and proteins. The grid was then overlayed on the
  mosaic images to make an oxygen map.
   [000488]        Nanoparticle penetration: A mixture of nanoparticles with diameters of
   12nm (476nm emission), 60nm (540nm emission), and 125nm (625nm emission) was
  prepared for intravenous injection as described previously (Popovic Z, et al., Angew
  Chem IntEdEngl.2010; 49(46): 8649-52). Concentrations were adjusted with in vitro
  calibration to result in roughly equal photoluminescence intensity for all three
  nanoparticle samples under 800nm multiphoton excitation. Following retro-orbital
  injection of 2 0 0 pL with these concentrations, multiphoton imaging was carried out as
  described above at depths from 0 - 201 m, with 2.76gm steps and 2.76x2.76gm pixels.
  Images were taken every 3min at each region of interest for a duration of lhr. Images
  were analyzed using custom analysis software developed in Matlab (The Mathworks) as
  described previously (Chauhan VP, et al., Nature Nanotechnology. 2012; advance online
  publication; Chauhan VP, et al., Angewandte Chemie InternationalEdition. 2011; 50(48):
   11417-20). The analysis approach involved 3D vessel tracing to create vessel metrics and
  a 3D map of voxel intensity versus distance to the nearest vessel over time. Images were
  also corrected for sample movement over time with 3D image registration. The effective
  permeability was calculated with          -                          r      , where Jt is the
  transvascular flux, Sv is the vessel surface area, C, is the concentration of the probe in the
  vessel, C is the concentration of the probe immediately extravascular, Peff is the effective
  permeability (Chauhan VP, et al., Nature Nanotechnology. 2012; advance online
  publication; Chauhan VP, et al., Angewandte Chemie InternationalEdition. 2011; 50(48):
   11417-20), t is time after the initial image, r is the distance from the vessel central axis,
  and R is the vessel radius at that point along the vessel. Fluorescence intensities were
  used as these concentrations. The calculation was made as an average over the entire
  imaged volume for each tumor.
   [000489]        Breast tumor growth and survival studies: Mice bearing orthotopic E0771
  or 4T1 breast tumors were split into treatment groups, time-matched for time after
  implantation and size-matched for tumor volume at this time (110-111mm 3 in E0771, in
  4T1). The mice were treated at this initial size with 40mg/kg losartan or an equal volume
  of PBS intraperitoneally on day 0 and each subsequent day. The mice were then treated
  with either 2mg/kg doxorubicin or an equal volume of saline by intraperitonteal injection
  every three days beginning on day 1 (after 2 losartan or PBS treatments). The primary
                                                127

  tumors were then measured every 2 days, beginning on day 0, using calipers. Tumor
  growth was quantified using the time for each to reach double its initial volume. Animal
  survival was quantified based on time of death after initiation of treatment or time to
  reach excessive tumor burden (>1000mm 3).
   [000490]       Pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis studies: Mice bearing orthotopic
  AK4.4 pancreatic tumors were split into treatment groups, size-matched for tumor
  volume (22mm 3 ), 6 days after implantation. The mice were treated with 40mg/kg
  losartan or an equal volume of PBS intraperitoneally on day 7 after implantation and each
  subsequent day. The mice were then treated with either 60mg/kg 5-FU or an equal
  volume of saline by intravenous injection on days 9 and 13 after implantation. Tumors
  were extracted on day 14 for measurement using calipers. Tumor growth was quantified
  using the size at day 14. For metastasis studies, mice were treated with losartan or PBS
  on day 11 after implantation, then with 5-FU or saline on days 13 and 17. Metastatic
  burden was assessed at death.
   [000491]       Mean arterial blood pressure: Mice bearing orthotopic AK4.4 pancreatic
  tumors were used for blood pressure measurements. Mean arterial blood pressure was
  measured by cannulation of the left carotid artery after a longitudinal skin incision above
  the trachea, as described previously (Zlotecki RA, et al., Microvasc Res. 1995; 50(3):
  429-43). After removal of the submandibular gland, the paratracheal muscles was split
  and the left carotid artery was isolated. The cranial end of the artery was ligated with a 6
  0 silk suture and another suture was tied loosely around the central part of the artery. A
  metal clamp was then positioned caudally to stop blood flow during the cannulation. A
  polyethylene catheter (PE-10, Becton-Dickinson) filled with heparinised saline was then
  be inserted through a hole cut proximally to the cranial ligature, and the other suture was
  tied tightly around the tubing and artery. The clamp was then removed and the end of the
  tubing was connected to a pressure transducer for the measurement of blood pressure.
   [000492]       Mathematical analysis and modeling: The analysis was carried out on
  mosaic images of whole tumors taken with multiphoton microscopy after injection of
  2MDa FITC-dextran as a perfused vessel tracer. Details of the models and corresponding
  equations are described in Chauhan VP, et al., Nature Nanotechnology. 2012; advance
  online publication, and Baish JW, et al., Proc NatlAcad Sci USA. 2011; 108(5): 1799
  803.
   [000493]       Hydraulic conductivity: Mice bearing orthotopic E0771 breast tumors
  were split into treatment groups, time-matched for time after implantation and size
  matched for tumor volume at this time (~100mm 3). The mice were then treated with

WO 2013/169739                                                               PCT/US2013/039901
  40mg/kg losartan or an equal volume of PBS intraperitoneally each day for 6 days.
  Interstitial hydraulic conductivity was measured as described previously (Mok W, et al.,
  Cancer Res. 2007; 67(22): 10664-8; Wabb EA, et al., Cancer research. 1974; 34(10):
  2814-22). The tumors were excised, and a 3mm biopsy punch was used to cut a
  cylindrical tissue block from each. A scalpel was then used to cut a 1.7mm-thick disc of
  viable tumor tissue from this cylindrical block. The disc-shaped tissue block was then
  placed into a clamp with a fluid flow channel. A pressure head of 10cmH 20 was applied,
  and a small bubble was created to measure the fluid velocity in the 0.58mm diameter
  tubing connecting the pressure head to the clamp. Measurements were taken over 5
   10min per tumor. The interstitial hydraulic conductivity was then calculated as
  IQ -     l L
     4       %.,where  Q is the volumetric flow rate through the tissue, A is the cross-sectional
  area of the tissue block, K is the interstitial hydraulic conductivity, Ap is the applied
  pressure drop, and Ax is the tissue block thickness.

  administration of losartan (Group 2), and one group of twenty-two mice for subcutaneous
  injection of losartan in the absence of pump. Subcutaneous pumps with losartan were
  implanted on day 7 into the twenty-two mice in Group 2. All of the mice in Group 1 were
  subcutaneously dosed with PBS daily until day 14 or day 19. All of the mice in Groups 2
  and 3 were dosed with losartan at 40 mg/kg daily until day 14 or day 19. Blood and
  tumor samples were collected either 2 hours or 6 hours post injection. The body weight
  was measured for all mice every other weekday (i.e., every Monday, Wednesday, and
  Friday) until the final dose on day 14 or 19. For PK/PD analysis, six mice in each group
  (three mice per time point in Groups 2 and 3) were euthanized on day 14 and day 19.
  Blood samples were collected and tumor weight was measured. To perform collagen I
  immunohistochemistry, the tumors of ten mice were collected following the measurement
  of the tumor volume.
   [000496]       Sample collection
           Sample type: plasma and weighed tumors (for PK/PD analysis) and tumors (for
  immunohistochemistry analysis)
           Collection instruction: For PK/PD analysis, blood samples from euthanized mice
  were collected into lithium heparin tubes and inverted until centrifuged for 5 minutes in
  4'C at 6,000 rpm. Weighed tumors were homogenized with PBS. For
  immunohistochemistry analysis of collagen I, tumors were collected and sliced into two
  pieces. Both pieces were placed in 4 % formaldehyde for up to 6 hours (0.5 hour per 1
  mm) then rinsed three times with PBS. The tumor samples were stored in 30% sucrose
  for 24 hours and then frozen in 30 x 24 mm molds with optimum cutting temperature
  compound (OCT). The tumor samples were then stored in tissue cassettes at -80'C.
           Sample storage: All samples were stored at -80'C.
  Results
  Losartan bioanalysis
   [000497]       The plasma and tumor levels of losartan and losartan carboxylic acid
  (E3174) were measured in Group 2 (subcutaneous pump administration at 40 mg/kg) and
  Group 3 (subcutaneous injections without pump at 40 mg/kg) mice on day 14 and day 19.
  The concentration of losartan and losartan carboxylic acid in plasma and tumor was
  quantified using high performance liquid chromatography/fluorescence (HPLC/FLU)
  method.
   [000498]       As shown in Table 3, the plasma and tumor losartan levels were higher in
                                             130

WO 2013/169739                                                            PCT/US2013/039901
  the mice administered with losartan via subcutaneous pump (Group 2, 6-hour time point),
  as compared to the mice injected with losartan subcutaneously without pump (Group 3, 6
  hour time point), on both day 14 and day 19. Similarly, the plasma and tumor levels of
  losartan were higher in the mice administered with losartan via subcutaneous pump
  (Group 2, 2-hour time point), as compared to the mice injected with losartan
  subcutaneously without pump (Group 3, 2-hour time point), on day 19 (Table 3). Table
  3 also indicates that the plasma and tumor levels of losartan increased or became steady
  from the 2-hour time point to the 6-hour time point in the mice administered with losartan
  via subcutaneous pump (Group 2, both day 14 and day 19), whereas the plasma and
  tumor levels of losartan generally decreased from the 2-hour time point to the 6-hour time
  point in the mice injected with losartan subcutaneously without pump (Group 3, both day
   14 and day 19).
   [000499]       Also as shown in Table 3, the plasma and tumor levels of losartan
  carboxylic acid were generally higher in the mice administered with losartan via
  subcutaneous pump (Group 2, 6-hour time point), as compared to the mice injected with
  losartan subcutaneously without pump (Group 3, 6-hour time point), on day 19. Table 3
  also indicates that the plasma and tumor levels of losartan carboxylic acid increased or
  became steady from the 2-hour time point to the 6-hour time point in the mice
  administered with losartan via subcutaneous pump (Group 2, both day 14 and day 19),
  whereas the plasma and tumor levels of losartan carboxylic acid decreased from the 2
  hour time point to the 6-hour time point in the mice injected with losartan subcutaneously
  without pump (Group 3, both day 14 and day 19).
   [000500]       These data indicate that continuous administration of losartan (e.g.,
  subcutaneous pump administration) resulted in generally higher plasma and tumor levels
  of losartan and losartan carboxylic acid, as compared to pulsatile administration (e.g.,
  subcutaneous injections without pump).

  Tumor volume measurement
   [000501]       The volumes of the tumors collected from the mice in Group 1
  (subcutaneous injections of PBS as a control), Group 2 (subcutaneous pump
  administration of losartan at 40 mg/kg), and Group 3 (subcutaneous injections of losartan
  without pump at 40 mg/kg) were measured on day 19. The baseline tumor volumes were
  measured on day 7.
   [000502]       The changes in the average tumor volume in the mouse AK4.4 pancreatic
  tumor model are shown in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, the average tumor volume in
  Group 2 is about 27% smaller than that of Group 1 and Group 3 on day 19. The average
  tumor volume increased by 21-fold from day 7 to day 19 in Group 2 mice, whereas the
  average tumor volume increased more than 30-fold in Group 1 and Group 3 mice during
  the same time period (Table 4).
   [000503]       These data indicate that continuous administration of losartan (e.g.,
  subcutaneous pump administration) was more effective in reducing tumor volume than
  pulsatile administration (e.g., subcutaneous injections without pump).

  Example 12: Colla2en I immunofluorescence quantitative ima2e analysis
   [000504]        This example presents a study that compared the pump administration and
  pulsatile injections of losartan based on the results of immunofluorescence quantitative
  image analysis for collagen I in AK4.4 pancreatic tumors.
  Experimental design
   [000505]        Mice implanted with AK4.4 pancreatic tumors were randomized into three
  groups. In Group 1, the mice were subcutaneously injected with saline as a control. In
  Group 2, losartan was administered to the mice via subcutaneous pump. In Group 3,
  losartan was administered to the mice via subcutaneous injections in the absence of pump.
   [000506]        Immunohistochemistry for collagen I was performed as described in the
  experimental protocols for Examples 11.
  Image analysis approach
   [000507]        To quantify the positively stained area for collagen I and to identify the
  number of collagen I positive fibers, each collagen fiber was outlined and each collagen
  area was calculated from the collagen I positive area / total area. The average collagen I
  area and number of collagen I positive fibers were calculated by averaging the total ten
  fields from each tumor sample.
  Results
   [000508]        Representative images of collagen I staining are shown in Fig. 37A-37C.
  As shown in Fig. 37A, the percentage of collagen I positive area in a tumor sample from
  Group 2 is 4.4530%, as compared to 22.356% (Fig. 37A) in a sample from Group 2 and
   11.34% (Fig. 37C) in a sample from Group 3.
   [000509]        The average percentages of collagen I positive areas in tumor samples
  from Groups 1-3 mice are summarized in Fig. 38A. As shown in Fig. 38A, the tumor
  samples from the mice administered with losartan via subcutaneous pump (Group 2)

   [000512]       These data indicate that administration of losartan to mice implanted with
  pancreatic tumors reduced collagen production in tumors, as evidenced by the percentage
  of collagen I positive area and the number of collagen I fibers. Further, continuous
  administration of losartan (e.g, subcutaneous pump administration) showed a more
  significant effect on reducing collagen production, as compared to pulsatile
  administration (e.g., subcutaneous injections without pump). This study suggests that
  AHCM, such as losartan, can be used to improve the delivery or efficacy of cancer
  therapy.
