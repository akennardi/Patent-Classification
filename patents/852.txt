                                     TITLE OF INVENTION:
        DRY PET FOOD COMPRISING A PALATABILITY ENHANCING COATING
   TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5
   The present invention relates to a dry pet food, more particularly it relates to a dry pet food
   comprising a core that contains starch and protein and a palatability enhancing coating that
   contains edible phosphate salt and yeast extract.
10 Examples of dry pet food according to the present invention include coated kibbles for cats
   or dogs. Kibbles may be formed, for instance, by an extrusion or compaction process in
   which kibble raw materials (e.g. cereal flour, meat meal etc.) are pressed to form an
   extruded or pelletized kibble. The palatability enhancing coating can be applied onto the
   kibble core during or after extrusion or compaction.

   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Pet food is commonly categorized on the basis of its moisture content:
   (1) dry or low moisture content products (typically less than 15%). The products typically
20 combine high nutritional content with convenience, but are generally less palatable;
   (2) wet or high moisture content products (greater than about 50%). These products are
   generally; most palatable to the pets;
   (3) semi-moist or semi-dry or soft dry or intermediate or medium moisture content products
   (generally between 15 and 50%). These products are usually less palatable than wet or high
25 moisture pet food but more palatable than dry pet food.
   Pets, like humans, are attracted to food that they find palatable. Therefore, palatability
   enhancers are very important for animal consumption, especially for dry pet food as this
   type of pet food is generally less preferred by pets.
30
   It is well-known in the art to incorporate palatability enhancing ingredients in dry pet food
   to increase the palatability thereof and to make them more appealing to pets. Examples of
   such palatability enhancing ingredients include: animal digest, animal fat, yeast autolysate,
   flavouring etc.

                                                     2
   Dry pet foods containing palatability enhancing ingredients have been described in the prior
   art.
   WO 2013/007639 describes a palatability-enhancing composition for pet food comprising
 5 about 1 to 70% by weight of free amino acids, where at least two amino acids are chosen
   from Ala, Glu, Pro, Leu, Asp, Tyr, Phe, Met or, alternatively from Met, Glu, Pro, Gly, Leu,
   Asp, Tyr, Phe. Examples 2 and 7 describe the preparation of a dry cat food by coating a
   dried extruded food composition with poultry fat and two different dry palatability
   enhancing compositions comprising trisodium pyrophosphate and brewer's yeast.
10
   US 2013/0122154 describes a pet food product comprising:
   e    a kibble;
   e    a first coating on the kibble, the first coating comprising a plasticizer; and
   e    a second coating on the kibble, the second coating comprising a fat;
15 e    wherein the coated kibble has a moisture level less than 12%
   The examples of this US patent application describe the preparation of coated kibble by
   extruding a hydrated blend, drying the extrudate, followed by subsequently coating the
   dried extrudate with glycerine and a fat system containing chicken fat and beef tallow. It is
   observed in the patent application that the kibble may be further coated with a standard
20 palatant blend.
   US 2011/0159149 describes a palatability enhancing composition that can be applied to a
   surface of a companion animal food, said composition comprising at least one palatant
   and/or at least one tasteant modified by glycerol and/or propylene glycol. The palatant may
25 be selected from the group consisting of phosphates, pyrophosphates, proteins, protein
   hydrolysates, biological extracts, dried yeast, yeast extracts, peptones and combinations
   thereof.
   US 2001/0002272 describes a method for enhancing the palatability of an extruded pet food,
30 said method comprising the steps of: providing a palatability enhancing composition
   including tetrasodium pyrophosphate; and applying the palatability enhancer to the
   extruded pet food.

                                                  3
   JP3206853 describes the preparation of pet food kibbles by extruding a composition
   containing cereal flours, meat meal, fish meal, wheat germ, brewer's yeast, vitamins,
   minerals and water; drying the extrudate; and coating the dried extrudate with beef tallow
   and yeast extract.
 5
   However, palatability of known dry pet foods, such as kibbles for cats or dogs, can still be
   improved.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
10
   The inventors have discovered that palatability of certain dry pet food products can be
   improved significantly by coating the food product with a covering layer that contains dry
   yeast extract, edible phosphate salt; and optionally other edible components.
15 One aspect of the invention relates to a dry pet food comprising 50-99.5 wt.% of a core and
   0.5-50 wt.% of an external coating that covers at least a part of the core and that is composed
   of one or more layers, including a covering layer that is located on the outside of the pet
   food, said dry pet food having a total water content of not more than 15 wt.%; said core
   containing:
20 e   carbohydrates in a concentration of 20-90 %by weight of the core, said carbohydrates
       including starch in a concentration of 5-50% by weight of the core;
   e protein in a concentration of 10-50% by weight of the core;
   e   fat in a concentration of 0-40% by weight of the core;
   said covering layer being composed of:
25 e   1-80 wt.% dry yeast extract;
   e   0.5-60 wt.% of edible phosphate salt selected from pyrophosphate, triphosphate and
       combinations thereof;
   e   0-95 wt.% of other edible components;
   wherein the dry yeast extract is contained in the covering layer in a concentration of 0.1
30 10% by weight of the dry pet food and wherein the edible phosphate salt is contained in the
   covering layer in a concentration of 0.1-5% by weight of the dry pet food.

                                                  4
   The combined application of yeast extract and edible phosphate salt in a covering layer of
   the dry pet food product was found to significantly improve the palatability of the product
   as compared to a coated food product in which either of the two components is lacking. The
   improved palatability of the dry pet food of the present invention can suitably be
 5 demonstrated in a test where the total amount of eaten product is monitored and compared
   to a suitable control.
   Another aspect of the invention concerns the use of the aforementioned dry pet food for
   feeding a companion animal selected from cats and dogs.
10
   Yet another aspect of the invention relates to a process of manufacturing the aforementioned
   dry pet food, said process comprising the successive steps of:
   *   providing a dough comprising 20-40 wt.% starch;10-40 wt.% protein; and 15-45 wt.%
       water;
15 e   extruding the dough employing extrusion temperatures that exceeds 105 C;
   e   optionally, applying one or more coating compositions onto the extrudate; and
   e   applying a palatability enhancing composition onto the optionally coated extrudate, said
       palatability enhancing composition containing yeast extract and edible phosphate salt
       selected from pyrophosphate, triphosphate and combinations thereof.

   contents from yeast (removing the cell walls).
   The term "dry yeast extract" as used herein, unless indicated otherwise, refers to the dry
20 matter that is contained in a yeast extract.
   The term "animal digest" as used herein refers to meat or animal by-products that have been
   hydrolyzed, e.g. by using acid, base, salt, heat, enzymes or any combination thereof.
25 The term "dry animal digest" as used herein, unless indicated otherwise, refers to the dry
   matter that is contained in aninmal digest.

30 e   20-60 wt.% carbohydrates;
   e    10-30 wt.% fat;
   e   at least 500 mg/kg, preferably 1000-4000 mg/kg of vitamins selected from vitamin E,
       vitamin A, vitamin B12, vitamin D3, riboflavin, niacin (vitamin B3), pantothenate

        source of vitamin K activity) and combinations thereof;
   e    at least 5 g/kg, preferably 10-25 g/kg of minerals selected from calcium, potassium,
 5      sodium, zinc, iron, copper and combinations thereof.
   A dry dog food according to the present invention preferably contains:
   *    20-50 wt.% proteinaceous matter;
   *    20-80 wt.% carbohydrates;
10 e    2-40 wt.% fat;
   e    at least 500 mg/kg, preferably 1000-4000 mg/kg of vitamins selected from vitamin E,

   e    at least 5 g/kg, preferably 10-25 g/kg of minerals selected from calcium, potassium,
        sodium, zinc, iron, copper and combinations thereof.
   The dry pet food typically has a bulk density of 200-600 g1l, more preferably of 300-500
20 g/l and most preferably of 300-450 g1l.
   The dry pet food of the present invention may have a moist, lubricious, "meaty"-looking
   appearance. The meat-like appearance may be enhanced by adding texture. Texture may be
   added using extrusion dies, moulds, or mechanical surface modification of the kibble before
25 or after the coating is applied. The meat-like appearance may also be enhanced by adding
   colour. Artificial colorants may be used, as well as inorganic colorants such as iron oxide,
   or biologically-derived colourants, such as cochineal, carmine, or carminic acid.
   Alternatively, incorporation of red meats or red meat by-products, blood meal, or other red
   to dark-brown food ingredients may alter the colour of the pet food and make the kibble
30 more meat-like in appearance. A moist appearance may be provided by using a brightener.
   The texture of the pet food may be rendered more meat-like by modifying the softness of
   the food ("crunchy" texture not generally being associated with meat). The softness of the

                                                   14
   food may be adjusted by selecting a suitable coating or coatings and/or by applying glycerol
   in the core. These approaches do not preclude the use of other additives or techniques for
   enhancing the softness (or "chewiness") of the food.
 5 The texture of the dry pet food can be characterized with the Young's modulus (kgf/cm2)
   of the pet food. For hard pet food the maximum pressure may be from 12 to 35 kgf/cm 2 ,
   more particularly from 12 to 20 kgf/cm 2 . Soft pet food typically has a Young's Modulus of
   1 to 12 kgf/cm 2 , more particularly of 2 to 7 kgf/cm 2 , especially of 2.5 to 5 kgf/cm 2 .
10 Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of a dry pet food as defined herein before
   for feeding a companion animal, especially a companion animal selected from cats and
   dogs, Even more preferably, the dry pet food is used for feeding a cat.
   Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to a process of manufacturing a dry pet
15 food as described herein before, said process comprising the successive steps of:
   *   providing a dough comprising 20-40 wt.% starch;10-40 wt.% protein; and 15-45 wt.%
       water;
   e   extruding the dough employing extrusion temperatures that exceeds 105'C;
   e   optionally, applying one or more coating compositions onto the extrudate; and
20 e   applying a palatability enhancing composition onto the optionally coated extrudate, said
       palatability enhancing composition containing yeast extract and edible phosphate salt
       selected from pyrophosphate, triphosphate and combinations thereof.
   It should be understood that the palatability enhancing composition may be applied as a
25 single composition or, alternatively, that it may be applied in stages, e.g. by first applying
   the yeast extract and next the source of edible phosphate salt or vice versa. Preferably, the
   palatability enhancing composition is applied as a single composition.
   The dough is suitably formed by combining a proteinaceous material with a farinaceous
30 material and optionally other edible components. The proteinaceous material is a material
   having a proteinaceous matter content of at least 15% by weight of dry matter. Examples
   of proteinaceous material include vegetable proteins such as soybean protein, cotton seed
   protein, and peanut protein; animal proteins such as casein, albumin, and fresh animal tissue

                                                 15
   including fresh meat tissue and fresh fish tissue; and dried or rendered meals such as fish
   meal, poultry meal, meat meal, bone meal and the like. Other types of suitable proteinaceous
   materials include wheat gluten or corn gluten, and microbial proteins such as yeast.
 5 The farinaceous material is a material having a proteinaceous matter content of less than
    15% by weight of dry matter and containing at least 20% starch by weight of dry matter.
   Examples of farinaceous material include grains such as corn, milo, alfalfa, wheat, barley,
   rice, soy hulls, and other grains having low protein content.
10 Together, the proteinaceous material and the farinaceous material typically constitute at
   least 60%, more preferably at least 65% and most preferably 70-90% of the dry matter
   contained with the dough.
   Other ingredients that may suitably be employed in the dough include vitamins, minerals,
15 humectants, preservatives, fats and water.
   The initial water content of the dough preferably is in the range of 18-40 wt.%, more
   preferably in the range of 20-35 wt.%. The presence of water in combination with the
   heating conditions employed during extrusion ensure that the starch within the dough
20 becomes gelatinized. Gelatinization of the starch ensures that the extrudate retains its shape.
   The dough is preferably cooked during extrusion under conditions of elevated temperature
   and pressure as these conditions favour starch gelatinization. Extrusion may be carried out
   in, for instance, a single screw or a twin screw (counter rotating) extruder. The extruder
25 may be provided with a die having a particular shape, such as a circle, a ring or a cross. The
   extruded product is preferably segmented into discrete particles or pieces by a rotating
   cutting knife as the product is extruded.
   In the present process the dough is preferably extruded at an extrusion temperature of 110
30  150 'C, more preferably of 120-140 'C. Here the extrusion temperature refers to the
   temperature of the dough during extrusion.

                                                  16
   The palatability enhancing composition that is applied in the present process can be a
   powder, a paste, a gel or a liquid. Preferably, the palatability enhancing composition is a
   powder, more preferably a free flowing powder.
 5 According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the yeast extract that is
   contained in the palatability enhancing composition is an agglomerated dry yeast extract.
   Preferably, the agglomerated dry yeast extract has a mass weighted average particle size of
   50-1000 pm, more preferably of 100-800 pm and most preferably of 200-750 pm.
10 The yeast extract in the palatability enhancing composition typically has a bulk density in
   the range of 300-600 kg/m3 , more preferably in the range of 400-600 kg/m3 .
   The yeast extract is typically applied onto the optionally coated extrudate in a concentration
   of 0.1-10 %, more preferably of 0.2-6% and most preferably 0.3-4% by weight of the dry
15 pet food, said weight percentages being calculated on a dry weight basis.
   The edible phosphate salt employed in the present process preferably is pyrophosphate,
   especially   pyrophosphate      selected   from    tetrasodium    pyrophosphate,    trisodium
   pyrophosphate, disodium pyrophosphate, tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, tripotassium
20 pyrophosphate, dipotassium pyrophosphate and combinations thereof. More referably the
   pyrophosphate is selected from tetrasodium pyrophosphate, tetrapotassium pyrophosphate
   and combinations thereof. Most preferably, the pyrophosphate used is tetrasodium
   pyrophosphate.
25 The edible phosphate salt is typically applied onto the optionally coated extrudate in a
   concentration of at least 0.02%, more preferably of at least 0.1%, even more preferably of
   at least 0.2% and most preferably of at least 0.5% by weight of the dry pet food. The edible
   phosphate salt is preferably applied onto the extrudate in a concentration that does not
   exceed 5%, more preferably does not exceed 4% and most preferably does not exceed 3%
30 by weight of the dry pet food.
   According to a preferred embodiment of the present process, the palatability enhancing
   composition contains a source of hydrolyzed protein. The source of hydrolyzed protein is

                                                 17
   typically applied in a concentration of 0.5-12%, more preferably of 1-4% by weight of the
   dry pet food, said weight percentages being calculated on a dry weight basis.
   In accordance with one particular embodiment of the present process, the palatability
 5 enhancing composition is a powder, preferably a powder having a mass weighted average
   diameter in the range of 30-800 pm, more preferably in the range of 50-600 pm. Preferably,
   this powdery palatability enhancing composition has the composition of the covering layer
   as defined herein before.
10 In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present process the palatability enhancing
   composition is a particulate composition comprising particulate dry yeast and a particulate
   source of hydrolyzed protein, and optionally further particulate ingredients.
   According to an alternative embodiment, the palatability enhancing composition is an
15 aqueous liquid or a paste, most preferably a liquid. Besides yeast extract and the source of
   hydrolyzed protein the liquid or pasty palatability enhancing composition may suitably
   contain other ingredients.
   The source of hydrolyzed protein typically contains at least 50% of proteinaceous matter
20 by weight of dry matter. More preferably, the source of hydrolyzed protein contains at least
   60%, most preferably at least 70% of proteinaceous matter by weight of dry matter.
   The source of hydrolyzed protein that is employed in the process preferably contains
   hydrolyzed protein selected from hydrolyzed animal protein, hydrolyzed vegetable protein
25 and combinations thereof. Preferably, source of hydrolyzed protein contains hydrolyzed
   animal protein. The hydrolyzed animal protein preferably originates from an animal
   selected from poultry, pig, beef, lamb, fish and combinations thereof.
   The hydrolyzed protein in the source of hydrolyzed protein preferably has a degree of
30 hydrolysis of to 5-100%. Even more preferably, the degree of hydrolysis is in the range of
   10 to 98%, most preferably in the range of 20 to 95%.
   According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the source of hydrolyzed protein is
   animal digest. Preferred animal digest compositions contain viscera and/or liver.

                                                 18
   The palatability enhancing composition may suitably contain further ingredients such as
   further palatability enhancing ingredients, fat, carbohydrates, yeast (whole cells or cell wall
   fragments), minerals, anti-oxidants, preservatives and colouring.
 5
   Examples of further palatability enhancing components that are advantageously contained
   in the palatability enhancing composition besides the yeast extract,the edible phosphate salt
   and the optional source of hydrolyzed protein include: free fatty acids; flavouring and
   combinations thereof.
10
   Flavouring is another palatability enhancing component that is advantageously applied onto
   the optionally coated extrudate. The flavouring may be applied in the form of a concentrated
   topnote and/or in the form of a much less potent flavour ingredient (e.g. a spray dried
   reaction flavour). Preferably, flavouring is applied onto the optionally coated extrudate in
15 a concentration, calculated on the total dry pet food, of 10 ppm to 5 wt.%, more preferably
    100 ppm to 3 wt.% and most preferably of 1000 ppm to 2 wt.%, said flavouring selected
   from flavouring top-notes, Maillard reaction flavours and combinations thereof.
   A typical palatability enhancing composition that can suitably employed in the present
20 process has the following composition (percentages by weight of dry matter):
   e    20-50% yeast extract;
   e    0-20% yeast;
   e    10-50% animal digest;
   e    5-30% edible phosphate salt;
25 e    0-20% fat;
   e    0-10%, preferably 0.1-10% flavouring; and
   e    0-10% of other ingredients .
   According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the present process comprises the step
30 of applying a fat-containing coating compositions onto the extrudate before the application
   of the dry yeast extract.

                                                  19
   The fat-containing coating composition is typically applied in an amount of 1 to 30% by
   weight of the final dry pet food. More preferably, the fat-containing coating composition is
   applied in an amount of 1.5 to 20%, most preferably of 2 to 10% by weight of the dry pet
   food. The fat-containing coating composition is typically applied by spraying it onto the
 5 extruded dough. Preferably, the fat-containnig coating composition that is sprayed onto the
   extruded dough has a temperature in excess of 30'C, preferably of 32-80'C.
   In accordance with a preferred embodiment the fat-containing coating composition contains
   at least 50 wt.% fat. Even more preferably, the fat-containing coating contains 50-100 wt.%
10 fat, 0-30 wt.% water and 0-40 wt.% protinaceous matter, wherein said fat, water and
   proteinacous matter together constitute at least 70 wt.%, more preferably at least 80 wt.%
   of the fat-containing coating composition. Preferably, the fat-containing coating
   composition contains 1-30 wt.%, even more preferably 2-20 wt.% of proteinaceous matter.
15 The fat-containing coating composition may suitably contain other ingredients besides fat,
   proteinaceous matter and water. Examples of such other ingredients include preservatives,
   antioxidants, minerals, carbohydrates, flavouring, colourant.
   The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.

   trials further show that cats clearly prefer cat kibbles 1 over cat kibbles A and B.
   Example 4
   Fat coated cat kibbles were prepared using the procedure described in Example 1, except
10 that this time the pieces of extrudate were coated with fat in a batch coater by spraying
