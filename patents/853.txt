   BACKGROUND
   [0002]         1. Field of the Invention
10 [0003]         The present invention relates to child safety seats.
   [0004]         2. Description of the Related Art
   [0005]         Many booster seat products currently available on the market are sold as
   a combination of a booster seat with a removable backrest that is convertible to a
   booster seat having no backrest as the child grows. The legal age requirement for a child
15 to be seated on a booster seat continues to increase, and current booster seats are rated
   for 10-year old children. At the age of 10, the child can be transported by different
   caregivers. For example, a parent may drop the child off at school, and another
   caregiver may pick up the child after school. Existing booster seats are usually large and
   bulky, which makes it difficult for the child to carry the booster seat, or requires the
20 caregivers to purchase multiple booster seats.
   [0006]         Therefore, there is a need for an improved child safety seat that can be
   manufactured in a cost-effective manner, and address at least the foregoing issues.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS
   [0019]           FIGS. 1-11 are various schematic views illustrating an embodiment of a
   child safety seat 100. The child safety seat 100 can include a seat portion 102 comprised
   of a seat base 104 and a belt-positioning seat 106, and a backrest 108 having a headrest
 5 110. The child safety seat 100 can have different configurations of use in accordance
   with the age of a child received thereon. For example, the backrest 108 can be attached
   to the seat base 104 for seating a child of younger age, and detached from the seat base
   104 so that the seat base 104 and the belt-positioning seat 106 disposed thereon can
   form a booster seat for seating a child of older age. As the child further grows up, the
10 belt-positioning seat 106 can be removed from the seat base 104 for independent use for
   seating a child on a vehicle seat. FIGS. 1 and 2 are a front and a rear perspective view
   illustrating the seat base 104, the belt-positioning seat 106 and the backrest 108
   assembled to form the entire child safety seat 100. FIG. 3 is a perspective view
   illustrating the backrest 108 alone. FIGS. 4 and 5 are a front and a rear perspective view
15 illustrating the belt-positioning seat 106 installed on the seat base 104 to form a booster
   seat without the backrest 108. FIG. 6 is a perspective view illustrating the seat base 104
   alone. FIGS. 7-10 are perspective views illustrating the belt-positioning seat 106 alone.
   FIG. 11 is a partial cross-sectional view schematically illustrating the belt-positioning
   seat 106 assembled with the seat base 104.
20 [0020]           Referring to FIGS. 1-6, the seat base 104 can have a bottom surface 112
   suitable for placement on a vehicle seat, and two armrests 114 protruding upward from
   an upper surface 116 of the seat base 104. According to an example of construction, the
   seat base 104 may include, e.g., a rigid shell body 118, the bottom surface 112 and the
                                                 4

   upper surface 116 may be two opposite surfaces of the shell body 118, and the two
   armrests 114 can be fixedly connected with the shell body 118 at a left and a right side
   thereof. The shell body 118 and the armrests 114 may be made of a rigid material,
   which can include, without limitation, plastics. Moreover, a left and a right side of the
 5 shell body 118 may be respectively connected object containers 119, such as cup
   holders.
   [0021]          As better shown in FIGS. 2 and 5, a rear of the shell body 118 can
   include a plurality of connectors 120 for attachment to a fixed anchor structure provided
   on a vehicle seat. The connectors 120 can be, e.g., ISOFIX connectors. For attaching the
10 backrest 108 to the seat base 104, the rear of the shell body 118 can further include one
   or more transversal bar(s) 121, and a lower end of the backrest 108 can include one or
   more clip(s) 123 operable to clamp the transversal bar(s) 121. The backrest 108 can be
   attached to the seat base 104 by engaging the clip(s) 123 with the transversal bar(s) 121,
   and detached from the seat base 104 by disengaging the clip(s) 123 from the transversal
15 bar(s) 121.
   [0022]          Referring to FIG. 5, according to an embodiment, the seat base 104 can
   further include a belt positioner 115 that is coupled to the shell body 118 via a leash 117.
   The belt positioner 115 may have a belt hole I15A for passage of a belt, and a slit 11 5B
   for insertion of a belt into the belt hole 115A. In use, the belt positioner 115 may be
20 coupled to a shoulder belt of a vehicle seatbelt. When it is not used, the belt positioner
   115 may be detached from the shoulder belt of the vehicle seatbelt. The unused belt
   positioner 115 may be stored in a storage compartment 122 provided on the seat base
                                                 5

   104. For example, the storage compartment 122 may be provided at a rear of the shell
   body 118 of the seat base 104.
   [0023]          Referring to FIGS. 1 and 4-6, the seat base 104 can have a receiving
   region 124 between the two armrests 114 configured to receive at least partially the
 5 belt-positioning seat 106. According to an example of construction, the receiving region
   124 can include a positioning cavity 124A (better shown in FIG. 6) provided on the
   upper surface 116 of the seat base 104. The positioning cavity 124A may have
   dimensions that substantially match with those of the belt-positioning seat 106. For
   example, the positioning cavity 124A can have a width W substantially matched with a
10 width of the belt-positioning seat 106, and a length L substantially matched with a
   length of the belt-positioning seat 106. Moreover, a depth D of the positioning cavity
   124A can substantially match with a thickness of the belt-positioning seat 106. In this
   manner, the belt-positioning seat 106 can be snugly fitted in the positioning cavity
   124A.
15 [0024]          In the example illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 4-6, the positioning cavity
   124A is opened at a front of the seat base 104, which can facilitate access to the interior
   of the positioning cavity 124A for removal and/or placement of the belt-positioning seat
   106. It will be appreciated, however, that other configurations are possible. For example,
   FIG. 12 illustrates a variant construction of the seat base 104 in which the positioning
20 cavity   124A may be entirely surrounded by sidewalls that prevent horizontal
   movements of the belt-positioning seat 106 in the positioning cavity 124A, so that the
   belt-positioning seat 106 can only be vertically installed in and removed from the
   positioning cavity 124A.
                                                6

   [00251           Referring to FIGS. 7-10, the belt-positioning seat 106 is installable in the
   receiving region 124 of the seat base 104, and removable from the seat base 104 for
   independent use for seating a child on a vehicle seat. According to an embodiment, the
   belt-positioning seat 106 can include a seat body 126 and two belt guides 128.
 5 [0026]           The seat body 126 can have an upper surface 130 on which a child can
   sit, and a bottom surface 132 adapted to be placed on a vehicle seat when the
   belt-positioning seat 106 is independently used. The seat body 126 can be compact in
   shape and size to facilitate its portability and placement in the receiving region 124 of
   the seat base 104. For example, the seat body 126 can have a plate shape having
10 dimensions smaller than the seat base 104. According to an example of construction, the
   seat body 126 may be made of a rigid material, which may include, without limitation,
   plastics.
   [00271           When the belt-positioning seat 106 is used independently on a vehicle
   seat, the two belt guides 128 are used for guiding the transversal passage of a restraining
15 belt (e.g., a vehicle seatbelt). According to an embodiment, the two belt guides 128 can
   be respectively connected pivotally with a left and a right side of the seat body 126
   about two pivot axes 134, which can be generally parallel to the left and right sides of
   the seat body 126. The belt guides 128 can be made of a rigid material, which can
   include, e.g., plastics, a metallic material, and the like. The belt guide 128 on each of the
20 left and right side of the seat body 126 can rotate relative to the seat body 126 between a
   deployed position (shown in FIG. 9) where the belt guide 128 can protrude upward
   above the upper surface 130 of the seat body 126 for use, and a storage position (shown
   in FIG. 8) where the belt guide 128 can be stowed in a storage cavity 136 provided in
                                                  7

   the seat body 126. For example, the storage cavity 136 can be provided on the bottom
   surface 132 of the seat body 126, and the belt guide 128 is rotatable toward the bottom
   surface 132 to be received in the storage cavity 136. The belt-positioning seat 106 can
   be placed in the receiving region 124 of the seat base 104 with the two belt guides 128
 5 in the storage position.
   [00281          Referring to FIGS. 8-10, the two belt guides 128 can have a same
   structure. For example, each belt guide 128 can have a belt hole 138 configured to
   receive the placement of a restraining belt (e.g., a vehicle seatbelt). The belt hole 138 is
   disposed at a forward position relative to a rear end 126A of the seat body 126. A front
10 edge 140 of the belt guide 128 can have a slit 142A for insertion of a restraining belt
   into the belt hole 138. The slit 142A is narrower than the belt hole 138 so that the belt
   hole 138 can restrict a restraining belt received therein. When the belt guide 128 is in
   the deployed position, the belt hole 138 may have an inclined profile, so that a rear end
   142B of the belt hole 138 is positioned higher than the slit 142A and at a forward
15 position relative to the rear end 126A of the seat body 126.
   [0029]          FIG. 13 is a schematic view illustrating another suitable construction of
   the belt guide 128. Rather than having the belt hole 138 described previously, the belt
   guide 128 shown in FIG. 13 can have a belt slot 138' configured to receive the
   placement of a restraining belt. The belt slot 138' can have a front opening 142A' on the
20 front edge 140 of the belt guide 128, and a closed rear end 142B'. The belt slot 138'
   may be narrow so as to prevent twisting of a restraining belt placed therein. The front
   opening 142A' can have a tapered shape that is larger on the front edge 140 of the belt
   guide 128 and narrows toward an interior of the belt slot 138', thereby facilitating the
                                                 8

   insertion of a restraining belt. The rear end 142B' of the belt slot 138' can be located
   higher than the front opening 142A' and at a forward position relative to the rear end
   126A of the seat body 126 when the belt guide 128 is in the deployed position.
   [0030]          During use, the two belt guides 128 can position a restraining belt
 5 forward and down onto the thighs of a child sitting on the belt-positioning seat 106. The
   restraining belt can thereby wrap across the child in a more suitable manner to provide
   effective protection.
   [0031]          Referring to FIG. 10, the belt-positioning seat 106 can further include a
   belt positioner 146 operable to couple to a restraining belt that is installed through the
10 belt guides 128. The belt positioner 146 may be similar to belt positioner 115 of the seat
   base 104, and include a belt hole 146A for passage of a belt and a slit 146B for insertion
   of a belt into the belt hole 146A. Moreover, the belt positioner 146 may be coupled to
   the seat body 126 of the belt-positioning seat 106 via a leash 147, which may be
   exemplary a strap. In use, the belt positioner 146 is deployable outside the seat body
15 126 and coupled to a shoulder belt of a vehicle seatbelt. When it is unused, the belt
   positioner 146 may be detached from the shoulder belt of the vehicle seatbelt. The
   unused belt positioner 146 and the leash 147 may be placed in a storage compartment
   148 provided in the seat body 126. The storage compartment 148 may be provided at a
   bottom of the seat body 126. A pivoting cover 150 connected with the seat body 126
20 may be operable to close and open the storage compartment 148.
   [0032]          Referring to FIGS. 6-10, the belt-positioning seat 106 can further include
   a coupling structure 151 for attaching the belt-positioning seat 106 to the seat base 104.
   According to an embodiment, the coupling structure 151 can include a catching portion
                                                9

   152 fixedly connected with the seat body 126 at an outer edge thereof, and a connector
   154 coupled with the seat body 126. For example, the catching portion 152 can be
   fixedly connected with the rear end 126A of the seat body 126, and the connector 154
   can be coupled with the seat body 126 at a forward position relative to the catching
 5 portion 152. According to an example of construction, the catching portion 152 may be
   formed as a protruding lip. According to an example of construction, the connector 154
   may be provided as a unitary part movably connected with the seat body 126. For
   example, the connector 154 can be pivotally connected with the seat body 126, and is
   rotatable relative to the seat body 126 between a storage position where the connector
10 154 is stowed in the seat body 126 and a deployed position where the connector 154
   protrudes downward from the bottom surface 132 of the seat body 126. According to an
   example of construction, the bottom surface 132 of the seat body 126 may include a
   cavity 156, and the connector 154 may be received at least partially in the cavity 156 in
   the storage position.
15 [0033]          Referring to FIGS. 4-11, when the belt-positioning seat 106 is installed
   in the receiving region 124 of the seat base 104, the catching portion 152 can engage
   with a corresponding structure provided on the seat base 104. For example, the catching
   portion 152 may engage with an opening 158 (better shown in FIG. 6) provided on the
   seat base 104. The opening 158 may be exemplary formed through a rear sidewall of the
20 positioning cavity 124A. Moreover, the connector 154 of the belt-positioning seat 106
   protruding downward can be received at least partially in an anchoring slot 160 (better
   shown in FIG. 6) of the seat base 104. For example, the anchoring slot 160 may be
   opened on a major surface 162 of the positioning cavity            124A on which the
   belt-positioning seat 106 can be placed and supported. While the connector 154 is
                                              10

   received at least partially in the anchoring slot 160, a latch 164 (better shown in FIG. 11)
   provided in the seat base 104 can engage with the connector 154 so as to retain the
   belt-positioning seat 106 with the seat base 104.
   [0034]          Referring to FIGS. 6 and 11, the latch 164 is movably assembled with
 5 the shell body 118 of the seat base 104. For example, the latch 164 may be slidably
   connected with the shell body 118, so that the latch 164 can slide rearward to engage
   with an opening 154A (better shown in FIG. 10) provided on the connector 154 and
   slide forward to disengage from the connector 154. Moreover, the seat base 104 can
   include a spring 166 and a release part 168 respectively connected with the latch 164.
10 The spring 166 can have two ends respectively connected with the shell body 118 of the
   seat base 104 and the latch 164. The release part 168 can be exposed on a front of the
   seat base 104, and can be slidably connected with the shell body 118. The release part
   168 is operable to urge the latch 164 to move for disengaging from the connector 154
   for removal of the belt-positioning seat 106 from the seat base 104.
15 [00351          Exemplary operations for converting the child safety seat 100 to different
   configurations of use are described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 1-11. For seating
   a child of young age, the backrest 108 can be attached to the seat base 104 by engaging
   the clip 123 of the backrest 108 with the transversal bar 121 provided on the seat base
   104. Moreover, the belt-positioning seat 106 can be installed on the seat base 104 with
20 the belt guides 128 in the storage position. The installation of the belt-positioning seat
   106 can include engaging the catching portion 152 of the belt-positioning seat 106 with
   the opening 158 in the seat base 104, and rotating the belt-positioning seat 106 toward
   the positioning cavity 124A with the connector 154 protruding downward until the
                                                 11

   belt-positioning seat 106 is positioned in the positioning cavity 124A and the connector
   154 received in the anchoring slot 160 of the seat base 104. As the connector 154 inserts
   into the anchoring slot 160, the latch 164 biased by the spring 166 can engage the
   connector 154. The respective engagements of the latch 164 with the connector 154 and
 5 the catching portion 152 with the opening 158 can lock the belt-positioning seat 106 in
   position. The assembly of the seat base 104, the belt-positioning seat 106 and the
   backrest 108 can thereby form the child safety seat 100 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, which
   can receive a child sitting on the belt-positioning seat 106.
   [00361          For seating a child of older age, the backrest 108 can be removed from
10 the seat base 104, while the belt-positioning seat 106 remains attached to the seat base
   104. The seat base 104 and the belt-positioning seat 106 can thereby form a booster seat
   having no backrest shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, which can receive a child siting on the
   belt-positioning seat 106.
   [00371          As the child grows older, the belt-positioning seat 106 can be removed
15 from the seat base 104 and used independently for seating the child on a vehicle seat.
   For removing the belt-positioning seat 106 from the seat base 104, the release part 168
   can be actuated so that the latch 164 is urged to move for disengaging from the
   connector 154. The belt-positioning seat 106 then can be removed from the seat base
   104. The belt-positioning seat 106 detached from the seat base 104 can be installed on a
20 vehicle seat with the bottom surface 132 of the seat body 126 contacting with the
   vehicle seat. The connector 154 can be in its storage position received in the cavity 156
   while the belt-positioning seat 106 rests on the vehicle seat. After a child sits on the
   upper surface 130 of the seat body 126 between the two belt guides 128, a vehicle
                                                  12

   seatbelt can be installed so as to extend through the belt guides 128 protruding upward
   from the upper surface 130 and wrap across the child's body, and the belt positioner 146
   deployed outward can be coupled to the shoulder belt of the vehicle seatbelt. The belt
   guides 128 can freely rotate to adapt to the size of the child sitting on the upper surface
 5 130 between the two belt guides 128. For example, a range of adjustment for each belt
   guide 128 can include, without limitation, an angular range of about 60 degrees defined
   between a vertical position where the belt guide 128 rises upward generally
   perpendicular to the seat body 126 and an outward inclined position where the belt
   guide 128 is tilted outward about 60 degrees from the vertical position.
10 [0038]          The aforementioned embodiment provides a configuration in which the
   belt-positioning seat 106 installed on the seat base 104 can serve as a sitting support. It
   will be appreciated, however, that other configurations may be possible. FIG. 14 is a
   perspective view illustrating another example in which the receiving region 124' for
   placement of the belt-positioning seat 106 can include a cavity 170 that is provided at an
15 underside of the seat base 104 and between the two armrests 114. The belt-positioning
   seat 106 when unused can be stored in the cavity 170. In the example of FIG. 14, a child
   can directly sit on the upper surface of the seat base 104 when the seat base 104 is used
   for seating a child on a vehicle seat.
   [0039]          Advantages of the structures described herein include the ability to
20 provide a child safety seat convertible to different configurations of use according to the
   age of the child. The child safety seat can include a seat base, a backrest and a
   belt-positioning seat that can be assembled together to form a complete child safety seat
                                                13

  or detached for independent use, which can offer more flexibility and expand the service
  life of the child safety seat.
  [0040]           Realization of the child safety seat has been described in the context of
  particular embodiments. These embodiments are meant to be illustrative and not
5 limiting. Many variations, modifications, additions, and improvements are possible.
  These and other variations, modifications, additions, and improvements may fall within
  the scope of the inventions as defined in the claims that follow.
