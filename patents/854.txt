ABSTRACT
A rolling friction or suspension friction impact mining method and a wear-resistant impact
mining machine using said method. The mining machine comprises a reciprocating impact part
(3). The reciprocating impact part comprises an impact drive device (4), a rolling reciprocating
device, and an impact head (6). The rolling reciprocating device comprises a rubbing body
(38), a rubbing body support (39), an impact guiding element (5.1), and a position-limiting
mechanism. The rubbing body (5.3) are disposed between the robbing body support (39) and
the impact guiding element (5.1), and inside of the position-limiting mechanism to form rolling
guiding. The impact drive device is disposed with a damage-prevention mechanism, a rotary
power buffer device, and a structural buffer device, such that the impact head reciprocatingly
move and have rolling or suspending friction under the support of the impact guiding element,
thereby preventing the damage-prevention force to damage a power drive device and a rolling
channel guiding device, and preventing the impact vibration caused by the reciprocating
impact part to affect the machine body and other parts. The overall stability is therefore
enhanced, and the service life is extended.

 ROLLING FRICTION OR SUSPENSION FRICTION IMPACT MINING METHOD AND
         WEAR-RESISTANT IMPACT MINING MACHINE USING SAID METHOD
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]     The present invention belongs to the mechanical field and is especially applicable to
a rolling friction or suspension friction impact mining method in the mining field and a wear
resistant impact mining machine using said method.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]     Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
[0003]     Tunneling machines and coal mining machines are mainly applied to excavation of
railways, bridges and culverts of roads and tunnels and mechanical mining of ore materials.
Most mining machines broadly applied at present are drilling and milling cutting-type tunneling
machines and rolling milling cutting-type mining machines and the working principle is to drill
and cut or mill and cut in a rolling manner a coalbed or a rockbed through picks arranged on
the outer surface at a front part of a cutting head. Since a relatively large rotating damage
force is generated by the cutting head during drilling and milling or rolling milling and cutting, a
relatively large twisting force will be generated to a rotating shaft, thus causing heavy damage
to the rotating shaft and shortening the equipment service life. The crushing efficiency of a
drilling milling or milling cutting mining method is relatively high with extremely high energy
consumption, and low production efficiency and lumpiness especially when tunneling crushing
and ore material mining are performed at a pressure stress. During the mining process, a large
amount of dust will be further generated, which results in a poor mining environment and
potential risks. In order to overcome various disadvantages of the drilling milling or milling
cutting mining method, reciprocating impact mining machines have emerged in the mining
field.
[0004]      In order to improve the mining efficiency, a cutting head of an existing reciprocating
impact mining machine is made as large as possible. When a material is impacted and fallen,
since the cutting head of the mining machine is heavy in weight and large in volume, a head
handle of the cutting head is seriously damaged from an impact guiding mechanism, thus
leading to damage on a drive system and a machine body, massive maintenance of the whole

                                                 -2
machine and a short service life. However, if the cutting head is narrow and small, the
production efficiency will be largely reduced. Therefore, it is in urgent need of an energy-saving
and environment-friendly impact mining machine which is high in production efficiency and
capable of preventing a cutting head from damaging an impact guiding mechanism with little
wear to the impact guiding mechanism, and little damage caused by an impact reactive force
on a drive system and a machine body.
[0005]     Invention Patent Numbered 201010238402.7 discloses a crushing mechanism for a
coal mining device. The equipment is composed of a main body, a power component, a
working component and a connecting arm etc. The power component drives the working
component to reciprocate and impact linearly to perform coal falling. The power component
applies a hydraulic cylinder. There is sliding friction between a piston in the hydraulic cylinder
and the cylinder body with large friction resistance, thus causing serious wear to a sealing plug
and increasing a gap between the piston and the cylinder body to increasing leakage while
increasing energy consumption and affecting the operational performance of the equipment. In
the present invention, the hydraulic cylinder is applied to driving the working component to
impact at a low speed with a low impact frequency, thus failing to realize a high frequency
impact effect of a mechanical transmission mechanism, e.g. a crank mechanism. The working
component is installed at an end of the hydraulic cylinder. When the hydraulic cylinder drives
the working component to extend out or retract along an axial direction of the hydraulic
cylinder, problems including swinging and oscillation etc. of the working component are further
caused to affect the impact effect. Since a hydraulic cylinder rod is not provided with an
auxiliary guiding device, the working component is seriously damaged from the hydraulic
cylinder by a powerful impact reactive force generated during mining. Thus, a sliding frictional
force is focused on the hydraulic cylinder to cause partial wear, which results in heavy damage
on the hydraulic cylinder and affects normal operation of the equipment.

[0117]      1. the device is compact and simple in integral structure and convenient to use and
operate; a material is fallen by an impact instead of being fallen by drilling milling and milling
cutting, thus substantially eliminating damage caused by a lateral force on the reciprocating

element, thus greatly reducing damage on the impact guiding element caused by reciprocating
impact and friction, and reducing consumption of kinetic energy; the guiding rubbing body

reducing damage on the impact drive device;
[0124]      8. the rolling wheel is provided between the guiding rubbing body support and the
rolling impact guiding element in the device; the rolling wheel enables the rolling impact
guiding element to have rolling friction, thus reducing wear of the guiding device and
prolonging the service life, and realizing a low failure rate and less maintenance; the
reciprocating speed is high with high efficiency because of rolling friction; at the same time, the
rolling wheel is cleaner and more environment-friendly and harmful substances or poisonous

 body and the jacking part, the buffering element can be damaged to absorb the impact reactive
force and the buffering guiding part controls a buffering direction so that buffering is

                                               -39
reciprocating straight line buffering, thus preventing non-directional oscillating when the
buffering element absorbs the impact reactive force; the buffering method and structure

greatly reducing a large number of mining failures, improving the service life of the machine
body and improving the working efficiency;
[0132]     16. the buffering element has a rebounding force to increase the impact effect; when

force to impact a material in a reciprocating manner;

dynamic sliding resistance is small during a mining process and the impact head is protected
effectively; during an impact falling and impact vibration transmission process of the
reciprocating impact part, the device decomposes an                impact reactive force through

impact teeth, reducing consumption of easily-damaged parts of the device and improving
working efficiency;
