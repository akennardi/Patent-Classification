                    COMPOUNDS AND THEIR METHODS OF USE
                                   CLAIM OF PRIORITY
           This application claims priority from International Application No.
  PCT/CN2012/085023, filed November 22, 2012, and International Application No.
  PCT/CN2013/000294, filed March 15, 2013, each of which is incorporated herein by
  reference in its entirety.
                             BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
           Cancer cells rely primarily on glycolysis to generate cellular energy and
  biochemical intermediates for biosynthesis of lipids and nucleotides, while the
  majority of "normal" cells in adult tissues utilize aerobic respiration. This
  fundamental difference in cellular metabolism between cancer cells and normal cells
  is termed the Warburg Effect. As a result of this difference, pyruvate generated via
  the glycolytic pathway is converted to lactic acid, rather than being used to generate
  acetyl-CoA and eventually, the citrate utilized in a normal citric acid cycle. To
  compensate for these energetic changes and to maintain a citric acid cycle, cancer
  cells rely on glutamine metabolism which is achieved through an elevation of
  glutaminase activity. Exploitation of this phenomenon can be achieved by inhibition
  of this elevated glutaminase activity.
                                SUMMARY OF INVENTION
           Described herein are heterocyclic containing, pharmaceutically acceptable
  salts, solvates, and hydrates thereof. The compounds can be used to treat a disorder
  described herein, for example, by inhibiting glutaminase in a patient. Also provided
  are compositions (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions) comprising a compound
  provided herewith and the use of such compositions in methods of treating diseases
  and conditions, for example, that are associated with the aberrant function of
  glutaminase or elevated activity of glutaminase, including, e.g., cancer.
           In one embodiment, provided is a compound of formula (I) or a
  pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:

   Methods of Evaluating Compounds
           Glutaminase activity can be monitored by detecting production of either of the
   products of the reaction, glutamate or ammonia. In some embodiments, glutamate
   production is measured because ammonia is a product of any of a number of
   biological reactions.
           Glutamate production can be measured by any of a number of standard
   methods known in the art, e.g., chemical and chromatographic detection methods and
   coupled enzyme assays that utilize NADH and glutamate dehydrogenase.
   Extracellular glutamate concentrations can also be measured in vivo, using
   microdialysis methods known in the art. One suitable method for measuring glutamate
   is a microtiter-based two-step assay in which glutamate formed in the initial step is
   quantitatively deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase to yield an equivalent amount
   of NADH (Godfrey et al., 1977; Kvamme et al., 1985), which can then be detected
   spectrophotometrically.

  disorder or to delay onset of at least one symptom of the disorder).
            As used herein, an amount of a compound effective to treat a disorder, or a
  "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount of the compound which is
  effective, upon single or multiple dose administration to a subject, in treating a cell, or
  in curing, alleviating, relieving or improving a subject with a disorder beyond that
  expected in the absence of such treatment.
            As used herein, an amount of a compound effective to prevent a disorder, or a
  "a prophylactically effective amount" of the compound refers to an amount effective,
  upon single- or multiple-dose administration to the subject, in preventing or delaying
  the occurrence of the onset or recurrence of a disorder or a symptom of the disorder.
            The term "patient" and "subject" are synonymous, and as used herein, refer to
  an animal, typically a human (i.e., a male or female of any age group, e.g., a pediatric
  patient or adult patient or other mammal, such as primates (e.g., cynomolgus
  monkeys, rhesus monkeys); commercially relevant mammals such as cattle, pigs,

   horses, sheep, goats, cats, and/or dogs; and/or birds, including commercially relevant
   birds such as chickens, ducks, geese, and/or turkeys, that will be or has been the
   object of treatment, observation, and/or experiment. When the term is used in
   conjunction with administration of a compound or drug, then the patient has been the
   object of treatment, observation, and/or administration of the compound or drug.
   Cancers
           The methods described herein can be used with any cancer, for example those
   described by the National Cancer Institute. A cancer can be evaluated to determine
   whether it is using a method described herein. Exemplary cancers can include but are
   not limited to, lung cancer, e.g., non-small cell lung cancer; breast cancer, e.g., triple
   negative breast cancer; or hepatocellular carcninoma, osteosarcoma, lipomas,
   chondrosarcoma, or mesothelioma. In some embodiments, the cancer is selected from
   colon cancer, renal cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), melanoma, and
   multiple myeloma.
           The cancer can be a primary tumor, i.e., located at the anatomical site of tumor
   growth initiation. The cancer can also be metastatic, i.e., appearing at least a second
   anatomical site other than the anatomical site of tumor growth initiation. The cancer
   can be a recurrent cancer, i.e., cancer that returns following treatment, and after a
  period of time in which the cancer was undetectable. The recurrent cancer can be
   anatomically located locally to the original tumor, e.g., anatomically near the original
   tumor; regionally to the original tumor, e.g., in a lymph node located near the original
   tumor; or distantly to the original tumor, e.g., anatomically in a region remote from
  the original tumor.
  Cancer Combination therapies
           In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered together
  with one or more additional cancer treatments. Exemplary cancer treatments include,
  for example: chemotherapy, targeted therapies such as antibody therapies,
  immunotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Examples of each of these treatments are
  provided below.

WO 2014/079150                                                                 PCT/CN2013/001428
            Chemotherapy
            In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with one
   or more chemotherapies. Chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with drugs that can
   destroy cancer cells. "Chemotherapy" usually refers to cytotoxic drugs which affect
   rapidly dividing cells in general, in contrast with targeted therapy. Chemotherapy
   drugs interfere with cell division in various possible ways, e.g., with the duplication
   of DNA or the separation of newly formed chromosomes. Most forms of
   chemotherapy target all rapidly dividing cells and are not specific for cancer cells,
   although some degree of specificity may come from the inability of many cancer cells
   to repair DNA damage, while normal cells generally can.
           Examples of chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer therapy include, for
   example, antimetabolites (e.g., folic acid, purine, and pyrimidine derivatives) and
   alkylating agents (e.g., nitrogen mustards, nitrosoureas, platinum, alkyl sulfonates,
   hydrazines, triazenes, aziridines, spindle poison, cytotoxic agents, toposimerase
   inhibitors and others). Exemplary agents include Aclarubicin, Actinomycin,

            Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are
   often given at the same time. Often, two or more chemotherapy agents are used as
   combination chemotherapy. In some embodiments, the chemotherapy agents
   (including combination chemotherapy) can be used in combination with a compound
   described herein.
            Targeted therapy
            In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with one
   or more targeted therapies. Targeted therapy constitutes the use of agents specific for
   the deregulated proteins of cancer cells. Small molecule targeted therapy drugs are
   generally inhibitors of enzymatic domains on mutated, overexpressed, or otherwise
   critical proteins within the cancer cell. Prominent examples are the tyrosine kinase
   inhibitors such as Axitinib, Bosutinib, Cediranib, dasatinib, erlotinib, imatinib,
   gefitinib, lapatinib, Lestaurtinib, Nilotinib, Semaxanib, Sorafenib, Sunitinib, and
   Vandetanib, and also cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as Alvocidib and
   Seliciclib. Monoclonal antibody therapy is another strategy in which the therapeutic
   agent is an antibody which specifically binds to a protein on the surface of the cancer
   cells. Examples include the anti-HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN@)
   typically used in breast cancer, and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab and
   Tositumomab typically used in a variety of B-cell malignancies. Other exemplary
   anbibodies include Cetuximab, Panitumumab, Trastuzumab, Alemtuzumab,
   Bevacizumab, Edrecolomab, and Gemtuzumab. Exemplary fusion proteins include
   Aflibercept and Denileukin diftitox. In some embodiments, the targeted therapy can
   be used in combination with a compound described herein.

WO 2014/079150                                                                  PCT/CN2013/001428
            Exemplary additional therapeutic agents can also include epidermal growth
   factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, e.g., cetuximab, panitumumab, gefitinib, erlotinib,
   nimotuzamab, matuzamab, zalutumumab, or lapatinib. Resistance to EGFR inhibitors
   can occur as a result of the transition of a cell to a mesenchymal phenotype or a
   mesenchymal phenotype, and tumors with EGFR mutations and mesenchymal
   phenotype can be less sensitive to EGFR inhibitors (see for example, Sequist et al.,
   (2011) Sci Transl Med. 3:75. Buck et al., (2007) Mol Cancer Ther. 6: 532; Thomson
   et al., (2008) Clin Exp Metastasis 25: 843).
             Exemplary additional therapeutic agents can also include glutathione depleting
   agents, e.g., L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO).
            Exemplary additional therapeutic agents can also include Phosphoinositide 3
   kinase (P13K) inhibitors, e.g., Perifosine, Idelalisib, BKM120, PX-866, IPI-145,
   NVP-BEZ235, GDC0941, and BAY 80-6946.
            Exemplary additional therapeutic agents can also include Heat Shock Protein
   90 (HSP90) inhibitors, e.g., geldanamycin, radicicol, 17-N-Allylamino-17
   demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG). ganetespib, 4-(4-(2,3-Dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin
   6-yl)-5-methyl- IH-pyrazol-3-yl)-6-ethylresorcinol, AUY922 (NVP-AUY922),
   BIIB021, STA9090, AT13387, NVP-BEP800, and SNX-2112 (PF-04928473).
            Targeted therapy can also involve small peptides as "homing devices" which
   can bind to cell surface receptors or affected extracellular matrix surrounding the
   tumor. Radionuclides which are attached to these peptides (e.g., RGDs) eventually
   kill the cancer cell if the nuclide decays in the vicinity of the cell. An example of
   such therapy includes BEXXAR@.
            Immunotherapy
            In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with one
   or more immunotherapies. Cancer immunotherapy refers to a diverse set of
   therapeutic strategies designed to induce the patient's own immune system to fight the
   tumor. Contemporary methods for generating an immune response against tumors
   include intravesicular BCG immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer, and use of
   interferons and other cytokines to induce an immune response in renal cell carcinoma
   and melanoma patients.

WO 2014/079150                                                                    PCT/CN2013/001428
           Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be considered a form
   of immunotherapy, since the donor's immune cells will often attack the tumor in a
   graft-versus-tumor effect. In some embodiments, the immunotherapy agents can be
   used in combination with a compound described herein.
           Hormonal therapy
           In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with one
   or more hormonal therapies. The growth of some cancers can be inhibited by
   providing or blocking certain hormones. Common examples of hormone-sensitive
   tumors include certain types of breast and prostate cancers. Removing or blocking
   estrogen or testosterone is often an important additional treatment. In certain cancers,
   administration of hormone agonists, such as progestogens may be therapeutically
   beneficial. In some embodiments, the hormonal therapy agents can be used in
   combination with a compound described herein.
           Nutrient restricted diets
           In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered in
   conjunction with one or more nutrient restricted diets. Since cancer cells rely on
   glucose to generate cellular energy, lowering glucose blood levels through
   carbohydrate and protein restriction may inhibit the growth of some cancers. In
   certain cancers, nutrient restricted diets such as caloric restriction, fasting, and
   ketogenic diets may be therapeutically beneficial. In some embodiments, such
   nutrient restricted diets can be used in combination with a compound described
   herein.
   Neuronal Disorders
           A compound or composition described herein can be used to treat or prevent
   neuronal cell death as a result of an injury to neuronal tissue, e.g., nervous tissue
   exposed to an ischemic or hypoxic event, to trauma or to a chronic neurodegenerative
   disorder. A "neuronal disorder" is a neurological disease or disorder that is associated
   with glutamate excitotoxicity, e.g., cerebral ischemia or hypoxia resulting from an
   neurological event such as a stroke or ischemic event. Treatment with the compound

   surfactants used in pharmaceutical dosage forms such as Tweens or other similar
   polymeric delivery matrices, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer
   substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial
   glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such
   as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate,
   sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl
   pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium
   carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block
   polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat. Cyclodextrins such as X-, 0-, and y
   cyclodextrin, or chemically modified derivatives such as hydroxyalkylcyclodextrins,
   including 2- and 3-hydroxypropyl- -cyclodextrins, or other solubilized derivatives
   may also be advantageously used to enhance delivery of compounds of the formulae
   described herein.

           The pharmaceutical compositions provided herewith may be administered
   orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally,
   vaginally or via an implanted reservoir, preferably by oral administration or
   administration by injection. The pharmaceutical compositions provided herewith may
   contain any conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants or
   vehicles. In some cases, the pH of the formulation may be adjusted with
   pharmaceutically acceptable acids, bases or buffers to enhance the stability of the
   formulated compound or its delivery form. The term parenteral as used herein
   includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular,
   intraarterial, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial
   injection or infusion techniques.
            The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable
   preparation, for example, as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension.
   This suspension may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using
   suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and
   suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable
   solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for
   example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents
   that may be employed are mannitol, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium
   chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a
   solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be
   employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid
   and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural
   pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their
   polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a

   compound (w/w). Alternatively, such preparations contain from about 20% to about
   80% active compound.
           Lower or higher doses than those recited above may be required. Specific
   dosage and treatment regimens for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of
   factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body
   weight, general health status, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug
   combination, the severity and course of the disease, condition or symptoms, the
   patient's disposition to the disease, condition or symptoms, and the judgment of the
   treating physician.
            Upon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a
   compound, composition or combination provided herewith may be administered, if
   necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be
   reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is
   retained when the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level. Patients may,
   however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of
   disease symptoms.
   Patient selection and monitoring
            The compounds described herein can inhibit glutaminase. Accordingly, a
   patient and/or subject can be selected for treatment using a compound described

            The tissue, fluid or product can be removed from the patient and analyzed.
   The evaluation can include one or more of: performing the analysis of the tissue, fluid
   or product; requesting analysis of the tissue fluid or product; requesting results from
   analysis of the tissue, fluid or product; or receiving the results from analysis of the
   tissue, fluid or product.
            The sample tissue, fluid, or product can be analyzed for the expression level of
   a gene described herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase. The sample
   tissue, fluid, or product can be analyzed for the expression level of a protein described
   herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase. The sample tissue, fluid or
   product can further be analyzed for the level of gene expression of a gene or plurality
   of genes of a preselected signaling pathway or phenotypic pathway, e.g., the epithelial
   to mesenchymal transition pathway, E-cadherin pathway, vimentin pathway, or the
   pyruvate carboxylase pathway. The sample tissue, fluid or product can further be
   analyzed for the level of protein expression of a protein or plurality of proteins of a
   preselected signaling pathway or phenotypic pathway, e.g., the epithelial to
   mesenchymal transition pathway, E-cadherin pathway, vimentin pathway, or the

            Methods of evaluating samples
            The expression level of a gene described herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin,
   and pyruvate carboxylase, can be assessed using any of a wide variety of well known
   methods for detecting expression of a transcribed molecule, gene, protein, mRNA,
   genomic DNA, or cDNA. Gene expression can be measured or monitored by measure
   of a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA, by a measure of the quantity of a translated protein,
   or by a measure of gene product activity; any of which can be measured using
   standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. Non-limiting examples of such
   methods include nucleic acid hybridization methods, nucleic acid reverse transcription
   methods, nucleic acid amplification methods, immunological methods for detection of
   proteins, protein purification methods, protein function or activity assays.
            E-cadherin
            The E-cadherin gene is located on human chromosome 16. E-cadherin is a
   classical cadherin of the cadherin superfamily. The encoded E-cadherin protein is a
                                            87

WO 2014/079150                                                                  PCT/CN2013/001428
   calcium dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein comprised of five extracellular
   cadherin repeats, a transmembrane region and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail.
   Mutations in this gene have been correlated with cancer, including gastric, breast,
   colorectal, thyroid and ovarian cancers. Loss of function of E-cadherin is
   contemplated to contribute to cancer progression by increasing proliferation, invasion,
   and/or metastasis. The ectodomain of this protein mediates bacterial adhesion to
   mammalian cells and the cytoplasmic domain is required for internalization. Identified
   E-cadherin transcript variants arise from mutation at consensus splice sites.
            Vimentin
           The vimentin gene is located on human chromosome 10 and encodes a
   member of the intermediate filament family of proteins. Intermediate filaments, along
   with microtubules and actin microfilaments, make up the cellular cytoskeleton, which
   helps maintain cell shape and integrity of the cytoplasm, as well as stabilizing
   cytoskeletal interactions. Vimentin also functions in mediating immune responses,
   control of the transport of low-density lipoprotein derived cholesterol from lysosomes
   to the sites of esterification, and as an organizer of a number of critical proteins
   involved in attachment, migration, and cell signaling.
           Pyruvate Carboxylase (PC)
           The PC gene is located on human chromosomes 11 and encodes the protein
   pyruvate carboxylase, which catalyzes the carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate.
   The active enzyme is a homotetramer arranged in a tetrahedron which is located
   exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix. Pyruvate carboxylase is involved in multiple
   cellular processes including gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, insulin secretion and
   synthesis of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Mutations in this gene have been
   associated with pyruvate carboxylase deficiency. Alternatively spliced transcript
   variants with different 5' UTRs, but encoding the same protein, have been identified.
           Nucleic Acid Molecules
           The methods described herein can pertain to the evaluation of a sample for the
   expression of a gene described herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate
   carboxylase; based on isolated nucleic acids which correspond to the gene described
   herein, e.g., the mRNA level of E-cadherin; the mRNA level of vimentin; the mRNA

    level of pyruvate carboxylase. As used herein, the term "nucleic acid" or "nucleic acid
    molecule" is intended to include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) and
    RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using
    nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double
    stranded.
            An "isolated" nucleic acid molecule is one which is separated from other
    nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid
    molecule. An "isolated" nucleic acid molecule can be free of sequences (such as
   protein-encoding sequences) which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences
    located at the 5' and 3' ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism
    from which the nucleic acid is derived. An "isolated" nucleic acid molecule, such
    mRNA, can be substantially free of other cellular material cellular material or other
   contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the nucleic acid is
   derived,
            A nucleic acid molecule described herein can be isolated using standard
   molecular biology techniques and the sequence information available in database
   records known to those of skill in the art. Using all or a portion of such nucleic acid
    sequences, nucleic acid molecules described herein can be isolated using standard
   hybridization and cloning techniques (e.g., as described in Sambrook et al., ed.,
   Molecular Cloning: A LaboratoryManual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
   Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989).
           A nucleic acid molecule described herein can be amplified using cDNA,
   mRNA, or genomic DNA as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers
   according to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid molecules so
   amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA
   sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to all or a portion of
   a nucleic acid molecule can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques, e.g., using
   an automated DNA synthesizer.
           An isolated nucleic acid molecule can comprise a nucleic acid molecule which
   has a nucleotide sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid
   corresponding to gene described herein, or to the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic

    acid encoding a protein which corresponds to the gene described herein. A nucleic
    acid molecule which is complementary to a given nucleotide sequence is one which is
    sufficiently complementary to the given nucleotide sequence that it can hybridize to
    the given nucleotide sequence thereby forming a stable duplex.
            A nucleic acid molecule described herein can comprise only a portion of a
    nucleic acid sequence. Such nucleic acid molecules can be used, for example, as a
    probe or primer. The probe/primer can be one or more substantially purified
    oligonucleotides. Probes based on the sequence of a nucleic acid molecules described
    herein can be used to detect transcripts or genomic sequences corresponding to the
    genes described herein. The probe can contain comprise a label group, e.g., a
    radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. Such
    probes can be used as part of a diagnostic test kit for identifying cells or tissues which
    express the protein, such as by measuring levels of a nucleic acid molecule encoding
    the protein in a sample of cells from a patient, e.g., detecting mRNA levels.
            Methods for Detection of Gene Expression
            Methods of detecting and/or quantifying a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA or
    cDNA made therefrom, can include but are not limited to Southern Blot analysis,
    Northern Blot analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses and probe arrays.
    Methods of detecting and/or quantifying a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA or cDNA
    made therefrom, can include but are not limited to hybridization based methods, e.g.,
    hybridization with a probe that is specific for the gene transcript, e.g., mRNA or
   cDNA made therefrom. The level of a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA or cDNA made
    therefrom, can be assayed by applying the sample, or the mRNA or cDNA made
    therefrom, or amplified from; to a nucleic acid microarray, or chip array.
            The level of a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA or cDNA made therefrom, can be
   assayed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method, e.g., quantitative PCR,
   quantitative real time PCR, real time PCR, reverse transcription PCR, real time
   reverse transcription PCR. The level of a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA or cDNA made
   therefrom, can be assayed by a sequencing based method, e.g., quantitative RNA

            The level of a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA, can be determined by in situ or by
    in vitro methods known in the art. For in vitro methods, any RNA isolation technique
   that does not select against the isolation of mRNA can be utilized for the purification
   of RNA from a sample, e.g., from cells of a sample (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., ed.,
   Current Protocolsin Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New York 1987-1999).
   Additionally, large numbers of tissue samples can readily be processed using
   techniques well known to those of skill in the art, such as, for example, the single-step
   RNA isolation process of Chomczynski (1989, U.S. Patent No. 4,843,155). For in situ
   methods, mRNA does not need to be isolated from the cells prior to detection. In
   such methods, a cell or tissue sample can be prepared/processed using known
   histological methods. The sample can then be immobilized on a support, and then
   contacted with a probe that can hybridize to mRNA that encodes the gene transcript of
   interest.
            Determinations can be based on absolute expression level; normalized
   expression level, or relative expression level; of a gene transcript, e.g., mRNA.
   Expression levels can be normalized by correcting the absolute expression level of a
   gene transcript by comparing its expression level to the expression level of another
   gene which is stably expressed, e.g., a housekeeping gene that is constitutively
   expressed. Suitable genes for normalization include housekeeping genes such as
   histone H3 gene or the actin gene. This normalization allows the comparison of the
   expression level in one sample to another sample, e.g., a first sample taken from a
  patient to a second sample taken from the same patient, e.g., from another tissue or at
   a different time point; or between samples from different sources, e.g., a patient
   sample from one patient to a patient sample from another patient.
            The expression level can be provided as a relative expression level. The
  relative expression level can be determined by comparing the absolute level of
  expression of the gene transcript, e.g., mRNA, to a reference standard. The reference
  standard can include the level of expression of the gene transcript of interest in a
  genotypically or phenotypically defined sample. The reference standard can be the
  level of expression of the gene transcript of interest, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin,
  pyruvate carboxylase, in a cell genotypically or phenotypically characterized as an

            The expression level of a gene transcript described herein, e.g., E-cadherin,
   vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase, can be measured at least at two time-points to
    determine if a change in the level of expression has occurred. For example, the level
   of expression can be measured pre- and post-treatment with a compound described
   herein, or at one or more time-points while treatment with a compound described
   herein is ongoing. If the expression level is found to be decreased, e.g., decreased
   expression of E-cadherin compared to a reference standard and/or increased
   expression of vimentin compared to a reference standard; the subject may be
   administered treatment with a compound described herein. The reference standard
   can be the level of expression of the gene transcript of interest in an epithelial cell
   characterized. An epithelial cell can be characterized by methods known in the art,

   expression of a gene described herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate
   carboxylase; based on isolated proteins which correspond to the gene described
   herein, e.g., the protein level of E-cadherin; the protein level of vimentin; the protein
   level of pyruvate carboxylase. This can also include the evaluation of biologically

   corresponding to the protein of interest can be isolated from the sample by an
   appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques known
   to those of skill in the art.
            An "isolated" or "purified" protein or biologically active portion thereof is
   substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or
   tissue source from which the protein is derived. The language "substantially free of

    portions of a polypeptide can include polypeptides comprising amino acid sequences
    sufficiently identical to or derived from the amino acid sequence of the protein, which
    include fewer amino acids than the full length protein, and exhibit at least one activity
    of the corresponding full-length protein. Typically, biologically active portions
    comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the corresponding protein.
            Methods for Detection of ProteinExpression
            The level of expression of a protein or polypeptide can be detected and
   quantified by any of a number of means well known to those of skill in the art.
   Methods of detecting and/or quantifying a protein or polypeptide described herein,
   e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase; can include but are not limited to
   biochemical methods such as electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC),

   assays (ELISAs), immunofluorescent assays, Western blotting,
   immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, fluorescence-activated cell sorting
   (FACS) and the like. A skilled artisan can readily adapt known protein/antibody
   detection methods for use in determining whether cells express the protein or
   polypeptide described herein.
            A protein or polypeptide can be detected using an immunoassay. As used
   herein, immunoassays include assays that utilize an antibody to specifically bind to a
   protein or polypeptide. An immunoassay can be characterized by the detection of
   specific binding of a protein or polypeptide to an antibody as opposed to the use of
   other physical or chemical properties to isolate, target, and quantify the polypeptide.
   The polypeptide can be detected and/or quantified using any of a number of well

    carboxylase, can be used to detect the protein or polypeptide. Antibodies can be
    polyclonal or monoclonal. An intact antibody, or a fragment thereof, e.g., Fab or
    F(ab') 2 can be used. The term "labeled", with regard to the probe or antibody, is
    intended to encompass direct labeling of the probe or antibody by coupling, i.e.,
    physically linking a detectable substance to the probe or antibody, as well as indirect
    labeling of the probe or antibody by reactivity with another reagent that is directly
    labeled. Examples of indirect labeling include detection of a primary antibody using a
    fluorescently labeled secondary antibody and end-labeling of a DNA probe with
   biotin such that it can be detected with fluorescently labeled streptavidin. The
    antibody can also be labeled, e.g., a radio-labeled, chromophore-labeled, fluorophore
   labeled, or enzyme-labeled antibody. An antibody derivative, e.g., an antibody
   conjugated with a substrate or with the protein or ligand of a protein-ligand pair, e.g.,
   biotin-streptavidin, or an antibody fragment, e.g., a single-chain antibody, an isolated
   antibody hypervariable domain, etc, which binds specifically with a protein described
   herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase, such as the protein encoded
   by the open reading frame corresponding to the gene transcript of a protein or
   polypeptide described herein, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase, or
   such a protein or polypeptide which has undergone all or a portion of its normal post
   translational modification, is used.
             Proteins from cells can be isolated using techniques that are well known to
   those of skill in the art. The protein isolation methods employed can, for example, be
   such as those described in Harlow and Lane (Harlow and Lane, 1988, Antibodies: A
   Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New
   York).
             The expression level can be provided as a relative expression level. The
   relative expression level can be determined by comparing the absolute level of

    expression of the protein, to a reference standard. The reference standard can include
    the level of expression of the protein of interest in a genotypically or phenotypically
    defined sample. The reference standard can be the level of expression of the protein of
    interest, e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase, in a cell genotypically or
    phenotypically characterized as an epithelial cell. An epithelial cell can be
    characterized by methods known in the art, e.g., as described in on any one of the
    following references: (Yauch et al., (2005) Clin Cancer Res 11:24; Savagner et al.,

             The expression level of a protein or polypeptide described herein, e.g., E
   cadherin, vimentin, pyruvate carboxylase, can be measured at least at two time-points
    to determine if a change in the level of expression has occurred. For example, the
   level of expression can be measured pre- and post-treatment with a compound
   described herein, or at one or more time-points while treatment with a compound
   described herein is ongoing. If the expression level is found to be decreased, e.g.,
   decreased expression of E-cadherin compared to a reference standard and/or increased
   expression of vimentin compared to a reference standard; the subject may be
   administered treatment with a compound described herein.

    Example A
             In this example, the enzymatic activity of glutaminase is measured through a
    coupled endpoint assay. Glutamine and phosphate are supplied to GAC at a
    concentration equal to Km and AC5o, respectively, and GAC concentration is adjusted
    to give a linear reaction for 60 minutes. The glutamate produced is converted to 2
    OG by a kinetic excess of glutamate dehydrogenase. This second step is configured
    for 2X Km for NAD, since excess NAD is inhibitory. However, a kinetic excess of
    the third coupling enzyme, diaphorase, recycles NAD from NADH to keep the NAD
    concentration constant during the timecourse of the assay. Diaphorase, also supplied
    in kinetic excess, oxidizes NADH produced by GDH back to NAD with the
    concomitant reduction of rezasurin to the highly fluorescent resorufin. Resorufin in
    measured after the assay is stopped with SDS by Ex544/Em590. A reduction in the
    signal indicates inhibition of some component of the coupled enzyme system.
    Prospective hits are counterscreened against GDH/diaphorase alone to remove hits to
    the coupling enzyme system in a second assay.

           Compound 1-4 was prepared by following a reported procedure (Tetrahedron
   Lett. 1997, 53, 10459). trans-1,2-bis(bromomethyl)cyclopropane 1-3 (1 equivalent)
   was dissolved in a mixture of EtOH/water (2/1). Following the addition of NaCN (4
   equivalents) the reaction mixture was refluxed overnight. All the volatile materials
   were evaporated to obtain a pasty mass which was dissolved in water and extracted
   with ether. The aqueous layer was further extracted with ether and the combined
   organic layers were evaporated to obtain the title compound 1-4. This material was
   used for the next step without any purification.
