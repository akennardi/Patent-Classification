                                      ABSTRACT
An abalone diving knife which has a built-in gauge to measure the minimum legal
abalone catch size. The gauge is cut out of the blade of the knife so that any abalone
whose shell fits inside the gap is an illegal catch. The knife is customised for each of
the different state regulations in Australia and New Zealand. The knife is made from
stainless steel with a rubber handle. The knife's aim is to streamline the measuring and
fishing process. This will help to prevent removing undersized abalone from a reef.
