                            STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY
                        SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT
   100021       This invention was made with government support under Contract No.
   W91 IQY-I5-C-0099 awarded by U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency. The government
15 has certain rights in the invention.
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [00031       The present invention pertains generally to vascular occlusion catheters and
   methods of vascular pre-conditioning while controlling occlusion and perfusion during an
   occlusion procedure. Pre-conditioning is employed to mitigate ischemia before, during
20 and/or after a vascular occlusion procedure, as well as used to reduce or ameliorate the
   onset of hypertension during or reduce or ameliorate the onset of hypotension after a
   vascular occlusion procedure. Vascular occlusions may be indicated in either the venous
   system and/or the arterial system, Endoarterial occlusion is a procedure in which a blood
   vessel is at least partially occluded in order to restrict blood flow upstream or downstream
25 of the occlusion site for purposes of a vascular procedure or repair, It is known that
   transient hypertension is a risk factor in arterial occlusion, particularly aortic occlusion.
   Transient hypertension occurs when the blood pressure upstream of the occlusion site rises
   to a potentially unsafe level during the time duration of the occlusion. Upon completion of
   a procedure requiring arterial occlusion, particularly aortic occlusion, care must be taken

   during the process of reestablishing blood flow to reduce or ameliorate the onset of
   hypotension. Thus, arterial occlusion carries with it two twin risks, hypertension during the
   occlusion and hypotension as the occlusion is withdrawn and blood flow restored that must
   be managed.
 5 [00041       In addition to hypotension and hypertension, techniques allowing partial flow of
   blood and related fluids past the occlusion member may be desirable to provide at least
   partial blood flow to portions of the patient's body downstream of the occlusion member.
   At least partial perfusion past the occlusion member can provide the benefits of focusing or
   directing a majority of blood flow to the brain, heart and lungs or other upstream portions of
10 the patient, but also potentially increasing the amount of time the occlusion member can be
   implanted in the patient, by providing at least partial blood flow to the patient's organs
   downstream of the occlusion member, such as to the patient's liver, digestive tract, kidneys
   and legs.
   [0005]       Referring to Fig. A, partial perfusion may be accomplished by reducing the size
15 of an occlusion member or occlusion balloon I that is attached to a catheter 2. The
   occlusion balloon I may, for example, be partially deflated to allow blood to flow between
   outer surfaces l a of the occlusion balloon 1 and inner surfaces 3a of a vessel 3 within which
   the occlusion balloon I is positioned. This, for example, deflation of the occlusion balloon
   I may cause the occlusion balloon I to lose contact with the inner surface 3a of the vessel 3,
20 thereby causing movement of the occlusion balloon I and partial vibration between the
   vessel 3 and the occlusion balloon 1 that is undesirable, Such loss of contact with the inner
   surfaces 3a of the vessel 3 by the occlusion balloon 1 is represented in Fig. A, by a
   cylindrical channel 4 defined between the outer surface Ia of the occlusion balloon I and
   the inner surfaces 3a of the vessel 3. Loss of contact with the inner surface 3a of the vessel
25 3 by the occlusion balloon I may also result in the occlusion balloon I and attached catheter
   2 being urged downstream in the vessel 3, thereby moving the occlusion balloon I out of its
   preferred placement. It would be desirable to design, develop and implement an occlusion
   balloon catheter that maintains contact with the vessel during partial perfusion to reduce or
   eliminate such vibrations and movement of the occlusion member during partial perfusion.
30 100061       Temporary aortic occlusion as an operative method to increase proximal or
   central perfusion to the heart and brain in the setting of shock due to major trauma is
   generally known. Despite potential advantages over thoracotomy with aortic clamping,
   resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta ("REBOA") for trauma has not
   been widely adopted.
                                                     2

    [00071      Many attempts have been made at developing technologies to control non
    compressible abdominal hemorrhage. For example, non-occlusive, abdominal tamponade
    procedures have been developed to address the problem of non-compressible hemorrhage,
    such as introducing an expandable, biocompatible foam into the abdominal cavity to apply
 5  pressure to the abdominal organs and vasculature. Pharmacological efforts have also been
   developed to address the problem of non-compressible hemorrhage. Conventional REBOA
   procedures are typically performed in an operating room and with the aid of fluoroscopy or
   other imaging.
    [00081      Devices that automate inflation and deflation of a balloon are generally known.
10 Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation catheters for blood pressure augmentation coordinated
   with electrocardiography signals are also known, Over-inflation safety devices are also
   known, such as a pressure-relief valve coupled to an inflation lumen that opens when
   pressure within the inflation lumen exceeds a threshold pressure, but relative pressure
   within the occlusion balloon is necessary to maintain occlusion of the blood vessel,
15  [0009]      It would be desirable to design, develop and implement a system that
   intermittently and automatically releases an occlusion balloon or member by releasing
   apposition of the occlusion balloon or member against the vascular wall and allowing
   perfusion past the occlusion balloon or member in response to a physiological parameter,
   then re-establishing occlusion in response to potential changes in the physiological
20 parameter, either during a vascular repair procedure to control hypertension or post-repair
   procedure to control hypotension. It would also be desirable to design, develop and
   implement a system that allows perfusion past the occlusion balloon or member while
   maintaining engagement between the occlusion balloon or member and the walls of the
   vasculature, preferably an artery and more preferably the aorta, to prevent vibration,
25 movement, sliding or shifting of the occlusion balloon or member as blood flows past the
   occlusion balloon. In addition, it is desirable to design, develop and implement an
   occlusion balloon that permits relatively fine control of a pressure ratio between proximal
   and distal sides of the occlusion balloon and, therefore, relatively fine control of blood flow
   across the occlusion balloon through the vessel. The preferred embodiments of the present
30 invention addresses certain of these limitations of the prior art occlusion systems.
   [0010]       In addition, it is desirable to design, develop and implement an occlusion balloon
   that permits relatively fine control of a pressure ratio between proximal and distal sides of
   the occlusion balloon and, therefore, relatively fine control of blood flow across the
   occlusion balloon through the vessel. Existing occlusion balloons are difficult to modulate
                                                     3

   pressure drop across the balloon, A relatively small change in balloon volume or internal
   pressure often results in drastic changes in blood pressure between proximal and distal sides
   of the occlusion balloon, resulting in full occlusion or a relatively high rate of volumetric
   blood flow across the balloon. It is desirable to design, develop and deploy an occlusion
 5 system that is less sensitive to slight pressure changes in the occlusion balloon and provides
   a more gradual change in blood flow past the occlusion balloon. The preferred present
   invention addresses these shortcomings of prior art occlusion balloons.
                             BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   100111      An occlusion catheter system for occlusion or partial occlusion of a relatively
10 large vessel includes an inflation catheter member, an occlusion balloon and an inflatable
   spine. The inflation catheter member includes a stiffener member, a first inflation lumen
   and a second inflation lumen. The inflation catheter member has a proximal catheter end
   and a distal catheter end and defines a longitudinal axis. The occlusion balloon has an
   internal balloon space, an external balloon surface, a proximal balloon end and a distal
15 balloon end, The proximal and distal balloon ends are connected to the inflation catheter.
   The first inflation lumen is in fluid communication with the internal balloon space. The
   inflatable spine has an internal spine space, an external spine surface, a proximal spine end
   and a distal spine end. The proximal and distal spine ends are connected to the inflation
   catheter. The second inflation lumen is in fluid communication with the internal spine
20 space, A portion of the external balloon surface contacts the external spine surface when
   the occlusion balloon and the inflatable spine are in an inflated configuration. The proximal
   spine end is connected to the inflation catheter near the proximal balloon end and the distal
   spine end is connected to the inflation catheter near the distal balloon end.
   100121      The preferred occlusion catheter system is intended to give the user or medial
25 professional a means of full occlusion, as well as a smooth-controlled partial occlusion.
   Current technology is limited in terms of partial occlusion because as the user withdraws
   fluid from the balloon to move from full occlusion to partial occlusion there is a sudden
   increase in blood flow across the balloon. The preferred embodiments of the occlusion
   catheter system mitigate this sudden change by creating flow paths of blood flow channels
30 for the blood allowing the user or medical professional to more precisely control the flow by
   hand with a syringe, such as by controlling the inflation volume of the occlusion balloon.
   Current technology utilizing a single occlusion balloon with a smooth, continuous shape can
   become unstable, vibrate and pulse during partial occlusion because of minimal contact
                                                    4

   between the vessel wall and the external surfaces of the balloon. The preferred occlusion
   catheter systems provide constant contact of the balloon to the vessel wall during partial
   occlusion, thereby deescalating the vibrating and pulsing effects of conventional occlusion
   balloons and systems.
 5 [0013]       In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to an occlusion
   catheter system for occlusion or partial occlusion of a relatively large vessel having an
   internal surface. The occlusion catheter system includes an inflation catheter member
   having a stiffener member, an occlusion balloon, a distal pressure sensor, and an inflatable
   spine, The inflation catheter member also includes a first inflation lumen, a proximal
10 catheter end and a distal catheter end. The inflation catheter member defines a longitudinal
   axis and the inflation catheter member has an atraumatic tip on the distal catheter end. The
   occlusion balloon has an internal balloon space, an external balloon surface, a proximal
   balloon end and a distal balloon end. The proximal and distal balloon ends are connected to
   the inflation catheter between the proximal catheter end and the distal catheter end. The
15 occlusion balloon is substantially centered along the longitudinal axis in an inflated
   configuration. The first inflation lumen is in fluid communication with the internal balloon
   space. The distal pressure sensor is attached to the inflation catheter member between the
   proximal balloon end and the atraumatic tip. The inflatable spine has an internal spine
   space, an external spine surface, a proximal spine end and a distal spine end. The proximal
20 and distal spine ends are connected to the inflation catheter, A portion of the external
   balloon surface contacts the external spine surface when the occlusion balloon and the
   inflatable spine are in an inflated configuration. The proximal spine end is connected to the
   inflation catheter near the proximal balloon end and the distal spine end is connected to the
   inflation catheter near the distal balloon end, The occlusion balloon and the inflatable spine
25 are configured to define blood flow channels with the internal surface and the external
   balloon surface when the occlusion catheter system is at least partially positioned in the
   vessel and the occlusion balloon and the inflatable spine are in a partially inflated
   configuration.
   [0014]       In another aspect, the preferred invention is directed to an occlusion catheter
30 system for occlusion or partial occlusion of a relatively large vessel having an internal
   surface. The occlusion catheter system includes an inflation catheter member having a
   stiffener member, an occlusion balloon, a distal pressure sensor and an inflatable spine. The
   inflation catheter member also includes a first inflation lumen, a second inflation lumen, a
   proximal catheter end and a distal catheter end. The inflation catheter member defines a
                                                   5

   longitudinal axis and has an atraumatic tip on the distal catheter end. The occlusion balloon
   has an internal balloon space, an external balloon surface, a proximal balloon end and a
   distal balloon end. The proximal and distal balloon ends are connected to the inflation
   catheter between the proximal catheter end and the distal catheter end. The occlusion
 5 balloon is substantially centered along the longitudinal axis in an inflated configuration.
   The first inflation lumen is in fluid communication with the internal balloon space. The
   distal pressure sensor is attached to the inflation catheter member between the proximal
   balloon end and the atraumatic tip. The inflatable spine has an internal spine space, an
   external spine surface, a proximal spine end and a distal spine end. The proximal and distal
10 spine ends are connected to the inflation catheter. The internal spine space us in fluid
   communication with the second inflation lumen, A portion of the external balloon surface
   contacts the external spine surface when the occlusion balloon and the inflatable spine are in
   an inflated configuration. The proximal spine end is connected to the inflation catheter near
   the proximal balloon end and the distal spine end is connected to the inflation catheter near
15 the distal balloon end.
   100151      In a further aspect, the preferred invention is directed to a rapid catheter
   securement device for securing a substantially cylindrical catheter to a patient. The
   securement device includes a base member having a skin facing surface and an engagement
   mechanism. The engagement mechanism is configured to movably engage the catheter. A
20 needle housing has an arcuate housing slot, a base boss and a substantially flat lower side,
   The base boss is positioned proximate the lower side. An arcuate needle has a tip and a
   needle base end. The needle is movably mounted to the needle housing and is movable
   along the arcuate housing slot. The needle tip is positioned within the needle housing along
   the housing slot in an initial position and at least a portion of the needle is positioned
25 outside the needle housing in a secured position proximate the lower side.

   one having ordinary skill in the art. At a minimum, such references that include a numerical
                                                    12

   parameter would include variations that, using mathematical and industrial principles
   accepted in the art (e.g., rounding, measurement or other systematic errors, manufacturing
   tolerances, etc.), would not vary the least significant digit.
   [00861       Referring to Figs. 1-6, in a first preferred embodiment, an occlusion catheter
 5 system 10 has similarities in function to the system and method for low-profile occlusion
   balloon catheter described in International Patent Application No. PCT/JS 16/23223, titled,
   "System and Method for Low-Profile Occlusion Balloon Catheter," filed March 18, 2016,
   the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The first
   preferred occlusion catheter system 10 is configured to occlude or partially occlude a
10 relatively large vessel, such as the aorta, but is not so limited and may occlude or partially
   occlude other vessels VW. The occlusion catheter system of the first preferred embodiment
   includes an inflation catheter member 12 having a stiffener member or hypotube         12a, a first
   inflation lumen 13a and a second inflation lumen 13b. The inflation catheter member or
   catheter 12 has a proximal catheter end 12b and a distal catheter end 12c and the catheter
15 member 12 defines a longitudinal axis 131. The inflation catheter member 12 is relatively
   flexible along its length for traversing the non-linear path of vessels, but the longitudinal
   axis 131 is defined when the inflation catheter member 12 is in a relaxed or relatively
   straight configuration (Fig. I C),
    [00871      An occlusion balloon 140 is attached to the inflation catheter member 12 and has
20 an internal balloon space 140a, an external balloon surface 140b, a proximal balloon end
    140c and a distal balloon end 140d. The proximal and distal balloon ends 140c, 140d are
   connected to the inflation catheter 12, preferably by bonding or co-molding the inflation
   catheter 12 with the occlusion balloon 140. The first inflation lumen 13a is in fluid
   communication with the internal balloon space 140a, such that fluid may be delivered to and
25  from the internal balloon space 140a through the first inflation lumen 13a to inflate and
   deflate the occlusion balloon 140.
    [0088]      In operation, the occlusion catheter system 10 is preferably inserted into a patient
   with the occlusion balloon 140 in a deflated or uninflated configuration (not shown) to limit
    the profile of the portion of the occlusion catheter system 10 that is inserted into the
30  patient's body. The spine 20 and occlusion balloon 140 are preferably wrapped around the
    stiffener member 12a in the uninflated configuration. The occlusion balloon 140 is inflated
    to an inflated configuration (Figs. I and 3) to occlude or partially occlude the vessel VW.
    The occlusion balloon 140 is preferably constructed of a biocompatible, relatively flexible
    and compliant polymeric material that is configured for engagement or co-molding with the
                                                      13

   inflation catheter member 12. The occlusion balloon 140 is not so limited and may be
   constructed of nearly any biocompatible material that is able to take on the general size and
   shape of the occlusion balloon 140, move between the deflated and inflated configurations
   upon receipt or withdraw of fluid or gas through the first inflation lumen 13a, perform the
 5 preferred functions of the occlusion balloon 140 and withstand the normal operating
   conditions of the occlusion catheter system 10. The preferred occlusion balloon 140 is also
   transparent or semi-transparent, such that the user can observe fluid within the occlusion
   balloon 140 and the stiffener member or hypotube 12a is visible through the occlusion
   balloon 140 (Figs.   1, 1C and 1D). The occlusion balloon 140 is not limited to being
10 transparent or semi-transparent and may be opaque or otherwise constructed, as long as the
   occlusion balloon 140 is able to performed the preferred functions, take on the general size
   and shape of the occlusion balloon 140 and withstand the normal operating conditions of the
   occlusion balloon 140.
   [0089]       The first preferred occlusion catheter system 10 also includes an inflatable spine
15 20 having an internal spine space 20a, an external spine surface 20b, a proximal spine end
   20c and a distal spine end 20d. The proximal and distal spine ends 20c, 20d are connected
   to the inflation catheter 12 and the internal spine space 20a is in fluid communication with
   the second inflation lumen 13b. A user or medical professional is able to inflate the
   inflatable spine 20 by introducing fluid into the internal spine space 20a through the second
20 inflation lumen 13b and deflate the inflatable spine 20 by removing fluid from the internal
   spine space 20a through the second inflation lumen 13b. In the first preferred embodiment,
   the inflatable spine 20 is constructed of a non-compliant polymeric material that is
   biocompatible, relatively flexible, and configured for attachment to the inflation catheter 12.
   The inflatable spine 20 is preferably constructed of a biocompatible polymeric material or
25 other biocompatible non-compliant material that is able to take on the general size and
   shape of the inflatable spine 20 and withstand the ordinary operating conditions of the
   inflatable spine 20. The inflatable spine 20 is not limited to such constructions and may be
   constructed of nearly any biocompatible material that is able to take on the size and shape of
   the preferred inflatable spine 20, move between the inflated and deflated configurations
30 upon receipt or withdraw of fluid or gas through the second inflation lumen 13b, perform
   the preferred functions of the inflatable spine 20 and withstand the normal operating
   conditions of the inflatable spine 20. The inflatable spine 20 may be constructed of the
   same polymeric material as the occlusion balloon 140, but is not so limited and may be
   constructed of a different material that is able to withstand the normal operating conditions
                                                   14

   of the spine 20 and perform the functions of the spine 20 described herein. In the preferred
   embodiment, the occlusion balloon 140 is constructed of a relatively compliant,
   biocompatible polymeric material and the spine 20 is constructed of a non-compliant,
   biocompatible polymeric material, The occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20 may both be
 5 constructed of a polyurethane material. In the preferred embodiment, the polyurethane
   materials of the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20 have different durometers with the
   second polyurethane material of the spine 20 having a second durometer and the first
   polyurethane material of the occlusion balloon 140 having a first durometer. The second
   durometer of the spine 20 is preferably greater than the first durometer of the occlusion
10 balloon 140.
   [00901       During use, the preferred system 10 is preferably operated or pressurized with a
   fluid, such as a saline solution or other biocompatible fluid that is able to pressurize the
   occlusion balloon 140 and balloon spine 20. The fluid may be impregnated with a
   radiopaque additive, such as barium sulfate, to facilitate detection and location of the
15 occlusion balloon 140 and balloon spine 20 when inserted into the patient. The radiopaque
   fluid in the occlusion balloon 140 and spine 20 may be visible with radiographic imaging,
   such as X-ray or fluoroscopy, to determine the location of the occlusion balloon 140 and
   spine 20 in the patient to confirm proper location or to direct positioning of the occlusion
   balloon 140 and the spine 20. The fluid is not limited to having radiopaque material mixed
20 therein and may be comprised of a non-radiopaque material without significantly impacting
   the function of the preferred system 10. The occlusion balloon 140 and the balloon spine 20
   may also be impregnated with a radiopaque material for visualization, particularly when
   utilized with a fluid that does not include radiopaque materials or in regulatory situations
   where radiopaque fluids are not preferred.
25 [00911       Referring to Fig. IA-1 C and 4, the inflation catheter 12 is preferably connected
   to an inflation hub 590 at its proximal end I2b. The inflation hub 590 of the alternative first
   preferred embodiment includes a first port or inflation connection port 590a, a second port
   or pressure sensing port 590b and a third port or spine inflation port 590c, The first port
   590a is in fluid communication with the first inflation lumen 13a and the internal balloon
30 space 140a, The second port 590b is in fluid communication with a hypotube lumen 15 of
   the stiffener member or the hypotube 12a and a distal side port 170 (Fig. IC) near the distal
   balloon end 140d. The distal side port 170 is not limited to being positioned in the location
   shown in Fig. IC and may be placed at nearly any location on or along the catheter 12,
   preferably distally relative to the occlusion balloon 140, including at or near the end of the
                                                   15

   inflation catheter 12 and proximate or on an atraumatic tip 450 or distal catheter end 12c. In
   addition the distal side port 170 is not limited to being comprised of a port or hole that
   opens from the catheter 12 for sensing pressure and may be replaced by a pressure sensor,
   such as an electronic pressure sensor. The distal side port or distal pressure sensor 170 may
 5 further be replaced or supplemented by a different biological sensor, such as a temperature
   sensor, a flow sensor, a blood glucose sensor or other sensor that is able to sense a
   parameter for use by the medical professional. In addition, the inflation catheter 12 may
   include a similar port (now shown) proximally relative to the occlusion balloon 140.
   [00921       The third port 590c is preferably in fluid communication with the second
10 inflation lumen ]3b and the internal spine space 20a of the spine 20. The inflation hub 590
   is not limited to inclusion of the first, second and third ports 590a, 590b, 590C and may
   include more or less ports for fluid communication with the occlusion balloon 140, the spine
   20 and others sensors or clinical sampling purposes. The spine 20 is preferably pocket
   bonded to the occlusion balloon 140 and extends over the back of the occlusion balloon
15 140. When the spine 20 is filled from the third inflation port 590c through the second
   inflation lumen 13b, the inflated spine 20 preferably prevents the occlusion balloon 140
   from sealing up against the vessel sidewall creating leak paths or flow channels between the
   external spine surface 20b, the external occlusion balloon surface 140b and an inside
   surface VS of a vessel wall or vessel VW (Fig. 1E) to allow for partial perfusion or blood
20 flow around the occlusion balloon 140, as is described in greater detail below. In addition,
   the spine 20 and occlusion balloon 140 may be designed and configured such that continued
   additional pressure applied into the spine 20 and occlusion balloon 140 results in the
   occlusion balloon 140 over-driving or collapsing the spine 20 (Fig. IF - sec. Y-Y) against
   the vessel wall VW to provide full occlusion of the vessel.
25 100931       Referring to Fig. IB, in the first preferred embodiment, the inflation hub 590
   includes only the first and second ports 590a, 590b, In this alternative first preferred
   embodiment, the first port 590a is in fluid communication with the first inflation lumen     13a,
   which is in fluid communication with both the internal balloon space 140a and the internal
   spine space 20a. The second port 590b is in fluid communication with the lumen 15 of the
30 stiffener member 12a and the distal side port 170, preferably for sensing pressure distally
   relative to the occlusion balloon 140.
   100941       Referring to Fig. I D, in the first preferred embodiment, the inflation catheter 12
   may be connected to an alternative hub 590' arrangement that is utilized to inflate and
   deflate the occlusion balloon 140 and spine 20 and determine pressure at the distal side port
                                                     16

   170 or otherwise sample fluid or inject medication with the distal side port 170. The
   alternative hub 590' includes a first port 590a' that is in fluid communication with the first
   inflation  lumen 13a, a second port 590b' that is in fluid communication with the lumen 15 of
   the hypotube 12a and a third port 590c' that is in fluid communication with the second
 5 inflation lumen 13b. The first, second and third ports 590a', 590b, 590c' are comprised of
   flexible tubes with valves 593' attached to proximal ends that may engage a syringe, an
   endoflator, a pump 591' or other instrument for manipulating occlusion catheter system 10.
   The pump 591' preferably includes a pressure sensor display that exhibits pressure in the
   tubing of a lead tube 59 1a' extending from the pump 591,
10 [00951       Referring to Figs. 1, 1A, 2 and 3, in operation, the occlusion catheter system 10
   of the alternative first preferred embodiment is insertable into a patient's vessel VW,
   preferably the aorta, with the occlusion balloon 140 and the inflatable spine 20 in the
   deflated configuration with the deflated occlusion balloon 140 and inflatable spine 20
   wrapped around the stiffener member 12a. The occlusion balloon 140 and inflatable spine
15 20 are preferably wrapped around the stiffener member 12a such that the profile of the
   catheter 12 is the same or smaller where the occlusion balloon 140 and inflatable spine 20
   are wrapped around the stiffener member 12a when compared to the remainder of the
   catheter member 12. The catheter member 12 is inserted into the vessel VW with the
   atraumatic tip 450 (Figs. 4 and 5) guiding the catheter 12 into the large vessel VW. The
20 catheter member 12 preferably includes depth markings (Fig. 44) on a proximal portion that
   provide a visual indication to a user regarding the depth of insertion of the occlusion balloon
   140. The depth markings preferably start approximately fifteen centimeters (15 cm)
   proximally from the proximal balloon end 140c and extend on an external surface of the
   catheter 12 to a location proximate the inflation hub 590. The depth markings may also
25 include zone markings or ranges that preferably indicate when the occlusion balloon 140 is
   in zone 1, zone 2 or zone 3 of the patient's aorta, as is described in further detail herein.
   10096]       When the occlusion balloon 140 is placed in a desired location of the aorta, the
   occlusion balloon 140 may be inflated by injecting fluid or gas into the internal balloon
   space 140a through the first inflation lumen 13a, Fluid or gas may be injected through the
30 first port 590a using a syringe or pump 59 1'that is able to connect to the first port 590a.
   Preferably, for full occlusion, the occlusion balloon 140 is inflated such that the external
   balloon surface 140b is in facing contact with internal surfaces VS of the vessel VW and
   blood flow is occluded from flowing past the occlusion balloon 140. The spine 20 is
   preferably in the deflated configuration in this occlusion technique and lies substantially flat
                                                   17

   between the external balloon surface 140b and the internal vessel surface VS, thereby not
   creating or creating a limited channel or path 21 for the flow of blood past the inflated
   occlusion balloon 140, The spine 20 is well suited to facilitate full occlusion, because the
   spine 20 becomes very thin or substantially flat in the deflated configuration, In the
 5 deflated configuration, the spine 20 is able to substantially conform to the external balloon
   surface 140b when the occlusion balloon 140 is in the inflated configuration. This feature
   of the spine 20 thereby limits or eliminates creation of the channel 21 adjacent the spine 20
   in the deflated configuration as it conforms to the external balloon surface 140b when the
   occlusion balloon 140 is in the inflated configuration.
10 [00971      Referring to Figs.  1, IB, 1C, IE and IF, in the preferred embodiment, the user
   connects the pump 591' to the first port 590a, 590a' and injects pressurized fluid or gas into
   the catheter 12. The inflation lumen 13a in the first preferred embodiment is in fluid
   communication with both the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20, resulting in
   substantially simultaneous inflation of the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20. This
15 simultaneous inflation results in blood flow channels 21 (See Fig. IE) being formed at sides
   of the spine 20 between the external balloon surface 140b, the external spine surface 20b
   and the internal surfaces VS of the vessel VW in certain of the partially inflated
   configurations. The blood flow channels 21, shown in Fig. I E in section Y-Y, may
   substantially permit sufficient flow of blood past the occlusion balloon 140 such that blood
20 pressure proximal and distal relative to the occlusion balloon 140 may be manipulated by
   changing the sizes of the channels 21. Generally, when the flow channels 21 are open and
   blood begins to flow through the channels 21, the blood pressures at the proximal and distal
   balloon ends 140c, 140d begin to change. Additional fluid pressure may subsequently be
   applied to the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20 to further reduce the size of the blood
25 flow channels 2 1, thereby resulting in partial occlusion of blood flow through the vessel
   VW and a pressure differential between the proximal balloon end 140c and the distal
   balloon end 140d. Referring to Fig IF, further fluid pressure may be applied to the
   occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20 in an inflated configuration, such that the occlusion
   balloon 140 over-drives the spine 20 or flattens the spine 20 where the occlusion balloon
30  140 centrally contacts the vessel walls VW. In this inflated configuration shown in Fig. IF,
   the occlusion balloon 140 is in full circumferential contact with the internal surfaces VS of
   the vessel VW, resulting in full occlusion of the vessel VW, and the spine 20 is collapsed or
   flattened such that the flow channels 21 are not formed or are collapsed.
    [00981      In an alternative operation of the first preferred embodiment of the occlusion
                                                    18

   catheter system 10, the occlusion balloon 140 and spine 20 are inflated to the fully inflated
   configuration once placed in the predetermined location in the vessel VW. The occlusion
   balloon 140 and the spine 20 are inflated to the same pressure, as they are both in fluid
   communication with the first inflation lumen      13a. The occlusion balloon 140 and the spine
 5 20 both inflate through various partially inflated configurations and eventually come into
   contact with the internal surface VS. As the fluid pressure in the occlusion balloon 140 and
   the spine 20 press against the internal surface VS, the size and compliant properties of the
   occlusion balloon 140 drives the fluid out of the spine 20 or over-drives and flattens the
   spine 20 against the internal surface VS of the vessel VW, thereby creating full occlusion of
10 the vessel VW. The physician or medical technician may maintain this fully occluded
   configuration for a certain amount of time while the patient is diagnosed and a hemorrhage
   in lower portions of the patient's body is reviewed. The full occlusion preferably directs
   blood flow to major organs above or upstream of the full occlusion, such as the brain, heart
   and lungs and diverts the blood away from the lower body hemorrhage. After a limited
15 amount of time of full occlusion, such as approximately twenty minutes (20 mii), the
   physician or medical technician may desire to allow some blood flow past the occlusion
   balloon 140 to address an ischemia or inadequate blood supply that may result for organs
   and tissue that are deprived of blood flow due to the full occlusion.
   [0099]      If and when partial occlusion is desired, fluid from within the occlusion balloon
20 140 is withdrawn and fluid flows back into the spine 20, thereby forming the flow channels
   21. The flow channels 21 are initially relatively small such that blood flow is minimal and
   the pressure ratio is relatively high or the degree of occlusion is relatively high. The user
   may continue to deflate the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20 to allow enlarging of the
   channels 21, more blood to flow through the channels 21 and reduction of the pressure ratio
25 or reduction of the degree of occlusion, Accordingly, the more volume in the occlusion
   balloon 140, the less flow past the occlusion balloon 140 through the channels 21 and the
   less volume in the occlusion balloon 140, the more flow past the occlusion balloon 140,
   1001001     Referring to Figs.   1, I A, 1E and I F, in the alternative first preferred
   embodiment, the occlusion balloon 140 and spine are inserted into the vessel VW to the
30 predetermined location within the vessel VW. The occlusion balloon 140 is initially
   inflated by introducing fluid into the first inflation lumen 13a through the first inflation port
   590a. If full occlusion is desired, the occlusion balloon 140 is maintained in the fully
   inflated configuration with the external balloon surface I40b in facing engagement with the
   internal surface VS. If partial occlusion is desired, the spine 20 is inflated by introducing
                                                     19

   fluid into the second inflation lumen 13 through the third inflation port 590c and fluid may
   be withdrawn from the occlusion balloon 140 such that the flow channels 21 are formed.
   Additional fluid may be introduced into the spine 20 and additional fluid may be withdrawn
   from the occlusion balloon 140 to increase the size of the channels 21 and flow of blood
 5 past the occlusion balloon 140.
   [0100]       Referring to Figs. 1E and I F, in a non-limiting example, the occlusion balloon
   ,140 and spine 20 of first preferred occlusion catheter system 10 was inserted into a high
   temperature silicone rubber tube having a durometer of fifty (50 A), an approximate three
   quarters of an inch (3/4") inside diameter and a seven-eighths inch (7/8") outer diameter,
10 The tube was used to simulate a patient's vessel VW, preferably a zone I section of the
   aorta. In a partially inflated configuration (Fig. 1E), wherein the channels 21 were formed
   to allow partial perfusion and blood flow past the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20
   through the channels 21, seven and one-half milliliters (7.5 mL) of fluid were introduced
   into the system 10, the fluid pressure in the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20 was two
15 and four tenths pounds per square inch (2.4 psi), an occlusion diameter DO of the occlusiotn
   balloon 140 was eighteen and one-half millimeters (18.5 mm) and a spine diameter DS of
   the spine 20 was two and one-half millimeters (2.5 mm). In the fully inflated configuration
   (Fig. I F), wherein the spine 20 is over-driven by the occlusion balloon 140, eleven and one
   half milliliters (11.5 mL) of fluid were introduced into the system 10, the fluid pressure in
20 the occlusion balloon 140 was six and eight tenths pounds per square inch (6.8 psi), the
   occlusion diameter DO was nineteen millimeters (19 mm) and the spine 20 was flattened or
   over-driven between the inner surface ofthe tube and the external balloon surface 140b.
   The fluid volumes, pressures and diameters described above are not limiting and are
   provided as a preferred example of the operation of the first preferred system 10 in a tube
25 that represents a typical aorta of a patient, preferably in zone 1 of the aorta. The zones of
   the aorta are described in Figs, 13 and 14 and the related specification sections of US Patent
   Application Publication No. 2014/0243873, titled, "Fluoroscopy Independent Balloon
   Guided Occlusion Catheter and Method," the contents of which are incorporated herein by
   reference.
30 [0101]       In another preferred non-limiting example, the occlusion balloon 140 and spine
   20 of first preferred occlusion catheter system 10 was inserted into a high-temperature
   silicone rubber tube having a durometer of fifty (50 A), an approximate five-eighths of an
   inch (5/8") inside diameter and a three-quarters of an inch (7/8") outer diameter. The tube
   was used to simulate a patient's vessel VW, preferably a zone 3 section of the aorta, In a
                                                    20

   partially inflated configuration (Fig. 1E), wherein the channels 21 were formed to allow
   partial perfusion and blood flow past the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20 through the
   channels 21, five milliliters (5 mL) of fluid were introduced into the system 10, the fluid
   pressure in the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20 was one and four tenths pounds per
 5 square inch (1.4 psi), the occlusion diameter DO was fifteen millimeters (15 mm) and the
   spine diameter DS was two and one-half millimeters (2.5 mm). In the fully inflated
   configuration (Fig. I F), wherein the spine 20 is over-driven by the occlusion balloon 140,
   seven milliliters (7 mL) of fluid were introduced into the system 10, the fluid pressure in the
   occlusion balloon 140 was five and eight tenths pounds per square inch (5.8 psi), the
10 occlusion diameter DO was sixteen millimeters (16 mm) and the spine 20 was flattened or
   over-driven between the inner surface of the tube and the external balloon surface 140b.
   The fluid volumes, pressures and diameters described above are not limiting and are
   provided as a preferred example of the operation of the first preferred system 10 in a tube
   that represents a typical aorta of a patient, preferably in zone 3 of the aorta. The zones of
15 the aorta are described in Figs. 13 and 14 and the related specification sections of US Patent
   Application Publication No. 2014/0243873, titled, "Fluoroscopy Independent Balloon
   Guided Occlusion Catheter and Method," the contents of which are incorporated herein by
   reference, In both of the preferred examples, portions of the external balloon surface 140b
   and the external spine surface 20b remain in contact with the internal surface VS of the
20 vessel VW to secure the occlusion balloon 140 in the predetermined location in the vessel
   VW,
    101021      Referring to Fig. 3, the spine 20 is shown as being in fluid communication with
   the first inflation lumen 13a (at distal spine end 20d) and the second inflation lumen 13b (at
   proximal spine end 20c). This configuration of the occlusion catheter system 10 is not
25  limited to having the spine 20 in fluid communication with both the first and second
    hiflation lumens 13a, 13b and may be designed and configured to be in fluid communication
   with only the first inflation lumen 13a (Fig. 1 B) or in fluid communication with only the
   second inflation lumen 13b (Fig. I A), as is described above.
    101031      Referring to Figs. 1-3, if and when the technician or medical professional desires
30 partial occlusion or the ability to allow some blood to flow past the occlusion balloon 140,
    fluid or gas is introduced into the spine 20. The fluid or gas may be introduced into the first
    lumen 13a through the first port 590a in the alternative first preferred embodiment (Fig.  1B)
    or through the second lumen 13b through the third port 590c in the first preferred
    embodiment (Fig. I A). The spine 20 expands from the substantially flat, deflated or
                                                    21

   uninflated configuration into the inflated configuration (Fig.  1), thereby urging the external
   balloon surface 140b of the occlusion balloon 140 away from the internal surface VS of the
   vessel VW proximate the inflated spine 20, The inflated spine 20 preferably creates the
   blood flow channels 21 at least on either side of the inflated spine 20 between the internal
 5 surfaces VS of the vessel VW, the external spine surface 20b and the external balloon
   surface I40b (See Fig. I E). These blood flow channels 21 allow at least partial flow of
   blood through the blood flow channels 21 and past the occlusion balloon 140,
   101041       The non-compliant nature of the spine 20 preferably facilitates the creation of
   the blood flow channels 21 by generally maintaining its cylindrical shape at predetermined
10 pressures. Adjusting the pressure within the spine 20 and the occlusion balloon 140 can
   likewise impact the size of the blood flow channels 21 and the amount of blood flowing
   through the blood flow channels 21. The non-compliant nature of the spine 20 also
   maintains the diameter of the spine 20 under increasing pressure and the compliant nature of
   the occlusion balloon 140 wraps around sides of the spine 20, thereby pushing fluid out of
15 the spine 20 and flattening the spine 20 as the system reaches the fully inflated
   configuration. The spine 20 may also be deflated by withdrawing the fluid or gas from the
   internal spine space 20a such that the spine 20 reverts to the deflated configuration in the
   first preferred embodiment by withdrawing fluid or gas through the third port 590c. In the
   deflated configuration, the spine 20 lies substantially flat against the external balloon
20 surface 140b to revert to a full occlusion of the vessel VW, The inflation of the spine 20
   and subsequent creation of the blood flow channels 21 at sides of the spine 20 preferably
   does not impact engagement of the occlusion balloon 140 with the internal surfaces VS of
   the vessel VW. That is, even when the spine 20 is inflated, the external balloon surface
   140b of the occlusion balloon 140 continues to maintain facing engagement with the
25 internal surface VS of the vessel VW, thereby reducing or eliminating movement or
   vibration of the occlusion balloon 140 that may occur when blood is allowed to flow around
   a full circumference of the occlusion balloon 140, as is shown in Fig. A.
   [01051       The stiffener member 12a is preferably comprised of a nitinol hypotube 12a,
   which is a small tube that has a strength and stiffness configured to permit insertion of the
30 occlusion catheter system 10 into the patient's vessel VW along the potentially curved
   vessel path into the preferred portion of the vessel VW. The stiffener member 12a may be
   hollow and include the hypotube lumen 15 therethrough that is in fluid communication with
   the distal side port 170. The side port 170 is preferably positioned distally relative to the
   distal spine end 20d on the catheter 12. The hypotube lumen 15 is also preferably in fluid
                                                   22

   communication with the second port 590b. The stiffener member 12a is not limited to
   including the hypotube lumen 15 or to being constructed of nitinol. The stiffener member
    12a may be substantially solid, be constructed of alternative biocompatible metallic or
   polymeric materials, such as stainless steel, polyether ether ketone ("PEEK") or have
 5 alternative constructions, based on requirements of the preferred occlusion catheter system
    10 or preferences of the designer or medical professional.
   [01061      The hypotube lumen 15 and distal side port 170 may be utilized to withdraw
   fluids from the vessel VW, inject fluid into the vessel VW, detect pressure of the fluid
   within the vessel VW or otherwise provide access to the vessel V W distally relative to the
10 occlusion balloon    140 during use. The catheter 12 may also include a proximal side port or
   proximal pressure sensor 171 near the proximal balloon end 140c that may be utilized to
   withdraw fluids from the vessel, inject fluids into the vessel VW, detect pressure of the fluid
   within the vessel VW downstream from the occlusion balloon 140 or otherwise provide
   access to the vessel VW proximally relative to the occlusion balloon 140 during use, The
15 proximal port 171 may be in fluid communication with a pressure sensor lumen (not shown)
   that extends from the hub 590 to the proximal side port 171 within the catheter 12, The
   distal side port 170 and proximal port 171 may alternatively be replaced by or supplemented
   with electronic pressure sensors, including the distal pressure sensor 170 and the proximal
   pressure sensor 171 that provide pressure sensing capability to the occlusion catheter system
20 10. The electronic pressure sensors may have wiring that extends through the catheter 12 or
   may be comprised of wireless sensors that wirelessly transmit pressure or other sensed
   features, such as temperature, flow, pH or other features, to a data acquisition system.
   [01071      The first preferred occlusion catheter system 10 is constructed such that the
   proximal spine end 20c is connected to the inflation catheter 12 near the proximal balloon
25 end 140c and the distal spine end 20d is connected to the inflation catheter 12 near the distal
   balloon end 140d. The ends 20c, 20d, 140c, 140d are preferably configured to facilitate
   wrapping the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20 around the stiffener member 12a in the
   deflated configuration or drawing a vacuum on the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20
   for insertion into the vessel VW. The ends 20c, 20d. 140c, 140d are not so limited and may
30 be connected and secured to the catheter 12 at nearly any location such that the occlusion
   catheter system 10 is able to perform its preferred functions and withstand its normal
   operating conditions. For example, the occlusion balloon 140 may be configured with a
   feature providing central fluid communication with the hollow hypotube 12a such that the
   occlusion balloon 140 expands both longitudinally and radially from the deflated
                                                  23

   configuration to the inflated configuration and the proximal and distal ends    140c, 140d are
   not directly connected to the catheter 12, but are only connected through the central
   engagement with the hollow hypotube 12a.
   101081      The first preferred embodiment of the occlusion catheter system 10 may
 5 alternatively be configured with only the first inflation lumen 13a being in fluid
   communication with both the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20 and elimination of the
   second inflation lumen 13b. This configuration, as is shown in Fig. lB, may facilitate a
   smaller profile for the catheter member 12, because the catheter member 12 only
   accommodates the first inflation lumen 13a, as opposed to both the first and second inflation
10 lumens 13a, 13b. In this alternative first preferred embodiment, the occlusion balloon 140
   and the spine 20 are both inflated by injecting fluid or gas into the internal balloon space
    140a and the internal spine space 20a. The fluid or gas is preferably introduced into the first
    lumen  13a through the first port 590a of the hub 590. In this alternative first preferred
   embodiment, the occlusion balloon 140 is preferably constructed of a compliant,
15 biocompatible material and the spine 20 is preferably constructed of a non-compliant,
   biocompatible material. Accordingly, the spine 20 generally maintains its pre-determined
   shape during inflation and the blood flow channels 21 are defined on either side of the spine
   20 during inflation and in the inflated configuration. The alternative first preferred
   embodiment of the occlusion catheter system 10 may provide full occlusion by inflating the
20 spine 20 and occlusion balloon 140 until the compliant occlusion balloon 140 blocks the
    blood flow channels 21 by generally conforming to the shape of the spine 20 and the inside
   surfaces VS of the vessel VW.
    [01091      Referring to Figs. 4 and 5, in the first preferred embodiment, a guiding
    atraumatic tip 450 is preferably secured to or co-molded with the distal end 12c of the
25 catheter 12. The guiding atraumnatic tip 450 may be employed with any of the preferred
   embodiments of the occlusion catheter system 10 described herein. The guiding atraumatic
   tip 450 is preferably comprised of a polymeric cylindrical or tubular member 452 that has a
   distal section 454 that has been formed into a generally flattened cylinder having two
    generally planar opposing surfaces 455, 457 and two generally curved opposing surfaces
30  458, 459. The two generally planar opposing surfaces 455, 457 include an inner planar
    surface 455 and an outer planar surface 457. The distal section 454 has a distally extending
    section 453 that projects distally and a curved section 456 continuous with the distally
    extending section that curves away from the central longitudinal axis 131 of the occlusion
    catheter system 10, then proximally toward the occlusion balloon 140 and subtends a
                                                    24

   generally circular are toward the central longitudinal axis 131 of the occlusion catheter
   system 10, The angle of the curve may be between about one hundred eighty degrees
   (1804) and three hundred fifty-five degrees (3550), more preferably between about two
   hundred seventy degrees (270*) and three hundred fifty degrees (3500) and even more
 5 preferably between about three hundred degrees (3000) and three hundred fifty degrees
   (3500) such that a gap is provided between the terminal end of the generally cylindrical
   flattened distal section 454 and the more proximal surface of the distal section 454. The
   distally extending section 453 and curved section 456 may alternatively be formed as a
   generally in-plane circular shape or may be formed as an out-of-plane generally helical
10 shape, where a terminal end of the curved section 456 is laterally displaced from the central
   longitudinal axis 131 of the occlusion catheter system 10. In this manner, the generally
   flattened distal section 454 is characterized by a generally circular profile.
   101101       In the preferred embodiments, a tip thickness Tt is defined between the inner
   planar surface 455 and the outer planar surface 457 and a tip width Wt is defined between
15 the opposing curved lateral surfaces 458, 459. The tip width Wt is preferably greater than
   the tip thickness Tt such that the atraumatic tip 450 is readily flexible about a central tip axis
   450a, The atraumatic tip 450 is preferably flexible about the central tip axis 450a from the
   substantially circular profile in the relaxed configuration to the introduction configuration,
   wherein the atraumatic tip 450 is relatively straight or positioned on the longitudinal central
20 axis 131. In the preferred embodiments, the tip thickness Tt is less than the tip width Wt.
   The relatively smaller tip thickness Tt in comparison to the tip width Wt facilitates the
   flexing of the atraumatic tip 450 from the relaxed configuration with the substantially
   circular profile to the introduction configuration, wherein the atraumatic tip 450 is
   substantially straight and is positioned on the longitudinal central axis 131 and renders
25 bending of the atraumatic tip 450 laterally more difficult.
    10111]      A tapered transition section 451 may, optionally, be provided between the
   polymeric cylindrical or tubular member 452 and the generally flattened cylindrical distal
   section 454. The guiding atraumatic tip 450 may be integral with the catheter member 12 of
   occlusion catheter system 10, Alternatively, the guiding atraumatic tip 450 may be
30  fabricated as a discrete member and joined to the catheter member 12 of the occlusion
   catheter system 10.
    101121      The guiding atraumatic tip 450 is preferably constructed of a polyether block
    amide (PBAX, Arkema, Paris France) having a durometer of forty (40D) or a similar
    polymer, such as a polyurethane or polyethylene that is compatible with the catheter 12, the
                                                   25

   spine 20 and the occlusion balloon     140 to make bonding easier and more secure, but is not
   so limited. As discussed above, the guiding atraumatic tip 450 may be either cylindrical or
   tubular, or have a solid cylindrical section and a tubular section. The curve of the guiding
   atraumatic tip 450 may be made by any of a wide number of processes, including, for
 5 example, injection molding, round extrusion, flattening and post-processing into the curved
   distal section 456, a flat extrusion bonded to a round extrusion, or an extrusion that is
   pressed into a hot die having a shape of the desired curved distal section 450.
   [01131       The atraumatic tip 450 may include a radio opaque tip marker 460. The radio
   opaque tip marker 460 may be implemented as a band surrounding the tip 450 or as a two
10 dimensional planar material on one or both of the planar opposing surfaces 455.
   Alternatively, the radio opaque tip marker 460 may be located at the most distal point of the
   atraumatic tip 450 indicated at 460' in Fig. 5. The band or the planar material may be
   composed of any suitable radio opaque material, such as for example, stainless steel or a
   suitable alloy such as platinum iridium. In another example preferred embodiment, the tip
15 450 may be made ofa plastic or polymer, such as for example, a polyether block amide,
   such as PEBAX, that is impregnated with a radio opaque material. In another preferred
   example embodiment, the plastic or polymer composition forming the tip 450 may be mixed
   with a radio opaque compound such as, for example, barium sulfate sufficient to permit
   visualization of the tip 450 using x-ray or fluoroscopy. Any of the preferred embodiments
20 of the occlusion catheter systems 10 described herein, including the first preferred
   embodiment of the occlusion catheter system 10, may include the atraumatic tip 450
   mounted or co-molded onto the distal end 12c of the occlusion catheter system 10 to
   facilitate guiding of the catheter system 10 into the large vessel VW, preferably the aorta of
   the patient, and generally preventing the catheter 12 from entering a secondary vessel VW
25 during insertion.
   101141       Referring to Figs. 1-6, the occlusion catheter system 10 of the first preferred
   embodiment is utilized to occlude or partially occlude a relatively large vessel VW, such as
   the aorta, having an internal surface VS. The occlusion catheter system 10 includes the
   inflation catheter member 12 having the stiffener member 12a, the first inflation lumen I 3a,
30 the proximal catheter end 12b and the distal catheter end 12c. The inflation catheter
   member 12 defines a longitudinal axis 131 and is relatively flexible with the longitudinal
   axis 131 extending along the inflation catheter member 12 and the stiffener member 12a.
   The inflation catheter member 12 has the atraumatic tip 450 at the on the distal catheter end
    12c that permits insertion of the inflation catheter member 12 into the relatively large vessel
                                                   26

   VW and inhibits movement of the atraumatic tip 450 into smaller vessels during the
   insertion process, while also limiting damage to the vessel VW during insertion.
   [0115]       The stiffener member 12a of the First preferred embodiment is comprised of the
   hypotube 12a that is constructed of the nitinol material or a relatively strong metallic
 5 material. The preferred hypotube 12a includes the lumen 15 therein. In addition, the
   atraumatic tip 450 of the first preferred embodiment is comprised of a generally flattened
   cylinder in a relaxed configuration having two planar opposing surfaces 455, 457.
   101161       The occlusion catheter system 10 of the first preferred embodiment also includes
   the occlusion balloon 140 with the internal balloon space 140a, the external balloon surface
10 140b, the proximal balloon end 140c and the distal balloon end 140d. The proximal and
   distal balloon ends 140c, 140d are connected to the inflation catheter member 12 between
   the proximal catheter end 12b and the distal catheter end 12c. The occlusion balloon 140
   has a working length WL between the proximal and distal ends 140c, 140d where at least
   portions of the external balloon surface 140b preferably contact the internal surface VS of
15 the vessel VW in an occlusion or partial occlusion configuration. The occlusion balloon
    140 is substantially centered along the longitudinal axis 131 in an inflated configuration.
   The first inflation lumen 13a is in fluid communication with the internal balloon space 140a
   such that fluid or gas can be introduced into the inflation balloon 140 through the first
   inflation lumen 13a to inflate the occlusion balloon from the uninflated configuration,
20 through various partially inflated configurations and to the inflated or fully inflated
   configuration.
   101171       The occlusion catheter system 10 includes the distal pressure sensor 170 attached
   to the inflation catheter member 12 between the distal balloon end 140d and the atraumatic
   tip 450. The pressure sensor 170 is comprised of an electronic pressure sensor in the first
25  preferred embodiment, which will be described in further detail below with respect to other
   preferred embodiments, The pressure sensor 170 may alternatively be comprised of the
   distal side port 170 in the inflation catheter member 12. The distal side port 170 is
   preferably in fluid communication with the lumen 15 in the stiffener member 12a so that
    pressure may be determined via the fluid in the vessel VW, through the distal side port I70
30  and through the lumen 15.
    [01181       The occlusion catheter system 10 also includes the inflatable spine 20 having
    the internal spine space 20a, the external spine surface 20b, the proximal spine end 20c and
   the distal spine end 20d. The inflatable spine 20 has a substantially constant spine diameter
    Ds between the proximal spine end 20c and the distal spine end 20d in the partially and
                                                   27

   fully inflated configurations. The inflatable spine 20, similar to the occlusion balloon 140,
   may be expanded to partially and fully inflated configurations from the uninflated
   configuration, wherein the spine 20 is substantially flattened. The inflatable spine 20 has a
   plurality of partially inflated configurations between the inflated configuration and the
 5 fully inflated configuration. In certain of the partially inflated configurations, the inflatable
   spine 20 has the substantially constant spine diameter Ds. The inflatable spine 20 is not
   limited to having the substantially constant spine diameter Ds in certain of the partially
   inflated configurations and may have a variable cross-section, a cross-section that is
   substantially consistent, but not circular, or may have other configurations that are designed
10 for creating blood flow channels 21, as is described herein.
   [01191       The occlusion balloon 140 of the first preferred embodiment has the occlusion
   diameter Do that is at least twice the spine diameter DS when the occlusion balloon 140 and
   the inflatable spine 20 are inflated to one of the partially inflated configurations. For
   example, a preferred occlusion balloon 140 and inflatable spine 20 configuration of the first
15 preferred embodiment in the partially inflated configuration (Fig. IE), as was described
   above, may have the occlusion diameter Do of approximately eighteen and on-half
   millimeters (18.5 mm) while the spine diameter Ds is approximately two and one-half
   millimeters (2.5 mm) in a zone I portion of an artery, while the occlusion diameter Do is
   approximately fifteen millimeters (15 mm) and the spine diameter Ds is approximately two
20 and one-half millimeters (2.5 mm). In this first preferred embodiment configuration, the
   occlusion diameter Do is approximately six to seven and one-half (6 - 7.5) times larger than
   the spine diameter Ds in the partially inflated configuration. The ratio is not so limited and
   may be approximately two to seven and one-half or more (2 - 7.5+) in certain preferred
   configurations and when introduced into particularly large vessels VW. In the first
25 preferred embodiment, the occlusion balloon 140 may be molded to an approximate ten to
   fifteen millimeter (10 - 15 mm) occlusion diameter Do and the balloon spine 20 may be
   molded to an approximate two and one-half millimeter (2.5 mm) spine diameter Ds, thereby
   resulting in the occlusion diameter Do being approximately four to six (4 - 6) times greater
   than the spine diameter Ds, The first preferred occlusion balloon 140 and the inflatable
30 spine 20 are not limited to having these specifically described occlusion and spine diameters
   Do, Ds and may have other specific diameters and shapes, as long as the occlusion catheter
   system 10 creates the blood flow channels 21 or full occlusion of the vessel VW when
   desired by the medical technician and are able to withstand the normal operating conditions
   of the preferred system 10. In addition, this ratio of the occlusion diameter Do relative to
                                                    28

   the spine diameter DS is impacted by the size of the vessel VW that the system 10 is
   operating within and the compliant or non-compliant nature of the occlusion balloon 140
   and the spine 20, respectively.
   [01201        In the first preferred embodiment, the first inflation lumen I3a is in fluid
 5 communication with the internal spine space 20a of the inflatable spine 20 such that the
   occlusion balloon 140 and the inflatable spine 20 are inflated when pressurized fluid or gas
   is introduced into the first inflation lumen 13. In this first preferred embodiment, the
   internal spine space 20a and the internal balloon space 140a are both subjected to the same
   pressurized fluid when pressurized fluid is introduced into the first inflation lumen 13a.
10 [01211        In the alternative first preferred embodiment, the second inflation lumen 13b is
   in fluid communication with the internal spine space 20a of the inflatable spine 20 and the
   first inflation lumen 13a is in fluid communication with the internal balloon space 140a of
   the occlusion balloon 140. In this alternative first preferred embodiment, the medical
   technician may individually introduce pressurized fluid or gas into the inflatable spine 20
15 and the occlusion balloon 140 based on preferences or clinical needs, The technician may,
   therefore, only introduce pressurized fluid into the occlusion balloon 140 to provide fully
   occlusion of the vessel VW, may provide full pressure to the balloon spine 20 and partial or
   a lower pressure to the occlusion balloon 140 to facilitate creation of the blood flow
   channels 21 or nearly any combination of pressures to the occlusion balloon 140 and the
20 inflatable spine 20, respectively. In addition, the individual pressures may be controlled by
   the controller 8 based on pressure sensed by sensors associated by the occlusion catheter
   system 10 to provide partial, fully or no occlusion of the vessel VW, based on the condition
   of the patient or preferences of the medical technician.
   101221        The proximal and distal spine ends 20c, 20d of the first preferred embodiments
25 are connected to the inflation catheter 12 and a portion of the external balloon surface 140b
   contacts the external spine surface 20b when the occlusion balloon 140 and the inflatable
   spine 20 are in an inflated configuration, partially inflated configuration or fully inflated
   configuration. Portions of the external spine surface 20b and the external balloon surface
    140b are nearly always in contact with each other, even in the uninflated configuration,
30 when the occlusion catheter system 12 is assembled, as the inflatable spine 20 is generally
   wrapped or folded around the occlusion balloon 140 in the uninflated configuration for
    insertion into or withdraw from the vessel VW. The proximal spine end 20c is connected to
   the inflation catheter 12 near the proximal balloon end 140c and the distal spine end 20d is
   connected to the inflation catheter 12 near the distal balloon end 140d, The occlusion
                                                      29

   balloon 140 and the inflatable spine 20 are configured to define the blood flow channels 21
   with the internal surface VS of the vessel VW and the external balloon surface 140b when
   the occlusion catheter system 10 is at least partially positioned in the vessel VW and the
   occlusion balloon 140 and the inflatable spine 20 are in the partially inflated configuration.
 5 [0123]       Referring to Figs. 1A-5, to utilize the first preferred occlusion catheter system
    10, the catheter 12 is inserted into the patient, preferably in the left or right femoral common
   artery or the left or right common iliac artery through a small puncture. The catheter 12 is
   introduced into the artery or vessel, preferably through an introducer sheath (not shown).
   When introduced, the atraumatic tip 450 is straightened, substantially along the longitudinal
10 axis 131 and may return to its substantially circular profile when the atraumatic tip 450
   enters the vessel VW. The preferred atraumatic tip 450 guides the tip of the catheter 12
   through the major vessel VW, generally preventing the catheter 12 from entering smaller
   vessels that branch off of the major vessel VW. The atraumatic tip 450 preferably guides
   the catheter 12 and the occlusion balloon 140 into an appropriate or desired location in the
15 major vessel VW where occlusion or partial occlusion is desired by the physician or
   medical technician. The atraumatic top 450 may, for example, guide the occlusion balloon
    140, in an uninflated configuration, into various zones in the aorta below the aortic arch,
   such as in the thoracic aorta, the abdominal aorta or at nearly any location therein desired by
   the user.
20 [01241       When the occlusion balloon 140 is positioned appropriately in the vessel VW, a
   proximal end of the catheter 12 is attached to an insufflator or other device that is able to
   introduce pressurized fluid into the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20. In the first
   preferred embodiment wherein the first port 590a is in fluid communication with the first
   inflation lumen 13a, which is in fluid communication with both the internal balloon space
25  140a and the internal spine space 20a, the insufflator introduces substantially equal pressure
   into both the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20. The second port 590b is in fluid
   communication with the internal lumen 15 of the stiffener member or hypotube 12a and the
   distal side port  170, preferably for sensing pressure distally relative to the occlusion balloon
    140, but also potentially for introducing medication, withdrawing blood or other fluids from
30 the vessel VW or otherwise gaining fluid access to the vessel VW proximate the distal side
   port 170. Pressurized fluid is introduced into the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20 to
   at least partially occlude the vessel VW, typically to limit blood flow to the patient's lower
   extremities and preserve blood flow to major organs, such as the heart, lungs and brain,
    When inflated, at least portions of the external balloon surface 140b and the external spine
                                                     30

   surface 20a and in contact with the internal surface VS of the vessel VW, thereby creating
   the channels 21 that permit flow of blood past the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20
   through the channels 21, The flow channels 21 are defined between the external spine
   surface 20a of the spine 20, the external balloon surface 140b and the internal surface VS of
 5 the vessel VW (See Fig. IE, wherein pressure proximal and distal of the occlusion balloon
   140 is likely not impacted) to permit partial blood flow through the vessel VW, The size of
   the channels 21 may be adjusted by modifying the inflation pressure in the spine 20 and the
   occlusion balloon 140 to permit more or less flow through the vessel VW.
   10125]      The pressure within the occlusion balloon 140 and spine 20 may specifically be
10 monitored and controlled based on nearly any desired factor determined by the medical
   professional, such as the blood pressure in the vessel VW upstream from the occlusion
   balloon 140, which may be detected by a pressure sensor or fluid pressure head through the
   distal side port 170. For example, the medical professional may desire to maintain a
   predetermined pressure on the upstream side of the occlusion balloon 140 in its mounted
15 configuration and may control the pressure in the occlusion balloon 140 and spine 20 to
   maintain this blood pressure. The catheter 12 may alternatively be attached to a controller 8
   and a pump 7 for controlling pressure within the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20.
   The pump 7 preferably replaces the insufflator to mechanically pump pressurized fluid into
   the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20. The controller 8 may receive pressure readings
20 from within the occlusion balloon 140 and spine 20, but is not so limited. The controller 8
   preferably receives pressure readings distally relative to the occlusion balloon 140,
   potentially from the distal side port 170, and/or proximally relative to the occlusion balloon
    140, potentially from the proximal port 171. The controller 8 may be configured to
   maintain a predetermined blood pressure detected at the distal side port 170, a
25 predetermined blood pressure differential measured between the distal side port 170 and the
   proximal side port 171, a predetermined pressure within the occlusion balloon 140 and the
   spine 20, a predetermined blood pressure detected at the proximal pressure sensor 171, other
   predetermined pressures or may react based on other biomedical data gathered from the
   patient that may be transmitted to the controller 8. The preferred controller 8 receives at
30 least blood pressure from the distal side port 170, the proximal pressure sensor 171 and
   pressure of the fluid in the occlusion balloon 140 and spine 20 and controls the pump 7 to
   inject fluid into the spine 20 and the occlusion balloon 140, withdraw fluid from the spine
   20 and the occlusion balloon 140 or shuts-off the pump 7.
                                                  31

   101261       In the first preferred embodiment, the occlusion balloon 140 is preferably
   constructed of a compliant material and the spine 20 is preferably constructed of a non
   compliant material. The occlusion balloon 140 may be constructed of a compliant
   polyurethane or polyolefin copolymer ("POC") material that is able to take on the general
 5 size and shape of the occlusion balloon 140, perform the preferred functions of the
   occlusion balloon 140 and withstand the normal operating conditions of the occlusion
   balloon 140. The introduction of pressurized fluid into the spine 20 and occlusion balloon
   140 preferably results in the spine 20 and occlusion balloon 140 inflating into the vessel to
   contact the inside surfaces VS of the vessel VW. The size and compliant nature of the
10 preferred occlusion balloon 140 results in over-driving or flattening of the non-compliant
   spine 20 after the occlusion balloon 140 engages the internal surfaces VS of the vessel VW
   and the spine 20 inflates to its full diameter, such as when the occlusion balloon 140 is in
   the fully inflated configuration or a relatively high pressure partial inflated configuration.
   The preferred spine 20 has an inflated diameter of approximately one-half to seven
15 millimeters (/2 -7    mm), more preferably one and one-half to three and one-half millimeters
   (I %2- 3 2  mm) and is preferably approximately two and one-half millimeters (2B? mm) in an
   inflated configuration.
   t01271       In the preferred embodiments, the occlusion balloon 140 is preferably sized to
   have a maximum diameter that is able to fully occlude the vessel VW into which the
20 occlusion balloon 140 is introduced. In the preferred embodiments, the occlusion balloon
    140 may have an inflated occlusion diameter Do of approximately ten to thirty-two or
   greater millimeters (10-      >_32 mm). An example preferred occlusion balloon 140 may be
   constructed of a compliant balloon material that is blown to an occlusion diameter Do of
   twelve to fifteen millimeters (12-15 mm) and is capable of expanding to approximately
25 thirty-two millimeters (32 mm) or more in an inflated configuration. In the example first
   preferred embodiment, the occlusion balloon 140 and spine 20 may provide partial
   occlusion when pressurized at one-half atmosphere (%2atm) and full occlusion wherein the
   occlusion balloon 140 over-drives or flattens the spine 20 at one atmosphere (I atm)(Fig,
    1F), but is not so limited. The preferred occlusion catheter system 10 may be otherwise
30 configured such that nearly any range of pressures may be applied to the occlusion balloon
    140 and spine 20 to facilitate partial and full occlusion of the vessel VW,
    [0128]      The occlusion catheter system 10 may also be supplied in a kit with multiple
   occlusion catheter systems 10 and introduction instruments provided in the kit. The kit may
    include multiple catheters 12 having differently sized occlusion balloons 140 for occluding
                                                    32

   or partially occluding differently sized vessels VW, In addition, the Occlusion balloon 140
   may be inflated to various diameters depending on the pressure introduced into the internal
   balloon space 140a. As a non-limiting example the occlusion balloon may have an
   occlusion diameter Do of approximately fifteen millimeters (15 mm) when five cubic
 5 centimeters (5 cc) of fluid are introduced into the internal balloon space 140a, an occlusion
   diameter Do oftwenty millimeters (20 mm) when eight cubic centimeters (8 cc) are
   introduced, twenty-five millimeters when thirteen cubic centimeters (13 cc) are introduced,
   thirty millimeters (30 mm) when twenty cubic centimeters (20 cc) are introduced and thirty
   two millimeters (32 mim) when twenty-four cubic centimeters (24 cc) are introduced. These
10 diameters and volumes are not limiting, but are presented as an example of the diameter
   range and pressures utilized with the first preferred occlusion balloon 140.
   [01291       Referring to Figs. 7 and 8, a second preferred embodiment of an occlusion
   catheter system 50 includes an inflation catheter member 52 with a stiffener member 53
   therein and an occlusion balloon 54 mounted to the inflation catheter member 52. The
15 inflation catheter member 52 preferably includes the guiding atraumatic tip 450 at its distal
   end to facilitate insertion of the occlusion catheter system 50 into the large vessel VW,
   preferably the aorta, of the patient. In the second preferred embodiment, the stiffener
   member 53 of the inflation catheter member 52 extends through proximal and distal ends
   54c, 54d of the occlusion balloon 54, such that the stiffener member 53 is in contact with a
20 portion of an external balloon surface 54b of the occlusion balloon 54 between the proximal
   and distal ends 54c, 54d, An inflation lumen 53a is preferably defined or formed between
   an internal surface of the inflation catheter member 52 and an external surface of the
   stiffener member 53, with the inflation lumen 53a being in fluid communication with an
   internal balloon space 54a of the occlusion balloon 54, The proximal end 54c of the
25 occlusion balloon 54 is attached to the inflation catheter member 52 such that the inflation
   lumen 53a is in fluid communication with the internal balloon space 54a and the distal end
   54d of the occlusion balloon 54 is attached to the stiffener member 53. The stiffener
   member 53 is preferably solid and substantially cylindrical in the second preferred
   embodiment, but is not so limited and may be constructed at a tube with an internal lumen
30 (not shown) for pressure sensing, delivery of medication, introduction of a guide wire or
   other functions. Alternatively, the stiffener member 53, in this or any of the preferred
   embodiments, may include the internal lumen that permits use of a guide wire for guiding
   the system 50 to a preferred location in the patient's vessel VW. Any of the preferred
   catheter members 12, 52, 52', 1244, 1244', 312, 412, 512, 612, 712, 812, 1412, 1512, 1612,
                                                   33

   1712, 1812 described herein may be adapted to include the lumen 15 that extends
   completely through the catheter member 12, 52, 52', 1244, 1244', 312, 412, 512, 612, 712,
   812, 1412, 1512, 1612, 1712, 1812 for use with a guidewire to guide the occlusion balloon
   140 to a preferred location.
 5 [01301       In operation, the occlusion catheter system 50 is introduced into the patient's
   vessel VW and the occlusion balloon 54 is positioned where the technician or medical
   professional desires occlusion of the vessel VW. In an insertion configuration, the
   occlusion balloon 54 is wrapped or folded onto or around the stiffener member 53, such that
   the folded occlusion balloon 54 has substantially the same profile or a smaller
10 diameter/profile than the inflation catheter member 52. The profile or diameter of the
   occlusion catheter system 50 is, therefore, greatest at the connection between the inflation
   catheter member 52 and the proximal end 54c of the occlusion balloon 54.
   [01311       When the occlusion catheter system 50 is appropriately positioned in the vessel,
   the technician or medical professional introduces fluid or gas into the occlusion balloon 54
15 through the inflation lumen 53a to inflate the inflation balloon 54. The occlusion balloon 54
   inflates into the inflated or partially inflated configuration and at least partially engages
   internal surfaces VS of the vessel VW with the external balloon surface 54b. The stiffener
   member 53 is also in contact with the external balloon surface 54b along a portion of the
   occlusion balloon 54 to deform the occlusion balloon 54, substantially parallel to a
20 longitudinal axis II ofthe occlusion catheter system 50. The deformation of the occlusion
   balloon 54 preferably creates blood flow channels along opposite sides of the stiffener
   member 53 within the vessel VW or a single blood flow channel between the stiffener
   member 53, the internal surfaces VS of the vessel VW and the external balloon surface 54b
   proximate the stiffener member 53, This deformation of the occlusion balloon 54 proximate
25 the stiffener member 53 allows at least partial perfusion of blood flow past the occlusion
   balloon 54 within the vessel VW, The occlusion balloon 54 may also be designed and
   configured such that the vessel VW is fully occluded when inflated to a predetermined
   pressure or within a pressure range.
    10132]      Referring to Fig. 9, in a third preferred embodiment an occlusion catheter system
30 50' has a similar configuration and function when compared to the second preferred
   occlusion catheter system 50 and the same reference numerals are utilized to identify the
   same or similar features, with a prime symbol (') utilized to distinguish the third preferred
   embodiment from the second preferred embodiment. The occlusion catheter system 50' of
   the third preferred embodiment includes the stiffener member 53' positioned proximate or in
                                                     34

   facing engagement with the external balloon surface 54b', but the occlusion balloon 54
   spirals or is configured to spiral around the stiffener member 53' in an assembled
   configuration. The external balloon surface 54b' proximate the stiffener member 53',
   thereby defines or forms a spiral or curved blood flow channel (not shown) between the
 5 external balloon surface 54b, the external surface of the stiffener member 53' and the
   internal surface VS of the vessel VW. In the inflated or partially inflated configuration, the
   spiral or arcuate blood flow channel is formed, thereby permitting flow of blood through the
   vessel VW and partial occlusion of the vessel VW.
   101331       Referring to Figs. 7-9, in the second and third preferred embodiments of the
10 occlusion catheter system 50, 50', the stiffener member 53, 53' creates a disruption in a
   potential seal between the vessel surface VS and the occlusion balloon 54, 54' when the
   occlusion balloon 54, 54' is in the inflated or partially inflated configuration. By preventing
   the vessel surface VW from conforming to the external balloon surface 54b, 54b' the
   stiffener member 53, 53' preferably creates two small flow paths for the blood to flow over
15 the occlusion balloon 54, 54' through the channel for partial occlusion. The facing
   engagement or contact between the stiffener member 53, 53' and external balloon surface
   54b, 54b' with the vessel wall VW being in contact with the internal vessel surface VS
   stabilizes the occlusion balloon 54, 54' as it is being inflated and deflated during partial
   occlusion.
20 (01341       Similar to the second and third preferred embodiments, referring to Figs. 10-12,
   fourth and fifth preferred embodiments of the occlusion catheter system 1240, 1240' include
   a compliant occlusion balloon 1242, 1242' and at least one restraining filament 1250, 1250'
   connected to proximal and distal catheters 1240b, 1240b', 1240c, 1240c' with the restraining
   filament 1250, of the fourth preferred embodiment positioned on an outside of an outer
25 surface 1243 of the balloon 1242. The proximal catheter 1240b, 1240b' includes an
   inflation lumen (not shown) therein that carries fluid or gas to and from the balloon 1242,
    1242' to facilitate inflation and deflation of the balloon 1242, 1242'. The restraining
   filament 1250, 1250' deforms at least one section of the occlusion balloon 1242, 1242'
   radially inward toward a longitudinal axis 1240a, 1240a of the balloon 1242, 1242' and
30 away from the internal surface VS of the vessel VW or allows an adjacent portion of the
   balloon 1242, 1242' to extend further away from the longitudinal axis 1240a, 1240a' than
   the portion proximate the filament 1240, 1240', The inclusion of the restraining filament
    1250, 1250' preferably creates a reverse curvature in the balloon 1242, 1242' and permits
   fluid to flow past the balloon 1242, 1242' through a blood flow channel or multiple blood
                                                     35

   flow channels (not shown). The blood flow channels preferably extend substantially
   parallel to the longitudinal axis 1240a, 1240a' when the balloon 1242, 1242' is positioned
   within the vessel VW and is in the inflated configuration. When a desired time elapses, a
   desired arterial blood pressure is achieved, or when other indicators suggest, the tension on
 5 the restraining filament 1250, 1250' may be released, the reverse curvature preferably
   expands and the balloon 1242, 1242' preferably returns to its occlusion position in
   apposition with the vessel surface VS of the vessel VW. At least portions of the external
   surface 1243, 1243' of the balloon 1242 are consistently in contact with internal surfaces VS
   of the vessel VW during this inflation and filament 1250 release procedure such that the
10 occlusion balloon 1242 is engaged with the vessel surface VS to limit movement or
   vibration of the balloon 1242 relative to the vessel VW,
   [01351       In the occlusion catheter system 1240 of the fourth preferred embodiment, the
   proximal and distal catheters 1240b, 1240c accommodate the at least one restraining
   filament 1250 within the proximal and distal catheters 1240b, 1240c. The filament 1250 is
15 restrained in the proximal and distal catheters 1240b, 1240c such that the filament 1250
   exits the catheters 1240b, 1240c near the proximal and distal ends of the balloon 1242 and
   overlies the balloon 1250 along a portion of the length of the balloon 1250. The filament
   1250 is also preferably movable within the proximal catheter 1240b so that a user is able to
   provide tension against the outer surface 1243 of the balloon 1250 to deform the balloon
20  1250 and define channels or flow paths 1221 between the outer surface 1243 and the inner
   surface VS of the vessel VW. The channels or flow paths 1221 are preferably oriented
   substantially parallel to or along the longitudinal axis 1240a.
   [01361       In the fourth preferred embodiment, the catheters 1240b, 1240c include a distal
   port 1246 passing through the outer wall of the distal catheter 1240c and a proximal port
25  1248 also passing through the outer wall of the proximal catheter 1240b. The restraining
   filament 1250 preferably traverses from the proximal end of the proximal catheter 1240b,
   where it is accessible to the medical practitioner for tensioning, through a lumen (not
   shown) in the proximal catheter 1240b, exits the proximal port 1248, passes over the
   balloon 1242 adjacent the outer surface 1243 of the balloon 1242, and anchors or is attached
30 at the distal port 1246 to the distal catheter 1240c, In this manner, tensioning the filament
    1250 at the proximal end of the proximal catheter 1240b causes the filament 1250 to tension
   against the balloon 1242 or block expansion of the balloon 1242 proximate the filament
    1250. When the balloon 1242 is inflated, the portions of the balloon 1242 spaced from the
   filament 1250 expand away from the longitudinal axis 1240a, while the portions of the
                                                   36

   balloon 1242 adjacent and beneath the filament 1250 are blocked from expansion by the
   filament 1250. Accordingly, the outer surface 1243 of the balloon 1242 forms or defines
   the blood flow channels 1221 extending substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis I 240a
   or along the length of the filament 1250 between the expanded portions of the balloon 1242.

   surface 1243 are in contact with the inside surface VS of the vessel VW.
   [01371        Referring specifically to Fig. 12, the fifth preferred occlusion catheter system
   1240' has similar features in comparison to the fourth preferred occlusion catheter system
    1240 and like reference numerals are utilized to identify like features, with a prime symbol
10 (') utilized to distinguish the features of the fifth preferred occlusion catheter system 1240'
   from the features of the forth preferred occlusion catheter system 1240. In the fifth
   preferred embodiment, at least one restraining filament 1250' is positioned within the
   interior space or within the material of the balloon 1242', thereby joining the at least one
   filament 1250' with the inner wall surface of the balloon 1242'. Thisjoining between the
15 restraining filament 1250' and the inner wall surface of the balloon 1242' may be
   accomplished by adhesives, thermobonding, co-molding or reflowing. Alternatively, one or
   more lumens may be co-extruded with the inner wall surface of the balloon 1242' or tubular
   members joined to the inner wall surface of the balloon 1242', and the at least restraining
   filament 1250' is subsequently positioned within this at least one lumen or tubular member
20 and anchored therein. The balloon 1242' may alternatively be formed from different
   materials, with the filament 1250' being constructed of a stiffer material than the remainder
   of the balloon 1242' such that the portion of the balloon 1242' with the filament 1250'
   therein does not expand at the same rate or to the same extent -as the remainder of the
    balloon 1242'. In this fifth preferred embodiment, the occlusion catheter system 1240' does
25 not necessarily include the proximal port 1248' and the distal port 1246', as the filament
    1250' may be positioned within the catheters       1240b', 1240c' or within a lumen of the
   catheters 1240b', 1240c'. The filament 1250' would, therefore, typically not be exposed to
   the blood vessel VW or blood flow in such a configuration, as the filament 1250' is encased
    within the balloon 1242' and the catheters 1240b', 1240c', where the filament 1250 is not
30 exposed to fluid and blood flow during use,
    101381       Referring to Figs. 13 and 14, a sixth preferred embodiment of an occlusion
    catheter system 100 includes a plurality of occlusion balloons 154a, 154b, 154c carried
    commonly on an inflation catheter member 152. The plurality of balloons 154a, 154b, 154c
    may be incorporated with any of the preferred occlusion catheter systems 10, 50, 50', 1240,

   independently expandable though inflation lumens or an inflation lumen (not shown) in the
   inflation catheter member 152, The inflation lumen preferably communicates
   independently with each one of the plurality of balloons 154a, 154b, 154c, but is not so
 5 limited. In the inflated configuration, each of the balloons 154a, 154b, 154c is preferably in
   contact with portions of the internal wall VS of the vessel VW, thereby reducing the
   possibility thatthe plurality of balloons 154a, 154b, 154c will lose contact with the vessel
   VW and move or vibrate out of its preferred positioning as a result of partial perfusion of
   blood past the balloons 154a, 154b,      154c.
10  [01391      Referring to Figs, 15 and 16, a seventh preferred embodiment of an occlusion
   catheter system 200 has similarities to the sixth preferred embodiment of the occlusion
   catheter system 100 and like reference numerals are utilized to identify like features, with a
   "2" prefix utilized to distinguish the seventh preferred embodiment of the occlusion catheter
   system 200. The seventh preferred occlusion catheter system 200 includes multiple
15 occlusion balloons 254a, 254b, 254c formed by constraining the occlusion balloon 254 with
   restraining filaments 270a, 270b. The restraining filaments 270a, 270b provide flexibility in
    formation of the multiple occlusion balloons 254a, 254b, 254c as they may be shifted along
   the length of the occlusion balloon 254 to define or form multiple occlusion balloons 254a,
    254b, 254c having different sizes and shapes, depending on clinical need. The multiple
20  occlusion balloons 254a, 254b, 254c, similar to the balloons 154a,     154b, 154c of the sixth
    preferred embodiment, reduce the possibility that the plurality of balloons 254a, 254b, 254c
    will lose contact with the vessel and move or vibrate out of their preferred positioning as a
    result of partial perfusion of blood past the balloons 254a, 254b, 254c.
    [0140]       Referring to Figs. 17-19, an eighth preferred embodiment of an occlusion
25  catheter system 300 comprises a plurality of occlusion balloon strings 320 that may be
    utilized to replace any of the preferred occlusion balloons 140, 54, 54, 1240, 1240, 154a,
    154b, 154c, 254a, 254b, 254c described herein. The occlusion balloon strings 320 may also
    be connected to any of the preferred inflation catheter members 12, 52, 52', 1240b, 1240c,
    1240bI 1240c,      152, 252, without significantly impacting the function of the preferred
30  occlusion catheter system 300 of the eighth preferred embodiment.
    101411       In the eighth preferred embodiment, the occlusion balloon strings 320 include
    individual balloon strands 301, 302, 303 with multiple occlusion balloons mounted thereon
    along a length of the occlusion catheter system 300. The individual balloon strands 301,
    302, 303 are connected to a manifold 340, which is connected to an inflation catheter

   member 312. The manirold 344 includes multiple exit ports 340a, 340b, 340c, 340d that are
   associated with the balloon strands 301, 302, 303 to provide individual fluid communication
   with each of the balloon strands 301, 302, 303. The individual occlusion balloons on the
   balloon strands 301, 302, 303 are preferably, but not necessarily, staggered along the length
 5 of the occlusion catheter system 300 to maximize or facilitate seating and packing of the
   individual balloons in an inflated configuration. A stiffener member 312a preferably
   extends through and past the balloon strands 301, 302, 303 to structurally support the
   balloon strands 301, 302, 303 and a distal end (not shown) of the occlusion catheter system
   300, which preferably includes the atraumatic tip 450.
10 101421       In operation, the occlusion catheter system 300 of the eighth preferred
   embodiment is inserted into the vessel VW so that the balloon strands 301, 302, 303 are
   positioned in the vessel VW where occlusion or partial occlusion is desired. Fluid or gas is
   introduced into the balloon strands 301, 302, 303 to inflate the balloon strands 301, 302,
   303, including the individual balloons. The fluid is directed to the appropriate balloon
15 strands 301, 302, 303 by the multiple exit ports 340a, 340b, 340c, 340d in the manifold 340.
   The exit ports 340a, 340b, 340c, 340d may be selectively opened or closed to permit flow of
   the fluid or gas into the respective balloon strands 301, 302, 303, thereby inflating, partially
   inflating or not inflating the strands 301, 302, 303, respectively. When the balloon strands
   301, 302, 303 are in the inflated or partially inflated configuration, the individual balloons
20 pack or seat against each other to prevent resistance to the flow of blood through the vessel
   VW. At least portions of the individual balloons of the strands 301, 302, 303 are in contact
   with the inside surface VS of the vessel VW in the inflated configuration to secure the
   occlusion balloon strings 320 relative to the vessel VW while blood is partially perfusing
   through the vessel VW along the strings 320. The amount of resistance may be at least
25 partially controlled by the inflation of the strands 301, 302, 303, the number of strands 301,
   302, 303, the length of the strands 301, 302, 303, the shape of the individual balloons, the
   materials utilized to construct the strands 301, 302. 303, the number of strands 301, 302,
   303 that are inflated or partially inflated, and other factors related to the strands 301, 302,
   303 and the preferred occlusion catheter system 300. For full inclusion, the individual
30 balloons preferably pack tightly together to prevent blood flow through the vessel VW or
   are at least partially compliant to form to the shape of the vessel VW in the inflated
   configuration.

   The occlusion balloon 440 of the ninth preferred embodiment is constrained by longitudinal
   straps 470 that connect to an inflation catheter member 412, which may comprise any of the
   preferred inflation catheter members 12, 52, 52', 1240b, 1240c, 1240b', 1240c',     152, 252,
 5 without significantly impacting the function of the preferred occlusion catheter system 400
   of the ninth preferred embodiment. The longitudinal straps 470 constrain the inflation of
   the occlusion balloon 440, thereby creating blood flow channels (not shown) along the
   length of the occlusion balloon 440 in the inflated configuration to allow partial flow of
   blood past the occlusion balloon 440. The blood flow channels are formed between an
10 outer surface 443 of the balloon 440 and the inner surfaces VS of the vessel VW.

   The occlusion balloon 540 of the tenth preferred embodiment is preferably constrained by
15 compliant longitudinal straps 570 that connect to an inflation catheter member 512, The
   inflation catheter member 512 may be configured and constructed in the same or a similar
   fashion to any of the preferred inflation catheter members 12, 52, 52', 1240b, 1240c, 1240b,
    1240c', 152, 252 described herein, without significantly impacting the function of the
   preferred occlusion catheter system 500 of the tenth preferred embodiment. The
20 longitudinal straps 570 constrain inflation of the occlusion balloon 540, thereby creating
   blood flow channels along the length of the occlusion balloon 540 in the inflated or partially
   inflated configurations to allow partial flow of blood past the occlusion balloon 540 when
    inserted into the vessel VW.
    101451      Referring to Fig. 22, an eleventh preferred embodiment of an occlusion catheter
25 system 600 comprises an occlusion balloon 640 that may be utilized to replace any of the
   preferred occlusion balloons 140, 54, 54. 1240, 1240, 154a, 154b, 154c, 254a, 254b, 254c.
   The occlusion balloon 640 of the eleventh preferred embodiment is preferably constrained
    by a fiber constraint 670, such as a Nylon fiber, that connects to an inflation catheter
    member 612 on either end of the occlusion balloon 612. The inflation catheter member 612
30  may comprise any of the preferred inflation catheter members 12, 52, 52', 1240b, 1240c.,
    1240b', 1240c', 152, 252, without significantly impacting the function of the preferred
    occlusion catheter system 600 of the eleventh preferred embodiment. The fiber constraint
    670 constrains the inflation of the occlusion balloon 640, thereby creating a substantially
    spiral or arcuate blood flow channel along the length of the occlusion balloon 640 between

   catheter system 700 includes an occlusion balloon 740 with a spine 720 mounted
 5 longitudinally on an external balloon surface 740b. The twelfth preferred occlusion catheter
   system 700 has similar features to the first preferred occlusion catheter system 10 and
   similar reference numbers are utilized to identify similar features between the first and
   twelfth preferred embodiments, with a "7" prefix utilized to distinguish the features of the

10 preferably includes a distal catheter end 712c that is similar to or the same as the atraumatic
   tip 450 described in Figs. 4 and 5. The atraumatic tip of the twelfth preferred embodiment
   is, therefore, identified by reference number 7450 and relevant features of the atraumatic tip
   7450 are similarly numbered with the "7" prefix,

15 component attached to the external surface 740b of the occlusion balloon 740 with proximal
   and distal spine ends 720c, 720d stopping short of the proximal and distal balloon ends
   740c, 740d. The spine 720 of the twelfth preferred embodiment has a substantially constant
   spine diameter Ds based on its solid polymeric construction and is not configured for over
   driving and flattening, as was described above with the first preferred inflatable spine 20,
20 The spine 720 of the twelfth preferred embodiment is not limited to being substantially solid
   or to being constructed of a polymeric material. The spine 720 may alternatively be
   constructed of a balloon attached to the occlusion balloon 740 that is inflated concurrently
   or separately from the inflation of the occlusion balloon 740. The spine 720 may
   alternatively be constructed of a tube or hollow cylinder that is attached to the external
25 surface 740b that defines a channel through the tube in the inflated configuration, The
   preferred spine 720 is attached to the external surface 740b of the occlusion balloon 740 to
   prevents the occlusion balloon 740 from sealing against inner surfaces VS of the vessel wall
   VW within which the occlusion balloon 740 is inserted and inflated, The spine 720,
   therefore, creates leak paths or flow channels 721 along the vessel VW to permit blood flow
30 to pass the occlusion balloon 740 in the inflated configuration. In the twelfth preferred
   embodiment, a single spine 720 is mounted to the occlusion balloon 740, however, the
   single spine 720 is not limiting and the occlusion balloon 740 may include two or more
   spines 720 mounted on the external surface 740b to create more leak paths or flow paths
   721 within the vessel VW.

   connected to individual inflation ports (not shown) that permit individual inflation or
   deflation of the multiple balloon spines 820x, 820y, 820z by a medical technician or
20 physician or may all be in fluid communication with a single inflation port for inflation and
   deflation of the multiple balloon spines 820x, 820y, 820z and/or the occlusion balloon 840

   deflation or inflation and deflation in stages based upon how many inflation ports are
   included and their fluid communication with the multiple balloon spines 820x, 820y, 820z
25 and/or the occlusion balloon 840. The multiple balloon spines 820x, 820y, 820z define
   multiple flow channels or leak paths (not shown) in the inflated configuration, thereby

   flexible strap 1503 and the internal surfaces VS of the vessel VW in the inflated or partially
   inflated configuration of the occlusion balloon 1540. The flexible strap 1503 may also be
25 untensioned and lie on the external surface 1540b of the occlusion balloon 1540 such that
   the external surface 1540b of the occlusion balloon 1540 is positioned against the internal
   surface VS of the vessel VW to fully occlude the vessel VW. The medical technician or
   physician is therefore able to selective create full occlusion to various levels of partial
   occlusion of the vessel VW by applying various levels of tension to the flexible strap 1503.
30 101541       Referring to Figs. 29-29C, a sixteenth preferred embodiment of an occlusion
   catheter system 1600 includes an occlusion balloon 1640 with a twisting rod 1603 attached
   to the external balloon surface 1640b of the occlusion balloon 1640 and pivotably mounted
   in an inflation hub 1690. The sixteenth preferred occlusion catheter system 1600 has
   similar features to the first preferred occlusion catheter system 10 and similar reference

   numbers are utilized to identify similar features between the first and sixteenth preferred
   embodiments, with a "16" prefix utilized to distinguish the features of the sixteenth
   preferred embodiment, The sixteenth preferred occlusion catheter system 1600 also
   preferably includes a distal catheter end 1612c that is similar to or the same as the
 5 atraumatic tip 450 described in Figs. 4 and 5. The atraumatic tip 1612c of the sixteenth
   preferred embodiment is, therefore, identified by reference number 16450 and relevant
   features of the atraumatic tip 16450 are similarly numbered with the "16" prefix.
   [0155]      The twisting rod 1603 is preferably fixed and pivotably attached to the proximal
   portion of the catheter member 1612 and is positioned on and attached to the external
10 surface 1640b of the occlusion balloon 1640. A twisting rod handle 1681 is connected to a
   proximal end of the twisting rod 1603 that a medical practitioner or physician is able to
   manipulate to deform the external surface 1640b of the occlusion balloon 1640 toward the
   hypotube 1612a of the catheter member 1612 to deform the occlusion balloon 1640 and
   create or define flow channels or leak paths 1600x between the external surface 1640b of
15 the occlusion balloon 1640, the twisting rod 1603 and the internal surfaces VS of the vessel
   VW in the inflated or partially inflated configuration of the occlusion balloon 1640. The
   twisting rod 1603 may also be untensioned and lie on the external surface 1640b of the
   occlusion balloon 1640 such that the external surface 1640b    of the occlusion balloon 1640
   is positioned against the internal surface VS of the vessel VW to fully occlude the vessel
20 VW. The medical technician or physician is therefore able to selectively create full
   occlusion to various levels of partial occlusion of the vessel VW by applying various levels
   of tension to the twisting rod 1603.

   embodiment, the occlusion balloon 1740 is substantially compliant and the flow channel
    1700X is pre-formed at the periphery of the balloon 1750. The flow channel      I700X runs
30 along or substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis 1731 of the occlusion balloon 1740 to
   permit partial flow of blood past the occlusion balloon 1740. The seventeenth preferred
   occlusion balloon 1731 could me mounted to any of the preferred occlusion catheter
   systems described herein without significantly impacting the functions of the preferred
   systems.

   [01571        Referring to Figs. 32 and 33, in an alternative preferred embodiment of an
   occlusion balloon assembly may be utilized with any of the preferred occlusion balloon
   systems described herein, such as the first preferred occlusion balloon system 10, a balloon
   spine 20" is connected at domed portions at proximal and distal balloon ends 140c", 140d"
 5 of the occlusion balloon 1404. This alternative preferred occlusion balloon assembly has a

   assembly and the same reference numerals are utilized to identify the same or similar
   features, with a double-prime symbol (") utilized to distinguish this alternative preferred
   embodiment from the first preferred embodiment, The occlusion balloon 140" of this
10 alternative preferred embodiment includes attachment ports 141" in domed portions of the
   occlusion balloon 140" in the proximal and distal balloon ends 140c", 140d". The
   connections at the attachment ports 141" provide fluid flow channels into the spine 20" fiom
   the inside of the occlusion balloon 140" such that the spine 20" and occlusion balloon 140"
   fill at the same pressure during inflation and are likewise deflated to the same or similar
15 pressures. The attachment ports 141" may be integrally formed with the balloon 140" or
   may be comprised of mechanical or adhesive bonding of the spine 20" to the occlusion

   occlusion balloon 140"' for an occlusion balloon assembly that may be utilized with any of
20 the preferred occlusion balloon systems described herein, such as the first preferred
   occlusion balloon system 10. In this alternative preferred embodiment, the spine 20"' is
   connected substantially longitudinally to the external balloon surface 140b"' of the occlusion

   triple-prime symbol (') utilized to distinguish this further alternative preferred embodiment
   from the first preferred embodiment and the above-identified alternative preferred
   embodiment of Figs. 32 and 33. The occlusion balloon 140" of this further alternative
   preferred embodiment includes a longitudinal attachment port 141" that extends along a
30 length of the occlusion balloon 140"', at least where the occlusion balloon 140' would come
   into contact with the internal surfaces VS of the vessel VM. The connection of the spine
   20' to the occlusion balloon 140.' at the attachment port 141"' provides a fluid flow channel
   between the spine 20"' and the inside of the occlusion balloon 140"' such that the spine 20"'
   and occlusion balloon 140' fill at the same pressure during inflation and are likewise
                                                    46

   deflated to the same or similar pressures. The spine 20'" is shown in this further alternative
   preferred embodiment as having an oval-type shape, but is not so limited and may have
   nearly any shape that results in flow channels being formed in an inflated or partially
   inflated configuration to permit partial blood flow past the occlusion balloon 140', as was
 5 described in detail above.
   101591       Referring to Figs. 36 and 37, an eighteenth preferred embodiment of an
   occlusion catheter system 1800 includes an inflation catheter member 1812 with an
   occlusion balloon 1840 mounted thereto. The eighteenth preferred occlusion catheter
   system 1800 has similar features to the first preferred occlusion catheter system 10 and
10 similar reference numbers are utilized to identify similar features between the first and
   eighteenth preferred embodiments, with an "18" prefix utilized to distinguish the features of
   the eighteenth preferred embodiment and the features described in the eighteenth preferred
   embodiment may be utilized with any of the preferred embodiments described herein. The
   preferred occlusion catheter system 1800 may also include an inflatable spine 1820, as is
15 shown in Fig. 38.
   [01601       The eighteenth preferred occlusion catheter system 1800 includes additional
   components that can be used to electronically display pressures related to the occlusion
   procedure and manage occlusion with more precision and safety with the preferred system
   1800. The preferred occlusion catheter system 1800 includes micro-scale proximal and
20 distal pressure sensors or transducers 1871, 1870 to precisely monitor distal and proximal
   blood pressure when the occlusion balloon 1840 is inserted in the vessel VW and
   pressurized to partially or fully inflated configurations. The occlusion catheter system 1800
   also preferably monitors the internal pressure in the occlusion balloon 1840 with an internal
   balloon pressure sensor 1873. These pressure sensors 1870, 1871, 1873 can be used
25 independently for open-loop feedback or with a full-feedback controller device to manage
   the inflation and deflation of the occlusion balloon 1840,
   101611       In the eighteenth preferred embodiment, the proximal and distal electronic
   pressure sensors 1871, 1870 are incorporated or fixedly attached to the catheter 1812. The
   proximal pressure sensor 1871 is preferably fixed to the proximal portion of the catheter
30 member 1812 near the proximal end 1840c of the occlusion balloon 1840 and the distal
   pressure sensor 1870 is mounted to the atraumatic tip 1850 at the distal catheter end 1812c.
   The electronic pressure sensors 1871, 1870, 1873 are preferably comprised of micro-scale
   pressure transducers 1871, 1870, 1873 that can be incorporated into or fixedly attached to
   the catheter member 12. These pressure sensors 1871, 1870, 1873 can sense blood pressure
                                                   47

   distal and proximal to the occlusion balloon 1840, respectively and within the occlusion
   balloon 1840. The output of the sensors 1871, 1870, 1873 is preferably used to monitor
   patient blood pressure during procedures associated with the occlusion catheter system
   1800, The pressure sensors 1871, 1870, 1873 are not limited to placements, as shown in
 5 Figs. 36 and 37, and may be otherwise placed on the catheter member 1812 or the occlusion
   catheter system 1810 to sense pressures or other patient parameters that are utilized to
   monitor the related procedures. The catheter member 1812 also preferably includes
   occlusion balloon radiopaque markers 1881, 1882 near ends of the working portion of the
   occlusion balloon 1840 at transitions to the proximal and distal balloon ends 1840c, 1840d
10 so that a technician is able to visualize placement of occlusion balloon 1840 in the vessel
   VW using visualization techniques, such as X-ray or fluoroscopy.
   [01621      Referring to Figs. 36-39, in use, the eighteenth preferred occlusion catheter
   system 1800 is inserted at least partially into the vessel VW such that the occlusion balloon
   1840 is positioned at the preferred location. The preferred location may be monitored by
15 visualization techniques and location of the radiopaque markers 1881,       1882. The occlusion
   balloon 1840 is inflated to the partially or fully inflated configuration to provide partial or
   full occlusion of the vessel VW, depending on the treatment or physician preferences. The
   pressure sensors 1871, 1870, 1873 transmit signals to the controller 8 and the pressures are
   preferably displayed as pressure readings on a small display screen 1891 mounted to the
20 occlusion catheter system 1800 by a control hub 1890. The control hub 1890 is preferably
   mounted on the proximal portion of the catheter member 1812 and includes the integrated
   LCD screen 1891 to display the pressures from the pressure sensors 1870, 1871, 1873.
   101631       Monitoring the pressures displayed on the display screen 1891 allows the user to
   observe blood pressure responses to the various inflation configurations of the occlusion
25 balloon 1840, in real time and in a convenient location, as the pressurization of the
   occlusion balloon 1840 is modified. The positioning of the control hub 1890 with the
   display screen 1891 thereon is preferred, versus a vital monitor that may or may not be
   conveniently located relative to the procedure for observation by the technician or
   physician. The display of the pressures from the pressure sensors 1870, 1871, 1873 on the
30 display screen 1891, which may include a first display 1891 a, a second display 1891 b and a
   third display 1891 c, with a localized signal processor acts as a means for open-loop
   feedback of the occlusion catheter system 1800. The first display 1891 a may display the
   pressure inside the occlusion balloon 1840 from the internal balloon pressure sensor 1873,
   the second display 1891b may display the pressure proximally of the occlusion balloon
                                                    48

    1840 from the proximal pressure sensor 1871 and the third display 1891 c may display the
   pressure distally of the occlusion balloon 1840 from the distal pressure sensor 1870. The
   senor 1870, 1871, 1873 data may also be transmitted to a central processor in a wired or
   wireless manner for depiction, manipulation and/or processing. For example, the collected
 5 data may be wirelessly transmitted to a remote central processor for storage and depiction
   on a larger display, such as a television screen, tablet, vital sign monitor or related
   equipment for viewing by a larger audience, manipulation and recording or storage. The
   display 1891 may also include other collected data or calculated information for the user,
   such as a pressure ratio between the distal and proximal pressure sensors 1870, 1871, an
10 indication of the degree or percentage of occlusion based on an algorithm that uses the
   proximal and distal pressures to provide an approximation of the degree of occlusion. The
   degree of occlusion could be displayed as a percentage, on a scale, such as 175, as a dial
   gauge or in other manners that provide an estimation of the degree of occlusion to the user.
   101641      The control hub 1890 preferably includes the controller 8, a power source 1893,
15 a pump 1893 and a valve 1894 therein. The valve 1894 is preferably utilized to switch from
   a manual pressurization at the proximal catheter end 1812b to a mechanical pressurization
   technique utilizing the pump 1893. The power source 1892 is preferably comprised of a
   battery or batteries stored in the control hub 1890 and power the pump 1893 and the display
   screen 1891. The controller 8 may include a circuit board to process signals, make
20 calculations related to the collected data, control the operating components and perform
   related functions described herein.
   101651      In a non-limiting, preferred example, as conditions change within the patient
   with the occlusion balloon 1840 positioned in the vessel VW and in the partially or fully
   inflated configurations, the sensors 1870, 1871, 1873 provide passive feedback to the
25 practitioner to indicate the need for changes to the occlusion balloon's 1840 volume to
   manage blood pressure distal and proximal to the occlusion balloon 1840, If the occlusion
   balloon 1840 is inflated in a constricted vessel VW, occlusion may be lost as the vessel VW
   relaxes and the passive feedback can indicate to the practitioner that additional volume or
   pressure is required in the occlusion balloon 1840 to maintain occlusion.
30 101661      In an additional non-limiting example, the vessel VW may be partially occluded
   by forming the blood flow channels 21 to permit limited blood flow around the occlusion
   balloon 1840. This partial occlusion (pREBOA) is a dynamic scenario where the vessel
   VW is partially occluded, allowing some blood to flow past the occlusion balloon 1840.
   This partial flow pas the occlusion balloon 1840 creates pressures being sensed by both the
                                                   49

   proximal and distal pressure sensors 1871, 1870. In use, the distal pressure sensor 1870 is
   typically going to have the higher pressure, as it will be placed upstream in the arterial
   vessel VW and the proximal pressure sensor 1871 is typically going to have the lower
   pressure, as it is placed downstream in the arterial vessel VW past the occlusion balloon
 5  1840 in the blood flow. The pressure ratio, which may provide an estimation of the degree
   of occlusion of the vessel VW, of the occlusion catheter system 1800 in this situation is the
   outlet pressure or pressure at the proximal pressure sensor 1871 divided by the inlet
   pressure or pressure at the distal pressure sensor 1870. This partial occlusion configuration
   requires additional attention from the practitioner in response to the dynamic circulatory
10 system of the patient, As the patient responds to treatment, the amount of pressure or
   volume applied to the occlusion balloon 1840 needed to maintain a specified amount of
   partial occlusion will typically change. Passive feedback can be used to indicate to the user
   when manual adjustments are required in order to maintain the desired amount of partial
   occlusion desired. The occlusion catheter system 1800 may also utilize different sensors,
15 such as  flow, force, temperature or other sensors, to monitor this partial occlusion
   configuration to customize the flow for the patient and their condition or treatment. For
   example, the flow sensor may be utilized to determine how much blood flow is received by
   the patient's lower extremities when the occlusion balloon 1840 is positioned in the
   patient's aorta and a timer may be utilized to signal when additional blood flow to the
20 patient's lower extremities is required or preferred before the lower extremities are
   damaged. Typically, the required time is extended with greater blood flow and lowered
   with reduced or lowered blood flow.
   10167]      The controller 8 in the occlusion catheter system 1800 of the eighteenth
   preferred embodiment may be comprised of a small, mobile controller unit 8. The
25 controller 8 is not so limited and may be positioned remotely from the catheter member
   1812 and communicate through wired or wireless channels with the sensors 1870, 1871,
   1873. The controller 8 may also communicate with the pump 1893 to introduce pressurized
   fluid or withdraw fluid from the occlusion and balloon spines 1840, 1820. The controller 8
   is preferably connected to the pressure sensors 1870, 1871, 1873 and other sensors, as is
30 described herein, for management of the occlusion state of the occlusion balloon 1840 in a
   closed loop configuration (full feedback). The controller 8 can be set to maintain the distal
   and/or proximal pressures or the pressure ratio between the two by continually adjusting the
   volume or pressure of the fluid introduced into the occlusion balloon 1840 using the
   preferably small, internal, locally powered pump 1893. The controller 8 may be set to
                                                  50

    maintain the proximal pressure measured by the proximal pressure sensor 1871 at
    approximately zero when maintaining full occlusion and at a pressure greater than zero
    when maintaining partial occlusion through creation of the blood flow channels 21. For
    partial occlusion, the controller 8 is preferably set to manage the pressure ratio or a pressure
  5 ratio within a range, to maintain a user-specified amount of partial occlusion. The
    controller 8 may also be configured to permit the user to select a distal pressure setpoint that
    sets a desired pressure for the distal pressure sensor 1870, which Is typically the upstream
    side of the occlusion balloon 1840 when the system 1800 is positioned in the artery. The
    controller 8 preferably adjusts the occlusion balloon 1840 and/or the balloon spine 20
10  volume until the setpoint is achieved. The controller 8 may also be based on a proximal
    side setpoint associated with the proximal pressure sensor 1871 or a target degree of
    occlusion (i.e. a preferred percentage of occlusion or pressure ratio). The valve 1894 may
    be utilized to switch between a manual pressurization of the system 1800, wherein pressure
    is manually introduced and withdrawn by the user, such as with a syringe, and the above
15  described closed loop feedback configuration, wherein the controller 8 substantially controls
    the pressure within the occlusion and balloon spines 1840, 1820.
    [01681       The controller 8, the pressure sensors 1870, 1871, 1873 and any other sensors
    associated with the occlusion catheter system 1800 or any of the other herein described
    preferred occlusion catheter systems 10, 50, 50', 1240, 1240', 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700 may
20  include wireless communication transmitters that transmit sensed data to a central server
    (not shown) or to each other. The controller 8 or other sensors 1870, 1871, 1873 may be
    connected to each other or to the central server by Bluetooth or other wireless technology.
    The central server may be comprised of a handheld device, tablet, or other central processor
    that is able to display the sensed data, store the sensed data or otherwise manipulate the data
25  for immediate or later use. The data may be displayed at the central server in the same or a
    similar manner to the data depicted on the below-described display screen 1991 of the
    nineteenth preferred embodiment. The wireless protocol is preferably secured to prevent
    any unauthorized receipt of the data.
    [01691       Referring to Figs. 40-42, an alternative control hub 1990 in accordance with a
30  nineteenth preferred embodiment may be mounted or attached to any of the preferred
    occlusion catheter systems described herein. The alternative control hub 1990 and the
    related occlusion catheter system features shown in Figs. 40-42 have similarities to the
    control hub 1800 of the eighteenth preferred embodiment and the occlusion catheter system
    10 of the first preferred embodiment and the same reference numbers are utilized for the
                                                     51

   nineteenth preferred embodiment with a "19" prefix utilized to distinguish the features of
   the nineteenth preferred embodiment, The alternative control hub 1990 may be fixedly
   attached to the inflation catheter member 12 near its proximal catheter end 191 2b or may be
   removably attached thereto.
 5 101701       The display screen 1991 of the nineteenth preferred embodiment has a single or
   first display screen 1991 with multiple depictions thereon. The preferred display screen
    1991 shows a representation of the occlusion balloons 140, 140", 140", 54, 1240, 320, 540,
   440, 640, 740, 840, 1440, 1540, 1640, 1740, 1840 mounted to the catheter members 12, 52,
   52', 1244, 1244' 312, 412, 512, 612, 712, 812, 1412, 1512, 1612, 1712, 1812 of any of the
10 preferred embodiments with sensed pressure depicted at the proximal and distal portions of
   the occlusion balloons 140, 140", 140", 54, 1240, 320, 540, 440, 640, 740, 840, 1440, 1540,
    1640, 1740, 1840. The display screen 1991 also preferably shows a visual indication of
   occlusion level in the vessel VW. For example, the display screen 1991 of Fig. 40 shows a
   pressure of one hundred twenty millimeters of Mercury (120 mmHG) at the distal portion, a
15 pressure of twenty millimeters of Mercury (20 mmHG) at the proximal portion and a nearly
   full occlusion of the vessel VW, These particular depictions on the display screen 1991 are
   not limited to including or showing these features, but these preferred representations
   provide a quick visual reference to the technician to determine the amount of pressure loss
   resulting from the occlusion within the vessel VW. The visual depiction of the preferred
20 catheters and occlusion balloon with the distal and proximal pressures placed near the distal
   and proximal portions of the depicted occlusion balloon is intuitively readable and
   understandable for the medical technician when viewing the display screen 1991 during use.
   [0171]       In the nineteenth preferred embodiment, the control hub 1990 includes the
   controller or circuit board 8 therein that is powered by the power source or batteries 1992,
25 The controller 8 is preferably in communication with the proximal and distal pressure
   sensors positioned at proximal and distal sides ofthe occlusion balloon.
   101721       In an alternative nineteenth preferred embodiment, the display screen 1991' may
   include alternative visual representations of pressures, occlusion degree, controls and
   settings related to the occlusion catheter systems of the preferred embodiments described
30 herein. The alternative preferred embodiment of the display screen 1991' has similar
   features when compared to the nineteenth preferred display screen 1991 with a prime
   symbol (""')utilized to distinguish the alternative nineteenth preferred embodiment. The
   nineteenth preferred embodiment display screen 1991' includes the occlusion balloon and
                                                   52

    catheter member depictions with the inflatable spine attached thereto and pressure
    indications at the proximal and distal end portions.
     [01731      A degree of occlusion depiction is positioned between the pressure indications
    and a lower portion of the display screen 1991' includes controls, including "inflate,"
 5  "deflate," "manual," "manual + alert," "full auto" and a set point representation. The
    alternative preferred display screen 1991' is preferably a touch screen such that contacting
    the "inflate" and "deflate" depictions result in the preferred catheter system inflating or
    delating one or both of the occlusion balloon and the inflatable spine. The "inflate" and
    "deflate" depictions or buttons may immediately result in the controller 8 urging pressurized
10  fluid into or drawing fluid out of the preferred occlusion balloon 140 and inflatable spine
   20, respectively. The "manual" button results in the controller 8 not controlling the
   operation of the preferred system 10 and permitting manual inflation and deflation by the
    user or technician. The "manual + alert" button facilitates manual operation of the preferred
   occlusion catheter systems, but provides alerts depending on pre-set parameters, such as a
15  maximum internal pressure permitted for the occlusion balloon or inflatable spine,
    minimum pressure at the proximal end portion of the occlusion balloon or other pre-set
    parameters that, when exceeded result in a visual and/or audible alarm to notify the user or
   technician. The "full auto" button results in the controller 8 controlling operation of the
    preferred occlusion catheter system controlling the operation based on predetermined
20 schedules or programming. The display screen 1991' may also include a running time or
   clock indicating the amount of time that the occlusion balloon 140 is set at fully occlusion
   to provide an indication to the physician regarding potential ischemia to downstream tissue
   and organs in the patient's body. The controller 8 may be programmed to automatically
   urge the occlusion balloon 140 and the spine 20 to the partially occluded or partially inflated
25 configuration to provide blood flow to the downstream tissues and organs. The display
   screen 1991' may further include two clocks or timers, one showing the amount of time the
   system 10 spends in full occlusion and the amount of time the system 10 spends in partial
   occlusion.
    [01741       The mean arterial pressure ("MAP") setpoint below balloon provides an
30 indication of a setting indicating that the controller 8 will adjust the downstream or
   proximal portion pressure to maintain at the level of approximately twenty millimeters of
   Mercury (20 mmHg) in this particular configuration. The downstream pressure setpoint is
   not limited to twenty millimeters of Mercury (20 mmHg) and may be otherwise set based on
   physician and patient requirements, but is preferably set in a range of approximately fifteen
                                                   53

     to thirty millimeters of Mercury (15 - 30 mmHg). The controller 8, accordingly, adjusts the
     volume or pressure in the occlusion balloon 140, 140", 140"', 54, 1240, 320, 540, 440, 640,
     740, 840, 1440, 1540, 1640, 1740, 1840 and/or the spine 20, 20", 20"', 1820 until the
     proximal portion pressure is approximately twenty millimeters of Mercury (20 mmHg).
  5  Setting the proximal portion pressure to a predetermined pressure may be proportionally
     related to blood flow downstream of the occlusion balloon 140, which the physician may
     utilize to avoid ischemia to lower body organs and tissue during the preferred procedure.
     The controller 8 may concurrently or separately be configured or programmed to maintain
     the distal pressure from the distal pressure sensor 170 between ninety and one hundred fifty
10   millimeters of Mercury (90 - 150 mmHg) to prevent excessively high or low pressure on
     the upstream side of the occlusion balloon 140. The alternative preferred display screen
     1991' is not limiting and the display screen 1991' may be otherwise arranged or configured
    to provide useful visual information to the technician during use of the system.
     [01751       Referring to Figs. 41 and 43, the preferred systems may include a metallic center
15  rod 77 that is positioned in the hypotube lumen 15 of the stiffener member 1812a. The
    center rod 77 may be positioned in the hypotube lumen 15 when the hypotube lumen 15 is
    not being utilized for guidewires, pressure sensing or other functional reasons related to the
    preferred systems to prevent blood from pooling and clotting in the hypotube lumen 15,
    The preferred systems are not limited to including the center rod 77, the center rod 77 being
20  metallic and may function or be constructed of other materials without significant impact to

30  1512, 1612, 1712, 1812 and the skin facing surface 61 a facing or in facing engagement with
    the patient's skin. The base member 61 is preferably slidable along the catheter member 12
    so that the base member 61 can be moved away from an insertion puncture during insertion
    and then moved to a position proximate the puncture to anchor the catheter member 12 to
    the patient. The housing 62 is then snap fit or otherwise engaged to the base member 61 by

     the needle holder 63 and the operation handle 64 in an initial position (Figs. 46 and 48) in
     the housing slot 62a, In the initial position, a needle tip 65a is positioned within and
     covered by the housing 62 to prevent or reduce the likelihood of inadvertent needle sticks.
  5  The needle 65 also has a needle base end 65b that is securely mounted to the operation
     handle 64.
     [01821      The assembled base member 61, inflation catheter member 12 and needle
     housing 62 may be mechanically secured together by fasteners, clips, adhesive bonding or

 10  assembled catheter securing mechanism 60 is moved to a position close to the puncture in
     the patient and the skin facing surface 61 a is placed on the patient's skin near the puncture.
     The user then grasps the operation handle 64 and urges the movable needle holder 63 and
    the needle 65 in an arcuate motion along the housing slot 62a. The tip 65a of the needle 65
    pierces the patient's skin as the needle 65, needle holder 63 and operation handle are guided
15  to the secured position (Fig. 47) by the housing slot 62a. The needle 65 secures the
    assembly to the patient's skin to prevent or limit movement of the catheter member 12, 52,

20  the secured position, the tip 65a is positioned in an end slot 62b that covers the tip 65a and
    prevents or limits potential needle pricks. The arcuate-shape of the needle 65 facilitates
    movement along the housing slot 62a and extension of the needle 65 out of the needle
    housing 62 into the patient's skin in the secured position.
    [01831       Following completion of the procedure, the user grasps the operation handle 64
25  and moves the operation handle 64, the needle holder 63 and the needle 65 from the secured
    position back to the initial position, guided by the housing slot 62a. The user is then able to
    remove the catheter securing member 60 from the catheter member 12, 52, 52', 1244, 1244',
