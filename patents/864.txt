10                                                STATE OF THE ART
   There              are           numerous       marine      vehicles        for    moving         about
   underwater                    at     shallow     depths,     making      use   of    fins,      pedal
   driven             propellers,              etc.    for   human     propulsion,         or   electric
   motors,                combustion          engines,      etc.    for motorized          propulsion,
15 or towing.
   To move about underwater at greater depths, a watercraft is
   known             from          the     prior    art    that    is     the    object      of    patent
   application                      FR   2   951   134.    This   device      and   its     variations
   have the following main features:
20              When             the       watercraft       is    submerged,        the       submerged
                         structure            is    at     least      1.5     meters       underwater,
                         requiring the use of breathing apparatus                           (SCUBA);
                The         speed        when   the   watercraft       is   out   of    the    water     is
                         limited to 12 knots;
25              The          autonomy         of    the    watercraft        when    underwater          is
                         limited            because     of     the     need     for      a    breathing

                The size of the craft.
   Also known from the prior art is a watercraft for exploring
   the         seabed that                 is   the     object        of patent     application         AU2007
   234478. This                         document           relates         to     a     pleasure          craft
 5 comprising                      a     submersible           support        and     a     mechanism        for
   raising                   and         lowering          the        support. The           mechanism        as
   described                    is     a    rotating-arm             system     and    the      support      can
   therefore                   be     submerged         in    the      water   or   raised        out   of   the
   water             by        deployment           of      the      rotating      arms. This          device,
10 including                     the        submersible             support       and       mechanism,        is
   incorporated                        into     the      vessel. Such           a   device         makes     the
   vessel             quite           cumbersome         when      in    storage.    In     addition,       such
   an      exploration                   watercraft         must       be equipped       with     a   suitable
   exploration                     device that is             integrated with           it.    In   addition,
15 this          watercraft                 is   particularly             suitable      for     diving      with
   air tanks;                    this type of diving is not suitable for everyone
   and requires long preparation for the user.
   There              is          therefore           a     need        for    systems         for     surface
   exploration                     with      fins    and     snorkel,        also   called       snorkeling,
20 for inexperienced divers in particular.
   The         present               invention       is     proposed        to overcome         some    of   the
   disadvantages of the prior art.
                                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   In       a     first            aspect,       the     invention         relates      to    a   device     for
25 exploring                   the      ocean      space,        intended       to   be     attached       to  a
   vessel, the exploration device comprising:
    -     a       support               able     to      receive         one   or   more        users     in   a
   recumbent position
    -     deployment                    means,      said       deployment         means       enabling       the
30 positioning                      of    the    support        in     a  given    position        under     the
   10080367_1 (GHMatters)P100041.AU.1

                                                                    3
   water, such that when the support is in said given position
   under            the          water       said       one       or   more         users       can     lie     on   the
   support while being partially immersed
    -    securing                 means      for maintaining                   the    support        in     the   given
 5 position under the water.
   It      will           become           apparent         in     the     following           description          that
   certain                  embodiments               of      the      invention              provide         numerous
   advantages.
   With          such          a      device,      it     is     possible          to    snorkel        without      any
10 training. Those                          who       cannot         dive         very        far     for      medical
   reasons                will          be   able       to     explore           the     seabed.       This      device
   also          has the               advantage         of    freeing          the user's          hands      so that
   he      or she can                    collect       samples        or      take photos           or movies        for
   example.                The        use    of   such        a    device        protects         the     diver     from
15 the          ocean             due      to   the        support          that        is     carrying        him    or
   her.         In        addition,           the       support        is       pulled        by   the      vessel    to
   which            it        is       attached.        The      user       is     therefore         pulled       along
   and          carried               by    the      support          which        serves        as     a    means    of
   transportation. The                             device           therefore              does       not      require
20 physical                 effort          for   moving          about        at    the      desired        direction
   and         speed.            When      the device            is   not       deployed,         phases       of   fast
   cruising are possible in order to travel to the location to
   be       explored                  for    example,           and     its       deployment           then      allows
   phases             of       underwater           exploration              in    front       of   and below the
25 craft, especially in shallow waters,                                            from the craft.
   In       preferred                  embodiments            of     the      device         for    exploring        the
   ocean           space according                    to the         invention,            one    or more        of the
   following arrangements may be used:
                -      it       is      attached         to     a   vessel         partially          submerged       in

   exploring                    the      ocean    space      (immediately        accessible,      for
15 exploring                     0    to    30   meters       down    or     more     depending    on
   visibility) intended to be attached to                                  a vessel. The vessel
   is      motor-driven                   for   example.     The   propellers        of   the  vessel
   must be equipped with propeller protection and an emergency
   stop             control,               accessible        from     the      lowered       immersed
20 position.                   This       device   allows       surface      immersion      of  users
   equipped                 with       simple   breathing       means    (mask and       snorkel  for
   snorkeling)                      to   allow    visual     exploration        of    the   ocean  in
   comfort                 and        autonomy.     As    a    variant,       the    device    allows
   deeper immersion.

   The          device                for    exploring      the     ocean    space     comprises          a
   support                T,      deployment        means    for positioning        the    support        T
   in a given position under the water, and securing means bl,
   b2,         Y,     b,       that      maintain     the    support    in  said    given position
15 under            the          water. The         given     position     under     the    water       is
   close to the underwater portions of the vessel.
   Vessels                 on       which      the   exploration        device     can    easily        be
   installed are generally small to medium boats with electric
   motors                or        combustion        engines,        equipped     with      propeller
20 protection                    and      an   emergency      stop    control.   It    can     also     be
   adapted for larger vessels.
   Such vessels travel to the exploration sites by their usual
   mode           of          operation,           with    the     exploration       device       in      a
   position                  out       of   the    water.   At    the  exploration       sites,       the
25 user deploys the device for exploring the ocean space.
   The         exploration                 device    allows     obtaining     a general        view     of
   the ocean space under optimal conditions of user safety and
   comfort,                 while        respecting      the    ocean    environment.      It    easily
   accommodates                         one     or   more      passengers,       making         snorkel

                                                                     13
   beneath, between, or at the sides of the                                                 submerged portions
   of the vessel.
   The         water            exploration              device         is     fast     and     easy     to    install
   and         uninstall                 on     the    vessel.         Any      appropriate         means       can     be
 5 provided                 for         attaching          the     exploration            device      in    a    simple
   and         reversible                 manner        to     an existing            vessel,      in     particular
   by         clipping                  it      on.    The       exploration            device        comprises           a
   support                 T      and        a     deployment           means        C,    H    that      is     light,
   removable, and transportable.
10 The         deployment                  means        C,    H therefore              allows      changing          from
   the no-snorkeling fast cruising configuration                                                   of the vessel
   to          which               the         device          is      attached,            to     the       deployed
   configuration of said vessel which allows snorkeling.
   The device is intended to be attached to a vessel partially
15 immersed                 in       the      water      and      partially          above      the    water.        When
   said          exploration                    device       is     mounted        on     said    vessel        on     the
   water            and         when         said      support         T    is    in     said     given      position
   under          the water C1,                      said deployment              means      C,   H is     partially
   immersed                 and         partially          above        water,        said     support       T    is    at
20 least partially immersed water, and the device is therefore
   immersed                  to       a    depth       P    in      said       given      position        under        the
   water           C1 ,        said         immersion           depth       P   being       determined          by     the
   geometric                   characteristics                   of      the     deployment         means        C,     H,
   said depth P being about the thickness of a human being.
25 One         possible                 embodiment          of     the      device       for    exploring          ocean
   space           is       shown          in     figure       1   in    a deployed          configuration,             in
   front of and below                               the underwater portions                     of   a vessel,          in

   The         guiding               system       H of the          deployment         means       may    consist,
   for          example,               of     two       bearings        H    fixed        to    the      port    and
   starboard                      sides         of       the       vessel,          allowing           rotational
   deployment                     of      the      exploration           device        as      illustrated        in
 5 Figure             1.       Advantageously,                 these     bearings         H may be         made   of
   aluminum                  coated          with       Teflon,        nylon,        or      a    composite. In
   another                embodiment              particularly           suitable          for    vessels       with
   standard                 inflatable            or    semi-rigid tubes,               the guiding system
   H can be                  attached          to     the vessel         by    integrated arcuate               pads
10 adapting                 to       the    shape       of    the    inflatable           tubes.      In   another
   embodiment,                      the     guiding         system      H of       the      deployment        means

   ties, bearings, and/or clips.
25 When          the         support          T    is    deployed under            the     vessel,         the user
   may be positioned on or above the support T, and preferably
   is      in      an        advantageous              position protected                from below by the
   support               and        from above           by the proximity               of the vessel.            The
   user is partially immersed and snorkeling is possible.
30 Another                embodiment,                suitable        for    flat-bottomed              boats     such
   as an           inflatable                 dinghy      for example,           is     shown       in   Figure 3.

   For this type of vessel, the support T is deployed entirely
   below              and          in        front      of      the     submerged        portion           of     the
   vessel. When the vessel has                                    inflatable tubes B, the guiding
   system              H       is      advantageously               attached       to    the     vessel         with
 5 arcuate pads.
   In          another                embodiment,             the     bars      or    frames         C     of     the
   deployment                    system are            adjustable          via   an   adjustable            sleeve
   coupling system.
   In       another               embodiment,             the     exploration        device       is     attached
10 to      a catamaran                     with     inflatable          or   composite        hulls.       In   this
   embodiment,                     the       deployment         means     C,   H of the        catamaran          are
   for         example              the       same    as     for    a monohull.        However,         they      are
   attached                    for        example          to     the      front      crossbeam            of     the
   catamaran                     and        the      rear       attachment         of    the       support          is
15 achieved                 using ropes              that      attach      to each     hull     to     cleats       at
   the         rear          of       the      vessel.      The     support      T may       be   attached          to
   its frame by bolt rope, sleeve-coupling, or lashing.
   If       the         device            is     attached        to    bearings      or    hasps,        rotation
   will           be         possible              for     its      deployment; depending                  on     the
20 initial                position              of   the      device      above     the    water,         it    will
   rotate                 from           45      to      270      degrees. It          is      not       deployed
   vertically                    but 45 degrees                forward.      The   rotation is           assisted
   and          secured               by     a   pulley       and     cleat     system      that      allows        an
   almost             instantaneous                   conversion         from    a   raised      position           of
25 the           support               to      an     immersed         position,        as     well        as     the
   maintaining of the support in a stable immersed position.
   In      another                embodiment,            as     shown    in    Figure     4,    the     frame       of
   the trampoline support T can be immersed by a translational
   movement,                    for       example         vertical,         of   the    trampoline             frame
30 relative                 to       the      vessel,       supported        by   the    front       structural
   crossbeam                    PL. The           translational            movement       is     structurally

   guaranteed                     down     to      a    given       shallow        depth. An        embodiment
   with more than two structural crossbeams is also possible.
   In      another               embodiment,            the    device      may be installed              between
   the two floats of a catamaran.
 5 In          another                 embodiment,            the        device         may     replace         the
   trampoline of the multihull.
   A       remote                 control         system         may      be     installed,          to     allow
   controlling                       the   vessel         from       the     deployed         device     in     the
   immersed                  position.           The      remote        controls          for   the    electric
10 motor             or         combustion            engine         M    are      implemented         as      rods
   mounted                on      gimbals;        starting/stopping                and     acceleration         are
   obtained                 by        rotation,         orientation          is      obtained      by    pulling
   and           pushing. For                  safety,           an      emergency          handle      may      be
   provided                 for making            emergency          stops,      as    well    as   protection
15 on the propeller or propellers of the vessel.
   Such an extension of the                                control system              (Figure 5) allows a
   user          to        continue          to     control        the     motorized         vessel     when     in

   complete                  autonomy. Advantageously,                         the       extension       of     the
20 control                system          consists         of    a     direction         control     A   and     an
   acceleration                       and   start/stop            control       B.     In   one   embodiment,
   the extension                       of  the       control        system      comprises,        among     other
   things,                a     connection           between         the    throttle         and   the    remote
   control                 achieved          by      attachment           via      a     sleeve-coupling           X
25 secured                by       a    screw,        a   distal        handle        m,    an   intermediate
   handle             m',        and     a gimbal         k.   Handle m'          therefore       occupies       an
   intermediate                       position on          the     rod.    The two         handles m and m'
   enable the                    diver     to     control        the vessel           at multiple        levels,
   for         example               when    lying       at    the      front      of     the   support       T  by

   Said           metal               structures          C    provide          a    frame     to      which       the
   support                T      is      attached.         The     structures           C   can    be     made       of
   aluminum or                      stainless         steel.       The     support       T is    the      location
   where            the         user       lies.      Two     elongate          floats      f  are      attached,
15 one on each                      side of       the support            T.    They     retain the user on
   the         support,               preventing          the     user      from lateral         movement          and
   giving the system greater stability.
   Attachment                    of      the     metal      structure         C to      the    vessel       can      be
   achieved in several ways.
20 For a monohull vessel,                              the structure C may be retained by a
   sleeve attached to the topside of the vessel. The structure
   C may            have           a perpendicular               extension           which    penetrates           the
   topside of the vessel.                               In   this      case,       nuts    and a pin may be
   used          to        secure          it,    for      example.         Finally,        the    structure           C
25 may be attached                         by a bearing H,                hasps,       or ties       (Figures        6,

   installed                   on      the     vessel.       For     inflatable          boats       (Figure       9),
   the bearing                      H or       hasp    is    attached          to    an   arcuate       pad.     This

   As in           the previous                   embodiments,             a remote      control      system can
   be      implemented                    for      controlling            the    vessel    from a       recumbent
   position,                   and        all      the       above      variants       of    these       modes       of
15 control                 can        be      applied         to    this       embodiment       and      the     ones
   below.
   In       a     variant               embodiment             of   the      invention,       represented            by
   Figures                 11,         12,       13      and     14,      the     underwater         exploration
   device              attached               to     a    vessel        forms      a   "beluga"-type           craft
20 which            is        a      fast       craft        for    surface        exploration         which       can
   instantly                    be       converted            into       a    craft     for    exploring           the
   immediate area below the water.
   The         device             comprises             a   cradle       N attached        to   a vessel.          The
   cradle             N constitutes                    the     support       T of    said device.          Shaft       H
25 is         a      support               and        rotation          shaft      transfixing          the      rear
   portion                of       the       cradle        N.    The      cradle     N pivots         about      this
   shaft           H.        This         pivotal         movement          allows     the    cradle       to    move
   from          the         raised           position          PH   of     the    cradle     (Figure        12)     to
   the         lowered              position            PB    of   the      cradle     (Figure      11).     In    the
30 lowered                position             PB     of    the    cradle,        the    front     part     of     the

                                                                  24
   cradle             N is            sufficiently           immersed         to    place    the   user    in    a
   position                 for        underwater          exploration,            equipped     with    only     a
   mask          and         snorkel.            The    user    is,      for     example,      lying    on    the
   cradle N. The user thus has direct and visual access to the
 5 underwater                    area       in    front of       and beneath           him or    her.   In    the
   raised              position                PH    of    the     cradle        N,    the    user    is,     for
   example,                 sitting            on    the    seat     S    of    the    cradle    N,    and    the
   craft can cruise more quickly to the exploration site.
   The         lowered position                       PB   therefore         corresponds       to   the   given
10 position                 under          the     water      C1,     and      the    raised    position       PH
   corresponds to the given position out of the water C 2 .
   In       both            positions,               raised       PH    and      lowered      PB,    the    user
   remains                in      control          of    the   propulsion           and    steering     of    the
   craft. Remote control can be provided by a push-pull system
15 for           both            the         direction         and       for       shifting      speeds       and
   accelerating.                       The      controls       are     the      same    regardless      of    the
   type          of         use,         whether         the    user       is     out    of   the    water     or
   immersed                   at        the       surface       of     the       water      with    mask      and
   snorkel. The                             craft           therefore               provides          complete
20 functionality,                        allowing the user to move quickly                         from above
   the water                   to      immediate         underwater          observation,        by   lowering
   the          front            part        of    the     cradle       N.     The    cradle     N   may,     for
   example,                  be       provided          with     a    handlebar         D.    The    handlebar
   gives            the          user        something        to    hold       on   to,    as   well    as    for
25 example a means of activating the controls and steering. In
   the lowered position PB                                the seat        S    of the cradle        N and the
   handlebar D are for example submerged.
   The          craft             is      powered         by   either          an    outboard      combustion
   engine or by an electric motor.
30 The vessel                    to which           the device         is     attached      comprises     hulls
   K,           the           hulls            K     having        inner         sidewalls        and     outer

                                                                 25
   sidewalls.                   The      cradle      N is,        for     example,         attached        between
   the hulls                   K of the vessel                and therefore            pivots      on    its    rear
   shaft,               submerging              its     front        part. The           structure          of    the
   cradle               N       is,       for     example,          in     contact         with      the       inner
 5 sidewalls                     of      the     hulls        K.     The      vessel         comprises,           for
   example,                 two hulls           K   and      the    cradle       N is      attached        between
   these two hulls K.
   The cradle                    N attached          between        the two hulls             K is     always in
   contact with the water whether it is in the raised position
10 PH or lowered position                              PB.     When     in   the      raised     position         PH,
   together with                       the two       lateral        hulls      K   it    forms     a gullwing
   shaped             monohull.             The    time       required        to    raise      and    lower       the
   device              is       therefore          reduced        by     the     shortened        distance         to
   the         water.            The      position        of     the     person        steering       is      almost
15 instantly changed to a view of the ocean space.
   The          cradle              N    contributes           to    the    buoyancy          of    the       vessel
   comprising the two lateral hulls K.
   The hulls                   K of       the    vessel        and    the    structure         of   the       cradle
   N,       which             is      in     contact       with      the     inner        sidewalls          of   the
20 hulls              K,           may       be     formed         for      example           of     composites
    (polyester,                     epoxy,      glass      fiber       or   carbon        or   kevlar)         or  be
   rotationally molded. The weight of the craft may range from
   approximately                       90    to   120     kilograms         excluding          the    engine       or
   motor, depending on the materials.
25 The         boat          also         comprises        two     structural           crossbeams           P  that
   connect and retain the hulls K                                    (Figures 13 and 14).
   Advantageously,                         the    movement        mechanism           of   the    cradle        N is
   simple.               It       is     hinged     on     a    transverse          shaft      H transfixing
   the           rear             end       of    the        cradle        N.     This        shaft        may     be
   10080367_1 (GHMatters)P100041.AU.1

                                                                26
   symmetrically                        attached       to     the    rear     portions        of    the   inner
   sidewalls of the hulls K.
   The         cradle             N is         sealingly       attached       to     each     hull    K  via    a
   sealing               attachment               between     the    transfixing          shaft     H and the
 5 cradle              N,        and      possibly       a     sealing      attachment          between      the
   shaft            H       and         each      hull    K    if    the    shaft        H   traverses       the
   structure of each hull K.
   There           are          a     plurality        of    possible       technical         arrangements,
   however,                   to        avoid       piercing        the     hulls        K    and     creating
10 possible                  vulnerabilities                in    their      buoyancy. The             shaft    H
   may, for example, be supported by the hulls K, which shifts
   it      upwards                to be         supported      by   the    gunwale        of   the hulls      K.
   In      this           case,         the rear       shape      of the cradle            N is    adapted to
   this solution, and may for example be raised to accommodate
15 the higher                    attachment           of  the     shaft.     It    is    also    possible     to
   attach             the         shaft         transfixing        the    cradle       N to     the    hulls    K
   with plates that are parallel to the inner sidewalls of the
   hull          K,        said        plates       being      attached       to    the     gunwale     of   the
   hulls K. It is also possible,                                   for example, to have a system
20 of clips                 in      the shape         of an     inverted        U,    which are       attached
   to          the           hulls           K     and     to     which        the      shaft       would     be
   attached. Other                            solutions        that      support         the      transfixing
   shaft           H in           order         to  avoid piercing           the      hulls     are possible
   but         will          not       be     described       here.    Thus      the    front      portion    of
25 the cradle                    can      swing downward           and be       submerged        by about     40
   centimeters,                       allowing        the     user     to   be     properly        positioned
   for underwater observation.
   The           device               comprises,          in      addition         to      the     cradle     N,
   deployment                    means        C,   H and     securing means            bl,    b2,   Y,   b.  The
30 front portion of the cradle is                                   supported by a hoist C. Said
   hoist           C provides                  the   connection         between        the    front     portion

   of       the           cradle          and     the     front     crossbeam          P    connecting           the
   hulls          of the craft.                  The guiding          system H is          the transfixing
   shaft             in         this        embodiment. These               two      elements         form       the
   deployment                         means        C,       H     of        the       device          in        this
 5 embodiment. Actuating                             the      hoist     C    will      either        raise       the
   front portion                       of    the cradle         N or     allow it        to    descend under
   its         own weight                and    stabilize        at the        chosen depth,           which is
   about 40 centimeters from the surface.
   Securing                 means        bl,    b2,      Y,   b for      securing        the     cradle        N in
10 the         lowered               position        PB    are   provided         in    order      to     prevent
   the         relative               movement        of the      cradle       N with       respect         to   the
   vessel              and         thus      improve        the    stability          of    the     craft.       The
   securing                 means        may be       implemented          for example          by a tubular

   to        allow             varying          the      depth      of     the      cradle       N.     In      this
   embodiment,                     the     lowered        position       PB     can    correspond           to   the
   given position under the water C1 and the raised position PH
   can correspond to the given position above the water C 2 .
20 Advantageously,                        the first         deployment         means     C,    H also allows
   moving the                    support       T between         the position out               of the water
   C2     and         the        given       position        under     the water         C1 ,   the     securing
   means            bl,           b2,     Y,     b,     maintaining          the      support        T     in    the
   position out of the water C2 .
25 It is desirable that the weight of the cradle N is neutral,
   meaning that the cradle N cannot sink nor can it float atop
   the           water. This                  is      achievable           for      example        by       adding
   polystyrene                          to         the         structure             of        the          cradle
   itself.               Furthermore,              the    front portion            of   the     cradle       is   V
30 shaped             for better              wave penetration.               It    also    has     flanges       on
   its sides which are an integral part of the cradle and rest

   against the                      inner   sidewalls    of the hulls       K.   This   serves    to
   keep          the         cradle       N more    stable   in    the   raised    position      PH,
   but also prevents splashing.
   The cradle comprises, for example, a seat S.
 5 The         craft            as     described   in   Figures     11,   12,    13,  and    14   is
   provided                  for      one   user.  However,     it   is   possible     to   expand
   the         cradle             N    so  that   other   users     can   make    use   of   it   as
   well. The craft is therefore intended for one or more users
   depending on its width.
10 The           device               can   easily    be    mounted      on    the    vessel      by
   assembling                      the    shaft   thereto,      on    each     side,    and     then
   connecting                    the    front portion     of   the    cradle    N to   the    hoist
