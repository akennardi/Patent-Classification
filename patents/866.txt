                   METHOD FOR OPERATING A HEARING AID
Field
[0001] The invention relates to a method for operating a hearing aid that comprises at least one
first input converter, a second input converter, and at least one output converter, wherein the
first input converter generates a first input signal from an acoustic signal of the surroundings,
and the second input converter generates a second input signal from the acoustic signal, and,
based on a number of signals that are derived from the first input signal and the second input
signal, an output signal is formed which is converted, at least by the output converter of the
hearing aid, into an acoustic signal.
Background
[0002] The handling of conversational situations represents one of the key problems in the use
of hearing aids. This is due to the fact that, first of all, important information is often conveyed
to the user of a hearing aid in a personal conversation. Solely for the purpose of preferably
reliable transmission of information, particular importance must be accorded to the intelligibility
of speech for the user of a hearing aid. On the other hand, the intelligibility of speech is often
impaired by the fact that typical conversational situations are superimposed with a high
proportion of ambient noise and interfering noise, which may be the case, for example, in a
conversation among several conversation partners who do not speak in turn one after the other,
or during a conversation between two persons in an enclosed space in which other groups of
persons are contributing to an elevated noise level due to their own conversations (so-called
"cocktail party" listening situation).
[0003] To improve the intelligibility of speech in the signal of a conversation partner, a
directional microphone algorithm is frequently used in modem hearing aids, via which a narrow
directional cone is oriented in the front direction of the user. Since in conversations between two
persons, the conversation partners are usually frontally facing one another, for example sitting or
standing opposite one another, such a directional cone, as a filter for the input signals of the
hearing aid, results in the speech signal of the frontal conversation partner being amplified,
while noises that originate from some other direction are greatly suppressed.

                                                     2
[0004] However, such a procedure, which is common for many hearing aids, in particular
binaural hearing aids, may not provide satisfactory results when the user of the hearing aid is
having a conversation with several conversation partners in loud surroundings, so that
background noises must be suppressed with respect to more than one speaker. To obtain a
maximally intelligible signal of the particular conversation input, the user of the hearing aid
would always have to immediately turn his/her head to the conversation partner speaking at that
moment, since otherwise, that person's conversation input would be attenuated by the frontally
oriented directional cone. However, this is not actually achievable in practice. An alternative
approach would be simply to broaden the directional cone with which the surrounding noises are
filtered from the input signals, when such a fairly complex conversational situation is
recognized. However, this would result in an increased proportion of background noise in the
input signals to be processed, corresponding to the broadening, thus impairing the signal-to
noise ratio.
[0005] Furthermore, there may also be listening situations in which the user, due to the spatial
orientation of the conversation partner(s), is not able or cannot be expected to continuously
direct his/her viewing direction away from the front direction of his/her body toward a
conversation partner in order to orient the directional cone.
[0006] An object of the invention, therefore, is to provide a method for operating a hearing aid
with which the best possible signal-to-noise ratio may be achieved for a plurality of useful
signals that originate from spatially separate useful signal sources, to ameliorate one or more
disadvantages of existing arrangements or to at least provide the public with a useful choice.
Summary
[0007] According to the invention, there is provided a method for operating a hearing aid that
comprises at least one first input converter, a second input converter, and at least one output
converter, wherein the first input converter generates a first input signal from an acoustic signal
of the surroundings, and the second input converter generates a second input signal from the
acoustic signal, wherein a first direction is associated with a first useful signal source, and a
second direction is associated with a second useful signal source that is spatially separate from
the first useful signal source, wherein, based on the first input signal and the second input signal,
a first directional signal oriented in the first direction and a second directional signal oriented in

                                                     3
the second direction are formed, and wherein, based on the first directional signal and the
second directional signal, an output signal is formed which is converted into an acoustic signal
by the output converter of the hearing aid. Advantageous embodiments and refinements, which
in part are inventive on their own, are discussed in the subclaims and in the following
description.
[0008] In general, an input converter encompasses an acoustoelectric converter, for example a
microphone, that is configured for generating a corresponding electrical signal from an acoustic
signal. In general, an output converter encompasses an acoustoelectric converter, for example a
loudspeaker or a sound generator for bone conduction, that is configured for generating a
corresponding acoustic signal from an electrical signal. A spatial separation of the first useful
signal source from the second useful signal source encompasses in particular a spatial separation
within the scope of the resolution capability of the hearing aid. This means in particular that the
first useful signal source and the second useful signal source have different polar angles with
respect to a front direction of the hearing aid, wherein in particular the hearing aid is configured
for forming two directional signals having a corresponding angular difference; i.e., the distance
between the polar angles of the useful signal sources may be mapped by the directional signals
to be oriented thereto in each case. A directional signal is understood to mean a signal which for
a reference sound of a reference sound source has a particularly high sensitivity in a certain
angular range, and which for a configuration of the reference sound source outside the given
angular range has a significantly reduced sensitivity to the reference sound. In particular, for a
given central angle the directional signal may have a maximum in its sensitivity to the reference
sound, wherein the sensitivity to the reference sound decreases with increasing angular distance
from the central angle.
[0009] The association of a first direction with the useful signal source and/or an association of
a second direction with the second useful signal source may take place in particular based on a
plurality of directional signals. In particular, directional signals may be formed from the first
input signal and the second input signal, the sensitivity maxima of the directional signals being
oriented in each case in different spatial directions. Based on signal components or acoustic
variables in the individual directional signals derived therefrom, a direction is then assigned to
the first useful signal source as a first direction, and is assigned to the second useful signal
source as a second direction, for which one of the directional signals has a sensitivity maximum.
The directional signals, which correspond to the first direction and to the second direction and

                                                    4
are used for localizing the first useful signal source and the second useful signal source, are then
directly further used as the first directional signal and as the second directional signal.
[00010] A formation of the output signal based on the first directional signal and the second
directional signal is understood in particular to mean that the first directional signal and the
second directional signal are directly used as input variables in the signal processing that is
specific for the hearing aid, wherein the output signal is the resulting signal of the signal
processing that is specific for the hearing aid.
[0010] The formation of the output signal based on the first directional signal and based on the
second directional signal allows, for a first useful signal that is generated by the first useful
signal source and for a second useful signal that is generated by the second useful signal source,
the signal-to-noise ratio to be improved, in that interfering noises that originate in particular
from an angular range between the first useful signal source and the second useful signal source
may be appropriately suppressed by the first directional signal and also by the second directional
signal, and thus are not included in the output signal to a noticeable degree. In particular, for a
user of the hearing aid this improves the quality of the output signal with regard to surrounding
noise that is included in the first input signal and the second input signal when the user is in a
conversation with more than one conversation partner, and the conversation is accompanied by
background noise. Two conversation partners are identified as the first useful signal source and
the second useful signal source, respectively, and the first directional signal and second
directional signal are respectively oriented to one speaker, so that the directional signal in
question amplifies the speech inputs of a speaker with respect to the surrounding noise. In
addition, as the result of respectively orienting the first directional signal and the second
directional signal to one speaker, the user does not have to follow speech activities of the
conversation partners via head movements, for example in order to be able to maintain improved
intelligibility of speech via a preset directional characteristic.
[0011] It has proven to be advantageous when the first directional signal and the second
directional signal are included in the output signal as a superposition. This means in particular
that signal processing of the first directional signal and of the second directional signal that is
specific for the hearing aid may take place, and the output signal is formed from the respective
resulting signals via a superposition, in particular a linear superposition, or that a superposition
of the first directional signal and of the second directional signal is included in signal processing

                                                    5
that is specific for the hearing aid, and the output signal is formed via the signal processing.
Also included is the type of superposition in which a phase reconstruction takes place at the first
directional signal and/or at the second directional signal, based on the two directional signals, in
order to improve the spatial perception.
[0012] For the superposition, linear factors for the first directional signal and for the second
directional signal are advantageously determined in each case for each frequency band. This
means in particular that the superposition in different frequency bands may provide a different
weighting of the first directional signal and of the second directional signal. Possible spectral
differences between the first useful signal source and the second useful signal source may thus
be taken into account, so that, for example, in a frequency band in which only one of the two
useful signal sources has appreciable signal components, the corresponding weighting of the
directional signal that is oriented to the useful signal source is higher. In particular in the case
that the first and the second useful signal source are each conversation partners, characteristic
spectral factors of the voices of the conversation partners may also be taken into account. In
addition, in particular for two or more useful signal sources, a linear superposition of the
directional signals that are oriented to the useful signal sources corresponds particularly well to
the actual listening situation, in which the first useful signal and the second useful signal also
undergo a superposition, and the resulting acoustic signal for the user must be corrected for
background noise by the hearing aid in order to improve the signal quality.
[0013] The first directional signal and/or the second directional signal preferably have/has a
cone- or lobe-shaped directional characteristic. Such directional characteristics may also be
generated with only two input signals by use of simple "sum and delay" methods.
[0014] It has proven to be advantageous when the directional characteristic of the first
directional signal and/or of the second directional signal have/has a maximum sensitivity at a
central angle, and for an angular deviation of 10 degrees from the particular central angle
have/has a sensitivity that is attenuated by at least 3 dB, preferably by 5 dB. The sensitivity is to
be defined, for example, with respect to a reference signal. A directional characteristic having
the described sensitivity pattern is on the one hand generatable from two input signals in hearing
aids without major effort, and on the other hand may still sufficiently contrast a useful signal of
a useful signal source against background noises from other spatial directions.

                                                    6
[0015] In one advantageous embodiment, the first direction and the second direction for the
association are determined based on the first input signal and the second input signal. Depending
on the nature of the useful signal sources and the type of listening situation, an association of a
spatial direction with a useful signal source may also take place, for example, via a presetting,
for example based on the assumption that in most cases the viewing direction of a user of the
hearing aid will lie in the direction of one of the useful signal sources, so that the front direction
may be specified as a first direction. However, for many listening situations this is not
appropriate. Therefore, it is advantageous to localize the first useful signal source and the
second useful signal source based on the first input signal and the second input signal, which are
available anyway. The determination of the first direction and of the second direction may take
place in particular in an approximate manner, for example in the form of a scan over a plurality
of angular ranges.
[0016] It has proven to be advantageous when a plurality of angle-dependent directional
characteristics, in each case having a fixed central angle and a given angular expansion, are
formed based on the first input signal and the second input signal, wherein the signal
components for the individual directional characteristics are examined for the presence of a
useful signal from a useful signal source, and for a first useful signal source that is determined in
a certain directional characteristic, the corresponding central angle is specified as the first
direction. This allows a localization of the first useful signal source which is particularly precise
and robust against background noise, since no propagation time measurements or phase
measurements that are susceptible to interference are used for this purpose, and the first
direction for the first useful signal source may be specified based on the signals that are present
(the first input signal and the second input signal) without the need for further assumptions, for
example frontal positioning, which possibly may not correspond to the actual listening situation.
[0017] An angular distance between two directional characteristics that are adjacent with regard
to their respective central angles advantageously corresponds to one-half the angular expansion.
In particular, both adjacent directional characteristics have the same angular expansion. For the
case that the individual directional characteristics are formed by directional cones whose
sensitivity is at a maximum in the direction of the central angle, and which decreases with
increasing angular distance from the central angle, this means in particular that for each
individual directional characteristic, an angle may be indicated for which the sensitivity to a test
signal has dropped by a certain factor compared to the maximum value for the central angle, for

                                                    7
example 6 dB or 10 dB. Such an angle is now associated with the corresponding directional
characteristic as one-half an angular expansion, and the central angle of the adjacent directional
characteristic is correspondingly selected in an angular distance that is one-half an angular
expansion. For the case that notch-shaped attenuations of sensitivity with a minimum at the
central angle are in each case selected as individual directional characteristics, the same may
apply, wherein for the definition of the angular expansion, instead of the attenuation of the
sensitivity with respect to the maximum value for the central angle, an increase in the sensitivity
with respect to the minimum value for the central angle is used. For a desired broader angular
range, essentially complete coverage may be achieved by the individual directional
characteristics, while, due to overlap of the individual directional characteristics up to the
respective next central angle, a useful signal source may always be clearly associated with at
least one of the directional characteristics, and due to the overlap, angular positions between two
adjacent angles are also resolvable.
[0018] In one advantageous embodiment, the individual directional characteristics are
determined in each case by a notch-shaped sensitivity characteristic that is specified by at least
two conditions, so that in each case a central angle and an angular expansion of the sensitivity
characteristic are fixed by the at least two conditions, wherein the signal components for the
individual directional characteristics are in each case examined by the sensitivity characteristic
for the presence of a useful signal, based on a relative attenuation.
[0019] A notch-shaped sensitivity characteristic is understood to mean a directional
characteristic that has the maximum attenuation of the sensitivity at the central angle with
respect to a test signal of a given sound volume, the sensitivity increasing with increasing
angular distance from the central angle. The degree of this increase in the sensitivity as a
function of the angular distance from the central angle then defines the angular expansion. If a
useful signal source is situated in the direction of a central angle of such a directional
characteristic, or within the scope of the angular resolution is situated in the immediate
proximity of the central angle, i.e., within the "notch" of the sensitivity characteristic, the signal
components of the useful signal are greatly attenuated by the directional characteristic, while
signal components from other useful signal sources situated outside the angular expansion about
the central angle of this directional characteristic are largely maintained. This may then be used
for determining the presence of a useful signal source in the range of the corresponding
directional characteristic.

                                                   8
[0020] It has also proven to be advantageous when the hearing aid is worn by a user, the first
input signal and the second input signal being generated on different sides with respect to the
head of the user. A hearing aid in particular encompasses a binaural hearing aid. As the result of
generating the two input signals on different sides of the head of the user, the first input signal
and the second input signal have a propagation time difference with regard to included
switching [sic; acoustic] signals; due to the width of the human head, the propagation time
difference may be up to one-half millisecond.
[0021] Such a propagation time difference allows the first or second directional signal to be
concentrated on a comparatively narrow angular range, as the result of which the signal-to-noise
ratio may be improved.
[0022] In another advantageous embodiment, a further input converter generates a further input
signal from the switching [sic; acoustic] signal, wherein the first directional signal and the
second directional signal are formed based on the first input signal, the second input signal, and
the further input signal. Use of the further input signal increases the available acoustic
information, in particular the phase information, and thus allows formation of particularly
narrow directional signals as the first or second directional signal.
[0023] A further direction is advantageously associated with a further useful signal source that
is spatially separate from the first useful signal source and the second useful signal source,
wherein a further directional signal is formed based on the first input signal and the second input
signal and is oriented in the further direction, and the first output signal is formed based on the
first directional signal, the second directional signal, and the further directional signal. In
particular, the further directional signal may also be formed based on further input signals, if
more than two input signals are present. In particular, the output signal may be formed based on
a linear superposition of the first directional signal, the second directional signal, and the further
directional signal, wherein preferably the first directional signal, the second directional signal,
and the further directional signal are included as linear superposition in the signal processing
that is specific for the hearing aid, and the output signal is formed by the signal processing. This
allows operations with more than two useful signal sources, without one of the useful signal
sources of the method not being treated as such, but, rather, as background noise, and the useful
signal in question being erroneously attenuated.

[0024] The invention further relates to a hearing aid, in particular a binaural hearing aid,
comprising at least one first microphone for generating a first input signal from a switching [sic;
acoustic] signal of the surroundings, a second microphone for generating a second input signal
from the switching [sic; acoustic] signal, at least one first loudspeaker, and a signal processing
unit that is configured for carrying out the method described above. The advantages stated for
the method and for its refinements may be analogously transferred to the hearing aid.

[0030] Mutually corresponding parts and variables are provided in each case with the same
reference numerals in all figures.
Detailed Description
[0031] A listening situation 1 of a user 2 of a hearing aid 4 is illustrated, in each case in a top
view, in Figure la and Figure lb. The user 2 is in a conversation with a first conversation
partner 6 and a second conversation partner 8; the first conversation partner 6 is situated in front
of and opposite the user, while the second conversation partner is positioned at an angle of
approximately 450 with respect to the front direction 10 of the user 2. The listening situation 1 is

                                                  10
such that the conversation of the user 2 with the first conversation partner 6 and the second
conversation partner 8 is superimposed with background noise originating from noise sources 12
distributed in the surroundings. Figure 1a illustrates how a directional signal having a directional
characteristic 14 is formed in the hearing aid 4 according to the prior art for better intelligibility
of the speech inputs of the first conversation partner 6 and the second conversation partner 8.
The directional characteristic 14 is oriented, with respect to its sensitivity maximum, in the front
direction 10 of the user 2; the angular expansion D1 of the directional characteristic 14 is large
enough that the second conversation partner 8 is still detected by the directional characteristic
14. However, as a result of the large angular expansion D1, the noise sources 12a and 12b are
now also detected by the directional characteristic, and correspondingly, the interfering noises
emitted by the noise sources 12a and 12b are not suppressed via the directional signal that is
formed according to the directional characteristic 14, but instead are suppressed solely by the
natural attenuation of the interfering noises due to the fairly large distance of the noise sources
12a and 12b from the user 2. However, such an attenuation is insufficient in many cases. In
addition, the formation of an alternative directional characteristic 16 whose direction of
maximum sensitivity 18 with respect to the front direction 10 of the user 2 is shifted by an
angular magnitude a, and which is thus situated between the first conversation partner 6 and the
second conversation partner 8, cannot suppress the interfering noise emitted by the noise source
12a, despite the smaller angular expansion D2.
[0032] In contrast, it is now proposed, as illustrated in Figure 1b, to identify the first
conversation partner 6 as the first useful signal source and to assign a first direction 20a to the
position of the first conversation partner, and to identify the second conversation partner 8 as the
second useful signal source and to assign a second direction 20b to the position of the second
conversation partner. A first directional signal having a first directional characteristic 22a as
well as a second directional signal having a second directional characteristic 22b are now
formed in the hearing aid 4. The first directional characteristic 22a and the second directional
characteristic 22b each have the same angular expansion D3, which is small enough that only a
narrow angular range around the first or second direction 20a, 20b is detected by the first or
second directional characteristic 22a, 22b. It may thus be ensured that in the first directional
signal formed based on the first directional characteristic 22a, essentially only the speech inputs
of the first conversation partner 6 occur as appreciable signal components, and all interfering
noises of the noise sources 12, 12a, 12b are effectively suppressed. The same then applies for
the second directional signal, formed based on the second directional characteristic 22b, with

                                                   11
regard to the speech inputs of the second conversation partner 8. The output signals of the
hearing aid 4 that are audible to the user 2 are now formed as a linear superposition of the first
directional signal and of the second directional signal, so that, due to the spatial sensitivity of the
first directional characteristic 22a and of the second directional characteristic 22b, the interfering
noises originating from the noise source 12a are now also suppressed.
[0033] Figure 2 illustrates in a block diagram a method 30 for operating a hearing aid 4 during a
listening situation 1 according to Figure lb. The hearing aid 4 has a first input converter 32a and
a second input converter 32b, each designed as microphones. The first input converter 32a and
the second input converter 32b generate from an acoustic signal 34 of the surroundings a first
input signal 36a and a second input signal 36b, respectively. Due to spatial filtering, directional
signals having different directional characteristics 22 are now formed from the first and second
input signals 36a, 36b, respectively. The individual directional characteristics 22 each have a
central angle aj with respect to the front direction 10 of the user 2, and an angular expansion D3.
The central angle aj is in each case defined by the angle between the direction 18 of maximum
sensitivity of a directional characteristic 22 and the front direction 10 of the user 2. Based on the
directional signals having the directional characteristics 22, the presence of a first useful signal
source 38a in a first direction 20a as well as the presence of a second useful signal source 38b in
a second direction 20b are now determined over the appropriate signal level. The first and
second directions 20a, 20b are assigned to the directions 18a, 18b of maximum sensitivity of the
directional characteristics 22a, 22b, whose corresponding directional signals have the largest
level components. The first directional signal 40a and the second directional signal 40b, which
have the first directional characteristic 22a and the second directional characteristic 22b,
respectively, are now mixed together by a linear superposition 42, so that the signal 44 resulting
from the linear superposition 42 is supplied to a signal processing block 46 in which all further
signal processing algorithms that are specific for the hearing aid 4 are carried out. The signal
processing block 46 outputs an output signal 48 which is converted by an output converter 50, in
the present case formed by a loudspeaker, into an acoustic signal that is audible to the user 2.
[0034] Figure 3 schematically illustrates in a block diagram an alternative sequence of the
method 30 according to Figure 2. A plurality of notch-shaped sensitivity characteristics 52a
through 52d are now applied here via the first and second input signals 36a, 36b, each having
the same angular expansion D4, and having a sensitivity minimum at a central angle aj. The
position of the first and second useful signal sources 38a, 38b is now determined based on the

                                                  12
ascertainment of those directional signals for which the relative signal level, normalized over the
overall signal level, is lowered the most by the corresponding sensitivity characteristic 52a
through 52d. The two central angles aj of the sensitivity characteristics 52a, 52b in question, as
first and second directions 20a, 20b, are then assigned to the first and second useful signal
sources 38a, 38b, respectively. The first directional signal 40a and the second directional signal
40b, which have the first and second directional characteristics 22a, 22b, respectively, are then
formed from the first and the second input signal 36a, 36b. The subsequent steps of the linear
superposition 42 of the first and second directional signals 40a, 40b are identical to the
embodiments of the method 30 illustrated in Figure 2.

preferred exemplary embodiment, the invention is not limited by this exemplary embodiment.
Other variations may be derived by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of
protection of the invention.
