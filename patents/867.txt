                                   ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
             Whether a fetus has an aneuploidy associated with a first chromosome is detected
using ratios of alleles detected in a maternal sample having a mixture of maternal and fetal
DNA. DNA from the sample is enriched for target regions associated with polymorphic loci
and then sequenced. Polymorphic loci (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms) in the target
regions with fetal-specific alleles are identified on a first chromosome and on one or more
reference chromosomes. A first ratio of the fetal-specific alleles and shared alleles is
determined for the loci on the first chromosome. A second ratio of the fetal-specific alleles
and shared alleles is determined for the loci on the reference chromosome(s). A third ratio of
the first and second ratio can be compared to a cutoff to determine whether an aneuploidy is
present, and whether the aneuploidy is maternally-derived or paternally-derived.

                                               BACKGROUND
[0002]          Prenatal screening and diagnosis of fetal aneuploidies, such as trisomy 21 (T21), is
an established part of modern obstetrics care. Conventional prenatal screening is built on
parameters such as maternal age, sonographic and biochemical markers [1]. Since these
parameters are mainly based on phenotypic features, which are essentially epiphenomena
associated with the core molecular pathology, their diagnostic performance is usually
suboptimal. Pregnancies stratified as high risk by the above screening approaches require
further investigation of fetal genetic materials obtained via invasive procedures, such as
chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis. These latter procedures carry small, but
definite, risk of miscarriage [2]. The demonstration of fetal DNA in maternal plasma in 1997
has opened up possibilities for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) [3].
[0003]          Maternal plasma DNA contains a mixture of fragmented maternal and fetal genomic
DNA [4]. The large background of maternal DNA represents a challenge for the interrogation
of fetal chromosomal status. Early studies for NIPD of T21 were polymorphism-based,
requiring the measurements of allelic ratios and comparing them with the expected normal
values [5-7]. These early methods were based on fetal-specific molecular signatures such as
DNA methylation markers [5] and RNA markers [6], or required one to increase the
fractional fetal DNA concentration to a sufficiently high level such as using formaldehyde
treatment of maternal plasma [7]. However, for the last approach, there are controversies on
                                                      1
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

the effectiveness of formaldehyde treatment because this method could not be replicated
consistently by different groups [8-10]. Therefore, the clinical applicability of such a method
remains unclear.
[0004]          It is therefore desirable to provide new techniques for noninvasive prenatal
diagnosis using allelic ratios.

general knowledge in the art in Australia or any other country.
                                              BRIEF SUMMARY
 [0005]         Embodiments provide methods, apparatuses, and systems for non-invasively
determining whether a fetus has an aneuploidy associated with a first chromosome by
analyzing a biological sample containing a mixture of cell-free fetal and maternal DNA. For
example, a first allelic ratio can be determined for the first chromosome and a second allelic
ratio can be determined for one or more reference chromosomes. To determine the ratios,
DNA can be enriched for target regions associated with polymorphic loci and then
sequenced. Loci in the target regions with fetal-specific alleles are identified on a first
chromosome and on one or more reference chromosomes. These loci can be used to
determine respective allelic ratios. A third ratio of the first and second allelic ratios can be
compared to a cutoff to determine whether an aneuploidy is present for the first chromosome,
and whether the aneuploidy is maternally-derived or paternally-derived.
 [0006]         Other embodiments are directed to systems, portable consumer devices, and
computer readable media associated with methods described herein.

                                                DEFINITIONS
[014a]          In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the
context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word
''comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition
of further features in various embodiments of the invention.
[0015]          The term "biologicalsample" as used herein refers to any sample that is taken from
a subject (e.g., a human, such as a pregnant woman) and contains one or more nucleic acid
molecule(s) of interest. Examples include plasma, saliva, pleural fluid, sweath, ascitic fluid,
bile, urine, serum, pancreatic juice, stool and cervical smear samples.
                                                       3
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

[0016]          The term "nucleic acid" or "polynucleotide"refers to a deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) and a polymer thereof in either single- or double-stranded
form. Unless specifically limited, the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known
analogs of natural nucleotides that have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic
acid and are metabolized in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless
otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses
conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions), alleles,
orthologs, SNPs, and complementary sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated.
Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in
which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed
base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer MA et al., Nucleic Acid Res 1991; 19:508 1;
Ohtsuka E et al., JBiol Chem 1985; 260:2605-2608; and Rossolini GM et al., Mol Cell
Probes 1994; 8:91-98). The term nucleic acid is used interchangeably with gene, cDNA,
mRNA, small noncoding RNA, micro RNA (miRNA), Piwi-interacting RNA, and short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) encoded by a gene or locus.
[0017]          The term "gene" means the segment of DNA involved in producing a polypeptide
chain. It may include regions preceding and following the coding region (leader and trailer)
as well as intervening sequences (introns) between individual coding segments (exons).
[0018]          As used herein, the term "locus" or its plural form "loci" is a location or address of
any length of nucleotides (or base pairs) which has a variation across genomes. A SNP is
informative if it is homozygous in the mother (e.g., genotype AA) and heterozygous in the
fetus (e.g., genotype AB).
[0019]          The term "sequenced tag" (also called sequence read) refers to a sequence obtained
from all or part of a nucleic acid molecule, e.g., a DNA fragment. In one embodiment, just
one end of the fragment is sequenced, e.g., about 30 bp. The sequenced tag can then be
aligned to a reference genome. Alternatively, both ends of the fragment can be sequenced to
generate two sequenced tags, which can provide greater accuracy in the alignment and also
provide a length of the fragment. In yet another embodiment, a linear DNA fragment can be
circularized, e.g., by ligation, and the part spanning the ligation site can be sequenced.

10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

[0020]          The term "universal sequencing" refers to sequencing where adapters are added to
the end of a fragment, and the primers for sequencing attached to the adapters. Thus, any
fragment can be sequenced with the same primer, and thus the sequencing can be random.
[0021]          The term fractional fetal DNA concentration is used interchangeably with the terms
fetal DNA proportion and fetal DNA fraction, and refers to the proportion of DNA molecules
that are present in a maternal plasma or serum sample that is derived from the fetus (Lo
YMD et al. Am JHum Genet 1998;62:768-775; Lun FMF et al. Clin Chem 2008;54:1664
 1672).
[0022]          The term "overrepresentednucleic acid sequence" as used herein refers to the
nucleic acid sequence among two sequences of interest (e.g., a clinically relevant sequence
and a background sequence) that is in more abundance than the other sequence in a biological
sample. For example, the maternal (shared allele) would be overrepresented at an
informative locus.
[0023]          The term "parameter"as used herein means a numerical value that characterizes a
quantitative data set and/or a numerical relationship between quantitative data sets. For
example, a ratio (or function of a ratio) between a first amount of a first nucleic acid
sequence and a second amount of a second nucleic acid sequence is a parameter.
[0024]          The term "cutoffvalue" as used herein means a numerical value whose value is used
to arbitrate between two or more states (e.g. diseased and non-diseased) of classification for a
biological sample. For example, if a parameter is greater than the cutoff value, a first
classification of the quantitative data is made (e.g. diseased state); or if the parameter is less
than the cutoff value, a different classification of the quantitative data is made (e.g.
non-diseased state).
[0025]          The term "chromosomal aneuploidy" as used herein means a variation in the
quantitative amount of a chromosome from that of a diploid genome. The variation may be a
gain or a loss. It may involve the whole of one chromosome or a region of a chromosome.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0027]          Plasma DNA obtained from a pregnant woman contains a mixture of cell-free
maternal and cell-free fetal DNA. The fetal DNA proportion in maternal plasma is relatively
consistent as determined using polymorphic genetic markers across different chromosomes in
euploid pregnancies. For example, the proportion of counts of a first fetal-specific allele at a
first locus is relatively consistent with the proportion counts of a second fetal-specific allele
at any other locus. The fetal DNA proportion may differ from one maternal sample to
another, but the fetal DNA proportion for different polymorphic genetic markers (on the
same chromosome or different chromosomes) is relatively consistent within the sample.
[0028]          For aneuploid pregnancies, the observed fetal DNA proportion measured using
polymorphic genetic markers for the aneuploid chromosome would be perturbed.
Embodiments use polymorphisms (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms) with fetus-specific
alleles to detect such perturbations in mothers carrying aneuploidy fetuses (e.g., trisomy 21
fetuses). Although the percentage of fetal DNA is typically less than the percentage of
maternal DNA, the fetal DNA percentage is typically high enough to identify the
perturbation. But, the fetal DNA proportion may differ from one sample to another, thereby
adding some complexity to the identification of the complexity.
[0029]          To address this complexity, embodiments can determine a ratio using a first fetal
DNA proportion from polymorphic genetic markers for the aneuploid chromosome and a
second fetal DNA proportion for reference chromosomes not involved in the aneuploidy.
The fetal DNA proportion for polymorphic genetic markers on the reference chromosomes
would not be perturbed by the aneuploidy. Using such a second proportion determined from
genetic markers on the reference chromosomes can provide an accurate parameter (e.g., the
ratio of the two proportions) for identifying an aneuploidy, particularly when specific parts of
the genome are enriched for known polymorphic sites. Such enrichment can provide greater
efficiency by increasing the number of analyzed DNA molecules that correspond to usable
polymorphic markers, relative to other DNA molecules that are not used in determining the
parameter.

I.           INTRODUCTION
[0030]          An approach for NIPD of aneuploidies (such as T21) is to measure the proportion of
chromosome 21 (chr2 1)-derived DNA molecules in a maternal plasma sample. If a mother is
carrying a T21 fetus, the additional copy of chr21 from the fetus would contribute an
additional amount of chr21 DNA molecules to the maternal plasma sample, leading to an
increased proportion of chr21 sequences [11]. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) enhances
the precision of DNA quantification, and has enabled the detection of aberrant quantities of
fetal DNA derived from an aneuploid chromosome [11-14].
[0031]          Embodiments use an allelic ratio approach for the NIPD of an aneuploidy (such as
T21) by using MPS. Since single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) only account for
approximately 1.6 % of the human genome according to the dbSNP Build 135 for human
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/), conventional non-targeted MPS would only include
SNP alleles in a small proportion of sequence reads. Therefore, embodiments can use
targeted MPS to preferentially sequence selected SNP loci in a biological sample (e.g.,
maternal plasma) for fetal aneuploid detection. In a previous publication, by using a
hybridization-based targeted MPS platform, the inventors demonstrated the enrichment of
DNA molecules within the targeted regions, as well as the preservation of the allelic ratios of
the targeted SNPs in maternal plasma after target enrichment [15].
[0032]           A SNP (or other polymorphism) is informative if it is homozygous in the mother
(e.g., genotype AA) and heterozygous in the fetus (e.g., genotype AB). In this scenario, the B
allele is the fetus-specific allele and the A allele is the allele shared by the mother and fetus.
The fetus-specific allelic counts and shared allelic counts for the informative SNPs can be
obtained from sequencing plasma DNA, and used to calculate a ratio between the count fetus
specific alleles and the shared alleles. An example of the ratio is labeled FSR.
 [0033]         In one implementation where the chromosome of interest is chromosome 21, the
ratio can be expressed as F-S ratio for chr2l (expressed as FSR 2 1) and the reference
chromosomes (expressed as FSRRef). If a mother is carrying a euploid fetus, the ratio between
FSR 2 1 and FSRRef (expressed as FSR 2{ ) should be equal to 1 (FIG. 1A). If a mother is
carrying a T21 fetus with an additional chr21 from the father (referred in this manuscript as
paternally-derived T21), the fetal genotype on chr2l would become ABB. The additional
                                                    7
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

copy of the fetus-specific allele would increase the FSRef to 2 (FIG. IB). If the extra copy
of chr2l is from the mother (referred in this manuscript as maternally-derived T21), the fetal
genotype on chr2l would become AAB. The additional copy of the shared allele would
reduce the FSR"f to less than 1 (FIG. 1).
             A.            Euploid
[0034]          FIG. 1A shows a diagram 100 of alleles at a locus for the mother and a euploid fetus
and an example calculation according to embodiments of the present invention. Locus 103 is
for a reference chromosome and locus 106 is for chromosome 21 (but it could be any
chromosome of interest). The maternal genome is homozygous at each locus and the fetus is
heterozygous at each locus. As depicted, the maternal allele is labeled A at each locus,
although the actual sequence for the two loci would be different. Thus, A and B are simply
labels highlighting two different alleles at a same locus (i.e., alleles from two different copies
of the chromosome), and in this case two alleles in the fetal genome.
[0035]          The paternal allele B is inherited by the fetus from the father, thereby making the
fetus heterozygous at the two loci. Other similarly situated loci (informative loci) can be
found on the reference chromosome and the chromosome of interest. Thus, locus 103 can
actually be loci 103, and locus 106 can be loci 106. There can also be more than one
reference chromosome.
[0036]          For the euploid case, the fetus has one allele A and one allele B at loci 103 and loci
 106. In an example where the fetal DNA percentage is 50% (i.e., equal parts maternal and
fetal DNA), there would be 25% proportion of paternal alleles B detected at loci 103 and
25% proportion of paternal alleles B at loci 106. Therefore, a ratio of the two proportions
(i.e., 25% divided by 25%) would be one. Similarly, a ratio of B alleles to A alleles is 1/3 for
loci 103 and 106, and 1/3 divided by 1/3 would be one. Of course, due to statistical nature of
the sample set of detected alleles, the ratio would probably not be exactly one. Thus, a
proportion (e.g., any ratio of counts of the alleles) of paternal alleles B at locus 103 should be
the same as the proportion of paternal alleles B.
 [0037]         FIG. 1A provides a more general formulation for different fractional fetal DNA
concentrations f. As shown, at each locus 103, the fetus would contribute a proportion of f/2
of allele B out of all of the alleles detected at locus 103. As mentioned above, if f was 0.5,
                                                       8
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

then the proportion would be .25, or 25%. Similarly, the fetus would contribute f/2 of allele
A. The higher the fractional fetal DNA concentration, the higher the proportion of allele B
would be. Here, f is defined as DNA of either genotype of the fetus, and thus the factor of
two.
[0038]          For the mother, each copy of the chromosome contributes the same proportion (1
f)/2. When f is 0.5, the proportion is .25 (25%) as noted above. In the limit of 0% fetal
DNA, each allele A contributes 50%, and only the A sequence is detected as the mother is
homozygous.
 [0039]         The ratio of B alleles relative to A alleles detected at each locus 103 and 106 is
given as f/(2-f). For example, if f is 0.5, then the ratio is 1/3, since there is one B allele for
each A allele. Other ratios may be used, e.g., the percentage of paternal alleles B detected for
all loci 103, as given by B/(A+B) or 2B/(A+B), where A and B here are the counts of the
corresponding alleles. The ratio shown is labeled FSR, as the ratio of the count of fetal
specific (paternal) allele and the shared (maternal) allele.
             B.            Paternally-derivedaneuploidy
 [0040]         FIG. 1B shows a diagram 120 of alleles at a locus for the mother and a paternally
derived aneuploid fetus and an example calculation according to embodiments of the present
invention. Locus 123 is for a reference chromosome and locus 126 is for chromosome 21. As
for FIG. 1A, the maternal genome is homozygous at each locus and the fetus is heterozygous
at each locus.
 [0041]         For this aneuploid case, the fetus has one allele A and one allele B at loci 123, but
has one allele A and two allele B at loci 126, as there is an extra copy of chromosome 21
from the father. In an example where the fetal DNA percentage is 50% (i.e., equal parts
maternal and fetal DNA), the ratio of B alleles to A alleles for loci 123 would 1/3, but would
be 2/3 for loci 126 since there is two B alleles.
 [0042]         For the general formula, each copy of the chromosome can be considered to
contribute f/2, since the fetal concentration is determined with respect to the reference
chromosome(s). Thus, the sum of the counts of allele B provides f/2+f/2=f. The sum of
counts of allele A provides f/2+1-f. The ratio of these provides 2f/(2-f), as shown. The ratio
                                                        9
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

FSRRef        for the reference chromosome is still the same as for FIG. 1A, since this chromosome
is still euploid.
[00431          The ratio of the ratio FSR 2 1 and FSRRef is two. Of course, due to statistical nature of
the sample set of detected alleles, the ratio would probably not be exactly two. The
paternally-derived aneuploidy is easier to detect that the maternally-derived aneuploidy as
described below.
             C.            Maternally-derivedaneuploidy
[0044]          FIG. IC shows a diagram 140 of alleles at a locus for the mother and a maternally
derived aneuploid fetus and an example calculation according to embodiments of the present
invention. Locus 143 is for a reference chromosome and locus 146 is for chromosome 21. As
for FIG. 1A, the maternal genome is homozygous at each locus and the fetus is heterozygous
at each locus.
[0045]          For this aneuploid case, the fetus has one allele A and one allele B at loci 143, but
has two allele A and one allele B at loci 146, as there is an extra copy of chromosome 21
from the mother. In an example where the fetal DNA percentage is 50% (i.e., equal parts
maternal and fetal DNA), the ratio of B alleles to A alleles for loci 143 would 1/3, but would
be 1/4 for loci 146 since there is one allele B for every 1 allele A.
[0046]          For the general formula, each copy of the chromosome can be considered to
contribute f/2, since the fetal concentration is determined with respect to the reference
chromosome(s). Thus, the sum of the counts of allele B provides f/2. The sum of counts of
allele A provides 1-f +f/2+f/2, which gives simply 1. The ratio of these provides f/2, as
shown. The ratio FSRRef for the reference chromosome is still the same as for FIG. 1A, since
this chromosome is still euploid. The ratio of the ratio FSR 2 1 and FSRRef is 1-f/2. Of course,
due to statistical nature of the sample set of detected alleles, the ratio would probably not be
exactly 1-f/2.
 [0047]         To determine which of these categories a sample corresponds, the final ration can be
compared to a cutoff value. For example, a cutoff somewhere between 1 and 2 can
distinguish the euploid case with the paternally-derived aneuploidy case. More than one
cutoff value could be used between 1 and 2, thereby providing different levels of confidence
for a determination. The cutoff value between the euploid and the maternally-derived
                                                      10
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

aneuploidy is more difficult as the spacing between the two values is smaller, and depends on
the fraction fetal concentration f. The cutoff could be determined from a separate
measurement of f to determine an expected value if the fetus at a maternally-derived
aneuploidy. As another example, a minimum value of f could be required, and then a same
cutoff value suitable for that minimum fetal concentration could be used.
[0048]          Accordingly, for the example of T21, assuming the fractional fetal DNA
concentration in chrRef is f, the F-S ratio would be f/(2-f) on chrRef irrespective of the
aneuploidy status of the fetus. On the other hand, the F-S ratio on chr2l would be f/(2-f) if
the mother is carrying a euploid fetus, 2f/(2-f) if the mother is carrying a paternally-derived
T21 fetus, and f/2 if the mother is carrying a maternally-derived T21 fetus. Therefore, the
 FSR"f would be 1 if the mother is carrying a euploid fetus, would become 2 if the mother is
carrying a paternally-derived T21 fetus, and would become (1-f/2) if the mother is carrying a
maternally-derived T21 fetus.
II.          METHOD
 [0049]         FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method 200 of analyzing a biological sample
from a female subject pregnant with a fetus to determine whether the fetus has an aneuploidy.
The biological sample contains a mixture of DNA molecules from the fetus and the female
subject. Parts of method 200 may be performed by a computer system.
 [0050]         At block 210, the biological sample is enriched for DNA molecules from a plurality
of target regions. The enrichment can be performed by hybridization techniques or
amplification techniques, or a combination of both. The target regions can be genomic
regions that are known to have polymorphic sites. Such regions can include those of the
Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix).
 [0051]         At block 220, DNA molecules from the biological sample are sequenced to obtain a
plurality of sequence reads. The sequencing may be performed in a variety of ways. For
example, a universal sequencing can use the same adapters ligated to the end of the
molecules for sequencing any DNA molecule. One embodiment uses massively parallel
DNA sequencing, such as, but not limited to that performed by the Illumina Genome
Analyzer platform (Bentley DR et al. Nature 2008; 456: 53-59), the Roche 454 platform
(Margulies M et al. Nature 2005; 437: 376-380), the ABI SOLiD platform (McKernan KJ et
                                                      11
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

al. Genome Res 2009; 19: 1527-1541), the Helicos single molecule sequencing platform
(Harris TD et al. Science 2008; 320: 106-109), real-time sequencing using single polymerase
molecules (Science 2009; 323: 133-138) and nanopore sequencing (Clarke J et al. Nat
Nanotechnol. 2009; 4: 265-70). In one implementation, the sequencing is paired-end
sequencing that provides a pair of reads for each DNA molecule sequenced.
[0052]          At block 230, the plurality of sequence reads are analyzed. The analyzing a
sequence read can include identifying a location of the sequence read in a reference genome
by aligning the sequence read to the reference genome, and determining a respective allele of
the sequence read. The respective allele is determined from the sequence of the read. For a
heterozygous locus, the sequence read can inform which allele corresponds to the sequence
read. The reference genome can include locations where polymorphisms are known to exist
and allow alignment for either allele.
[0053]          At block 240, a plurality of first loci on a first chromosome are identified, where the
plurality of first loci correspond to a portion of the target regions. The first loci are
informative in that the mother is homozygous at the loci and the fetus is heterozygous. These
loci can be determined from the sequencing reads when reads having two different alleles
align to the same location in the reference genome, and where one allele is in a significant
majority. Since the fetal concentration is expected to be between 5%-20%, informative loci
might be expected to have a minority allele appearing about 2.5%-10%. These percentages
are illustrative and other percentages may be used. Such first loci that are within a target
region (i.e., a region that was enriched) can be identified for further analysis.
[0054]          At block 250, a plurality of second loci on one or more reference chromosomes are
identified, where the plurality of second loci correspond to a portion of the target regions.
The pregnant female is homozygous for a respective maternal allele at each of the first and
second loci, and the fetus is heterozygous for the respective maternal allele and a respective
paternal allele at each of the first and second loci. The paternal allele is the fetal-specific
allele, and thus the respective paternal alleles being different from the respective maternal
alleles.
[0055]          At block 260, a first ratio of a first maternal amount and a first paternal amount is
calculated. The first maternal amount is of the respective maternal alleles at the plurality of
first loci. For example, the number of maternal alleles counted at each first loci may be
                                                        12
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

counted. The first paternal amount is of the respective paternal alleles at the plurality of first
loci. As described above, the ratio can be strict division of the two amounts, with either in
the denominator, but can also be other ratios, e.g., where the denominator includes a sum of
the two values.
[0056]          At block 270, a second ratio of a second maternal amount and a second paternal
amount is calculated. The second maternal amount is of the respective maternal alleles at the
plurality of second loci. The second paternal amount is of the respective paternal alleles at
the plurality of second loci. The second ratio should have the same form as the first ratio,
and the formula for determining the ratios should be the same. For example, sum alleles B
divided by sum of alleles A.
 [0057]         At block 280, a third ratio of the first ratio and the second ratio is calculated. The
third ratio can also be a simple ratio with either the first ratio of the second ratio being in the
denominator. The ratio can also involve sums in the denominator or numerator, as well as be
a ratio of functions of the first and second ratios, as can still convey a relative value between
the first and second ratio.
 [0058]         At block 290, the third ratio is compared to one or more cutoff values to determine
whether the fetus has an aneuploidy associated with the first chromosome. More than one
cutoff can be used, e.g., to differentiate between the euploid, the maternally-derived
aneuploidy, and the paternally-derived aneuploidy. The cutoff values can be derived in a
variety of ways. For example, distributions among test samples whose results are known can
be used to determine the statistical distribution of the third ratio (e.g., FSRAef) for each of the
cases and a cutoff value can be chosen to accurately differentiate new cases that would fall
within the known distributions. Theoretical values could also be used, e.g., based on
expected distributions.
[0059]          The cutoff values can be determined as outlined in FIGS 1A-IC. For example, the
cutoff value can differentiate when the third ratio is approximately two, and thus determine
that the aneuploidy is paternally-derived. The determination of approximately being two can
be made by the third ratio being above a cutoff meant to distinguish a value of 1 and a value
of 2. As another example, the cutoff value can differentiate when the third ratio is
approximately1-f/2, and thus determine that the aneuploidy is maternally-derived, where f is
a fractional fetal DNA concentration in the mixture. The fractional fetal DNA concentration f
                                                        13
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

may be determined from the second paternal amount and the second maternal amount. For
example, thefollwoing formula can be used fractional fetal DNA concentration            = second
paternal amount x 2 / (second paternal amount + second maternal amount) x 100%. The
cutoff value can be placed at an appropriate value between 1 and 1-f/2 to differentiate
between the two cases.
III.         ENRICHING
[0060]          The enriching can be performed by selectively amplifying and/or capturing targeted
regions from a DNA sample before sequencing. The enrichment is effected by probes and/or
primers that are designed to hybridize to a particular location in the genome. Many of these
probes/primers may be used to target multiple regions of the genome. Various regions can be
targeted on the chromosome of interest and various regions can be targeted on one reference
chromosome or across multiple reference chromosomes.
[0061]          In one implementation, the target regions include regions that are known to have
polymorphisms. In this way, one does need to know the specific polymorphisms of the fetus
ahead of time. But, since the target regions correspond to polymorphisms generally found in
a population, there is a good chance that the father passed one of those polymorphisms to the
fetus. The mother and father could also be genotyped, thereby allowing specific knowledge
of polymorphic sites of the fetus, as is described herein.
             A.             Capture
[0062]          A rationale of capture (e.g., using an array) is to hybridize a DNA library to
immobilized probes. For example, the probes correspond to a target region, and DNA
molecules from these target regions hybridized to the immobilized probes. Thus, the targeted
DNA is immobilized, while the non-targeted DNA is not.
[0063]          Non-targeted DNA fragments can be removed by washing, and targeted fragments
are can be harvested by elution. A vast excess of DNA in the library (20 g per sample) over
that of the probes may be required to ensure complete hybridization. Example techniques
include on-array capture (20) and in-solution capture (21). In some embodiments, probes
may be designed for SNP loci that are known to show high polymorphic rate in the
population. Only the SNP loci that turn out to be informative would be used for the
calculation. Such an approach is generally easier to execute in a clinical setting that an
                                                      14
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

approach that requires custom selection of probes for every pregnancy, e.g., when a specific
sited for a fetal-specific allele is known, as may be done by identifying sites where the
mother and father are homozygous for different alleles.
[0064]          The capturing may not be perfect, as some DNA molecules from non-target regions
may remain, the percentage of DNA molecules from target regions increased relative to the
percentage before enrichment. In this manner, there is a higher likelihood that a sequence
read corresponds to a target region. Therefore, less sequencing needs to be performed to get
a same number of allelic counts for the various loci.
             B.            Amplification
[0065]          For amplification, primers are designed to amplify target regions of the genome.
Whereas, capture techniques remove DNA from non-targeted regions, amplification
techniques preferentially increase the number of DNA molecules from the target regions. In
this manner, there again is a higher likelihood that a sequence read corresponds to a target
region.
 [0066]         Amplification can provide many copies of DNA from the target regions for
sequencing, but the overall accuracy is still related to the statistical accuracy of the original
sample. That is, if the original sample is relatively small (and thus susceptible to statistical
inaccuracies due to the sample size), the amplification will not overcome such issues, even
though more copies of DNA now exist.
[0067]          In one embodiment, may combine the two techniques. For example, one may
capture DNA molecules for a target region, and remove non-target DNA. The remaining
DNA have an increased percentage from the target regions. One can then amplify the
remaining DNA molecules to increase the target percentage even higher, and to get more
copies of DNA from the target regions.
IV.          IDENTIFYING LOCI
[0068]          As described above, embodiments use informative loci, where the mother is
homozygous and the fetus is heterozygous. These loci can be identified in various ways. For
example, informative loci (e.g., SNPs) may be identified according to maternal and fetal
genotyping information. However, such a process would involve obtaining fetal cells, e.g.,
from an invasive technique. For example, the genotyping can be done on the maternal blood
                                                     15
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

cells and a fetal tissue sample obtained invasively. Other embodiments can identify the
informative loci from noninvasive techniques. But, this genotyping can be used as a gold
standard to compare the validity of noninvasive methods. For the non-targeted sequencing
results below, the read depth was not high enough to identify many informative loci based on
the sequencing alone, and thus prior genotyping information regarding the informative loci
was used.
[0069]          For targeted sequencing embodiments, there is enough depth at more SNP loci
where one can identify the presence of two alleles but one at a lower amount, and these are
the likely informative loci. For example, for a locus, one can count a first number of
sequence reads corresponding to a first allele and count a second number of sequence reads
corresponding to a second allele. The overrepresented sequence (allele) would correspond to
the shared allele and the underrepresented allele would correspond to the fetal-specific allele.
Loci where the mother is heterozygous (i.e., about 50-50 of the two alleles) can be
distinguished by dismissing loci where the ratio of the two alleles is about one. Since the
fetal concentration is expected to be between 5%-20%, informative loci might be expected to
have a minority allele appearing about 2.5%-10% out of all sequence reads aligning to the
locus. These percentages are illustrative and other percentages may be used.
 [0070]         In one embodiment, a first number of sequence reads corresponding to the first
allele at the first locus can be determined. A second number of sequence reads corresponding
to the second allele at the first locus can be determined. An allelic ratio of the first number
and the second number may be calculated in a variety of ways (e.g., as percentage of reads
with the first allele). If the allelic ratio is above a first threshold and below a second
threshold, the first locus can be identified as an informative locus. For example, the second
threshold can be used to ensure that the locus is not simply heterozygous in the mother and
the first threshold could be 0 (or some other value to ensure that the sequence read was
simply not in error).
V.           RESULTS
 [0071]         DNA was extracted from plasma samples collected from fourteen pregnant women
carrying singleton fetuses. Hybridization-based targeted sequencing was used to enrich 2,906
single nucleotide polymorphism loci on chr7, chr13, chr18 and chr21. Plasma DNA libraries
with and without target enrichment were analyzed by massively parallel sequencing.
                                                    16
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

Genomic DNA samples of both the mother and fetus for each case were genotyped by single
nucleotide polymorphism microarray analysis.
[0072]         FIG. 3 shows a table 300 of sequencing results of 14 pregnant women according to
embodiments of the present invention. Table 300 shows data where chromosome 21 is the
chromosome of interest. The fetal status was determined from the genotyping data. The rest
of the data is determined from the sequencing results.
 [0073]        For the targeted regions, the mean sequencing depth of the enriched samples was
225-fold higher than that of the non-enriched samples. Sequencing depth can be defined as
the mean number of times each base had been sequenced in a particular region. On average, 3
million paired-end reads in non-enriched and enriched samples were mapped uniquely to the
reference human genome (Hgl 8). After filtration of the duplicated paired-end reads, the
sequencing depth of the targeted region can be calculated by dividing the total number of
sequenced bases within the targeted region by the length of the targeted region. The mean
sequencing depth was 0.12 time for the non-enriched samples and 27 times for the enriched
samples, indicating a mean enrichment of 225-fold. This finding was consistent with our
previous publication [15].
 [0074]        The fractional fetal DNA concentrations (also referred to as the fetal DNA
percentage) in the non-enriched samples was calculated by using the informative SNPs from
all autosomes except for chr2 1, according to the equation: fractional fetal DNA concentration
= fetus-specific allelic counts x 2 / (fetus-specific allelic counts + shared allelic counts) x
 100%. The median fractional fetal DNA concentration for the fourteen cases analyzed in this
study was 15.5% (range 9.1% - 19.7%). The fractional fetal DNA concentration can be used
to determine the expected reduction in the third ratio of method 200 (e.g., FSR 21 ) from a
value of 1 for maternally-derived aneuploidies (FIG. 1C). As mentioned herein, a cutoff
value can be determined based on the fractional fetal DNA concentration. Alternatively, a
cutoff can be chosen based on an assumption or measurement that a minimum fractional fetal
DNA concentration exists in the sample.

103340161 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

according to embodiments of the present invention. Based on maternal and fetal genotyping
information, informative SNPs were identified on chr2l (range amongst the samples: 1,044
to 1 775 SNPs), and chrRef which included all autosomes except chr2l (range amongst the
samples: 99,581 to 106,950 SNPs). Within the above informative SNPs, fetus-specific allelic
counts (expressed as FC) and shared allelic counts (expressed as SC) were determined for
chr2l (FC 2 1=2 to 19, SC 21=87 to 213) and chrRef (FCRef=390 to 1,622, SCRef= 6,880 to
 18,892). FIG. 3 shows the results calculated for FSR 2 1, FSRRef and FSR              e,
[0076]          As shown in FIG. 4A, the paternally-derived T21 case (FSR              =  2.35) could be
differentiated from the euploid group (FSR              Rf mean 0.91, median 0.96, range 0.70 to 1.10).
On the other hand, the maternally-derived T21 cases (FSR ef mean 1.10, median 1.30, range
0.33 to 1.57) overlapped with the euploid cases (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p=0.366).
             B.            F-S ratio calculation using targetedsequencing data
 [0077]         FIG. 4B shows FSR          ef values were calculated to differentiate the paternally- and
maternally-derived T21 from the euploid fetuses from the non-targeted sequencing data
according to embodiments of the present invention. Among the 1,437 targeted SNP loci on
chr2l and 1,469 SNP loci on chrRef (including chr7, chr13 and chr18), informative SNPs
(chr2l=151 to 273 SNPs, chrRef=145 to 182 SNPs) were identified for each case. The
number of sequenced reads with the fetus-specific and shared alleles were determined for
chr2l (FC 2 I= 197 to 761, SC2I= 3 610 to 7,740) and chrRef (FCRef               = 154 to 473, SCRef
2,786 to 5,557), as shownin table 300.
[0078]          As shown in FIG. 4B, the paternally-derived T21 case (FSR {,=1.68) could be
differentiated from the euploid group (FSR              Rf mean 1.06, median 1.06, range 0.95 to 1.29).
Although the maternally-derived T21 group had lower FSR                   ef values (FSR ef mean 0.94,
median 0.93, range 0.78 to 1.17) (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p=0.05 1), there was still
overlap with the euploid group. However, the overlap decreased. The existence of the
overlap suggests that the number of loci should be increased and/or the level of sequencing
depth increased.
                                                           18
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

             C.             Comparison
[0079]          The paternally-derived T21 case was successfully detected in both non-targeted and
targeted sequencing data. For the maternally-derived T21 cases, this approach became less
effective. Although the mean FSR f values was lower in the maternally-derived T21 cases,
there was significant overlapping in the FSR f values between the euploid and the
maternally-derived T21 cases. The difference in performances between paternally- and
maternally-derived T21 detection was mainly due to the magnitude of the change in FSRR,,
which was increased by 2-fold for paternally-derived T21 and decreased by f/2-fold for
maternally-derived T21 (FIGS. 1B and IC). Thus, the paternally inherited aneuploidy could
be distinguished noninvasively at lower sequencing depth than maternally-inherited
aneuploidy.
 [0080]         Since the fetal DNA represents a minor population in maternal plasma, the lower
fractional concentration of fetal DNA would diminish the degree of FSR , change in
maternally-derived T21. For example, assuming the fractional fetal DNA concentration is
5%, the FSR"2                  of maternally-derived T21 would become 0.975, which is very close to that
of a euploid case (FSR"f =1).
VI.          COMPUTER SIMULATION
[0081]          Computer simulation was employed to investigate the accuracy of the F-S ratio
analysis for T21 detection. The statistical model is based on the assumption that the numbers
of fetus-specific and shared allelic counts should follow a binomial distribution, according to
the fractional fetal DNA concentration in both the paternally- and maternally-derived T21
models. For example, assuming the fractional fetal DNA concentration in the reference
chromosomes (chrRef) is f, the probability of detecting the fetus-specific allele for an
informative SNP would be f/2 on chrRef irrespective of the aneuploidy status of the fetus. On
the other hand, the probability of detecting the fetus-specific allele on chr21 would be f/2 if
the mother is carrying a euploid fetus, 2f/(2+f) if the mother is carrying a paternally-derived
T21 fetus, and f/(2+f) if the mother is carrying a maternally-derived T21 fetus (FIGS. 1A
 IC).
                                                          19
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

[0082]          For illustration purposes, we assumed equal amounts of informative allelic counts
(the summation of fetus-specific and shared allelic counts) were obtained from chr21 and
chrRef. Based on the above assumptions, 1,000 euploid and 1,000 T21 cases were simulated
each time for different fractional fetal DNA concentrations to investigate the detection
accuracy in both the paternally- and maternally-derived T21 models.
[0083]          FIGS. 5A and 5B shows plots of a computer simulation for T21 detection for
fractional fetal DNA concentrations of 5% (FIG. 5B) and 15% (FIG. 5A) according to
embodiments of the present invention. We used computer simulation to determine the
parameters that would further improve the accuracy of the allelic ratio approach for T21
detection. Computer simulation revealed relationships between the fetal DNA proportion, the
number of informative alleles, and the depth of sequencing.
[0084]          In order to obtain a specificity of greater than 99%, the cutoffs for T21
differentiation were chosen at 3 standard deviations above and below the mean F-S ratio of
the euploid group. The sensitivity for paternally- and maternally-derived T21 detection was
investigated on different numbers of informative allelic counts on chr21 and chrRef,
respectively, for a fractional fetal DNA concentration of 15% (A). Similar analysis was
performed for a fractional fetal DNA concentration of 5% (B). (Ma-T21: maternally-derived
T21. Pa-T21: paternally-derived T21. Sen=sensitivity. Fe%= fractional fetal DNA
concentration. Info AC=informative allelic counts on each of chr21 and chrRef. Info
SNP=informative SNPs on each of chr21 and chrRef. Seq depth=sequencing depth. Info AC=
Info SNP x Seq depth).
[0085]          To get the plots of FIG. 5A, the fractional fetal DNA concentration was fixed at
15% and gradually increased the numbers of informative allelic counts on chr21 and chrRef
to investigate the detection accuracy for fetal T21. Additional informative allelic counts
would improve the detection accuracy in both the paternally- and maternally-derived T21
models. In order to obtain accurate detection (sensitivity >99%, specificity >99%), more
informative allelic counts were required for the maternally-derived T21 detection
(informative allelic counts=130,000) than the paternally-derived T21 detection (informative
allelic counts=1,100) (FIG. 5A). If the fractional fetal DNA concentration was reduced to
5%, the corresponding informative allelic counts would need to be increased to 3,600,000 for
detecting maternally-derived T21 and 3,500 for detecting paternally-derived T21 (FIG. 5B).

[0086]          FIG. 6 shows a plot 600 of a computer simulation to investigate the minimal
number of informative allelic counts for T21 detection. The solid curve represents the
minimal number of informative allelic counts required on each of chr21 and chrRef (Y axis),
in order to achieve a reliable detection in maternally-derived T21 (sensitivity >99%,
specificity >99%) according to a given fractional fetal DNA concentration (X axis). The dash
curve represents the paternally-derived T21 model.
 [0087]         When the fractional fetal DNA concentration in maternal plasma was gradually
decreased from 40 % to 1%, the minimal number of informative allelic counts would need to
be increased in both the paternally- and maternally-derived T21 scenarios, in order to
maintain a high detection rate (sensitivity >99%, specificity >99%), but the count increase
was more prominent for the maternally-derived T21 scenario. The sensitivity and specificity
chosen for this analysis were chosen to mirror the recently reported performance of the non
polymorphic tag counting approach [12-14].
VII.         INCREASING ACCURACY
 [0088]         As outlined above, there are various ways one could improve the detection
accuracy. One approach is to increase the fractional concentration of fetal DNA, which would
enlarge the magnitude of FSRif change in maternally-derived T21. Although an early study
attempted to enrich the fetal DNA proportion by formaldehyde treatment of maternal plasma
[7], this method is not ready for use because it has not been consistently reproduced by
different groups [8-10]. Alternatively, the accuracy of detecting maternally-derived T21 can
be improved by increasing the number of informative allelic counts. According to our
simulation analysis, additional informative allelic counts would, to some extent, compensate
for the loss of detection accuracy caused by the decrease in fractional fetal DNA
concentration (FIG. 6). Two approaches can be used to increase the number of informative
allelic counts, namely, recruiting more informative SNPs and sequencing each locus deeper.
In one embodiment, both approaches are used.
             A.            Determining informative loci
[0089]          The number of informative SNPs is generally determined by two factors: the total
number of SNPs on the chromosome of interest for detection and the frequency of
informative SNPs. The latter is the percentage of detectable informative SNPs amongst a
                                                        21
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

group of analyzed SNPs. To investiagete, the fetal genotype information, as determined by
microarray-based analysis of chorionic villus DNA, was used to maximize the frequency of
informative SNPs, the mean value of which is approximately 12% in all fourteen cases of this
study. However, the fetal genomic material would not be available beforehand for actual
NIPD. Therefore, informative SNPs would need to be deduced indirectly, for example, by
selecting SNPs in which the parents are both homozygous but with different alleles (e.g.,
mother is AA and father is BB1). In this scenario, the mean frequency of informative SNPs
would decrease from 12% to 6%, because such an approach would exclude any SNPs in
which the father is heterozygous.
 [0090]        In terms of SNP recruitment, a hybridization-based enrichment system may be used.
In the examples above, we only employed a relatively small number of probes to capture
2,906 SNP loci on the target chromosomes. However, it is possible to increase the number of
analyzed SNP loci. For example, if we design probes to cover all chr21 SNP loci (12,930
SNPs) on the Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix), we could increase the
number of informative SNPs on chr21 to approximately 1,500 SNPs for each case in the
current dataset. If we obtain the same number of informative SNPs on chrRef and sequence
the plasma DNA to a depth of 87 times, we would harvest approximately 130,000
informative allelic counts (1,500 x 87) on chr21 and chrRef, respectively.
 [0091]        Such numbers would allow the relatively robust classification of maternally
inherited T21 from the euploid cases assuming a fractional fetal DNA concentration of 15%
or above (FIG. 5A). Given that in this study the mean frequency of informative SNPs is
approximately 12% and approximately 50% reads could be mapped back to the targeted
regions (with the remaining reads being off-target), the total number of reads required to
obtain 130,000 informative allelic counts would be approximately 4.3 million (130 000 reads
x  2 / (12% x 50%)).
 [0092]        However, if the fractional fetal DNA concentration is reduced to 5%, the number of
reads would need to be increased to approximately 120 million (FIG. 5B). 5% and 15% were
analyzed here because 5% is close to the lower limit for the non-polymorphism-based tag
counting approach at the depth of sequencing used in a number of recent studies, and 15% is
the approximate mean fractional fetal DNA concentration in the published clinical trials
based on the tag counting approach [12-14].
                                                   22
103340161 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

             B.            Sequencing deeper
[0093]          In order to obtain sufficient number of allelic counts, an alternative approach is to
sequence more deeply each locus with a relatively small number of informative SNPs.
According to our previous publication, we demonstrated that each milliliter of plasma
contained approximately 1,000 genome-equivalents of DNA, which would give rise to 2,000
allelic counts for each locus [4]. If we could count all of the alleles for each locus in 5 mL
plasma, we would obtain 10,000 allelic counts for each locus. In this scenario, 26 informative
SNPs (13 SNPs on chr21, 13 SNPs on chrRef) could provide sufficient informative allelic
counts for maternally-derived T21 detection in a sample containing 15% fetal DNA,
representing 130,000 informative allelic counts (10 000          x 13) on chr2l and chrRef,
respectively. The number of informative SNPs would need to be increased to 720 (360 SNPs
on chr2l, 360 SNPs on chrRef) for a sample containing a fractional fetal DNA concentration
of 5%. Due to the high read depth required by this strategy (i.e. 10,000 counts per
informative allele), PCR-based approaches for target enrichment (i.e., amplification methods)
might be alternative methods for this type of application [18,19].
VIII.        MATERIALS AND METHODS
[0094]          We recruited fourteen pregnant women with singleton fetuses (gestational age
ranging from 12 weeks to 13 weeks and 5 days). Maternal peripheral blood samples were
collected prior to CVS. Following CVS, fetal genomic DNA samples were obtained from the
chorionic villi. The aneuploidy or euploidy status were confirmed by full karyotyping.
Among the fourteen cases, seven were T21 fetuses and the rest were euploid.
[0095]          In one implementation, the DNA is extracted in the following way. Maternal
peripheral blood samples (5-10 mL) were centrifuged at 1 600g for 10 min at 4 'C. The
plasma portion (2-5 mL) was recentrifuged at 16 OOOg for 10 min at 4 'C. We removed any
residual plasma from the blood cell portion by recentrifugation at 2 500g for 5 min [16].
Plasma DNA was extracted with the DSP DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen), as described
previously [11]. Fetal and maternal genomic DNA was extracted from chorionic villi and
peripheral blood cells, respectively, with the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. The extracted plasma DNA was quantified by real
time PCR using an ABI 7300 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). A p-globin real-time
                                                     23
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

PCR assay was performed as described previously [4]. A conversion factor of 6.6 pg of DNA
per cell was used to calculate the amount of the extracted plasma DNA.
             A.             Targeted Sequencing of Plasma DNA Libraries
 [0096]         The following is an example of sequencing techniques usable in embodiments. As
the plasma DNA molecules were already fragmented in nature, no additional fragmentation
step was required for this example. 10-30 ng plasma DNA for each case was used for DNA
library construction by the Genomic DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) as previously
described [15], except for the replacement of the adaptors and primers with the
oligonucleotides from the Multiplexing Sample Preparation Oligonucleotide Kit (Illumina)
and the SureSelect Target Enrichment System Kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
 [0097]         In order to obtain high fold sequencing coverage for SNPs, the SureSelect Target
Enrichment System (Agilent) was applied for capturing SNPs in the targeted regions. As a
proof-of-principle study, approximately 5% of the probes were designed to target a total of 2
906 SNP loci on chr7 (313 SNPs), chr13 (564 SNPs), chr18 (592 SNPs) and chr2l (1 437
SNPs), while the remaining probes were designed for another project. 500 ng of each
constructed plasma DNA library was incubated with the probes for 24 h at 65'C. After
hybridization, the captured DNA molecules were eluted and amplified by a 12-cycle PCR
according to manufacturer's instructions. Libraries with and without target enrichment were
indexed for multiplex sequencing on a Genome Analyzer Ix (Illumina) in 50-bp x 2 paired
end format. An additional 7 cycles of sequencing were performed to decode the index
sequence.
 [0098]         All sequenced reads were aligned to the unmasked human reference genome (Hg18)
(genome.ucsc.edu) with the aid of SOAPaligner/soap2 (soap. genomics. org. cn). Two
mismatches were allowed during alignment. The range of fragment sizes of paired-end reads
was defined as 50-600 bp. Duplicated paired-end reads (e.g., reads with identical sequences
and start-end coordinates) were considered clones of the same original plasma DNA
template. All but one of the duplicated reads were filtered, leaving only 1 copy for
subsequent bioinformatics analysis as previously described [15].
                                                        24
10334016_1 (GHMatters) P93457.AU.1

             B.            MicroarrayGenotyping
[0099]          Genotyping was used to confirm the accuracy of the sequencing techniques.
Maternal and fetal genomic DNA samples were genotyped with the Genome-Wide Human
SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix). The parental origin of the additional copy of chr2l in seven T21
fetuses was determined using microarray analysis of the chorionic villus samples in which
the allelic signal intensities for SNPs on chr21 were analyzed. If the fetus has paternally
derived T21, the signal intensity of the fetus-specific allele (B allele) should be 2-fold higher
than the shared allele (A allele), because the fetal genotype would become ABB on chr21,
and vice versa. Using this approach, one fetus was identified as a paternally-derived T2 1,
while six were maternally-derived T21.
