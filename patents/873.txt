[0107]            "Triangular acorn shape" is the shape assumed by the seed pod, seed cone,
planting cone and/ or planting system and as referenced in Figures 1-10, for example.
[0108]            "Plant growing media," "rooting media," or "inner plug," (hereafter collectively
referred to as "rooting media") refer to a media in which a seed(s) is placed and allowed to
germinate into a plant and is housed within the outer shell. An exemplary representation of an
inner plug can be seen in Figures 12-15 and 18-26, for example.
[0109]            "Dibbles," "recesses," "concavities," or "holes" (hereafter collectively referred to
as "dibbles") refer to a depression of shallow to medium depth formed in a surface.                   An
exemplary representation of a dibble can be seen, for example, on the tops of the rooting media,
in Figures 1, 2, 12, 18, and 26, for example.
[0110]            "Indoor growing unit," "indoor planting unit," and the like refer to a unit and/or
system configured to be used indoors to germinate and/or grow plants. The unit is designed to
be modular, self-contained, and house or provide the necessary growing conditions for plants
(e.g., light, water, fertilizer, soil, etc.), such as through the use of a seed pod or planting system as
defined above. The use of a seed pod is not required however, as seeds may be planted directly
into growing media contained within the indoor growing unit. An exemplary embodiments of
the indoor growing unit can be seen, for example, in Figures 33, 42, 43, 44, 46, 50, and 59.

[0111]          Figures 1-11 depict a seed pod 100 according to exemplary embodiments. The
seed pod 100 may have a lid 102, rooting media 106, and an outer shell 114. The lid 102 may be
made of one or more layers 104, such as 104A and 104B. The lid 102 seals the contents of the
seed pod 100 within the outer shell 114. The lid 102 may be made of a biodegradable material
and is configured to fit onto the outer shell 114, fit into the outer shell 114, or be adhered onto a
flange 116 of the outer shell 114. The top of the lid layers 104 may be constructed such that the
top layer 104A may be peeled back to reveal a second layer 104B. The second layer 104B may
have printed instructions thereon or other information relating to the seed pod 100 and its use.
The use of multiple layers according to exemplary embodiments allows for a consumer to review
information relating to seed pod 100 while enabling the seed pod 100 to remain sealed.
According to exemplary embodiments, the seed pod 100 may be 94% biodegradable.
[0112]          The outer shell 114 provides a protective housing unit for the rooting media 106,
the seed(s) 112, and fertilizer 118 and/or nutrient 118 from the external environment
surrounding the seed pod 100.
[0113]          The rooting media 106 has one or more dibbles 110 and external ribs 108. In
between each of the external ribs 108 is a gap 109. The rooting media 106 may be formed or
shaped into a cone, spike, acorn, triangular acorn, or flower pot. Exemplary embodiments of the
rooting media 106A, 106B, 106C, and 106D can be found in Figures 12-15, 18-26, respectively.
         B.     Outer Shell
[0114]          The outer shell 114 of the seed pod 100 provides a protective housing unit for
the rooting media 106, the seed or seeds 112, and fertilizer 118 and/or nutrient 118 from the
external environment surrounding the seed pod 100. During the early stages of plant growth,
the seed pod 100 creates a microenvironment with sufficient nutrients to allow for the successful
germination of the plant. Additionally, the outer shell 114 is configured in such a manner that it
provides a mechanism or platform for inserting the seed(s) 112 into the planting surface.
However, after the initial germination process, the outer shell 114 should be capable of allowing
                                                 14
105517101 .doc

the growing plant to take root in the surrounding external environment. Thus, the outer shell
114 may be sufficiently rigid for initial insertion and protection of the young seed 112 and also
permeable enough to allow the growing plant to take root in the surrounding environment.
[0115]          As described above, the outer shell 114 should be sufficiently rigid and also
biodegradable to allow for root penetration. The materials that are suitable for accomplishing
this object may include formed, moldable, composted, and/or shapeable materials.               Such
materials may include manure, peat moss, brown sugarcane fibers, coir, corn stover, sunflower
stem, white sugarcane fibers or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the outer shell 114 is
composed of a formed, molded, and/or composted material. This might include composted and
molded or formed peat moss.        In another embodiment, the outer shell 114 is composed of
formed or molded manure.          Manure can be derived from any animal source, but in one
embodiment, the manure is derived from a cow, bull, or horse, preferably a cow. In another
embodiment, the outer shell 114 is composed of material derived from poultry feathers.            It
should be appreciated that the materials used in the fabrication of the outer shell 114 can also be
derived from organic and/or natural sources. As such, plants or vegetables that germinate from
the seed pod 100 may be classified and rated as organic.
[0116]          The outer shell 114 of the seed pod 100 is designed to be inserted into a surface.
For example, the surface may be soil. Typically, gardeners desire to pre-dig a hole in the planting
surface to accommodate a plant or seed 112. The outer shell 114 eliminates the need, in some
instances, for pre-digging a hole to receive the seed pod 100. This is accomplished by forming
the outer shell 114 into a specific shape that optimizes penetration into a surface, such as, but
not limited to, dirt, soil, container, raised bed, clay, rocks, gravel, sand, or a tray specifically
adapted to receive the seed pod 100. As such, various shapes of the outer shell 114 may be used
to meet this function.
[0117]           In one embodiment, the outer shell 114 is shaped like a cone, an acorn, or a
combination thereof. It has been found that when the outer shell 114 is shaped as a cone, it
                                                  15
10551710_1.doc

provides the best penetration of the seed pod 100 into the planting surface. It has also been
found that when the outer shell 114 of the seed pod 100 is shaped as an acorn, it provides the
best surface area for germinating the seed.          Accordingly, exemplary embodiments seek to
combine the benefits of both the cone shape and the acorn shaped. Thus, in an embodiment,
the seed pod 100 is shaped as a triangular acorn shape.
[0118]          The overall thickness of the outer shell 114 plays an important role in the
establishment and/or growth of the seed 112 in the seed pod 100. To optimize the protective
environment of the outer shell 114, while also allowing penetration of the roots from a growing
plant, the outer shell 114 may have a particular thickness that withstands insertion into the
planting surface and allows for root penetration. In an embodiment, the thickness of the outer
shell 114 is conserved throughout the entire outer shell 114. This thickness may be in the range
of about 0.025 to 0.25 inches, more preferably in the range of about 0.05 to about 0.15 inches,
and even more preferably in the range of about 0.09 to about 0.13 inches.                 In another
embodiment, the thickness of the outer shell 114 may also be in the range of about 0.08 to about
0.11 inches. In yet another embodiment, the thickness of the outer shell 114 is 0.11 inches.
[0119]          Because soil or dirt may differ from region to region, insertion of the seed pod
100 into the planting surface may cause the outer shell 114 to collapse or crack upon insertion.
Accordingly, the tip or apex 115 of the outer shell 114 may be reinforced.             One type of
reinforcement is to provide a thicker apex or tip 115 such that when the tip 115 of the outer
shell 114 is inserted into the planting surface, it is more rigid than the remainder of the outer
shell 114 and is capable of withstanding a greater impact force. Thus, in one embodiment, the
tip 115 of the outer shell 114 is fabricated or molded by thickening only the tip portion and
graduating the sides of the outer shell 114 with less thickness, such that it preserves the ability of
the plant to extend its roots. Alternatively, the tip 115 may be reinforced with a thickening agent
or solidifying agent, such that it is sufficiently rigid when dry, but biodegradable after sufficient
hydration or moisture.

[0120]          The seed pod 100 can be virtually any circumference. It should be appreciated
that the potential size of the plant generated from the seed 112 as well as the nutritional
requirements of the seed may dictate the overall circumferential size of the seed pod 100. Thus,
some of the factors that may dictate the circumference of the seed pod 100 may include, for
example, the amount of fertilizer 118 or nutrient 118 supply provided in the seed pod 100, the
types of seeds 112 planted, or the types of plant that germinates from the seed pod 100. The
foregoing list of factors is not intended to be an exhaustive list of factors, but a representation of
some of the factors that may dictate the circumferential size of the outer shell 114.
[0121]          Proper depth placement also plays an important role in the successful
germination of a seed. To aid in this process, the seed pod 100 integrates a seed depth indicator
into the outer shell 114. In one embodiment, the seed depth indicator is the flange 116 that is
located at the top of the seed pod 100. The flange 116 forms a lip that guides the user to insert
the seed pod 100 to the proper seed 112 depth. By inserting the pod 100 until the flange 116 is
level with the surrounding soil or dirt, it will indicate to the user that the seed 112 has been
properly positioned for optimal seed germination and growth. Thus, in one embodiment, the
flange 116 extends along the top of the entire periphery of the outer shell 114. The flange 116
may also serve as an area or surface onto which the lid 102 is fastened, secured, or adhered.
         C.     Rooting media
[0122]          Figures 12-15 and 18-26 depict exemplary embodiments of rooting media 106.
Located and housed within the outer shell 114 is the rooting media 106 which provides a
substrate in which the seed will grow. The rooting media 106 may be made of a variety of
materials. These might include, for example, coir (compressed, non-compressed, screened, coir
dust, and/or coir pith), peat, peat moss (for example, sphagnum peat moss), peat humus,
vermiculite, compost perlite, bark, bark fines, composted bark fines, wood shavings, saw dust,
mulch, a modified cornstarch, corn stover, sunflower stem, composted rice hulls, reed sedge
peat, composted manure, composted forest products, coffee grounds, composted paper fiber,
                                                  17
105517101 .doc

digested manure fiber, composted tea leaves, bagasse, yard waste compost, cotton derivatives,
wood ash, bark ash, vegetative by-products, agricultural by-products, or combinations thereof.
In other embodiments, the rooting media may include fertilizers or fertilizing agents. These
materials may also be formed and/or molded into a solid form. In an embodiment, the rooting
media 106 is molded into a cone, acorn, triangular acorn, flower pot, or spike form. In another
embodiment, the rooting media 106 is the Q-PLUG® or EXCEL-PLUG® manufactured and
sold by International Horticultural Technologies, Inc. Hollister, CA 95024.              In another
embodiment, the Q-PLUG® or EXCEL-PLUG® is molded and shaped into a cone, acorn,
triangular acorn, flower pot, or spike shape. In another embodiment, the molded and/or formed
rooting media 106 is adapted to fully or partially fill the interior space defined by the outer shell
114.    Thus, in one embodiment, the rooting media 106 may be formed or shaped into a
truncated cone, spike, acorn, triangular acorn, or flower pot such that it leaves a void at the
bottom interior space of the outer shell 114. Similar to the outer shell 114, the components of
the rooting media 106 may be derived from natural or organic sources. As such, plants or
vegetables that are produced from the seed pods 100 may be classified and rated as organic.
[0123]          Exemplary embodiments include a rooting media 106 in which the molded or
formed shape provides a means to control and retain water for an extended period of time. The
rooting media 106 has been shaped and configured to comprise external ribs that create pockets
or channels between the inner wall of the outer shell 114 and the rooting media 106. In one
embodiment, the external ribs 108 are adapted to frictionally engage the interior wall of the outer
shell 114 such that it holds the rooting media 106 in place, and/or permits the migration of water
into a lower interior chamber, which is created by a truncated rooting media 106. In another
embodiment, the external ribs 108 form open channels or gaps 109 that allow the flow of water
to the bottom of the seed pod 100. In yet another embodiment, the external ribs 108 form
closed channels that reduce the flow of water to the bottom of the seed pod 100. In yet another
                                                 18
10551710_1.doc

embodiment, the external ribs 108 form closed channels that open at the top and continue for
only part of the length of the inner wall of the outer shell 114.
[0124]          Without being bound by any particular theory, the channels created by the
external ribs 108 allow the flow of water to rooting media 106 as well as the outer shell 114.
This provides an accelerated hydration of the entire seed pod 100 that allows for enhanced or
rapid germination of a seed 112. In one embodiment, the shaped and molded rooting media 106
comprises between 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 external ribs 108 or gaps
109.    In another embodiment, the shaped and molded rooting media 106 may comprise 4
external ribs 108 or gaps 109.
[0125]          The external ribs 108 and gaps 109 may also provide other functions. First, the
external ribs 108 may act as friction points with the outer shell 114 to prevent the rooting media
106 from falling out when it is dry. Second, the gaps 109 may provide water channels and water
retention within the channels during the watering and growing phases of the seed. When users
water the seed pod 100, water will travel through the channels and fill the fertilizer area that is
located beneath the rooting media 106 in the apex 115 of the seed pod 100.                  As water
accumulates, the water will travel back through the channels and may accumulate in these
channels until it is further absorbed by either the seed, rooting media 106, or fertilizer 118, or
diffuses out of the seed pod 100. Third, it serves a functional role by preventing buoyancy of the
rooting media 106 from lifting out of the outer shell 114. The gaps 109 act as air release valves
which allow pressure within the fertilizer chamber to be released.
[0126]          In another embodiment, the rooting media 106 may be recessed from the top
flange 116 of the outer shell 114 to provide a water holding reservoir. While not being bound by
any particular theory, as a user waters the seed pod 100, the recessed area may hold additional
quantities of water that will funnel through the channels created by the external ribs 108 molded
into the rooting media. This reservoir provides extended hydration to the seeds 112 within the
                                                  19
105517101 .doc

seed pod 100. In another embodiment, the rooting media 106 may comprise a water absorbent
polymer to aid in the retention of water over a duration of time.
[0127]           According to exemplary embodiments, the rooting media 106 may comprise
dibbles 110 that provide areas for seed positioning, housing, or receiving.         It should be
appreciated that the number of dibbles 110 made in the rooting media 106 will depend on the
seed 112 types planted.      In an embodiment, there are three dibbles 110 in the surface of the
rooting media 106, such as shown in Figure 1, for example. In yet another embodiment, there
may be two dibbles 110 in the surface, such as shown in Figure 22, for example. Other numbers
and configurations of dibbles are possible. In another embodiment the rooting media 106 may
comprise slits for positioning, housing or receiving a seed 112. In another embodiment, the
rooting media 106 may comprise up to four slits.
[0128]           Once the seed 112 is placed within the dibble 110, the seed may be covered or
overlaid by a variety of materials to prevent the seed 112 from falling out of the dibble 110. In
an embodiment, the cover for the dibble 110 may be a biodegradable plug, a biodegradable lid, a
water permeable adhesive, coir dust admixed with an adhesive material (e.g., EnviroHold@,
polyvinyl acetate coating, starched based), or combinations thereof. An exemplary cover 105A is
depicted in Figure 1 in the form of a cylindrical plug. This is meant to be exemplary and non
limiting since a variety of cover types and shapes may be used as described herein. For example,
the cover 105A may be conically shaped or flat. Furthermore, a single cover 105A is depicted. It
should be appreciated that each of the dibbles 110 may have a cover 105A.          In a particular
embodiment, the cover 105A that overlays each of the dibbles 110 may be inserted into the
dibbles 110 and plugged in a wine-cork fashion and held in place by friction.          In another
embodiment, the dibble filler, plug, lid, or cover 105A may be held in place by an adhesive
substance, which may be made of polymers or from natural products.
[0129]           In another exemplary embodiment, as depicted in Figure 2, a cover 105B for the
dibble may be made of coir fines. The coir fines may be held in place by an adhesive. The
                                                 20
105517101 .doc

adhesive may be applied using a spray such that the coir fines are saturated by the adhesive and
held in place thereby. The adhesive may be transparent. The cover 105B depicted in Figure 2
may cover the majority of the upper surface of rooting media 106B. Thus, the coir fines that
make up the cover 105B may be applied in a bulk manner during the assembly of the planting
system 100.     In some embodiments, the cover 105B may be applied to each dibble 110
individually and then held in place by adhesive. It should be appreciated that in Figure 2, only a
single seed 112 is depicted for illustrative purposes, however, like Figure 1 there may be a seed
for each dibble 110. In other embodiments, the cover 105B for the dibble 110 may be held in
place by a mechanical means. In one embodiment the dibble cover 105B may be a biodegradable
plug made of peat, coir (compressed, non-compressed, screened, coir dust, and/or coir pith),
peat moss (for example, sphagnum peat moss), peat humus, vermiculite, compost, perlite, bark,
bark fines, composted bark fines, wood shavings, saw dust, mulch, a modified cornstarch, corn
stover, sunflower stem, composted rice hulls, reed sedge peat, composted manure, composted
forest products, coffee grounds, composted paper fiber, digested manure fiber, composted tea
leaves, bagasse, yard waste compost, cotton derivatives, wood ash, bark ash, or biofoam available
through Natur-tech (e.g., Natur-tech nuudles), cookie pellets, vegetative by-products, agricultural
by-products,, or combinations thereof, that plugs into the dibbles 110 possessing seeds 112. In
another embodiment, the dibble cover may be a biodegradable lid made of biofoam, polyvinyl
alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, or combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the dibble cover is
made of an adhesive that may be natural or synthetic. These may include for example, guar gum,
pine tar, seed-flour based, starch based adhesives, biofoams, polyvinyl alcohols, cookie meal,
molasses, natural rubber emulsions, vegetable oils (e.g., neem oil), gelatins, or combinations
thereof. As indicated above, the rooting media 102, lid 102, and/or adhesive may be composed
and constructed of natural or organic materials such that the final plant or vegetable product
produced from the seed pod 100 may be designated as an organic product. It should be
appreciated that the material and type of covering for the dibbles 110 may vary and may be freely
                                                 21
105517101 .doc

substituted by any material that comports with the general concepts described herein. As such,
the types and components used to make the dibble covering should not be so limited to those
specifically recited above.
          D.     Seeds and other plant parts
[0130]           It should be appreciated that the seed pod 100 may be used to grow and
germinate a wide variety of plants. These plants may generally include, for example, flowers,
vegetable, fruits, herbs, grass, trees, or perennial plant parts (e.g., bulbs, tubers, roots, crowns,
stems, etc.). Certainly, any plant that a gardener can envision may be incorporated into the seed
pod 100 according to exemplary embodiments. While it is not an exhaustive list, the types of
plant seeds 112 that may be included in the seed pod 100 are globe tomato, cherry tomato, roma
tomato, cantaloupe, honey dew, jalapeno pepper, sweet pepper, straight cucumber, zucchini,
yellow zucchini, watermelon, pumpkin, basil, cilantro, dill, thyme, bush bean, looseleaf lettuce,
butterhead lettuce, romaine lettuce, smooth leaf spinach, snap pea, oregano, thyme, mint, radish,
eggplant, broccoli, collards, cabbage, leek, zinnia, sunflower, marigold, carrot, corn, beet, parsnip,
turnip, swiss chard, fennel, Marjoram, or combinations thereof. In exemplary embodiments,
each seed pod 100 may include one or more seeds. As described herein, the seeds 112 are placed
into the dibble(s) 110, of the rooting media 106. According to exemplary embodiments, one
seed 112 may be placed in each dibble 110.
[0131]           In another embodiment, the seed 112 may be coated with various agricultural
agents that may help preserve the longevity of the seed 112. These coatings may help prevent
the dehydration of the seed 112 and/or provide protection from various other adverse effects.
These coatings may include, for example, fungicides, insecticides, biocides, coatings to promote
water absorption and retention, or any other agricultural agent that is generally known in the art.
In an embodiment, the agricultural agents may be organic or naturally derived agents that are
environmentally safe and help attain organic product classification. In one embodiment, the
seed may be coated with a fertilizer or a fertilizing agent. One of skill in the art would readily
                                                  22
10551710_1.doc

understand that various types of fertilizers or fertilizing agents may be coated onto the seed and
these types are generally known in the art. In another embodiment, the seed may be coated with
agents (e.g., limestone, talc, clay, cellulose or starch) that help to pellet the seed, which results in
a more uniform seed product.
[0132]            Seed depth may be a critical component for optimal seed germination.
Exemplary embodiments simplify this process by providing a seed pod 100 that places the seed
112 at the appropriate depth for consistent seed germination. Thus in one embodiment, the
seed 112 is located at a depth of about 0.125 inches to about 3 inches below the planting surface.
In another embodiment, the seeds 112 are located at a depth of about 0.125 inches to about 3
inches below the top of the seed pod 100. In another embodiment, the seeds 112 are located at
a depth of about 0.125 inches to about 0.750 inches below the top of rooting media 106. As
described above, the flange 116 may provide an aid in proper insertion of the seed pod 100 to an
appropriate depth in the surface.
          E.      Fertilizers and Nutrients
[0133]            It should be appreciated that any type of fertilizer 118 may be used with
exemplary embodiments.         It is generally understood that fertilizers, fertilizer compositions,
nutrients, and/or micronutrients are compositions comprising food for the plant. Common
ingredients within the fertilizer 118 include nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (aka NPK) but
the fertilizer is not to be limited by the aforementioned. Other ingredients that may be included
within the fertilizer 118 including anhydrous ammonia, urea, methylene ureas, IBDU,
ammonium nitrate, calcium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, diammonium phosphate (aka DAP),
monoammonium phosphate (MAP), tetrapotassium pyrophosphate (TKPP), muriate of potash,
potassium nitrate, potassium magnesium sulfate, triple superphosphate, or combinations or
derivatives thereof.       Other secondary nutrients may also be included such as, for example,
calcium, magnesium, sulfur, micronutrients such as iron, copper, zinc, manganese, boron,

         H.     Methods of planting and growing a seed
[0148]          Exemplary embodiments envision various methods of utilizing the seed pod 100.
In an embodiment, a method of growing a plant comprising planting the plant growing system
                                                   28
105517101 .doc

and watering said plant growing system is used. Such a method envisions growing the seed 112
such that the germinated seed may be subsequently transplanted. In another embodiment, a
method of planting includes pushing a plant seed pod 100 into a surface, without the need for
digging a hole, and watering the inserted seed pod 100. In another embodiment, planting the
seed pod 100 requires preparing a surface adapted to receive the seed pod 100.
          I.    Indoor Growing Unit
[0149]          The seed pod may also be paired with an indoor growing unit according to
exemplary embodiments as described above and depicted in Figures 33, 42, 43, 44, 46, 50, and
59, for example.
[0150]          The indoor growing unit 300 may have a stand 304, a light source 302, a base
plate 308, one or more growing containers 310, one or more cloches or covers 312 to cover the
growing containers 310, one or more pod trays 314 which fit in the growing containers 310, and
a water reservoir 318. The unit is designed to incorporate these elements into a compact design
suitable for placement on a kitchen counter.       For example, the system may be placed on a
kitchen counter under upper cabinets so as not to impede the most readily accessible work
surface.
[0151]          The indoor growing unit 300 is designed to start plants from a seed indoors, such
as, for example, in a consumer's home.       Plants can be started in the unit 300 and later be
transplanted outdoors, or can be grown directly to harvest. For example, plants suitable for
transplant include tomatoes and peppers, and plants that may be grown to harvest include salad
greens and herbs. The unit 300 is designed to function with the seed pods 100 as described
above, and also, according to exemplary embodiments, be used with seeds 112, such as plain
vegetable seeds, that may also be planted directly into the unit into an appropriate growing media
in the growing container 310. The indoor growing unit 300 is configured such that the seed
pods 100 as described above can be placed either into a pod tray 314 or seeds 112 can be placed
into the growing container 310 directly into appropriate growing media, such as soil, and then
                                                 29
10551710_1.doc

using the integrated light source 302 and water reservoir 318 the plant seeds 112 can be
germinated and grown. It should be appreciated that the seed pods 100 or seeds 112 can be
placed directly into growing media 310.
[0152]           The indoor growing unit 300 is designed to be modular and transportable. For
example, the base plate 308 with the water reservoir 318, growing container(s) 310 and pod
tray(s) 314 may be removed from the stand 304 and light unit 302 for transport and/or use. For
example, the base plate 308 may be used outdoors as a self-watering growing unit. Being used
outdoors, the light source 302 may not be required. Additionally, the base plate 308 and/or
growing containers 310, with or without pod trays 314, may be taken outside to adapt seedlings
to temperatures and sunlight in preparation for transplant.    Furthermore, this modularity allows
for removal of the base plate 308 or individual growing containers 310 for easier access to plants
for harvest. For example, easier access to plants for harvest, such as lettuces and herbs, may be
provided by this modularity. Each growing container 310 is covered with a cloche or cover 312.
According to exemplary embodiments, the cloche 312 is transparent and provides a way to retain
moisture (e.g., maintain humidity) and heat within the growing container 310 to contribute to a
favorable growth atmosphere for the seeds 112 in the seed pod 100 or directly planted in the
growing container 310.
[0153]           The unit 300 has a light unit 302 that is attached to a stand 304 through a post
assembly 306. The light unit 302 may be removably mounted to the post assembly 306. The
post assembly 306 is detachably mated with the stand 304. The stand 304 may have trough 326
which may be used to contain decorative elements or provide added storage space. For example,
the trough 326 may be filled with rocks or other items, such as, extra pods or harvesting shears.
Alternatively, the stand 304 may lack the trough 326. The trough 326 may be of a closed
construction which precludes the placement of rocks or other items therein. The unit 300 may
be composed primarily of plastic, such as ABS. Alternative embodiments may be composed of
other durable materials, such as metal, or combinations of materials, such as metal and plastic.
                                                30
105517101 .doc

[0154]          The stand or base 304 of the indoor growing unit includes a base plate 308, a
water reservoir 318, one or more growing containers 310, and one or more pod trays 308 in the
growing containers 310. The growing containers 310 and water reservoir 318 may fit tightly over
the base plate 308 to further minimize light exposure to the water in the base plate 308 to help
prevent algal growth. For example, there may be three growing containers 310. Each growing
container 310 can be configured to contain a number of seed pods 100 using the pod tray 314.
For example, the pod tray 314 may be configured to contain up to six seed pods 100. The
growing containers 310 and pod trays 314 are both removable. A moisture indicator may be
used. The moisture indicator may be placed into one or more seed pods or soil in the growing
container 310 (depending how the unit is configured) to indicate the moisture level which may
provide an indication of the water status of the unit.
[0155]          The indoor growing unit 300 may be configured such that assembly requires no
tools and parts are easily snapped together and taken apart. Once transplanting or harvesting has
occurred, the entire system can be disassembled for cleaning. For example, the base plate 308,
the pod trays 314, and the growing containers 310 can be washed and reused for the next
growing cycle to prevent contamination. The parts of the indoor growing unit 300, such as the
base plate 308, the pod trays 314, and the growing containers 310 may be dishwasher safe.
[0156]          The indoor growing unit 300 has a base plate 308.         The base plate 308, as
depicted in Figure 39, is configured to fit over the inner two projections 324 of the stand 304 as
depicted in Figures 33, which show this integration and Figure 40 shows the stand 304 with the
inner two projections 324.     The base plate 308 is configured to accommodate at least one
growing container 310. According to exemplary embodiments, three growing containers 310
may be used with the base plate 308. Each growing container 310 may have a cover or grow
dome 312. As depicted in Figure 36, the cover 312 may be transparent. The cover 312 may be
made of plastic or another suitable material. Within each growing container 310, may be a pod
tray 314. The pod tray 314 may be configured to hold a plurality of seed pods. For example,
                                                 31
105517101 .doc

each pod tray 314 may hold up to six seed pods 100. The base plate 308 has a water tank or
reservoir 318. It should be appreciated that each growing container 310, each cover 312, each
pod tray 314, and the water reservoir 318 may be removable from the base plate 308.
[0157]           According to exemplary embodiments, the indoor growing unit 300 is designed
to meet plant physiological needs and may have two, T-5 lights in the light unit 302 that provide
the proper light quality and quantity for best plant growth. The lights may be programmable to
run for a particular length of time, without the need for manually turning on/off of the lights.
For example, the lights may run on 16 hour days with a nightly rest period to support plant
photosynthesis and respiration needs. The light hood is adjustable, allowing the light to easily be
moved to the proper distance above the growing portion or plant canopy for optimum growing
conditions.
[0158]           The light unit 302 may be movable on the post assembly 306 such that the
vertical height of the light unit 302 may be adjusted. For example, the light unit 302 may be
adjustable using a ratchet type system. Furthermore, the light unit 302 may be movable in other
axes to allow positioning the light unit 302. The light unit 302 has, on its underside, one or more
light sources. The light sources may be light bulbs or tubes as appreciated by one of ordinary
skill in the art. The light unit 302 may accommodate differing types of light sources such as
fluorescent, LED, halogen, and incandescent. Specialized agricultural and/or horticultural lights
may be used. For example, the light unit may have two lights that are grow lights that offer full
spectrum lighting in the appropriate temperature to support plant growth. The two lights may
have a color temperature appropriate for plant growth. For example, the lights may be T5HO
lights from Sunblaster, Inc.. According to exemplary embodiments, the lights may be 24 watts
and and have a color temperature of 6400K. In some embodiments, other types of lights may be
used that operate at other wattages and color temperature. For example, 2700K or 10,000K T5
type lights may be used. The lights used in the light unit 302 may be white lights but it should be
appreciated that other colors may be used as appropriate.
                                                32
105517101 .doc

[0159]          The light unit 302 may have one or more reflectors. The reflectors may be made
of plastic and may be lined with a reflective material, such as, for example, a Mylar material. The
reflector may be configured to mimic the curvature of the T-5 bulb, effectively reflecting the
light downward towards the growing containers. For example, the light unit 302 may have two
reflectors, one for each of the two light bulbs. For example, a T5HO nanotech reflector from
Sunblaster, Inc. may be used with each light.       It should be appreciated that other types of
reflectors may be used.
[0160] The light unit 302 may be powered through a power source. For example, the light unit
302 may have a power cord (not shown), which may be contained within the stand/ or post
assembly, for plugging into an outlet. The light unit may incorporate a mechanism, such as an
electronic or mechanical timer, for programming the on/off light period automatically.
[0161]          The light unit 302 has a hood portion 303 that encloses the lights. The hood
portion 303 may adjustable by tilting the hood 303 up and sliding it up and down along the neck
306. The neck 306 has notches that allow the hood 303 to be secured in place at the desired
height. Alternatively, different adjustment mechanisms may be used. For example, friction pads
may hold the hood 302 at a desired height using gravity. Alternatively, a tightening screw or
knob or series of pegs and holes may serve to secure the light at a desired height.
[0162]          The indoor growing unit 300 also has a watering reservoir 318, which provides a
constant water table for moisture wicking from the growing media or seed pods 100. The water
reservoir 318 is contained so as to provide a barrier from and positioned away from the light
source for added safety. The water reservoir 318 is designed to contain a quantity of water that
is dispensed from the reservoir through a cap (not shown) which covers opening 319. The cap
may have a spring loaded outlet or valve that is actuated when the reservoir is placed into the
base. The water is dispensed directly into the base plate. The reservoir 318 is configured such
that water flows from the reservoir 318 to maintain a particular depth of water in the base of the
indoor growing unit. For example, the water depth may be maintained at 2 inch. This water
                                                33

level allows moisture to be drawn up as the growing media or seed pod needs it, helping solve
consumer issues of over or under watering. The reservoir 318 also allows consumers to spend
less time watering and have a greater amount of time in between watering. The water reservoir
318 is removable from the unit 300 and can be refilled by a user and then replaced in the unit,
rather than requiring the consumer to move the entire unit or bring water to the unit to refill the
water reservoir 318. To refill the water reservoir 318, water is filled through the cap, which is
removable, and then water can be filled into the opening 319. The water reservoir 318 is further
designed to not leak or spill once filled and water will only exit the reservoir once placed into the
growing unit and the cap is actuated. The water reservoir 318 may be opaque (such as shown for
example in Figure 50 (water reservoir 2119) or its material may contain an additive to block or
otherwise minimize light from reaching the water, thereby helping to prevent algal growth. The
water reservoir 318 may be transparent as shown, for example, in Figure 49 (water reservoir
2118).    The water reservoir 318 may incorporate a visual water level indicator to allow visual
inspection of the reservoir's water level. For example, a visual inspection port or strip may be
used, a gauge may be used, or the water reservoir may be partially or completely transparent.
[0163]          The water reservoir 318 may have an opening or inlet 319 (see Figure 41, for
example). A cap (not shown) may be used to close this opening 319 and provide flow control
for water exhaust from the reservoir.      The cap may have a spring loaded valve to allow for
exhaust of water from the reservoir 318 into the base plate 308. The spring loaded valve may
provide flow metering for water exhaust.       The spring loaded valve may be actuated through
contact with a circular protrusion 332 on the base plate 308. The cap may attach to the water
reservoir 318 through a threaded connection as shown in the figures.
[0164]          The indoor growing unit is designed to be modular and have a particular number
of growing containers 310. For example, the indoor growing unit may have up to three growing
containers 310.   It should be appreciated that other numbers of growing containers 310 are
possible. These growing containers 310 may be alternatively referred to as grow trays. Each
                                                 34
10551710_1.doc

growing container 310 may contain a pod tray 314. This modularity provides flexibility for
different growing configurations. For example, one growing container 310 could be utilized to
start transplants using a pod tray 314 while the other two growing containers 310 could be used
to grow herbs to harvest in growing media, using seed pods, or seeds. The growing containers
310 are dimensionally deep enough to provide enough growing media for healthy root growth
and development and growing space is optimized for growing plants either to harvest or
transport. The growing containers 310 are rectangular with hollow pedestals 322. According to
exemplary embodiments, each growing container 310 may have six hollow pedestals 322 with
holes in their bottom portion that allow water to enter the pedestal. Through these holes, water
is allowed to directly contact with the seed pod or growing media. Through this contact, a
wicking action may be established to allow for the water to provide moisture to the seed pod or
the growing media supporting plant germination and growth. It should be appreciated that each
of the six hollow pedestals 322 may be covered by a permeable or semi-permeable mesh to
prevent growing media from exiting through the opening but still allow water to wick from the
base plate 308 to the growing media in the growing container 310.
[0165]           To support transplant growing, the pod tray 314 may be used, which simplifies
the transplant experience. This pod tray 314 is designed to receive and hold plurality of seed
pods. For example, each tray may hold up to six seed pods. The pod tray 314 suspends the seed
pods without growing media in the growing container 310 and allows the tips of the pods to
touch the water that is located at the bottom of the growing container 310 through the hole in
the bottom portion of the pedestal feet 322 as described above. The pod tray 314 is supported
in the growing container 310 by a flange 336 with is configured to rest on an inner lip 338 of the
growing container 310. The pod tray 314 is thus suspended at a predetermined height for proper
exposure of the tips of the seed pods to water by way of resting on the inner lip 338 surrounding
the inside perimeter of the growing container 310. Further, the openings in the bottom of the
pod tray allow proper water uptake and root growth while the tray itself maintains the seed pod
                                                35
105517101 .doc

shape. The seed pods can be easily pushed out of the pod tray from these holes in the bottom to
release the seed pod for transplant in another container or garden.
[0166]           To support growing to harvest, the growing container 310 may be used without
the pod tray 314 and is filled with a growing media. The growing media fills growing container
310 and the growing media is in communication with the water in the base plate 308 through the
holes in the bottom of each of the pedestals. Seed pods may be planted directly into growing
media. Alternatively, seeds could also be planted in the growing container 310 directly into the
growing media.
[0167]           Each growing container 310 has a cover or cloche 312.           The cover 312 is
designed to trap heat and moisture in the growing container 310 because having a warm and
moist environment can increase the speed of germination. The cover 312 has several vents along
the side and top, which allow for removal of excess heat and moisture.
[0168]           The base plate 308 may have a series of raised projections 328. These raised
projections 328 support the underside of the growing container 310 to provide for proper
placement of each growing container and may serve to support the bottom surface of the
growing containers, suspending the growing containers at the optimum height for interaction of
the soil or seed pod tips with the water contained in the base plate 308.
[0169]           Alternatively, the raised projections 328 may mate with the pedestals 322 of each
growing container 310 to provide for proper placement and to secure the growing container 310.
The base plate 308 may have also have raised portions 330 which accommodate the inner
projections 324 of the stand 304. The base plate 308 has a circular protrusion 332 which is
configured to actuate the valve in the cap of the water reservoir as described above.
[0170]           It should be appreciated that the unit may be portable and can be moved without
disassembly. Alternatively, the base plate 308, with any growing containers 310 and the water
reservoir 318 can be moved. For example, the base plate 308 and its contents may be moved to
an exterior location where the stand and light unit are not required.

[0171]          It should further be appreciated the positioning and structure of the various
components is exemplary. Changes in structure, size, shape, and positioning may be possible. In
some embodiments, the indoor growing unit 300 may lack the reservoir 318, the pod tray 314,
and the cover 312. In these embodiments, for example, water may be added directly to the base
unit 308.
[0172]          For example, Figure 42 depicts an indoor unit 1800 according to exemplary
embodiments, with differing structure from the unit 300, such as, for example, having a water
reservoir 1818 being located at the rear of the unit.         This and other differences may be
appreciated from Figure 42 also. Unit 1800 is also shown lacking covers 312 (although such
covers could be included).     Figure 43 depicts another exemplary embodiment 1900 with a
transparent water reservoir 1918 located at the rear of the unit. It should be appreciated that, as
described above, the water reservoir 318 may be transparent. Unit 1900 is also shown lacking
covers 312 (although such covers could be included).         Figure 44 depicts another exemplary
embodiment 2000, that has similar parts to the other embodiments.           Figures 45-54 depict
another exemplary embodiment 2100 that uses a capillary mat structure to provide wicking of
water between the base unit and the seed pods. Figures 59-62 depict yet another exemplary
embodiment that lacks a separate water tank and has a divider structure for support of the seed
pods in the growing containers.
[0173]          It should be appreciated however that the various embodiments of the indoor
growing unit depicted herein may also include the various features described above with respect
to the indoor unit 300 to the extent that such features are not described below. The descriptions
of the various embodiments of the indoor growing units may focus on the differences and other
features for each embodiment.        For example, each of the various indoor growing unit
embodiments may include the lights and associated reflectors as described above.          In some
embodiments, the features may be modified or structurally different but perform the same or
                                                37
10551710_1.doc

similar functions to those described above for the indoor unit 300. For example, a different type
of light and/or reflector may be used or a different type of watering system may be used.
[0174]          Figure 42 depicts an indoor growing unit 1800 according to exemplary
embodiments. The unit 1800 has a light unit 1802 that is attached to a stand 1804 through a
post assembly 1806. The light unit 1802 may be removably mounted to the post assembly 1806.
The post assembly 1806 is detachably mated with the stand 1804. The stand 1804 may have
trough 1805 which may be used to contain decorative elements or provide added storage space.
For example, the trough 1805 may be filled with rocks or other items, such as, extra pods or
harvesting shears. Alternatively, the stand 1804 may lack the trough 1805.
[0175]          The indoor growing unit 1800 has a base plate 1808.         The base plate 1808 is
configured to accommodate at least one growing container 1810.             According to exemplary
embodiments, three growing containers 1810 may be used with the base plate 1808.             Each
growing container 1810 may have a cover or grow dome (not shown). Within each growing
container 1810 may be a pod tray. The pod tray may be configured to hold a plurality of seed
pods as described above. For example, each pod tray may hold up to six seed pods. The base
plate 1808 has a water tank or reservoir 1818.       It should be appreciated that each growing
container 1810, each cover, each pod tray, and the water reservoir 1818 may be removable from
the base plate 1808.
[0176]          The water reservoir 1818 may have a water level indicator (not shown).        The
water level indicator indicates the water level in the water reservoir. The water level indicator
may be transparent or opaque. This indicator may be a float type indicator.          It should be
appreciated that other water level indicators may be used.
[0177]          In Figures 43-44 depict additional exemplary embodiments of the indoor unit as
described above, such as indoor unit 1900 and 2000. These indoor units have similar features to
those of indoor unit 1800, with similar structures labeled with similar reference numbers having a
"19" or "20" prefix instead of "18."

[0178]             Figures 45-54 depict an indoor unit 2100. The indoor unit 2100 is depicted with
a capillary mat 2122 secured by a securing bar 2124 in place in the bottom of the growing
container 2110. This capillary mat 2122 and securing bar 2124 may be present in each growing
container 2110 or in a subset of the growing containers. The capillary mat 2122 may be made of
a material capable of absorbing and wicking water. The capillary mat 2122 may be reusable for
multiple growing sessions or uses of the unit 2100. The capillary mat 2122 may have a certain
lifespan after which it requires replacement. The capillary mat 2122 may be of a rectangular
shape that is configured to be indented or folded down a central portion. This fold allows for
the securing bar 2124 to be placed within the fold to secure and press down the capillary mat
into the growing container 2110. The growing container 2110 may have a slot or other opening
in its base to allow the capillary mat 2122 with the securing bar 2124 to extend through the
growing container's base. In this manner, the capillary mat 2122 may be placed in contact with
the water present in the base 2108. Through this contact, water may be wicked or otherwise
caused to migrate from the base 2108, through the capillary mat 2122 to either the growing
media in which the seed pods or seed is planted in the growing container 2110 or to the seed
pod tray 314. The seed pod tray 2114 may rest upon the capillary mat 2122 when it is present in
the growing container 2110. A seed pod 100 that is present in the seed pod tray 2114 may then
have access to the water through this contact. The seed pod sits within the seed pod tray 2114
and its bottom portion may allow this contact. The unit 2100 may have water reservoir 2118.
The water reservoir 2118 may be transparent. In some embodiments, the water reservoir 2119
may be opaque as shown in Figure 50. The water reservoir may have an opening 2121. The
opening 2121 may contain a cap or valve (not shown). The cap or valve may be removed to
facilitate filling of the reservoir. The cap or valve may be a one-way flow device to allow water
to exit the opening 2121. The water reservoir 2118 or 2119 may have a visual indicator 2120 to
visually show the water level in the reservoir. The visual indicator 2120 may be a float type
indicator. It should be appreciated that other types of indicators may be used.

[0179]          Figure 51 depicts a cross-section view of a growing container 2110 and a pod tray
2114. A capillary mat 2122 is shown along with a securing bar 2124. The opening or slot 2126 is
shown through which the capillary mat 2122 and the securing bar 2124 extend into the base
2108. An opening 2128 at the base of the pod tray 2114 is in contact with the capillary mat
2124. A seed pod (not shown) may be placed in the pod tray. The bottom portion of the seed
pod cone would extend into the opening 2128 and contact the capillary mat 2124, according to
some embodiments. Figure 52 provides another view of the components depicted in Figure 51.
The capillary mat 2122 is shown in an unfolded state 2122'.
[0180]          Figures 49 and 50 depict a further embodiment for use with the growing tray
2110. A seed pod 100 (in cross section with only the outer shell 114 shown) is in the pod tray
2114. As depicted in Figure 51, its bottom cone portion extends into the opening 2128. A
bridge 2132 is located in the opening 2128 between the cone tip and the capillary mat 2122. The
bridge 2132 facilitates water wicking from the capillary mat 2122 to the seed pod 2130. The
bridge 2132 may be made of a suitable material to facilitate the water wicking. The water may
wick through the bridge 2132 to the seed pod 2130. The bridge 2132 may have an open center
portion as depicted in Figure 53 or the bridge 2132 may be a closed structure. As depicted in
Figure 53, multiple bridges 2132 may be used under each opening 2128 of the pod tray 2114.
[0181] Figures 59 through 62 depict an indoor growing unit 2200 according to exemplary
embodiments. The unit 2200 has a light unit 2202 that is attached to a stand 2204 through a
post assembly 2206. The light unit 2202 may be removably mounted to the post assembly 2206.
The post assembly 2206 is detachably mated with the stand 2204. The stand 2204 may be
enclosed and lack any trough structure.
[0182]          The indoor growing unit 2200 has a base plate 2208. The base plate 2208 may be
detachably mated with the stand 2204. The base plate 2208 is configured to accommodate at
least one growing container 2210.       According to exemplary embodiments, three growing
containers 2210 may be used with the base plate 2208 as shown. Within each growing container
                                                 40

2210 may be structure to accommodate a plurality of seed pods 2216. For example, up to six
seed pods may be accommodated in each growing container. The seed pod 2216 may be any of
the embodiments of a seed pod as described above. For example, the seed pod 2216 may be the
seed pod 100 as described over. Each growing container 2210 may be removable from the base
plate 2208.
[0183]           Within each growing container 2210 may be a number of elements to hold the
seed pods. The structure may include a top portion 2212 and a pod divider 2214. The pod
divider 2214 may provide support for the top portion 2212 and serve as a separator for each
seed pod 2216. In Figure 60, it should be appreciated that only the outer shell portion of the
seed pod 2216 is depicted. The top portion 2212 may be removed and the seed pods placed into
the pod divider 2214. According to exemplary embodiments, growing media, such as, but not
limited to soil, may be added to the interior volume of the growing container 2210 upon removal
of the top cover 2212 prior to the seed pods 2216 be placed. Once the growing media has been
filled in, one or more seed pods 2216 may be inserted into the growing media. The pod divider
2214 may serve to provide a separator for the seed pods 2216 to provide for proper spacing and
placement of each seed pod 2216. The growing media may provide support for each seed pod
2216. The top cover 2212 may be replaced following insertion of the seed pods. The top cover
2212 may serve to protect the seed pods and prevent foreign objects or material from entering
the growing container 2210.
[0184]           In some embodiments the top portion 2212 may have openings 2228 through
which each seed pod 2216 may be inserted without removing the top portion 2212. In other
embodiments, the growing media may be filled through these openings.
[0185]           The top portion 2212 may have two halves 2220A and 2220B as depicted in
Figure 61. The two halves may be divided along a section 2222. The top portion 2212 may be
perforated to allow for penetration of moisture and air through its upper surface, for example.
The top portion 2212 may be made of a suitable material. For example, the top portion 2212
                                                 41
105517101 .doc

may be made of plastic. The two halves 2220A and 2220B may allow for removal of the top
cover 2212 once any plants have germinated and grown and need to be removed from the
growing container 2210. The halves may allow such removal without damage or disturbing of
any plants growing.
[0186] The growing container 2210 may have a bottom structure as depicted in Figure 38, for
example. Thus, the bottom structure of the growing container 2210 may have hollow pedestals
322. Each growing container 2210 may have six hollow pedestals 322 with holes in their bottom
portion that allow water to enter the pedestal. Through these holes, water is allowed to directly
contact with the seed pod or growing media. Through this contact, a wicking action may be
established to allow for the water to provide moisture to the seed pod or the growing media
supporting plant germination and growth. According to exemplary embodiments, as described
above, the growing container 2210 may be filled with growing media, such as, but not limited to,
soil. The growing media may fill the volume of the growing container 2210 including each of the
hollow pedestals 322. Water, in the interior volume 2209 of the base unit 2208 may then be
wicked into the growing container and eventually into contact with each seed pod 2216.
[0187] The indoor growing unit 2200 may lack a separate water reservoir. The water need for
growth of the seed pods may be provided from the interior volume 2209 of the base unit 2208.
For example, water may be added to the interior volume 2209 directly. The water may be added
through scalloped portion 2224.     There may be two scalloped portions 2224 according to
exemplar embodiments.      Two raised projections 2226 may serve as water level indicators to
provide a visual reference regarding the water level in the interior volume 2209. As depicted in
Figure 62, for example, the raised projection 2226 can be seen from exterior of the unit 2200
when the growing containers 2210 are in place.
[0188]          In some embodiments, water may be added through one or more an openings
2228 through the top cover 2212. The water may then flow down and excess may accumulate in
                                                42
105517101 .doc

the interior volume 2209. The water level in the interior volume may be observed as indicated
above.
[0189]             A moisture indicator may be used. The moisture indicator may be placed into
one or more seed pods 2216 or soil in the growing container 2210 (depending how the unit is
configured) to indicate the moisture level which may provide an indication of the water status of
the unit 2200.
[0190]             The following examples are not intended to limit the exemplary embodiments in
any way.
EXAMPLES
          A.       Example 1
[0191]             Previous experimentation found that the large, thin-walled spikes made of
composted and molded cow manure can successfully grow vegetable plants to maturation and
harvest.      In this experiment, the inventors determined that various plant species can also
successfully grow in the triangular acorn shaped seed pods described and depicted herein. The
inventors also determined that the thicker walled triangular acorn shaped seed pod improved the
ability of the pod to be pushed into the planting surface.
          B.       Example 2
[0192]             In this experiment, the inventors determined that dried compressed cow manure,
peat moss, and sugar cane were useful as the outer shell.          Lima beans and zucchini were
successfully grown in each of these materials and these outer shells were easily penetrated by
plant roots.
          C.       Example 3
[0193]             Previous experimentation showed that the sugar cane shaped seed pod worked
well for zucchini squash when filled with coir and fertilized with a controlled release fertilizer
(e.g., Osmocote@). In this experiment, the inventors evaluated the growth of corn, tomato and
                                                   43
10551710_1.doc

green in variable planting depths (e.g., fertilizer beneath the seed, fertilizer in bottom of cone,
and fertilizer adjacent to seed), in a loose medium such as coir.
[0194]            The inventors determined that the placement of formed Osmocote® did not
impact tomato plant growth and development. In beans, having the formed Osmocote® in the
bottom of the cone was more advantageous in time to germination. Towards the end of the
trial, all treatments were similar in their plant size and mass.
[0195]            Corn was variable in performance. Over time, the formed Osmocote® beneath
seed, formed Osmocote® in bottom of cone, and formed Osmocote® adjacent to seed
performed similarly in plant size and mass.
[0196]            In sum, including a formed Osmocote® in a cone matrix successfully delivered
proper nutrition to vegetable plants. Placement in the bottom of cone demonstrated faster time
to germination.
           D.     Example 4
[0197]            This experiment investigated variable planting depths in a loose medium such as
coir. Corn, tomato and green bean seeds were planted at four depths, including           4 inch, 1.5
inches, 3 inches, and the recommended seeding depth from the seed supplier.
[0198]            Differences were seen for the first few days after germination with beans and
corn, but treatments soon tapered and were statistically the same for the rest of the trial.
Tomato treatments were the same for the entire duration of the trial. Depths of 2-3 inches was
not detrimental to seedling growth and development and gives more flexibility in seed
placement. This study demonstrated that a universal seeding depth may be used with vegetable
species.
           E.     Example 5

[0200]           Germination was statistically equivalent for all treatments and in all species. Only
a single lettuce treatment showed no germination. All other treatments for all species germinated,
with an average of at least 58%. Differences in plant quality were evident throughout the trial,
with added Osmocote® treatments greatly outperforming the non-fertilized treatments.
          F.     Example 6
[0201]           This experiment investigated how compressed cow manure cone and the rooting
media within will interact to pull water for the benefit of a germinating seed and the depth at
which the exterior growing media provides adequate moisture. The cones were evaluated in an
open tray format utilizing three depths of exterior growing media outside the cones. The rooting
media in the cones was either loose coir or a molded plug having external ribs and formed to fit
within the cone and comprising shredded coconut coir pith and bark fines.              Only bottom
watering was done utilizing the features of the Misco Pot with exterior water ports and interior
portals for the soil to engage the water for wicking purposes.
          1. Materials and Methods
[0202]           As depicted in Figure 57, three Misco pots measuring 6 inches x 24 inches x 5
inches deep were filled at various depths with shredded coir. The bottoms of the cones are 0.25,
1.25 and 2.25 inches above the portals in the bottom of the Misco pot. Two types of seed were
seeded into each cone; three basil on the left side of the cone and three yellow zucchini squash
seeds on the right side - both at     4 inch deep. As a control, the same seed types were planted
directly into the coir base, in the absence of a seed pod, at the same depth and distance apart as
that dictated by the cone dimensions. At planting, prepared cones were arranged in a straight line
through the middle of the Misco pot. Each Misco pot housed three cones, which were formed
of composted and molded cow manure. Three of these cones were filled with loose coir and
three with molded plugs. These three cones of each substrate represent three replicates. Direct
seeded seeds were planted in the voids around the cones but at least one inch away from the
cone so any wicking by the cone would not influence the adjacent direct-sown seeds. After the
                                                  45

cones were seeded and planted into the shredded coir in the Misco pots, wherein the finished
pots will be bottom watered only. No top watering was done in this trial. Pots were monitored
daily to be sure water level was maintained especially as the coir base was being wetted out.
Germination and development of seedlings were monitored throughout the trial. In particular,
seedlings, run in triplicate, were counted as they emerge and the number counted was divided by
3 to obtain the percent germination. This rating was taken periodically through the first several
weeks of the trial in order to monitor speed of germination as a result of the varying moisture
conditions.
[0203]            As seedlings emerge they were counted. The number counted was divided by 3
to obtain % Germination. This rating was taken periodically through the first several weeks of
the trial in order to monitor speed of germination as a result of the varying moisture conditions.
[0204]            Figures 55 and 56 depict the germination of basil in seed pods comprising either
loose coir or a molded plug at various planting depths according to exemplary embodiments.

experiment.

[0206]            The data from these nine treatments was subjected to analysis of variance
(ANOVA) using ARM version 8.0 (Gylling Data Management).               If treatment probability is
significant, means were separated using Student Newman-Keuls at P -0.05.
                  2.      Results
[0207]            In the shallow planted Misco Pots, the coir matrix soil was a total of 3.0 inches
deep with the bottom of the cone elevated at 0.25 inches above the level of the water. It was
observed that the surface of the coir matrix continuously had a wet appearance attesting to its
wicking capability at that 3.0 inch depth. The exposed rims of the cones were noticeably wetter
as well (see Figure 57).
[0208]            The coir matrix effectively wicked moisture through its 3.0 inch profile and
provided ample moisture at 7 days after seeding (DAS) for seed germination in both versions of
                                                47

the cone (loose coir filled and molded plug-filled) and for the direct-sown seed. This pattern
held true for both species at all three rating dates (see Figure 55 and 56).
[0209]          In the mid-depth Misco pot the coir matrix was 4.0 inches deep with the bottom
of the cone elevated 1.25 inches above the level of the water. Unlike the surface of 3.0 inch deep
coir matrix, the 4.0 inch depth did not appear wet at the surface. However, the exposed rims of
the cone showed that most of the cones were adequately moistened due to wicking (see Figure
57).
[0210] At 7 DAS the molded plug cone was the only setting where basil plants received
adequate moisture for germination. No basil seeds germinated in the Coir-filled cone or the
direct seed. At 13 and 20 days basil seed germination occurred in the Coir-filled cone but not in
the direct seed setting (see Figure 55).
[0211]          Squash was similar to basil in its response except that both versions of the cone
provided ample moisture for the germination of the squash seed beginning at the early 7 day
timeframe.     Direct-sown squash did not germinate (see Figure 56).          This illustrated the
effectiveness of the cone for moving moisture against gravity for successful germination of these
two species which could not germinate using conventional direct-sow seeding methods. In this
case moisture was moved 3.75 inches - from the portal to the seed.
[0212]          In the deep-depth Misco pot the coir matrix was 5.0 inches deep with the bottom
of the cone elevated 2.25 inches above the level of the water. At this depth there was no visible
moisture at the surface of the coir matrix (see Figure 57). Most all cones wetted well based on
the appearance of the exposed rims (as in the mid-depth Misco pot one of the three Coir-filled
cones did not wick water and so no seeds germinated).
[0213]          As with the mid-depth Misco Pot most all basil and squash germinated as long as
they were housed in the cone setting (see Figures 56 and 57). Direct-sown seed did not receive
adequate moisture for germination. In this case, adequate moisture was pulled 4.75 inches to the
seed through the benefit of the cone and the loose coir and/or molded plug materials within.

         F.    Example 7
[0214]         A variety of other herbs and vegetables were tested utilizing similar methodology
presented above.    In this example, the nutrient blends were tested for germination, overall
growth, root rating, and dry weight of the products produced. The nutrient blends of NPK
tested were NPK-0.0075-0.0032-0.015 (i.e., Fl) and NPK-0.0045-0.0025-0.013 (i.e., F2).      These
plants include basil, cilantro, thyme, dill, bush beans, snap peas, spinach, lettuce (loose leaf,
butterhead, and romaine), watermelon, cucumber, summer squash, pumpkin, sweet pepper,
tomato (globe and cherry). The tables, below, provide a summary of seed pods utilizing Fl and
F2 NPK levels in the seed pods as compared to seeds planted directly into the native soil. The
seed pods' outer shell was a compressed cow manure cone and the rooting media was a molded
plug comprising shredded coconut coir pith and bark fines and Fl or F2 NPK. The tables
below summarize the results for the various seeds in percent germination (Table 2), overall
growth (Table 3), root rating (Table 4), and dry weight (Table 5).

                 1.      Basil
[0215]           Basil grown in the seed pods produced better emergence at 7 days after seeding
when compared to direct seeding into amended native soil. This was likely due to difficulties of
the basil seedling emerging through the clay-like soil with a high bulk density and a tendency of
surface crusting after watering. Germination at 19 days showed no statistical differences between
treatments. Dry weight, growth indices and root ratings at 6 weeks showed significantly more
growth with the plants grown in the Seed Pod compared to directly sown seed. In this study the
seed pods provided basil a germination advantage as well as an overall growth, dry weight
accumulation, and root growth advantage for basil compared to directly sown seed.
                 2.      Cilantro
                                                53
105517101 .doc

[0216]           Cilantro seed performed similarly when grown from the Seed Pods or when
direct seeded.     Percent germination at 7 and 19 days was not statistically different among
treatments. Final dry weights and root ratings were also not statistically different. However,
growth indices showed that cilantro grown in Seed Pods was significantly larger than plants that
were directly seeded. Overall, cilantro growth was comparable when grown from seed in the
Seed Pods or directly seeded into native soil.
                 3.      Thyme
[0217]           Thyme responded similarly to the three treatments. Germination at 7 and 19 days
was not statistically different among treatments. Dry weight, root ratings, and growth indices
were also not statistically different among treatments. Thyme germination, growth and
development was comparable when grown in the Seed Pods or when directly sown into native
soil.
                 4.      Dill
[0218]           Dill seed germination was statistically similar for the three treatments at both 10
and 19 days after sowing. Even though overall growth of dill in the Seed Pods was significantly
greater than direct-seeded into native soil, the dry weights of the three treatments two weeks
later (at the end of the trial) were not significantly different. Seed Pods tended to have better
root ratings than the direct-seed treatment. In summary, the performance of dill in the Seed Pods
showed tendencies of improved growth and development when compared to direct seed.
                 5.      Bush Bean
[0219]           Bean seeds grown in Seed Pods or directly seeded had comparable germination
rates at 7 and 19 days. Growth indices taken at 4 weeks showed the F-2 Seed Pod produced a
significantly larger plant than the direct seeded control. The F-I Seed Pod was no different than
the control. However, by 6 weeks dry weights and root ratings showed no significant difference
among the three treatments. Overall, beans grown in Seed Pods or in native soil have similar
germination, dry weight production, and root growth.
                                                  54

                 6.      Snap Pea
[0220]           There was a tendency for pea seeds in the Seed Pods to germinate better than
seeds sown directly into native soil. The Seed Pod with F-2 fertilizer produced pea plants with
significantly greater dry weight accumulation than Seed Pod with F-I fertilizer or directly sown
seeds. Overall growth measured at 4 weeks and 6 week root ratings were statistically similar for
all treatments. In summary pea seed germination tended to be better in Seed Pods but the
subsequent vegetative growth and root growth were quite similar for each of the three
treatments.
                 7.      Spinach
[0221]           Spinach plants had similar germination at 7 and 19 days for all treatments.
Growth indices taken at 4 weeks showed that spinach plants grown from direct seed in soil
tended to have greater growth than those grown in Seed Pods. However, by 6 weeks dry weights
and root ratings indicated there were no significant differences among the three treatments.
Overall, spinach performed similarly when grown in Seed Pods or when directly seeded into
native soil.
                 8.      Lettuce
[0222]           Several varieties of lettuce were tested in these studies, including loose leaf
lettuce, butterhead lettuce, and romaine lettuce.    All three cultivars of lettuce grown from the
Seed Pods had statistically similar germination rate at 7 and 19 days as those planted directly into
native soil. At four weeks, overall growth of lettuce plants for each variety was similar for each
treatment. At six weeks, the dry weight for loose leaf and romaine lettuce showed that the three
treatments were not statistically different from one another however, dry weights of butterhead
lettuce showed that native soil and Seed Pods with F2 level of nutrition had significantly more
growth than plants grown in Seed Pods with Fl. Root ratings of loose leaf lettuce, butterhead
lettuce, and romaine lettuce showed no statistical differences among treatments. In summary, all
three lettuces grown from seed in the Seed Pod performed similarly as lettuce grown in native
                                                 55
10551710_1.doc

soil. One parameter, butterhead lettuce dry weight, showed that the F-I Seed Pod was inferior
to the F-2 Seed Pod and the native soil control. However, all other butterhead lettuce ratings
showed no statistical differences among the three treatments.
                 9.      Watermelon
[0223]           Watermelon performed similarly in both Seed Pods and when seeded directly
into the native soil. The rate of germination was statistically similar for all treatments at 7 and 19
days. The dry weight, root ratings, and overall growth were not statistically different among
treatments. Overall, watermelon seed can be started from either Seed Pods or directly sown to
obtain the same rate of germination and plant growth for 6 weeks after seeding.
                 10.     Cucumber
[0224]           Cucumber performed similarly in both Seed Pods and when seeded directly into
the native soil. The rate of germination was similar for all treatments at 7 and 12 days. The dry
weight, root ratings, and overall growth were not statistically different among the three
treatments.     Overall, the success of growing cucumber in Seed Pods or direct seed is very
similar.
                 11.     Summer Squash (Zucchini)
[0225]           Zucchini performed similarly in both Seed Pods and when grown in a direct-seed
setting. The rate of germination was similar for all treatments at 7 and 12 days. The dry weight,
root ratings, and overall growth were not statistically different among treatments. Overall,
zucchini can be grown from seed equally well using the Seed Pods or when directly sown in
native soil.
                 12.     Pumpkin
[0226]           Pumpkin performed similarly in both Seed Pods and when directly seeded into
native soil. The rate of germination was similar for all treatments at 7 and 12 days. The dry
weight, root ratings, and overall growth were not statistically different among treatments.

Overall, pumpkin can be grown equally well from seed using Seed Pods or when direct sown
into native soil.
                  13.    Sweet Pepper
[0227]            Sweet Pepper performed similarly in both Seed Pods and when seeded directly
into native soil. The rate of germination was similar for all treatments at 10 and 19 days. The dry
weight, root ratings, and overall growth were not statistically different among treatments.
Overall, sweet pepper performs equally well when seed is planted using the Seed Pod system or
when directly seeded into native soil.
                  14.    Tomato
[0228]            Two types of tomatoes (Cherry and Globe) were evaluated in this set of trials.
Cherry tomato had statistically similar germination rates for all three treatments at both 7 and 19
days. Globe tomatoes that were direct seeded into native soil had better germination than Seed
Pods at 7 days after seeding but by 19 days there was no statistical difference among treatments.
The delay of germination of Globe tomatoes in Seed Pods could not be explained. At 4 weeks
the overall growth of both Cherry and Globe tomato plants in the Seed Pods was not
significantly different than directly sown plants. However, at 6 weeks Cherry tomato plants in
the Seed Pods had significantly more dry weight accumulation than directly seeded into the soil.
This was likely due to the added nutrition in the growing media of the Seed Pods. Interestingly
this nutritional advantage was not expressed in the Globe tomato plants. The root ratings for
both tomato cultivars indicted no differences among the treatments. Overall, Cherry and Globe
tomatoes performed similarly when grown from Seed Pods or when directly seeded.

          G.    Example 8
[0230]          Experiments to determine whether the contents of the rooting media and/or
techniques in fabricating the rooting media affected the germination rates of a variety of seed
types were conducted. Seed pods were tested by altering the type of rooting media with (1) only
coconut coir pith, (2) coconut coir pith and bark fines, (3) the coconut coir pith and peat moss
held in place by x-tack and subjected to heat drying, or (4) seeds were placed directly into the
planting surface (i.e., no seed pod) (see table below):

                      4        Seed directly placed into Professional Growing Media
 [0231]            The manufacturing process of the plug may require the use of a special adhesive
call X-tack and requires drying the seed pod in a dryer at high temperatures to remove moisture.
Seed pods were seeded with two to three seeds (depending on the seed type and size). Each seed
was placed at a depth of 0.25 inches below the surface of the planting area (measured from the
top of the seed). As a control the same number of seeds will be seeded directly into the planting
area without the use of a seed pod.             All seed pods and seeds were planted in Fafard 3B
professional potting mix (i.e., soil) and placed into 4" plastic pots filled with the soil so that the
rim of the pod is level with the surface of the soil. Finished pots were watered to settle the soil
and establish the moisture level for seed germination.             Observations were noted as seeds
germinate and grow. The experiment terminated at the end of the germination period, which is
approximately 3 to 4 weeks after initiation. The following species of vegetables/herbs were
tested:      Basil Genovese (Ocimum basilicum 'Genovese'), Cilantro (Coriandrum sativum 'Santo), Dill
 (Anethum graveolens 'Fernleaf), Bush Bean (Phaseolus vulgars     Jade), Snap  Pea (Pisum sativum 'Sugar
Bon), Spinach (Spinacia oleracea 'Baker), Looseleaf Lettuce (Lactuca sativa Lola Rosa), Butterhead
Lettuce (Lactuca sativa 'Buffer Crunch 5, Romaine Lettuce (Lactuca sativa 'Winter Density), Watermelon
 (Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus 'SugarBaby), Cucumber (Cucumis sativus 'Tasty Green), Zucchini Squash
 (Cucurbitapepo 'Fiesta), Yellow Zucchini Squash (Cucurbitapepo 'StarDust), Pumpkin (Cucurbita
pepo   'Spartan5, Sweet Pepper (Capsica annuum 'Red Bull), Cherry Tomato (Solanum jycopersicum 'Sweet
Million ), Globe Tomato (Solanum jycopersicum 'RedPride').
 [0232]            Following the 3 to 4 week experimentation period, the germination rates for
planted species were compared. The results of the experiments are provided in Figure 58. Seed
pods comprising only coconut coir pith germinated at a rate that was similar to seeds placed
                                                      59

directly into the soil. Depending on the seed type, seed pods comprising only coconut coir pith
performed similar to or better than seed pods comprised of both coconut coir pith and bark
fines, with or without X-tack and heat process. Lettuce cultivars had a better initial rate of
germination in the coconut coir pith seed pods compared to coconut coir pith and bark fines,
with or without the X-tack and heat process.
         H.      Example 9
[0233]           In-field trials were conducted using the seed pods at five locations worldwide,
including Ohio, Oregon, Florida, France, and England.          The primary goal of this trial was to
determine the viability of various seed types    /  cultivars of garden vegetables and herbs in the
seed pod system. Germination and early growth were the primary parameters evaluated in this
trial. The success of the seed pods were based on comparing the seed pod germination rates to
the germination rate of directly planting the seeds into native soil.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
[0234]           Trials were conducted in 4.0 foot wide garden rows and marked off in 4.0 foot
segments, where each segment is the equivalent of one replicate. Each replicate was sub-divided
into four 2 foot x 2 foot squares - each accommodating one of the four treatments (according to
the plot plan in the Addendum). Each species will occupy a total of 16 linear feet of the garden
row. For all 18 seed types a total of 288 linear feet of garden row will be needed.
[0235]           Prior to planting, the garden rows (at Marysville only) were topped with 3.0
inches of Miracle Gro Flower and Vegetable Garden Soil per garden soil directions and tilled to
a depth of 6 inches using a tractor-mounted rotor-tiller or similar implement. Seed pods and
                                                  60

seed were planted in the center of their 2 foot x 2 foot plots. Seed pods were planted according
to labeled instructions, such that they were pressed into the soil up to the flange. The direct-seed
control treatments were planted directly into the prepared soil.         Large-seeded species were
planted at 0.75 inches deep and small-seeded species will be at 0.25 inches deep. Table 6 below
provides a species list to determine large-seeded and small-seeded species.

[0236]           After planting and fertilizing, the plots were watered until the area appeared
thoroughly wetted - as a homeowner would and applied to all plots as equally as possibly. Water
was applied on a daily basis. At 30 days, additional fertilizer was applied to treatments 2 and 4
(see Table 7 below), using a shaker jar to the 1 square foot area of soil surrounding the seedling
and lightly raked into the soil. Treatments were monitored for germination beginning at 4 days
after planting. The dates of emergence and the number of seeds germinated in each plot were
recorded.

            RESULTS
  [0237]           Results were recorded as a percentage of seeds that germinated vs. the number of
  seeds planted (i.e. if only one of three seeds germinated, that site had 33% germination). The
  controls (i.e., seeds planted directly into the soil) were seeded at the same depth and spacing as
  the seed pods. In several instances the seed pod had Percent Germination greater than 100%.
  This is because:     1) Some small-seeded seeds pods were manufactured with more than the
  specified number of 3 seeds, or 2) Some species such as cilantro and dill sometimes appear to
  have 2 seedlings emerging from the same seed.             It will also be noticed that germination
  occasionally decreased over time. Seedlings can die or be eaten and when 'blind' ratings are
  conducted and this would not be noticed until the data are analyzed.          The results from each
  location are summarized below.

          CONCLUSION
[0238]           The results from the five locations provided great insight despite the variable
climatic conditions of seed pods testing. In general, seeds planted in seed pods performed as
well or better than directly planting the seed. When temperatures cooled in Ohio, the seeds
germinated fine and even tended to surpass directly planted seeds, which indicates a possible
effect of temperature on lettuce seed pods.        Previous research has shown that no large
temperature difference occurs within seed pods when compared to native Ohio soil at various
times during the day. No other species really showed this anomaly.
[0239]           The term 'comprising' as used in this specification and claims means 'consisting
at least in part of. When interpreting statements in this specification and claims which include
the term 'comprising', other features besides the features prefaced by this term in each statement
can also be present. Related terms such as 'comprise' and 'comprised' are to be interpreted in
similar manner.
[0240]           In this specification where reference has been made to patent specifications,
other external documents, or other sources of information, this is generally for the purpose of
providing a context for discussing the features of the invention.        Unless specifically stated
otherwise, reference to such external documents is not to be construed as an admission that such
documents, or such sources of information, in any jurisdiction, are prior art, or form part of the
common general knowledge in the art.
