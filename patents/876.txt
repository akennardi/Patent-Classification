         The present invention relates to a medicine intermediate method which belongs to
 5 the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates to mandelic acid drug
   intermediate benzaldehyde synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         Benzaldehyde is an important raw material for medicine, dyestuff, spice and resin
10 industry. It can be used as solvent, plasticizer and temperature lubricant. It is mainly
   used for the preparation of edible essence in essence industry, a small amount for the
   flavor of the essence and tobacco flavor. Although it is widely used as a commercial
   food condiment and industrial solvent, the main use of benzaldehyde is still used for
   synthesizing various other compounds from medical medicine to plastic additives.
15 Benzaldehyde is also an important intermediate product for the production of perfumes,
   spices and synthetic certain aniline dyes. The synthesis of mandelic acid use the
   benzaldehyde as initial reagent, the hydrocyanic acid reacts with the benzaldehyde,
   then the product mandelonitrile is hydrolyzed racemic mandelic acid. Most of the
   existing synthesis methods are using the process that benzene and aluminum chloride
20 react with carbon monoxide and hydrogen chloride under pressure. This method of
   production requires the condition of pressure reaction and carbon monoxide and
   hydrogen chloride as reactants, reaction energy consumption is high, carbon monoxide
   and hydrogen chloride are poisonous gas, and flammable and explosive, the synthesis
   process is of high risks, and the synthesis method is complicated. Therefore, it is
25 necessary to propose a new synthesis method.

   invention mandelic acid drug intermediate benzaldehyde synthesis method, it is
20 unnecessary to react under pressure, reducing the energy consumption of reaction, and
   to use carbon monoxide and hydrogen chloride as reactants, avoiding the carbon
   monoxide and hydrogen chloride which belong to poisonous gas bring the flammable
   and explosive risk, reduces the factor of risk, reducing intermediate links reaction,
   decreasing the reaction time and improving the reaction yield, at the same time, the
