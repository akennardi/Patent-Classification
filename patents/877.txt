              BEDBUG DETECTION, MONITORING AND CONTROL TECHNIQUES
                         CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS:
             The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.
 5 60/853,573 filed October 23, 2006 and to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/854,378 filed
   October 25, 2006, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
             The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent No. <removed-apn>,
   which is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2015227488, which is also a
   divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2013200548, which is a divisional
10 application from Australian Patent Application No. 2007309475, the entire disclosure of which is
   incorporated herein by reference.
                                               BACKGROUND
             The present invention relates to pest control, and more particularly, but not exclusively,
15 relates to the detection, monitoring, and control of insects, including for example, bedbugs.
             Recent data suggests bedbug infestations (Cimex species) of human domiciles are on the
   rise. At least 92 species have been identified globally, of which at least 16 species are in the North
   American continent. Generally, bedbugs are parasitic pests with its hosts including humans and
   various domesticated animals. It is believed that bedbug infestations are becoming more
20 problematic now at least in part because long acting, residual insecticides are no longer being used
   to keep bedbug populations in check. In addition, increased international travel and insecticide
   resistance have made bedbug infestations spread and control with insecticides very difficult. In
   terms of scale, such infestations are of particular concern for hoteliers, cruise ships, trains, daycare
   facilities, and the like because of the business reputation risk posed by bad press or bad reviews.
25 Other problematic areas tend to include nursing homes, barracks, dorms, hospitals, and various
   other forms of high density housing. Nonetheless, single family homes can likewise be impacted
   adversely.
             For many of these dwellings, the pervasive application of long acting insecticides by
   spraying and/or dusting is undesirable. As a result, new approaches to bedbug detection,
30 monitoring, and control are being sought. The present application provides contributions along
   these lines that are not only applicable to bedbugs, but may also find application in the detection,
   monitoring and control of other species of insects.
                                                 SUMMARY

20             DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF REPRESENTATIVE EMBODIMENTS
            For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention,
   reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language
   will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope
   of the invention is thereby intended. Any alterations and further modifications in the described
25 embodiments, and any further applications of the principles of the invention as described herein are
   contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.
            Referring now to Fig. 1, there is illustrated a diagrammatic view of a system 10 suitable to
   address an insect infestation, such as bedbugs, in room 15. System 10 includes at least one device
   20, which, as illustrated, is attached to leg 41a of bed 40 and is suitable for one or more of
30 detecting, monitoring and controlling an insect population, such as a bedbug population. The total
   number of devices 20 used in system 10 may vary in relation to the infestation problem and/or the
   time period in which an effective removal is desired. Bed 40 further includes legs 41b-41d which
   are interconnected via a frame 42 and a headboard 43 to form a support for a mattress 44 placed on
   top of box springs 45. It should be appreciated that in alternative embodiments, bed system 40 may
35 comprise one or more components in addition to or in lieu of those illustrated in Fig. 1. For
   example, in other embodiments bed system 40 may lack box springs 45 or headboard 43, or may
   include a footboard. In yet another embodiment, bed system 40 may only include mattress 44 on
                                                        3

   top of box springs 45 set directly on floor 16 of room 15. Device 20 may be attached to bed leg 41a
   by any type of fastener, including but not limited to, a nail, screw, bolt, tack, clamp, strap,
   adhesive, tape, hook and loop connector (such as VELCRO), and/or such different fastener variety
   as would occur to those skilled in the art. In an alternative embodiment not illustrated, device 20
 5 may be placed elsewhere on the structure of bed system 40. For example, device 20 may be placed
   on any of legs 41a-41d, frame 42, headboard 43, a portion of mattress 44, or on box springs 45. In
   another alternative embodiment, device 20 may be placed on either of wall 17 or 18, or elsewhere
   in the room 15.
             It should be understood that as illustrated in Fig. 1, system 10 is being used in room 15,
10 where room 15 belongs to a: dormitory, hostel, shelter, hotel, motel, bed and breakfast, inn, tent,
   cabin, nursing home, hospital, and/or house, just to name a few possibilities. In a further
   embodiment, system 10 may be used at any location in which a blood meal, particularly a human
   blood meal, might be in the presence of a bedbug during a bedbug feeding period, such as night
   time. For example, system 10 might be placed in the sleeping rooms or cabins of a vehicle (such as
15 a ship, train, or motor coach), or in sleeping rooms of daycare centers and schools. System 10 may
   be individually configured in accordance with the specific attributes of each location.
             Additionally, the placement of device 20 within a designated area may not only vary with
   different locations, but can also vary in accordance to visual evidence indicating the increased
   probability of nearby bedbugs or bedbug harborages. For example, device 20 may be placed in
20 close proximity to one or more of bedbug excrement or fecal matter, molted exoskeleton shells,
   eggs, or blood spots. In one embodiment, device 20 may be placed in close proximity to the likely
   location of a human blood meal host, like for example near mattress 44. In another embodiment not
   illustrated, device 20 may be placed on or near one or more bedbug harborages in the form of a
   crack, gap, or crevice. For example, device 20 may be placed near peeling wallpaper or cracks in
25 the drywall or plaster of either of walls 17 and 18 in room 15. Additionally, for an embodiment in
   which room 15 includes one or more trim moldings mounted to walls 17 and/or 18, device 20 may
   be placed in close proximity thereto. For one variation, device 20 is shaped and structured to
   simulate trim molding or another common decor feature typically found in a bedroom. In another
   embodiment, device 20 may be placed next to flooring on the surface of floor 16, like for example
30 near the edge of either securely fastened or rolled back carpet. In another variation, device 20 may
   be placed on or near one or more of air duct vents 21, which may communicate with one or more of
   a supply air duct or a return air duct, as would be appreciated by one having skill in the art. In
   another form, device 20 may be placed in the supply air duct or return air duct communicating via
   vents 21. It is further contemplated that device 20 may be placed in any position effective for
35 bedbug control.
             Device 20 is shown in greater detail in a diagrammatic partial sectional view in Fig. 2.
   Device 20 includes a housing member 32 defined by an exterior wall 34 and a top cover 36
                                                        4

   enclosing an internal chamber 35 which houses a sensing arrangement 37 generally including
   interconnected sensor 38, controller 48, indicator 52, and power source 56. It is contemplated that
   in alternative embodiments not shown, sensing arrangement 37 may include one or more
   components in addition to or in lieu of that illustrated in Fig. 2. It should further be understood that
 5 in various embodiments the componentry of sensing arrangement 37 may be arranged in one or
   more alternative fashions to that depicted in Fig. 2.
            Sensor 38 extends through exterior wall 34 at opening 40 such that sensing portion 42 may
   be externally exposed to the environment of the area in which device 20 is placed. Sensor 38 is
   generally structured to analyze one or more biochemical substances 144 to determine if it is
10 indicative of bedbug biochemistry. A few detailed examples of the biochemical detection
   mechanisms performed with sensor 38 are further described hereinafter in connection with
   reference to Figs. 1-3 generally. While sensing portion 42 is illustrated as being at least partially
   external to chamber 35, it should be understood that in alternative embodiments sensing portion 42
   may be entirely disposed within chamber 35. In these embodiments, device 20 may include one or
15 more components to convey a biochemical substance. For example, with regard to such substance
   144 being carried in the air, an air handling system like a fan or suction device can be included to at
   least bring part of a biochemical substance 144 into internal chamber 35 through opening 40 to
   engage sensing portion 42 of sensor 38. In another form, device 20 may include one or more
   openings in addition to opening 40, with each additional opening being structured to guide a
20 medium carrying biochemical substance 144 into contact with an internally disposed sensing
   portion 42. For example, when device 20 is placed on or near air duct vents 21, or in the air ducts
   themselves, the opening may be structured to channel the airflow moving around device 20 into
   contact with sensing portion 42.
            In response to biochemical substance 144, sensor 38 generates a corresponding sensor
25 signal that is conveyed along signal pathway 46 to controller 48. Controller 48 operates in
   accordance with operating logic to determine if the signal indicates the presence of biochemistry
   indicative of bedbug presence and/or another target insect type. Controller 48 is comprised of one
   or more components that may be configured as a single unit, or distributed among two or more
   units. Such components may be of a solid state, electromagnetic, optical, and/or different variety as
30 would occur to those skilled in the art. The controller 48 may include analog circuitry, digital
   circuitry, and/or a hybrid combination of both of these types. In one form, the controller 48 is of the
   programmable variety that executes algorithms and processes data in accordance with its operating
   logic being defined by programming instructions (such as software or firmware). Alternatively or
   additionally, the operating logic for controller 48 is at least partially defined by hardwired logic or
35 other hardware.
            After controller 48 receives and processes the sensor signal, a controller output signal is
   output along signal pathway 45 to an indicator 52. Indicator 52 is generally structured to provide a
                                                       5

   human operator with an output to indicate the presence or absence of a biochemical substance 144
   indicative of bedbug biochemistry. As illustrated in Fig. 2, indicator 52 includes an output in the
   form of visual markers 54. Visual markers 54 may be in one or more forms of a light, such as a
   light emitting diode (LED), fluorescent, incandescent, and/or neon type, amongst other
 5 possibilities. In each form, the presence of biochemical substance 144 may be indicated by, for
   example, a discrete yes/no indicator, a color change, a flashing sequence, or other change in
   indicator state. In alternative forms, indicator 52 may provide an output indicating the presence of
   biochemical substances 144 in the form of a colorimetric strip or an aural/audio signal. In one form,
   when the output of indicator 52 is in an aural form, the presence of biochemical substance 144 may
10 be indicated by one or more of a single or sequential beep, chime, ring, horn, and click, just to
   name a few possibilities. In one implementation, a quantitative evaluation is provided by varying
   the indication with the number of bedbugs present, such as providing a more intense color
   indicator, a louder and/or more frequent aural indicator, or the like in response to detection of a
   greater bedbug presence.
15          As illustrated in Fig. 2, sensing arrangement 37 includes a power supply 56 structured to
   send electrical power to controller 48, sensor 38, and/or indicator 52, as needed. Only power supply
   pathway 58 to controller 48 is illustrated. It should be appreciated that certain types of sensor 38
   and/or indicator 52 may derive any needed electrical power from pathway 46 and/or 58 as needed,
   and that in still other embodiments such components are passive, not needing any type of persistent
20 electrical power source.
            As illustrated, power supply 56 is located within internal chamber 35 and may be provided
   for example, in the form of one or more electrochemical cells or battery of such cells. In an
   alternative embodiment, power is sourced externally from an electrical socket, such as wall
   receptacle 19 in Fig. 1, in which case, supply 56 is understood to be at least partially external to
25 device 20. It should be appreciated that sensing arrangement 37 may be modified for use with a DC
   power source or an AC power source and that the modification of components may be dependent
   upon the availability of one or more forms of the power source. In another form, a renewable
   external power source, such as a solar cell disposed on top cover 36 of device 20, may be used to
   provide sensing arrangement 37 with power. It is further contemplated that in other embodiments
30 one or more of sensor 38, controller 48, and indicator 52, each includes its own power source. The
   components of sensing arrangement 37 including sensor 38, controller 48, and indicator 52 may be
   alternatively interconnected. For example, in one arrangement the components of sensing
   arrangement 37 may be interconnected using wired or wireless techniques with corresponding
   signals structured in an appropriate fashion. It should be appreciated that some implementations
35 may be passive in nature, so that no power source is needed, and alternatively or additionally no
   controller may be utilized. As further described elsewhere in the present application, a colorimetric
                                                       6

   strip sensitive to one or more bedbug-specific biochemicals provides one nonlimiting example of a
   sensor/indicator device that lacks a power source and controller.
            Once bedbugs have been detected, an operator can determine whether to conduct an
   extermination process, such as the application of one or more types of insecticides toxic to
 5 bedbugs. Such types of insecticides are further described with reference to Fig. 3 as follows. Fig. 3
   depicts a diagrammatic partial sectional view of device 70 which is suitable for use in system 10
   and configured for one or more of detecting, monitoring and controlling an insect population, such
   as a bedbug population. Device 70 includes an operator handle 72 opposite a housing member 74.
   Operator handle 72 is generally structured for engagement by the hand of a human operator and
10 may including knurling 73 to increase operator gripping capabilities. In alternative forms not
   shown, operator handle 72 may include one or more grip enhancing features in addition to or in lieu
   of knurling 73. For example, in one form a rubber coating may be applied to operator handle 72
   while in another form operator handle 72 may include one or more ergonomic hand grips. In
   another embodiment, handle 72 may be free from any grip enhancing features.
15          Housing member 74 includes an exterior wall 76 and a top cover 80 which together form
   an internal chamber 78 structured to house and provide protection for sensing arrangement 81 and
   exterminating arrangement 109. Sensing arrangement 81 includes an interconnected sensor 82,
   controller 94, indicator 100, and power source 104. It is contemplated that in alternative
   embodiments not shown, sensing arrangement 81 may include components in addition to or in lieu
20 of that illustrated in Fig. 3. It should further be understood that in various embodiments the
   componentry of sensing arrangement 81 may be arranged in one or more alternative fashions to
   that depicted in Fig. 3.
             Sensor 82 extends through exterior wall 76 at opening 84 such that sensing portion 86 may
   be externally exposed to the environment of the area in which device 70 is being used. Similar to
25 sensor 38, sensor 82 is generally structured to analyze one or more biochemical substances 144
   indicative of bedbug presence. A few detailed examples of the biochemical detection mechanisms
   performed with sensor 82 are further described hereinafter in connection with reference to Figs. 1-3
   generally. While sensing portion 86 is illustrated as extending beyond internal chamber 78 - being
   at least partially external thereto -- it should be understood that in alternative embodiments sensing
30 portion 86 may be entirely disposed within chamber 78. In these embodiments, as described above,
   device 70 may include one or more structures to convey biochemical substances 144, bringing all
   or part of it into contact with an internally disposed sensing portion 86. Device 70 may also include
   one or more openings in addition to opening 84, with each additional opening being structured to
   guide a medium carrying biochemical substance 144 into contact with an internally disposed
35 sensing portion 86.
            Upon sensing biochemical substances 144 indicative of bedbug biochemistry, sensor 86
   sends a corresponding sensor signal to controller 94 via signal pathway 92. Controller 94 can be
                                                         7

   configured in any of a number of ways such as described in connection with controller 48. After
   controller 94 receives and processes sensor signal 90, a controller output signal is sent to indicator
   100 via signal pathway 96. Indicator 100 is structured to provide a human operator with an output
   signal notifying the operator of the presence of biochemical substance 144 indicative of bedbug
 5 biochemistry. Indicator 100 includes visual markers 102 to notify a human operator of bedbug
   biochemistry similarities and the probability of the presence of one or more bedbugs. Visual
   markers 102 are generally structured and operative in a manner similar to that described above in
   regard to visual markers 54. Furthermore, as indicated above, indicator 100 may provide output to
   notify a human operator of the presence of biochemical substance 144 indicative of a bedbug in one
10 or more forms in addition to or in lieu of visual markers 102. For example, an aural signal or a
   colorimetric strip may be utilized. It should be appreciated that any output signals provided by
   indicator 100 may include any one or more features described above with respect to the output
   signals which may be provided by indicator 52.
            A power source 104 is included in internal chamber 78 that provides electric power to
15 controller 94, sensing arrangement 81, and exterminating arrangement 109, respectively. The
   provision of such power to arrangement 81 and/or 109 may be via controller 94 and/or by separate
   power conveying pathways not shown. In still other embodiments, some or all of the components
   of arrangements 81 and 109 are passive in nature, not requiring a persistent source of power. Power
   source 104 may be in the form of a DC battery, or in an alternative form, may not be positioned
20 within internal chamber 78. In one such alternative, the power source 104 may be an AC source,
   such as wall receptacle 19 in Fig. 1. As described above in regard to arrangement 37, it is
   contemplated that the components of arrangements 81, 109 may be individually powered and can
   be interconnected through one or more wired or wireless pathways.
            When sensing arrangement 81 indicates one or more biochemical substances 144 of
25 bedbugs, a human operator may use device 70 to commence extermination via exterminating
   arrangement 109. Exterminating arrangement 109 includes a pushbutton 110. In response to the
   depression of pushbutton 110, control module 112 sends a release signal on signal pathway 116 to
   an exterminating module 118. As illustrated in phantom, exterminating module 118 includes an
   internal reservoir 120 communicating with an applicator tip 122. A closing member 123 is biased
30 to a closed position adjacent the applicator tip 122. The contents of reservoir 120 include an
   insecticide 124 toxic to bedbugs. In response to the release signal from signal pathway 116,
   member 123 opens to release insecticide 124 in a fluid form, such as an aerosol, gas, liquid, or
   powder. When the operator releases the depressed button 110, the release signal changes state in
   such manner that member 123 returns to its closed state in response, ceasing the release of
35 insecticide 124.
            In an alternative embodiment not shown, exterminating module 118 may be directly
   connected to controller 94 and may react directly to the presence of biochemical substance 144 to
                                                       8

   release insecticide 124 automatically, without any action by a human operator. In one such form,
   insecticide 124 is control released and confined to the area in which biochemical substance 144 is
   detected. In another embodiment exterminating system 109 may be mechanical in nature, such that
   as operator release button 110 is depressed, member 123 is opened to permit release of insecticide
 5 124. In this form, exterminating system 109 may not include any connection to sensing
   arrangement 81 or power source 104. Insecticide 124, non-limiting examples of which will be
   provided herein below, may be of one or more forms effective for exterminating a bedbug
   population as would be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art. The insecticide can be
   provided in a form intended to be ingested by bedbugs and/or to provide exposure sufficient for
10 extermination by external contact with the body of a bedbug. In still another form, the insecticide
   may be provided in a vapor form which may be insufflated through one or more spiracles of a
   bedbug.
            Referring now generally to Figs. 1-3, devices 20, 70 may comprise any number of suitable
   materials including certain polymers, woods, metals, or any mixtures thereof. Moreover, one or
15 more of devices 20 may be used with one or more of device 70 in a further embodiment. It should
   appreciated that each of devices 20, 70 is not limited to the form as illustrated in respective Figs. 2
   and 3. For example, device 20 may be configured for handheld operation while device 70 may be
   configured for semi-permanent placement. In additional alternative forms, devices 20, 70 may be
   wheeled devices or robotic devices structured to scan, for example, room 15.
20          Indicator 52, 100 may provide information in addition to a positive or negative indication
   of biochemical substance 144. In one form, a relative concentration or quantitative measurement of
   an analyte used by sensor 38, 82 may be provided by indicator 52, 100. When such information is
   provided, sensor 38, 82 may include an operator viewing screen on which the relevant information
   is displayed. In these forms, controller 48, 94 may provide indicator 52, 100 with a pre
25 programmed control model upon which the human operator may compare the levels of biochemical
   substances 144 detected to determine if one or more bedbugs are present or if further detecting is
   necessary. It should also be appreciated that the output provided by indicator 52, 100 may vary in
   relation to a characteristic of the biochemical substance 144 analyzed by sensor 38, 86. For
   example, in response to different concentration levels of biochemical substance 144, indicator 52,
30 100 may provide visual markers 54, 102 including levels of brightness which correspond to the
   concentration level of biochemical substance 144. Additionally or alternatively, aural/audio signals
   may be provided which include volume levels and/or output sequences which correspond to the
   concentration level of biochemical substance 144.
            In a further embodiment, information is relayed by a wired or wireless communication
35 pathway from device 20, 70 to a remote site for further data collection and analysis. This remote
   site could be a computer coupled to device 20 and/or 70 by a computer network in a designated
   room of a hotel, nursing home, cruise ship, train, dormitory, barracks, hospital, or the like and/or
                                                      9

   could even be remote relative to such structures, like a pest control service provider business
   location or the like.
            As indicated above, sensor 38, 82 is generally structured to analyze at least one
   biochemical substance 144 to determine if it is indicative of bedbug biochemistry. In addition to air
 5 handling mechanisms, transport of an analyte to sensor 38, 82 can be accomplished by a swab,
   wipe, tissue, or towelette or the like either with or without a wetting agent, such as distilled water,
   to collect a sample for biochemical analysis. Alternatively or additionally, a dust/particulate
   collector is utilized with or without a wetting agent. In a further approach, a liquid is applied in
   aerosol form to the air and/or to one or more surfaces and collected for sensor analysis. Any of
10 these transport mechanisms can be manually and/or automatically performed. In one particular
   variation, the sample is collected with a device that includes an agent in liquid or aerosol form,
   which is intended to react with one or more biochemicals indicative of bedbugs. Sensors 38, 82 can
   include any chemical reaction, antigen/antibody reaction, galvanic, electrochemical, fluorescence,
   spectroscopic, and/or chromatography technique or the like to detect a biochemical substance 144
15 or group of such substances 144 indicative of a target insect types, such as bedbugs. Certain
   specific examples of these implementations are further described in the examples that follow.
            It is contemplated that the biochemical substance 144 may be any compound or
   combination of compounds that are distinctly associated with bedbug biochemistry. In one form,
   biochemical substance 144 may be one or more or any combination of bedbug saliva, exoskeletons,
20 lost antennae and other body parts, pheromones, hormones, kairomones, proteins, bodily secretions
   including fecal matter, other waste products or by-products, and/or seminal fluid, and eggs and egg
   residue. It is contemplated that arrangement 37, 81 may be modified in various embodiments to
   detect one or more of each the listed biochemical substances 144 as well as other biochemical
   substances indicative of bedbug biochemistry.
25          The specific biochemical substance(s) 144 analyzed may vary. In one form where the
   biochemical substance sought to be analyzed is a bedbug exoskeleton, chitin comprising
   acetylglucosamine (N-acetyl -D-glucos-2-amine) may be sensed by sensor 38, 82. In another form,
   when bedbug saliva is analyzed by sensor 38, 82, an anticoagulant or anesthetic may be the
   substance sought to be detected. In one specific implementation of saliva analysis, one or more
30 proteins, such as nitrophorin and apyrase, or peptides forming the proteins, may be the targeted
   biochemical substance 144. Any one or more of mammalian red blood cells, white blood cells,
   platelets, glucose, iron and plasma, the plasma including but not limited to, albumin, thrombogenic
   factors, immunoglobulins, hormones, proteins, and/or electrolytes, may be detected as biochemical
   substance 144 when sensor 38, 82 analyzes bedbug fecal matter. In analyzing a substance to
35 determine if it is bedbug seminal fluid, sensor 38, 82 may detect for the combined presence of
   alanine and glutamic acid and/or DNA or RNA specific to a bedbug species. In another form,
   sensor 38, 82 may detect the presence of bedbug hormones, kairomones, and/or pheromones in any
                                                       10

   state of matter (solid, liquid or gas). In one such implementation, sensor 38, 82 may be structured
   to detect for one or more of trans- oct-2-en-l-al or trans-hex-2-en-l-al. It should be appreciated that
   sensor 38, 82 may be structured to detect any number of combinations of compounds in order to
   yield a more reliable result as to the detection of a biochemical substance 144 indicative of bedbug
 5 biochemistry.
             Sensor 38, 82 may include one or more features structured to facilitate chemical analysis of
   biochemical substance 144 to determine if it is indicative of bedbug biochemistry. In one form,
   sensor 38, 82 includes application of an agent as aerosol spray and/or liquid to the biochemical
   substance 144. Such agent is selected to cause a desired chemical reaction with the target
10 biochemical substance(s) 144 that facilitates detection with sensor 38, 82. In one form, the agent
   causes an endothermic or exothermic reaction between one or more biochemical substances
   specific to a bedbug. In this form, sensor 38, 82 includes a thermometer structured to record
   differences in temperature which may result from the reaction. Upon detection of a selected amount
   of change in temperature, arrangement 37, 81 provides a positive indication of the presence of
15 biochemical substance 144. In a variation of this approach, arrangement 37, 81 indicates that at
   least a temperature corresponding to an increased level of biochemical substance 144 is present
   below the threshold, at which point a human operator could decide whether to continue searching.
   In another form, the aerosol may be structured to provide an electrochemical reaction with the
   biochemical substance 144. Sensor 38, 82 may then include a meter structured to measure electrical
20 current/voltage or other electrical property associated with the electrochemical reaction such that
   arrangement 37, 81 may determine if the biochemical substance 144 is indicative of bedbugs. In
   still other forms, the reaction results in a pH level indicative of the target biochemical(s) and/or
   oxygen concentration indicative of the target biochemical(s) detectable with sensor 38 and/or 82.
             Sensor 38, 82 may further include a molecularly imprinted polymer structured to detect one
25 or more potential biochemical substances 144. The molecularly imprinted polymer includes a
   plurality of reception sites which have been specifically modified for a targeted molecule, like for
   example, one of the bedbug-indicative compounds listed above. Each reception site will generally
   include a shape, size, and functionality unique to the targeted molecule. In one non-limiting form,
   the molecularly imprinted molecule may include reception sites which extract one or more of trans
30 oct-2-en- 1 -al or trans-hex-2-en-1 -al from an air flow that passes thereby. Once a sufficient amount
   of the one or more of trans- oct-2-en-1-al or trans-hex-2-en-l-al is extracted and bound to the
   molecularly imprinted polymer section of sensor 38, 82, a corresponding signal to indicate bedbug
   presence may be sent to controller 48, 94 and/or to indicator 50, 92.
             In one form in which device 20, 70 detects the presence of a bedbug exoskeleton including
35 chitin, which comprises acetylglucosamine (N-acetyl-D-glucos-2-amine), sensor 38, 82 provides an
   enzyme in the form of a lysozyme. As would be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art,
   the lysozyme hydrolyzes N-acetyl-D-glucos-2-amine linkages to break-up the chitin structure.
                                                        11

   Sensor 38, 82 may be structured in one or more forms to detect the concentration of one or more
   molecules as the result of the hydrolysis reaction and arrangement 37, 81 may determine and
   indicate whether the tested sample is likely a biochemical substance 144 indicative of bedbug
   biochemistry based upon the concentration changes, or lack thereof, that result from the reaction.
 5          Sensor 38, 82 may utilize one or more forms of a wipe assay in alternative embodiments.
   In this form, one or more wipes may be used to swab a surface desirable for analysis and then
   placed into an assay analyzer of sensor 38, 82. In one form, an enzyme- linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELISA) may be provided at sensor 38, 82 to provide detection of a targeted antibody in
   bedbug saliva. The assay may utilize an lgE antibody which is specific to a nitrophorin antigen
10 present in the bedbug saliva. Another antibody coupled to an enzyme is provided which reacts with
   the nitrophorin-lgE antibody complex as would be appreciated by one having skill in the art. The
   second antibody may provide a chromogenic or fluorogenic signal indicative of the presence of the
   nitrophorin-IgE antibody complex. Consequently, a corresponding signal may be sent to controller
   48, 94 so that arrangement 37, 81 can indicate the presence of biochemical substance 144
15 indicative of bedbug biochemistry.
            It should be appreciated that sensor 38, 82 may utilize one or more biochemical reactions
   or analysis techniques to determine the presence of biochemical substance 144 indicative of a
   bedbug. These biochemical reactions and analysis techniques may include, but are not limited to:
   an electrochemical reaction; an antigen-antibody reaction; an endothermic reaction; an exothermic
20 reaction; assay analysis; SDS-Page; a glucose reaction monitor; and Kastle-Meyer analysis just to
   name a few examples. Additionally or alternatively, detection based on spectrometry and/or
   chromatography can be utilized, including for example, mass spectrometry and liquid
   chromatography. Furthermore, it is contemplated that as additional biochemical substances 144
   specific to bedbug biochemistry become targeted substances, arrangements 37, 81 may be modified
25 accordingly in order to provide adequate sensing techniques. Additionally, each of devices 20, 70
   may include one or more sensors in addition to sensors 38, 82 to either provide an expanded
   surface area of detection or an increased number of targeted biochemicals. Furthermore, it should
   be appreciated that as the targeted biochemical substance 144 changes, controller 48, 94 may also
   change in order to adequately handle sensor signals. For example, in varying forms, controller 48,
30 94 may be programmed with one or more control levels upon which determination of varying
   targeted biochemical substance(s) 144 indicative of bedbug biochemistry is to be evaluated.
            In one manner of detecting a biochemical substance 144, devices 20, 70 are specifically
   structured to identify the protein nitrophorin by, for example, detecting one or more peptides or
   peptide fragments thereof. In this form, sensor 38, 82 may be contacted with a surface in a room
35 where bedbug infestation might be likely to facilitate potential exposure to nitrophorin.
   Additionally or alternatively, an exemplary sample of any substances on the surface may be
   obtained by a user and then exposed to sensor 38, 82. In this latter manner, it should be appreciated
                                                       12

   that the sample may be further treated or processed before exposure to sensor 38, 82, including, for
   example, being mixed with one or more solvents or other carrier agents as necessary to facilitate
   analysis by sensor 38, 82.
   Sensor 38, 82 may utilize any one or more of the analytical methods described above, including
 5 one or more of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry and antigen-antibody reaction, for
   determining the presence of nitrophorin. If the presence of nitrophorin is positively indicated,
   devices 20, 70 may automatically notify a user of such. In another form, sensor 38, 82 determines
   the concentration of nitrophorin and compares that concentration with concentration levels pre
   programmed into devices 20, 70 which are indicative of bedbug presence before notifying a user of
10 the presence of nitrophorin. Upon the positive identification of a requisite amount of nitrophorin, a
   user may selectively apply an insecticide to the room or take other appropriate actions.
             As an alternative or addition to biochemical sensing techniques, other bedbug sensing
   mechanisms can be utilized. For example, a sensor responsive to the weight of a bedbug and/or the
   mechanical force exerted by a bedbug may be utilized. In another instance, electromagnetic
15 radiation is used to sense bedbugs by returning, blocking, and/or dispersing the radiation in a
   manner that can be detected and identified as being indicative of bedbug presence. In a specific
   implementation of this approach, bedbugs in device 20 and/or 70 are directed along a path such that
   a light beam directed across the path is broken/blocked when a bedbug travels along such path. As
   a result, the output signal from an optical detector responsive to the light beam changes state,
20 indicating the presence of the bedbug. Likewise, acoustic energy, such as ultrasound, may be used
   to detect bedbug presence. Additionally or alternatively, tarsal recognition or spectral analysis
   (including without limitation ultraviolet and infrared techniques) may also be used to detect the
   presence of the bedbugs.
             Various features of devices 20, 70 can be combined or omitted in other embodiments. In
25 one arrangement, device 20 or 70 is provided in the form of a probe with a sensing surface defined
   by sensor 32, 82. For example, the sensing surface may be impregnated with a detector substance
   which is exposed to a liquid bearing a sample submitted for detection of insect, or bedbug,
   indicative biochemicals. In response to the presence of such biochemicals in the same (a positive
   result), the sensing surface changes color to indicate likely insect presence. As such, this surface
30 also acts as an indicator in this arrangement, such that a separate indicator is not needed. In one
   form, this probe may resemble a human pregnancy test. In still other arrangements, it should be
   appreciated that controller, sensor, and/or indicator functions may be integral to each other such
   that they are represented as separate features in only a logical sense. In yet other arrangements, a
   controller may be absent in device 20 or 70 with sensor 38, 82 providing a signal directly to an
35 indicator or remote data gathering/analysis site.
             In Fig. 4 there is depicted one procedure 200 for using system 10. At stage 210 procedure
   200 is started either by attaching device 20, 70 to a desired location as indicated in Fig. 2 or by
                                                       13

   using a hand-held device a's illustrated in Fig. 3. A sample of one or more substances which may
   potentially include one or more targeted forms of biochemical substance 144 is obtained at stage
   220 to be analyzed by device 20, 70. At stage 230, sensor 38, 82 analyzes the sample to determine
   if it is a biochemical substance indicative of a bedbug. Sensor 38, 82 passes the analysis result onto
 5 controller 48, 94 which passes an output signal on to indicator 52, 100. Indicator 52, 100 is checked
   at stage 240 to determine if biochemical substance 144 is present. If biochemical substance 144 is
   present, then the human operator may exterminate at stage 245 using either exterminating system
   109 of device 70 or an alternative extermination method as would be appreciated by one having
   skill in the art. At stage 250, after indicator 52, 100 indicates at stage 240 that biochemical
10 substance 144 is not present and/or after extermination at stage 245, the human operator must
   determine whether to continue procedure 200. If the procedure 200 is continued, like for example
   at another location within the area being checked, then procedure 200 returns to restart, as indicated
   by arrow 255. If procedure 200 is not continued, then it halts at stage 260. Procedure 200 may be
   repeated continually until an entire bedbug population has been removed and/or detected or until
15 the human operator is satisfied that a sufficient period of time has passed without any indication of
   bedbug presence.
              In an alternative procedure, an attractant is used to lure bedbugs to a location submitted to
   detection with device 20 and/or 70. Such attractant can be included in device 20 or 70 and/or
   utilized externally/separately. These attractants can be included in a bait combined with an
20 insecticide for ingestion by bedbugs. The attractant can include one or more naturally occurring or
   synthetic bedbug attracting compounds -- which in one form may be structured to mimic one or
   more biological or physical requirements essential for bedbug survival while in another form may
   be known to draw bedbugs without correlation to survival -- to name just a few examples. Further
   details regarding the characteristics of the attractant, and or combination of the attractant with a bait
25 and/or insecticide, will be provided herein below in connection with attractant source 346 and bait
   362. If used, the attractant should be selected so as not to increase the number of false positive
   indications of bedbug presence with sensor 32, 82 beyond an unacceptable threshold. Such
   circumstances may in particular arise with attractants that simulate bedbug biochemistry.
              Referring now to Fig. 5, there is illustrated a diagrammatic view of a second type of system
30 310 suitable to address a bedbug infestation in room 15. System 310 includes at least one device
   320, which, as illustrated, is engaged with electrical wall receptacle 19 of room 15 and may be
   suitable for one or more of detecting, monitoring and controlling a bedbug population. The total
   number of devices 320 used in system 310 may vary in relation to the infestation problem and/or
   the time period in which an effective removal is desired. While wall receptacle 19 and device 320
35 are located below bed system 40, it should be appreciated that in one or more forms device 320
   may be placed alternatively throughout room 15. For example, in one form, device 320 may be
   engaged with a wall receptacle located alternatively to wall receptacle 19. In another form, device
                                                          14

   320 may utilize a power cord to facilitate its placement on, for example, bed system 40. It should
   be further appreciated that, dependent on proper power supply, device 320 may generally be placed
   at various locations in room 15, as described above in connection with device 20.
            Device 320 is shown in greater detail in a diagrammatic partial sectional view in Fig. 6. For
 5 this view, a few representative bedbugs BB are illustrated in and around device 320. Device 320
   generally includes a housing member 321 including an exterior wall 322 and an outer cover 325
   forming internal chambers 323 and 328a. It should be appreciated that chamber 323 is generally
   structured to provide a bedbug harborage for one or more bedbugs BB which may enter chamber
   323 through opening 326. As illustrated, a dividing wall 328 separates chamber 323 from chamber
10 328a, with chamber 328a being structured to provide a channel for one more bedbug attractants to
   be released from chamber 328a through opening 326, which is accessible by bedbugs BB, and
   opening 327, which is not accessible by bedbugs BB. Opening 327 is directed to the external
   environment of the area in which device 320 is located, as indicated by directional arrow A.
   Opening 327 is generally structured to permit the attractant to be released from chamber 328a but
15 prohibits a bedbug from entering chamber 328a so that components of operating system 338 are not
   disturbed. Dividing wall 328 defines one or more permeable sections or openings 328b through
   which attractants or heat may be dispersed from chamber 328a into chamber 323 and out of
   opening 326, in order to draw bedbugs BB into chamber 323; however, openings 328b are
   structured to prevent the passage of bedbugs BB from chamber 323 into chamber 328.
20 Additionally, it should be understood that chamber 323 may include one or more openings in
   addition to opening 326 and that opening 326 and any additional openings may include one or more
   light blocking devices to prohibit light from entering chamber 323.
            Housing member 321 is generally rigid and has an approximately L-shaped profile. The
   shorter leg of this profile is structured as a cantilever 324 including an end wall 329 through which
25 an electrical plug 330 extends. Plug 330 includes first prong 331 and second prong 332 with each
   being structured to engage with a corresponding socket of electrical wall receptacle 19. Plug 330 is
   typically joined to receptacle 19 with a friction fit connection that is typically aided by leaf springs
   biased to press against prongs 331 and 332 within receptacle 19. With this connection, terminal
   ends 331a, 332a of each of respective prongs 331, 332 can be inserted into the socket of receptacle
30 19 until end wall 329 comes into contact with an exterior portion of receptacle 19. Once fully
   inserted, top portions 33 lb, 332b engage with a corresponding surface in the socket of wall
   receptacle 19 to provide support for device 320. In this arrangement, as the weight of device 320
   forces housing member 321 in a downward direction, as indicated by directional arrow B, top
   portions 33 1b, 332b remain in sufficient contact with the corresponding structure of the socket of
35 wall receptacle 19 to prevent device 320 from moving out of its illustrated vertical position.
   Accordingly, device 320 is structured for a cantilevered connection to the receptacle 19 such that is
   may be suspended above the floor. As illustrated, device 320 is otherwise freestanding, with no
                                                         15

   support structure needed except for the plug 330/receptacle 19 engagement. It should be
   appreciated that in other embodiments, the longer leg of the L-shaped 321 housing may be arranged
   to articulate relative to the cantilever connection to receptacle 19 and/or housing 321 may be
   differently shaped.
 5          Device 320 further includes an operating system 338 structured to control a bedbug
   population. System 338 includes various components disposed in both chamber 323 and chamber
   328a. In the illustrated form, system 338 includes a controller 340, a fan module 342, a heat source
   344, an attractant source 346, a sensor 348, and an extermination module 350. Plug 330 may be
   connected to controller 340 through any standard manner, like for example soldering, riveting,
10 mechanical terminals or the like to provide an electrical power to system 338. Typically, power
   from an AC (alternating current) source is converted to DC (direct current) electricity to power
   electronic devices, and such power conversion circuitry would be included in device 320 as needed,
   but is not shown to preserved clarity. In still other embodiments, some or all of the components of
   system 338 are passive in nature, not requiring a persistent source of electrical power.
15          Controller 340 is comprised of one or more components that may be configured as a single
   unit, or distributed among two or more units. Such components may be of a solid state,
   electromagnetic, optical, and/or different variety as would occur to those skilled in the art. The
   controller 340 may include analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or a hybrid combination of both
   of these types. In one form, the controller 340 is of the programmable variety that executes
20 algorithms and processes data in accordance with its operating logic being defined by programming
   instructions (such as software or firmware). Alternatively or additionally, the operating logic for
   controller 340 is at least partially defined by hardwired logic or other hardware. Controller 340
   sends controller output signals along signal pathways 341, 343, and -345 to each of the respective
   fan module 342, heat source 344, and attractant source 346.
25          Fan module 342 may operate as a function of the controller output signal sent via signal
   pathway 341 and may include one or more of a motor and a fan blade assembly structured to create
   air flow, as would be appreciated by one having skill in the art. It should be understood that fan
   module 342 may be of any standard form and may include one or more components in addition to
   or in lieu of those mentioned. The air flow created by fan module 342 generally moves in chamber
30 328a past heat source 344 and attractant source 346, both of which will be discussed in further
   detail in general reference to Figs. 5-7, and through openings 327, 328b and 326 to exit device 320.
   In one form, the air flow may carry one or more of heat from heat source 344 or an attractant from
   attractant source 346 to the external environment in which device 320 is placed to attract one or
   more insects, such as bedbugs, to device 320, as will also be explained in further detail in reference
35 to Figs. 5-7 generally. Furthermore, it is contemplated that the force of the air flow created by fan
   module 342 may be varied in different embodiments to create a stronger or weaker diffusion of
   heat and/or attractant. In one form, the force of the air flow may be dependent on the temperature
                                                       16

   of the heat and/or the attraction potency of the attractant. In another form for example, the force of
   the air flow may be dependent on the area from which a human operator desires to attract the one
   or more insects.
             Sensor 348 is located in chamber 323 and is generally structured to detect the presence of
 5 one or more bedbugs BB in chamber 323. It should be appreciated that in alternative forms, sensor
   348 may be placed external to chamber 323 on the exterior of device 320, to detect one or more
   bedbugs BB being attracted to device 320. Sensor 348 may include any one or more of motion
   detectors, heat detectors, photo-optic detectors, weight detectors, and biochemical detectors, just to
   name a few possibilities. In an embodiment not illustrated, it is contemplated that sensor 348 may
10 include a closed circuit detection arrangement employing magnetic sensors. In this form, opening
   326 may include a biasable door, which upon being opened in response to the weight of a bedbug,
   misaligns the magnetic sensors and opens the circuit to detect the bedbug's presence. In another
   form, sensor 348 may be structured to detect a bedbug through tarsal or spectral confirmation.
   Sensor 348 may additionally or alternatively include a biochemical detector to detect one or more
15 biochemical substances indicative of bedbugs, as described above. As an alternative or additional
   sensing mechanism, electromagnetic radiation is used to sense bedbugs by returning, blocking,
   and/or dispersing the radiation in a manner that can be detected and identified as being indicative of
   bedbug presence, as described above with respect to devices 20, 70.
             In response to detecting the presence of a bedbug, sensor 348 generates a corresponding
20 sensor signal that is conveyed along signal path 347 to controller 340. Controller 340 may process
   the sensor signal and then generate an additional controller output release signal which is sent
   along signal pathway 349 to extermination module 350. As illustrated in phantom, extermination
   module 350 includes an internal reservoir 352 communicating with an applicator tip 354. A closing
   member 358 is biased to a closed position adjacent the applicator tip 354. The contents of reservoir
25 352 include an insecticide 356 toxic to bedbugs. In response to the release signal from signal
   pathway 349, closing member 358 opens to release insecticide 356 in a fluid form, such as an
   aerosol, gas, liquid, or powder into chamber 323 to exterminate the one or more bedbugs BB
   present therein. Closing member 358 may remain open to release the insecticide 356 into chamber
   323 until controller 340 stops sending the release signal along signal pathway 349 to extermination
30 module 350. In another form, extermination module 350 may be directly connected to sensor 348
   and operate as a function of sensor 348 detecting one or more bedbugs. In this form, extermination
   module 350 and sensor 348 may be connected by one or more of a hard-wired or wireless electrical
   connection or by a mechanical connection. An insecticide toxic to bedbugs may also be present in
   chamber 323 either with or without extermination module 350. In one form, insecticide is present
35 in combination with an attractant in the form of bait structured for ingestion. Furthermore, chamber
   323 may also contain one or more additional attractant sources (not shown). It should be
   appreciated that insecticide 356 may include one or more of the varieties disclosed herein below
                                                       17

   and will generally be structured to deliver a lethal effect on a bedbug through either contact
   exposure to the cuticle of a bedbug, insufflation through spiracles and/or ingestion.
            In an unillustrated embodiment, system 338 may further include an indicator structured to
   notify a human operator of a positive or negative indication of the presence of one or more
 5 bedbugs. The indicator may be linked with controller 340 and operate as a function of a controller
   output signal which is generated in response to the sensor signal. In one form, the indicator
   includes one or more visual markers in the form of a light, a light emitting diode (LED),
   fluorescent, incandescent, and/or neon, output amongst other possibilities. In each form, the
   presence of a bedbug may be indicated by, for example, a discrete yes/no indicator, a color change,
10 a flashing sequence, or other change in indicator state. In alternative forms, the indicator provides
   an output indicating the presence of one or more bedbugs in the form of a colorimetric strip or an
   aural/audio signal. For embodiments with an indicator, such indicator may be structured to provide
   information in addition to a positive or negative indication of bedbug presence, such as a
   concentration or quantitative measurement from sensor 348.
15          It should be understood that device 320 may not include one or more of the components of
   system 338 as illustrated in Fig 6. For example, Fig. 7 depicts an alternative embodiment as device
   360 suitable for one or more of detecting, monitoring and controlling a bedbug population; where
   like numerals refer to like features previously described. Device 360 includes attractant source 346
   in chamber 328a without a fan module or controller. In this form, plug 330 is connected to
20 attractant source 346 as shown by electrical circuitry 361 which may include any AC/DC
   converters or other components desired to implement proper operation. Attractant source 346,
   discussed in further detail below, may include one or more attractants releasable therefrom as
   electrical power is supplied from plug 330 and passed therethrough. The attractant is generally
   structured to allure or attract one or more bedbugs to device 360.
25          In device 360, chamber 328a is in communication with chamber 423 of device 360 to
   permit passage of attractant from source 346 to chamber 423 via opening 328b. Chamber 423
   opens into opening 326 and is arranged to provide a bedbug harborage like chamber 323 of device
   320, with opening 328b being sized and/or shaped to prevent passage of bedbugs into chamber
   328a from chamber 423. Chamber 423 includes one or more trapping features 423b disposed on
30 each of angled surfaces 423a, with each of surfaces 423a being structured to prohibit a bedbug BB
   from leaving chamber 423 at opening 326. In one form, surfaces 423a may comprise one or more
   of a polished glass or metal or other traction reducing substance(s) designed to prohibit movement
   of the bedbugs across surfaces 423a. In another form, surfaces 423a may include trapping features
   423b in the form of an adhesive material or petroleumjelly, with each being structured to limit
35 bedbug movement. In still another form, surfaces 423a may be configured with one or more
   mechanical barriers which prohibit bedbug movement from chamber 423 in the direction of
   opening 326. Trapping features 423b may alternatively or additionally include a slipping, anti
                                                      18

   friction agent that prevents sufficient traction for bedbugs to escape from chamber 423. While
   trapping features 423b are illustrated on surface 423a, it should be understood that one or more
   areas of chamber 423 may include one or more forms of trapping features 423b. It should be
   appreciated that a bedbug trapped in chamber 423 may remain therein until eventual extermination,
 5 removal by a human operator, or death by starvation. Additionally, device 360 may include one or
   more insecticides dispersed throughout chamber 423 in addition to or in lieu of trapping features
   423b.
            As illustrated in Fig. 7, chamber 423 further comprises bait 362 which may include one or
   more forms of attractant as provided by attractant source 346 and one or more forms of insecticide
10 356. Bait 362 may mimic a blood meal source and is generally structured to induce one or more
   bedbugs to enter chamber 423 and eat therefrom. When a bedbug eats bait 362, a toxic amount of
   insecticide 356 is ingested, resulting in extermination of the bedbug. In another embodiment,
   insecticide 356 may be provided in a form which is toxic to a bedbug through exposure rather than
   ingestion, and may be placed on or about bait 362. This form may be used in addition to or in lieu
15 of insecticide in an ingestible form. One nonlimiting approach facilitates passing of the insecticide
   356 from one bedbug to the next and/or transfer to bedbug eggs to bring about mortality.
            Referring generally to Figs. 5-7, devices 320, 360 may comprise any number of suitable
   materials including certain polymers, woods, metals, or any mixtures thereof. The internal surfaces
   of chamber 323,423 may comprise a material the same as, or different than, the rest of devices 320,
20 360.-For example, in one embodiment, chamber 323, 423 includes a surface suitable for the
   assembling of bedbugs and/or the depositing of one or more bedbug eggs thereon. In this
   embodiment, the surface may be a textured surface defined by fabric, paper, or wood. A surface
   resembling any one or more of mattress 44, box springs 45, legs 41a-41d, frame 42, headboard 43,
   wallpaper, carpet, plaster, and bed sheets, just to name a few possibilities, may also be included
25 within chamber 323, 423.
            In the illustrated embodiments, plug 330 of device 320, 360 is generally structured to
   engage with wall receptacle 19 of room 15 when wall receptacle 19 provides a 110-120 Volts AC
   electric power. As would be appreciated by one having skill in the art, prong 331 is slightly larger
   than prong 332 to provide one-way keying for engagement with receptacle 19. In an alternative
30 form in which polarity control is not significant, prongs 331, 332 may be the same size. Plug 330
   may also include a third grounding prong in addition to prongs 331, 332 in other embodiments. It is
   contemplated that in an alternative embodiment device 320, 360 may include an adjustable plug
   330 and corresponding circuitry that can adapt to other types of power and can include an internal
   source, such as a battery that is charged through receptacle 19 to provide back-up power when
35 receptacle power fails.
            In varying forms, heat source 344 may use power from plug 330 to produce heat in any
   standard manner, including for example, with a coil resistance heater, a metal oxide resistance
                                                        19

   heater, or a PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) heater, just to name a few possibilities. In one
   instance, heat source 344 generates heat in an amount commensurate with the presence of a blood
   meal source and/or suitable bedbug harborage. In another form, the heat may be in an amount
   commensurate to release one or more attractants from attractant source 346 as described below. In
 5 one such form, heat source 344 can be structured to increase the temperature of chamber 323 to a
   climate most preferred by bedbugs, like for example, in the range of 70 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
   In another example, heat source 344 is structured to increase the temperature of chamber 323 to
   mimic the body temperature of a blood meal source to increase attraction of one or more bedbugs.
   In one form, where the blood meal source is a human, the temperature is raised by heat source 344
10 to around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. It should be understood that fan module 342 may push heat at
   any temperature out of chamber 328a through hole 327, to attract one or more bedbugs to device
   320, in addition to or in lieu of modifying the temperature of chamber 323.
            Alternatively or additionally, heat from source 344 can be controlled to provide a thermal
   level sufficient to exterminate bedbugs once present in chamber 323. In this exterminating form,
15 heat source 344 may be used to raise the temperature of chamber 323 to a level where a sufficient
   duration of exposure kills a bedbug. In one exterminating form, the temperatures may be raised to
   somewhere in the range of 99 to 125 degrees Fahrenheit. It should be understood that in some
   embodiments, heat source 344 may provide even higher temperatures, where a shorter duration of
   exposure time is sufficient for extermination. Furthermore, heat source 344 may be coupled with
20 one or more controls structured to dictate the time and/or temperature at which source 344 heats.
            Attractant source 346 generally includes one or more attractants structured to induce one or
   more bedbugs into entering chamber 323, 423 of devices 320, 360. The one or more attractants
   may be in a gel, gas, aerosol, powder, liquid, or particulate form, just to name a few possibilities.
   As indicated above, one or more attractants the same as or similar to attractant source 346 may also
25 be used on or near one or more of devices 20 and 70. Attractant source 346 may include one or
   more holding and releasing structures dependent upon the selected attractant(s) and the form in
   which the attractant(s) is used. For example, in one form, attractant source 346 may include a
   porous matrix dispensing member holding the attractant in a particulate or powdered form. In this
   embodiment, the attractant may be released from attractant source 346 by the air flow produced by
30 fan module 342 and carried out of chamber 328a or passed into chamber 323. In another form,
   attractant source 346 may include a gel matrix which holds the attractant. The attractant may be
   released from the gel matrix, for example, by exposure to heat from heat source 344 or electrical
   current provided by plug 330. In another form, attractant source 346 may include a holding
   reservoir from which the attractant may be released upon reception of a controller output signal
35 along pathway 345. Furthermore, in another contemplated embodiment, the attractant may be time
   released from attractant source 346 in conjunction with, for example, a time delayed chemical
   reaction. In one such form, the chemical reaction may be dependent upon a controller output signal
                                                      20

   sent via signal pathway 345. In either of these forms, the attractant may emanate from attractant
   source 346 based upon its own chemical and physical properties or may be displaced from chamber
   328a and/or into chamber 323 with air flow created by fan module 342.
             Attractant source 346 includes one or more attractants which may be naturally occurring or
 5 synthetic bedbug alluring compounds structured to mimic one or more biological or physical
   requirements essential for bedbug survival. In one form, the attractant may include any
   combination of one or more of avian or mammalian pheromones, hormones, sweat, epidermic oils,
   blood, choline, and other body odors, such as those associated with, for example, halitosis. The
   bedbug attraction associated with any combination of compositions in attractant source 346 may be
10 further enhanced by the production of heat by heat source 344. Furthermore, heat can be used to
   liberate attractant with or without the aid of a fan. Attractant source 346 may further be placed
   within a controlled atmosphere or emit one or more gases therefrom by evaporation, sublimation,
   diffusion, or such other mechanism as would occur to those skilled in the art.
             In one embodiment, attractant source 346 provides a controlled level of carbon dioxide
15 (C0 2 ) in and/or surrounding device 320, 360 to attract bedbugs. For instance, the CO 2 level can be
   regulated to simulate the concentration of CO 2 exhaled by a blood meal source for a bedbug.
   Accordingly, this level may mimic that of a mammal, including but not limited to, domesticated
   animals and pets, bats, rats, or humans. In one preferred form, a CO 2 level indicative of a human
   blood meal source is provided, such as a CO 2 level between about 0.01 and 1.0 percent of the
20 atmosphere in or surrounding device 320, 360. In another preferred form, attractant source 346 may
   distribute between 0.003 to 0.042 mL of CO 2 per square meter of surface of either attractant source
   346 or device 320, 360. Device 320, 360 may include an internal reservoir of CO 2 and one or more
   release mechanisms to control the distribution rate of the CO 2 . In alternative embodiments, the
   humidity levels of the atmosphere in or surrounding device 320, 360 may be altered in addition to
25 or in lieu of a CO 2 level change.
             In an embodiment where attractant source 346 includes a sweat simulating compound,
   various levels of sodium chloride (NaCI) and urea ((NH 2 )2 CO) may be included. One or more
   odorants, such as 2-methylphenol or 4-methylphenol, may be included in attractant source 346 with
   or without the presence of one or more of sodium chloride or urea. In one form, the epidermic oil
30 may mimic sebum as produced by the human sebaceous gland and may include a mixture of one or
   more of wax monoesters, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and squalene. It should be understood that
   the quantity of each may vary in order to control one or more chemical characteristics of the
   epidermic oil, such as for example, stereochemistry, pH level, or electrochemistry, to assist in its
   attracting function. It is further contemplated that attractant source 346 may include additional
35 compounds associated with the human body, including glucose, lactic acid, or bile salts such as
   choline, just to name a few example. Furthermore, one or more of sodium taurocholate and sodium
                                                       21

   glycocholate or a mixture thereof may be added to the various forms and embodiments of
   attractants included in attractant source 346.
             In another form, attractant source 346 may include one or more attractants associated with
   bedbugs. By way of nonlimiting example, pheromones may be included in one or more forms of an
 5 assembling or aggregative pheromone, a sexual pheromone, or an aggression stimulating
   pheromone. In one example, the pheromone is similar to one contained in one or more scent
   producing glands of a bedbug. In another example, one or more extracts of bedbug excreta or other
   bedbug secretions may be used. In yet another example, an extract of excreta obtained using a
   mixture of water and methanol solvent is present as an attractant.
10           It should be appreciated that bait 362 may include any whole or part of a blood meal
   source, including but not limited to synthetic or natural avian or mammalian blood. While
   illustrated in connection with device 360, and described in connection with both of devices 320,
   360, it should be appreciated that bait 362 may be implemented with either of the other devices 20
   and 70. For one implementation, the mammalian blood may be in the form of human blood and
15 may include one or more of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma, the plasma
   including but not limited to, albumin, thrombogenic factors, immunoglobulins, hormones, proteins,
   and/or electrolytes. It should be understood that the mixture of the above elements may change in
   alternative embodiments to alter attracting or ingestion qualities. It is contemplated that the bait
   362 may be placed in or about chamber 323, 423 or on or about the exterior of each of the
20 respective devices 320, 360. In one form, the bait may be intermixed with one or more forms of
   attractant releasable by attractant source 346 as described above. In another form, bait 362 is mixed
   with insecticide 56 such that consuming the bait will deliver a lethal dose of insecticide 356 to a
   bedbug, as described above in regard to Fig. 7.
             In one unillustrated form, in which bait 362 is utilized, it may include one or more features
25 designed to simulate a human being. For example, an external layer mimicking skin may enclose
   an internal reservoir including one or more blood meal forms, which in one embodiment may be
   human blood. The external layer may include one or more of the above listed attractants and may
   further include additional features, such as pores, hair follicles, and/or hair shafts. In one particular
   implementation, the external layer is indicative of the arms and shoulder of a human blood meal.
30 The bait 362 may further emit CO 2 and or be placed in a CO 2 controlled environment as previously
   described. Heat from heating source 344 may further be included to make the temperature of the
   external layer indicative of the epidermis of a human. One or more forms of insecticide may be
   mixed with a blood meal attractant and structured so that as a bedbug pierces the external layer and
   attempts to feed on the blood meal, a lethal dosage of insecticide is delivered to the bedbug. The
35 bait 362 may further include one or more features capable of restricting blood loss from the
   reservoir from piercings created by a bedbug.
                                                       22

            It should be further understood that the components of devices 320, 360 can be connected
   using wired or wireless techniques. For a further embodiment, information is relayed by a wired or
   wireless communication signal pathway from device 320, 360 to a remote site for further data
   collection and analysis. This remote site could be a computer coupled to device 320 and/or 360 by
 5 a computer network in a designated room of a hotel, nursing home, cruise ship, train, dormitory,
   barracks, hospital, or the like and/or could even be remote relative to such structures, like a pest
   control service provider business location or the like. In still other arrangements, it should be
   appreciated that one or components of system 338 may be integral to each other such that they are
   represented as separate features in only a logical sense. It should be appreciated that devices 320 or
10 360 could be adapted to provide an air freshener or fragrance and/or to provide air purification in
   addition to insect control operations.
            Fig. 8 depicts one procedure 500 for using system 310 in flowchart form. At stage 510,
   procedure 500 begins. Following stage 510 is stage 520 in which system 310 is installed, including
   for example engaging device 320, 360 or one or more variations thereof with wall receptacle 19 of
15 room 15. After installation, system 310 begins to attract one or more bedbugs in accordance with
   one or more embodiments disclosed. At stage 540, inspection of system 310 occurs to see if
   bedbugs or signs indicative of bedbug infestation are present. It is contemplated that the inspection
   may be facilitated by one or more of sensor 348 or visual inspection by a human operator. A
   determination of the presence of one or more bedbugs is made at stage 550. If it is determined that
20 one or more bedbugs are present, the bedbugs may be exterminated at stage 555. In one form,
   extermination module 350 exterminates the bedbugs in response to an output signal from controller
   340. In another form, where extermination module 350 is absent, the human operator may
   determine whether to exterminate the bedbugs. If no bedbugs or signs indicative of bedbugs are
   present and a sufficient period of time has passed to satisfy the human operator that no bedbugs are
25 present, then the operator may proceed to step 570 and halt procedure 500. If however signs of
   bedbugs are present or a sufficient period of time has not passed to satisfy the human operator of a
   lack of presence of bedbugs, procedure 500 may be started over again as indicated by arrow 565.
   Procedure 500 may be continually repeated until an entire bedbug population has been removed
   and/or the human operator is satisfied that a sufficient period of time has passed without any
30 indication of bedbug presence, indicating their absence.
            As indicated above, it is contemplated that one or more embodiments may include an
   insecticide 124, 356 effective for exterminating one or more bedbugs. In one form, insecticide 124,
   356 may include one or more of 1,2 dichloropropane, 1,3 dichloropropene, abamectin, acephate,
   acequinocyl, acetamiprid, acethion, acetoprole, acrinathrin, acrylonitrile, alanycarb, aldicarb,
