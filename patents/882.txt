   COMBINATION THERAPY FOR COPD
          FIELD OF THE INVENTION
          The present invention relates to pharmaceutical aerosol solution formulations
   intended for use with pressurized metered dose inhalers, comprising glycopyrronium
   bromide and formoterol or a salt thereof. The invention further relates to use of such
 5 formulations in the prevention and therapy of respiratory disorders, including
   COPD.
          BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
          Glycopyrronium bromide (also known as glycopyrrolate) is a muscarinic M3
   anticholinergic agent used to reduce salivation associated with administration of
10 certain anaesthetics, and as adjunctive therapy for peptic ulcers. It has also been
   reported to be effective in the treatment of asthmatic symptoms (Hansel et al., Chest
   2005; 128:1974-1979).
          WO 2005/107873 relates to use of glycopyrrolate for the treatment of
   childhood asthma.
15        WO 01/76575      discloses a controlled release formulation for pulmonary
   delivery of glycopyrrolate. The formulation is intended for use in treatment of
   respiratory disease, in particular chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   The application focuses on dry powder formulations suitable for delivery by means
   of a dry powder inhaler (DPI).
20        WO     2005/074918      discloses    combinations    of    glycopyrrolate    with
   glucocorticoid drugs, and their use for treating diseases of the respiratory tract.
          WO 2005/110402 refers to combinations of glycopyrrolate and a beta-2
   agonist of the class of indane or of benzothiazole-2-one derivatives for treatment of
   inflammatory or obstructive airway diseases.
25        WO    2006/105401      refers  to   combinations   of    an   anticholinergic,  a

                                             2
   corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-2 agonist for prevention and treatment of
   respiratory, inflammatory or obstructive airway diseases. The anticholinergic is
   optionally glycopyrrolate.
          According to WO 2007/057223 and WO 2007/057222,              combinations of
 5 glycopyrronium bromide respectively with an anti-inflammatory steroid and, in
   particular, with mometasone furoate provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of
   inflammatory and obstructive airways diseases.
          WO    2007/057221    and WO     2007/057219    refer to  combinations    of a
   glycopyrronium salt with an indanyl derivative beta-2 agonist (or analogue) and
10 respectively with an anti-inflammatory steroid and, in particular, with mometasone
   furoate.
          Formoterol is a beta-2 agonist drug capable of relaxing smooth muscle in the
   bronchi and opening the airways to reduce wheezing conditions. It is commonly
   used in the management of asthma and other respiratory conditions.
15        Recently an effective combination therapy comprising formoterol fumarate
   and beclometasone dipropionate (a corticosteroid) has become available under the
   trade-name Foster®. Foster is designed for delivery by aerosol to the lungs using a
   pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI). It has long been known that aerosol
   solutions of formoterol fumarate are relatively unstable and have a short shelf-life
20 when stored under suboptimal conditions. The Foster® formulation incorporates a
   quantity of inorganic acid in order to stabilize the formoterol component (as
   described in EP 1157689).
          It would be desirable to provide a clinically useful combination aerosol
   product that combines the therapeutic benefits of formoterol and glycopyrronium
25 bromide, optionally in conjunction with beclometasone dipropionate. Such a product
   would need to be formulated in a manner such that each individual pharmaceutically
   active component is delivered to the lungs in effective and consistent doses over an

                                                3
   extended product lifetime, and ideally without the need for storage under special
   conditions of temperature or humidity.

15        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
          The present invention provides          a pharmaceutical      aerosol  formulation
   comprising:
          (a) glycopyrronium bromide at a dosage in the range of 0.5 - 100 pg per
          actuation; and
20        (b) formoterol or a salt thereof at a dosage in the range of 1-25 pg per actuation;
          dissolved in HFA propellant and a co-solvent, wherein the formulation also
   comprises an inorganic acid as stabilizing agent. Optionally the formulation further
   comprises beclometasone dipropionate.
          In another aspect the invention provides the use of a combination product
25 comprising glycopyrronium bromide and formoterol or a salt thereof for the
   prevention or treatment of COPD and other respiratory diseases.
          In yet another aspect, the invention provides a canister for use with a pMDI

                                               4
   comprising:
           (a) glycopyrronium bromide; and
           (b) formoterol or a salt thereof;
           dissolved in HFA propellant and a co-solvent, wherein the formulation also
 5 comprises an inorganic acid as stabilizing agent.
       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
           When attempts were made to formulate a combination solution formulation
   product comprising both glycopyrronium bromide and formoterol it was surprisingly
   found that the formoterol component underwent significant degradation upon storage
10 under conditions of high temperature and high relative humidity, to an extent that
   made the product clinically and commercially non-viable. This was despite the
   presence of acid in the formulation, which would normally be adequate to stabilise
   the formoterol component.
           It also emerged that glycopyrronium bromide is normally unstable in aerosol
15 solution formulations based on HFA and co-solvent, but is stabilized by the
   inclusion of acid in the formulation.
           Upon further analysis, it was shown that in the presence of glycopyrronium
   bromide a portion of the formoterol component undergoes degradation to a range of
   different products. Under suboptimal conditions the amount of the degradation
20 product termed DP3 can exceed the identification and qualification reporting
   thresholds for new drug products (as defined in ICH Guideline Q3B(R2)). Thus, it
   became clear that the formulation needed to be altered so as to improve formoterol
   stability and reduce the levels of DP3 and other unwanted degradation products.
           Subsequent experimentation has revealed that one successful approach to
25 avoiding these stability issues is the inclusion of an optimised amount of acid in the
   formulation     so that both     the  formoterol  and  the  glycopyrronium     bromide
   components are stabilized. In particular, the present inventors found that inclusion of

                                               5
   an amount of IM HCl in the range of 0.1-0.3 pg/pl, preferably 0.15-0.28 pg/pl,
   more preferably 0.18-0.26 pg/pl, even more preferably 0.19-0.245 pg/pl in the
   solution is sufficient to favour stabilisation      of glycopyrronium bromide and
   formoterol over an extended period of non-optimal storage, thereby ensuring a
 5 consistent dose of glycopyrronium bromide and of formoterol for every actuation of
   the pMDI containing the solution formulation. The amount of acid included in the
   formulation is conveniently defined in terms of amount of added acid rather than in
   terms of resulting pH because the latter is poorly defined in non-aqueous systems
   such as propellant-based solutions.
10        A further significant discovery is that removal of oxygen from the canister
   headspace further stabilizes formoterol in combination solution formulations with
   glycopyrronium bromide.
           Glycopyrronium          bromide,          chemically          defined         as
   3- [(cyclopentylhydroxyphenylacetyl)oxy] -1,1 -dimethylpyrrolidinium      bromide,   has
15 two chiral centres corresponding to four potential different stereoisomers with
   configurations    (3R,2'R)-,  (3S,2'R)-,  (3R,2'S)-  and   (3S,2'S)-.  Glycopyrronium
   bromide in the form of any of these pure enantiomers or diastereomers or any
   combination thereof may be used in practising the present invention. In one
   embodiment             of         the          invention          the          (3S,2'R),
20 (3R,2'S)-3 - [(cyclopentylhydroxyphenylacetyl)oxy] -1,1 -dimethylpyrrolidinium
   bromide     racemic    mixture,   also   known    as   glycopyrrolate,    is  preferred.
   Glycopyrronium bromide is present in the formulation in an amount in the range
   from 0.005 to 0.14% (w/w), preferably from 0.010 to 0.13% (w/w), more preferably
   from 0.015 to 0.04% (w/w), wherein% (w/w) means the amount by weight of the
25 component, expressed as percent with respect to the total weight of the composition.
           Glycopyrrolate is commercially available, and can be synthesized according
   to the process described in US 2,956,062 or in Franko BV and Lunsford CD, J Med

   Pharm Chem 2(5), 523-540, 1960.
          The    propellant      component     of   the    composition    may     be   any
   pressure-liquefied propellant and is preferably a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) or a
   mixture of different HFAs, more preferably selected from the group consisting of
 5 HFA 134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), HFA 227 (1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane),
   and mixtures thereof. The preferred HFA is HFA 134a. HFAs may be present in the
   formulation in an amount in the range from 75 to 95% (w/w), preferably from 85 to
   90% (w/w).
          The formoterol component of the formulation can be in the form of the free
10 base, or as a salt or a solvate. Preferably the formoterol is provided in the form of
   formoterol fumarate. Formoterol fumarate can, for instance, be employed in the
   formulation in an amount of 0.005-0.07% w/w, preferably 0.01-0.02% w/w.
          The co-solvent incorporated into formulations of the invention has a higher
   polarity than that of the propellant and may include one or more substances such as a
15 pharmaceutically acceptable alcohol, in particular ethanol, or a polyol such as
   propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol.
          Advantageously the co-solvent is selected from the group of lower branched
   or linear alkyl (Ci-C 4 ) alcohols such as ethanol and isopropyl alcohol. Preferably the
   co-solvent is ethanol.
20        The concentration of the co-solvent will vary depending on the final
   concentration of the active ingredient in the formulation and on the type of
   propellant. For example, ethanol may be used in a concentration comprised in the
   range from 5 to 25% (w/w), preferably from 8 to 20% (w/w), more preferably from
   10 to 15% (w/w). In one of the preferred embodiments the concentration of ethanol
25 is 12% (w/w).
          The ratio of propellant to co-solvent in the formulation is in the range from
   50:50 to 95:5 (w/w).

                                                7
          It is envisaged that HCl of different molarity or alternative inorganic acids
   (mineral acids) could substitute for IM HCl in the formulations of the invention. For
   instance, alternative acids could be any pharmaceutically acceptable monoprotic or
   polyprotic acid, such as (but not limited to): hydrogen halides (hydrochloric acid,
 5 hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid etc.) phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulphuric acid,
   and halogen oxoacids.
          It is preferred that the pharmaceutically active components of the composition
   are substantially completely and homogeneously dissolved in the mixture of
   propellant and co-solvent, i.e. the composition is preferably a solution formulation.
10        Optionally the     solution formulation    compositions    may comprise      other
   pharmaceutical     excipients   or additives known in the art. In particular, the
   compositions of the invention may comprise one or more low volatility components.
   Low volatility components are useful in order to increase the mass median
   aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the aerosol particles upon actuation of the
15 inhaler and/or to improve the solubility of the active ingredient in the propellant/co
   solvent mixture.
          The low volatility component, when present, has a vapour pressure at 25'C
   lower    than    0.1   kPa,    preferably   lower   than   0.05    kPa.   Examples     of
   low-volatility components are esters such as isopropyl myristate, ascorbyl myristate,
20 tocopherol esters; glycols such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol;
   and surface active agents such as saturated organic carboxylic acids (e.g. lauric,
   myristic, stearic acid) or unsaturated carboxylic acids (e.g. oleic or ascorbic acid).
          The amount of low volatility component may vary from 0.1 to 10% w/w,
   preferably from 0.5 to 5% (w/w), more preferably between 1 and 2% (w/w).
25        In another embodiment, an amount of water comprised between 0.005 and
   0.3% (w/w) may optionally be added to the formulations in order to favourably
   affect the solubility of the active ingredient without increasing the MMAD of the

                                               8
   aerosol droplets upon actuation.
          Advantageously, the formulations of the invention are free of excipients (such
   as surfactants) other than co-solvent, propellant and a stabilizing amount of an acid.
          The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may further comprise
 5 other,   additional pharmaceutically    active   agents for separate,      sequential or
   simultaneous use. Optional additional pharmaceutically active components of the
   composition include any known in the art for prophylaxis or treatment of respiratory
   diseases and their symptoms. Examples of these active components are: beta-2
   agonists   such as salbutamol,      fenoterol,   carmoterol    (TA-2005),     indacaterol,
10 milveterol, vilanterol (GSK 642444), terbultaline, salmeterol,            bitolterol, and
   metaproterenol in form of single stereoisomers or mixtures thereof and salts thereof;
   corticosteroids   such   as  beclometasone     dipropionate,    fluticasone   propionate,
   butixocort, mometasone furoate, triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide and its 22R
   epimer, ciclesonide, flunisolide, loteprednol, and rofleponide; other anti-muscarinic
15 drugs such as methscopolamine, ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide and
   tiotropium bromide; phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors such as: cilomilast, roflumilast,
   and tetomilast.
          In a preferred embodiment,        compositions    of the      invention comprise
   beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) as active agent in addition to the formoterol and
20 glycopyrronium bromide components. In that embodiment BDP is preferably present
   in the formulation in an amount of 0.07-0.41 % w/w, preferably 0.1-0.3 % w/w.
          The compositions of the invention can be inhaled from any suitable known
   pressurized MDI device. Desired doses of the individual pharmaceutically active
   components of the formulation are dependent on the identity of the component and
25 the type and severity of the disease condition, but are preferably such that a
   therapeutic amount of the active ingredient is delivered in one or two actuations.
   Generally speaking, doses of active ingredient are in the range of about 0.5 - 1000

                                               9
   pg per actuation, e.g. about 1-100 pg/actuation, and sometimes about 5-50
    tg/actuation. The skilled person in the field is familiar with how to determine the
   appropriate dosage for each individual pharmaceutically active ingredient.
           With reference to formoterol, the preferred dosage is about 0.5 to 50 pg per
 5 actuation, preferably about 1 to 25 pg per actuation, and more preferably about 5 to
   15 ptg per actuation. In specific embodiments, the dose of formoterol fumarate is 6
   or 12 pg/actuation.
           With reference to glycopyrronium bromide, the preferred dosage is about 0.5
   100 pg per actuation, preferably about 1-40 pg per actuation, and more preferably
10 about    5-26   pg per actuation.      In one    specific embodiment,     the dose    of
   glycopyrronium bromide is about 25pg/actuation.
           With reference to the optional component beclometasone dipropionate, the
   preferred dosage is about 10 to 2000 pg per actuation, preferably about 20 to 1000
   pg per actuation, and more preferably about 50-250 pg per actuation. In specific
15 embodiments, the dose of beclometasone dipropionate is about 50, 100, 200
   pg/actuation.
           The pharmaceutical formulation of the invention is filled into pMDI devices
   known in the art. Said devices comprise a canister fitted with a metering valve.
   Actuation of the metering valve allows a small portion of the spray product to be
20 released.
           Part or all of the canister may be made of a metal, for example aluminium,
   aluminium alloy, stainless steel or anodized aluminium. Alternatively, the canister
   may be a plastic can or a plastic-coated glass bottle.
           The metal canisters may have part or all of their internal surfaces lined with
25 an     inert    organic     coating.    Examples      of   preferred     coatings    are
   epoxy-phenol resins, perfluorinated polymers          such as perfluoroalkoxyalkane,
   perfluoroalkoxyalkylene,      perfluoroalkylenes    such  as   poly-tetrafluoroethylene

                                              10
   (Teflon),   fluorinated-ethylene-propylene    (FEP),   polyether  sulfone   (PES)   or
   fluorinated-ethylene-propylene     polyether    sulfone    (FEP-PES)     mixtures   or
   combination thereof. Other suitable coatings could be polyamide, polyimide,
   polyamideimide, polyphenylene sulfide or their combinations.
 5        In certain embodiments canisters having their internal surface lined with FEP
   PES or Teflon may be used.
          In other particular embodiments canisters made of stainless steel may be used.
          The container is closed with a metering valve for delivering a daily
   therapeutically effective dose of the active ingredient. Generally the metering valve
10 assembly comprises a ferrule having an aperture formed therein, a body moulding
   attached to the ferrule which houses the metering chamber, a stem consisting of a
   core and a core extension, an inner- and an outer- seal around the metering chamber,
   a spring around the core, and a gasket to prevent leakage of propellant through the
   valve.
15        The gasket seal and the seals around the metering valve may comprise
   elastomeric material such as EPDM, chlorobutyl rubber, bromobutyl rubber, butyl
   rubber, or neoprene. EPDM rubbers are particularly preferred. The metering
   chamber, core and core extension are manufactured using suitable materials such as
   stainless steel, polyesters (e.g. polybutyleneterephthalate (PBT)), or acetals. The
20 spring is manufactured in stainless steel eventually including titanium. The ferrule
   may be made of a metal, for example aluminium, aluminium alloy, stainless steel or
   anodized aluminium. Suitable valves are available from manufacturers such as
   Valois, Bespak plc and 3M-Neotechnic Ltd.
          The pMDI is actuated by a metering valve capable of delivering a volume of
25 between 25-100 pl, preferably between 40-70 pl, and optionally about 50 pl, or
   about 63 pl per actuation.
          Each filled canister is conveniently fitted into a suitable channelling device

                                              11
   prior to use to form a metered dose inhaler for administration of the medicament into
   the lungs of a patient. Suitable channelling devices comprise, for example a valve
   actuator and a cylindrical or cone-like passage through which medicament may be
   delivered from the filled canister via the metering valve to the mouth of a patient
 5 e.g. a mouthpiece actuator.
           In a typical arrangement the valve stem is seated in a nozzle block which has
   an orifice leading to an expansion chamber. The expansion chamber has an exit
   orifice which extends into the mouthpiece. Actuator (exit) orifices having a diameter
   in    the     range    0.15   -    0.45  mm     and    a   length    from    0.30   to
10 1.7 mm are generally suitable. Preferably, an orifice having a diameter from 0.2 to
   0.44 mm is used, e.g. 0.22, 0.25, 0.30, 0.33 or 0.42 mm.
           In certain embodiments of the invention, it may be useful to utilize actuator
   orifices having a diameter ranging from 0.10 to 0.22 mm, in particular from 0.12 to
   0.18 mm, such as those described in WO 03/053501. The use of said fine orifices
15 may also increase the duration of the cloud generation and hence, may facilitate the
   coordination of the cloud generation with the slow inspiration of the patient.
           In case the ingress of water into the formulation is to be avoided, it may be
   desired to overwrap the MDI product in a flexible package capable of resisting water
   ingress. It may also be desirable to incorporate a material within the packaging
20 which is able to adsorb any propellant and co-solvent which may leak from the
   canister (e.g. a molecular sieve).
           Optionally the MDI device filled with the formulation of the invention may be
   utilized together with suitable auxiliary devices favouring the correct use of the
   inhaler. Said auxiliary devices are commercially available and, depending on their
25 shape and size, are known as "spacers", "reservoirs" or "expansion chambers".
   VolumaticTM is, for instance, one of the most widely known and used reservoirs,
   while AerochamberTM is one of the most widely used and known spacers. A suitable

                                                 12
   expansion chamber is reported for example in WO 01/49350.
          The formulation of the invention may also be used with common pressurized
   breath-activated inhalers, such as those known with the registered names of Easi
   BreatheTM and AutohalerTM.
 5        The efficacy of an MDI device is a function of the dose deposited at the
   appropriate site in the lungs. Deposition is affected by the aerodynamic particle size
   distribution of the formulation which may be characterised in vitro through several
   parameters.
          The aerodynamic particle size distribution of the formulation of the invention
10 may be characterized using a Cascade Impactor according to the procedure described
   in the European Pharmacopoeia      6 th edition, 2009 (6.5), part 2.09.18. An Apparatus
   E,     operating      at    a     flow       rate    range     of     30     1/min   to
   100 1/min or an Apparatus D -Andersen Cascade Impactor (ACI)-, operating at a
   flow rate of 28.3 1/min. Deposition of the drug on each ACI plate is determined by
15 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
          The following parameters of the particles emitted by a pressurized MDI may
   be determined:
           i)   mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) is the diameter around
                which the mass aerodynamic diameters of the emitted particles are
20              distributed equally;
           ii)  delivered dose is calculated from the cumulative deposition in the ACI,
                divided by the number of actuations per experiment;
           iii) respirable dose (fine particle dose       =   FPD) is obtained from the
                deposition from Stages 3 (S3) to filter (AF) of the ACI, corresponding
25              to particles of diameter < 4.7 microns, divided by the number of
                actuations per experiment;
           iv)  respirable fraction (fine particle fraction=FPF) which is the percent

                                               13
                 ratio between the respirable dose and the delivered dose.
           v)    "superfine" dose is obtained from the deposition from Stages 6 (S6) to
                 filter, corresponding to particles of diameter    1.1 microns, divided by
                 the number of actuations per experiment;
 5         The solutions of the invention are capable of providing, upon actuation of the
   pMDI device in which they are contained, a total FPF higher than 40%, preferably
   higher than 50%, more preferably higher than 60%.
          Moreover the formulations of the invention are capable of providing, upon
   actuation, a fraction higher than or equal to 30% of emitted particles of diameter
10 equal    to  or    less  than    1.1  microns   as  defined   by   the  content   stages
   S6-AF of an Andersen Cascade Impactor, relative to the total fine particle dose
   collected in the stages S3-AF of the impactor. Preferably the fraction of emitted
   particles of diameter equal to or less than 1.1 microns is higher than or equal to
   40%, more preferably higher than 50%, even more preferably higher than 60%, most
15 preferably higher than 70%.
          According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of
   filling an aerosol inhaler with a composition of the invention. Conventional bulk
   manufacturing methods and machinery well known in the art of pharmaceutical
   aerosol manufacture may be employed for the preparation of large-scale batches for
20 the commercial production of filled canisters.
          A first method comprises:
           a)  preparing a solution of glycopyrronium bromide and formoterol fumarate
               and       optionally     beclometasone      dipropionate     in     optional
               co-solvent (e.g. ethanol), mineral acid, propellant comprising a HFA and
25             optionally a low volatility component at a temperature from -50 to -60 0C
               at which the formulation does not vaporize;
           b)  cold-filling the inhaler with the prepared solution; and

                                                14
            c)  placing the valve onto the empty can and crimping.
           An alternative method comprises:
            a)  preparing a solution of glycopyrronium bromide and formoterol fumarate
                and optionally beclometasone dipropionate in a co-solvent (e.g. ethanol),
 5              mineral acid, and optionally a low volatility component;
            b)  filling the open can with the bulk solution;
            c)  placing the valve onto the can and crimping; and
            d)  pressure-filling the can with the HFA propellant through the valve
           A further alternative method comprises:
10          a)  preparing a solution of glycopyrronium bromide, formoterol fumarate
                (and optionally beclometasone dipropionate) and mineral acid in optional
                co-solvent (e.g. ethanol), optional low volatility component and HFA
                propellant using a pressurised vessel:
            b)  placing the valve onto the empty can and crimping; and
15          c)  pressure-filling the can with the final solution formulation through the
                valve
           In one embodiment of the invention, oxygen is substantially removed from the
   headspace of the aerosol canister using conventional techniques in order to further
   stabilize the formoterol component, especially at higher acid concentrations. This
20 can be achieved in different ways depending on the method of filling the container.
   Purging can be achieved by vacuum crimping or by using propellant, for instance. In
   a preferred embodiment the second filling method described above is modified to
   incorporate an oxygen purge into step (c) by vacuum crimping.
           The packaged formulations of the invention are stable for extended periods of
25 time when stored under normal conditions of temperature and humidity. In a
   preferred embodiment the packaged formulations are stable for at least 6 months at
   25'C and 60% RH, more preferably for at least 1 year, most preferably for at least 2

                                               15
   years. Stability is assessed by measuring content of residual active ingredient. A
   "stable" formulation as defined herein means one retaining at least about 85%,
   preferably at least about 90%, and most preferably at least about 95% of residual
   content of each active ingredient at a given time point, as measured by HPLC-UV
 5 VIS.
          The optimized stable formulations meet the specifications required by the
   ICH Guideline QIB or CPMP/QWP/122/02 Rev.1 relevant for drug product stability
   testing for the purposes of drug registration.
          The combination product compositions of the invention may be used for
10 prophylactic purposes or therapeutic purposes or for symptomatic relief of a wide
   range of conditions, and in one aspect the invention therefore relates to use of any of
   these these pharmaceutical      compositions as a medicament.       In particular, the
   combination products of the invention are useful in the prevention or treatment of
   many respiratory disorders, such as asthma of all types and chronic obstructive
15 pulmonary disease (COPD).
          Thus, in another aspect the invention relates to a method of preventing or
   treating a respiratory disease, such as COPD, comprising administering to a patient
   in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical
   composition according to the invention.
20        The invention also provides the use of the pharmaceutical compositions of the
   invention for the therapeutic or palliative treatment or prevention of respiratory
   diseases and their symptoms.
          Respiratory disorders for which use of the pharmaceutical compositions of the
   invention may also be beneficial are those characterized by obstruction of the
25 peripheral airways as a result of inflammation and presence of mucus, such as
   chronic obstructive bronchiolitis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, acute lung injury
   (ALI), cystic fibrosis, rhinitis, and adult or acute respiratory distress syndrome

                                                16
   (ARDS).
           EXAMPLES
           Example 1
           A) Stability of single, double and triple combination aerosol solution
 5 formulations
           A study was performed to investigate the stability of a triple combination of
   formoterol fumarate (FF), glycopyrronium bromide (GLY) and beclometasone
   dipropionate (BDP) in an aerosol solution formulation, in canister packaging under
   varied storage conditions:
10         In addition to the triple combination, the double combinations (FF + BDP; FF
   + GLY) and the single agent (GLY) were included in the study to evaluate whether
   any potential interactions between the active ingredients could affect drug stability.
   GLY as single agent was formulated with and without IM HCl to evaluate the
   stabilizing effect of the acid.

10          Regarding the triple combination, BDP and GLY can contents were not
   significantly affected by time and temperature. In contrast, formoterol fumarate can
   content was highly dependent on storage conditions: the % residue with respect to
   time zero decreases with time and temperature. After 3 months at +30'C/75% RH
   the % residue had reached 92.5%; after 3 months at +40'C/75% RH it had decreased
15 to 88.6%.
            With regard to the double combination of FF + GLY, see Table 3:

           The GLY component remained stable under all of the tested conditions. As in
   the triple combination, the formoterol fumarate can content was strongly dependent
   on time and temperature: after 3 months at +30'C/75% RH it had dropped to 91.5%;
   after 3 months at +40'C/75 % RH it had decreased to 88.1 %.
 5         In contrast, the formoterol content in the FF + BDP double combination did
   not decrease rapidly over time under any of the different storage conditions. These
   contrasting observations lead to the conclusion that the presence of GLY in
   combination with formoterol fumarate has the effect of destabilizing the formoterol
   fumarate.
10         The single agent formulation containing GLY was found to maintain a
   constant content in the presence of IM HCl, but to be highly dependent on time and
   temperature of storage if the acid was omitted.
           B) Analysis of impurities/degradation products
           All of the formulations preserved at 40'C/75% RH were tested by a standard
15 HPLC/UV VIS method for non-chiral impurities and degradation products of the
   active components. An MS detector was used to confirm the molecular weights of
   the detected impurities/degradation products found in the FF+ BDP and FF + GLY +
   BDP cans.
           Results:
20         Analyzed by the HPLC/UV method, those formulations comprising both FF
   and GLY had high levels of degradation products related to formoterol fumarate. It
   was also observed that the amount of each degradation product increased with
   temperature.
           Three major degradation products were identified: DPI, DP2 and an unknown

                                                19
   degradation product (termed DP3). Two of these degradation products (DPI, DP2)
   had previously been found to be present in Foster®-like formulations containing
   only low levels of acid.
          C) Titration of acid content
 5        Since the stability and impurity test results pointed to the importance of acid
   in  the   formulations    to  stabilize  formoterol  fumarate    in  the presence    of
   glycopyrronium bromide, a series of triple combination formulations was prepared
   with added IM HCl varying between 0.191 pg/pl and 0.254 pg/pl. In each test pair
   of samples, one can had its oxygen removed by vacuum crimping in order to
10 investigate the impact of oxygen on the degradation process.
          After 3 months at 25'C/60% RH the samples were analyzed for residual can
   content of active ingredients and major impurities/degradation products. The GLY
   and BDP components were stable over the 3 months period and experienced little
   degradation. The results for the formoterol fumarate component are shown in Table
15 4.

          Comparing those samples from which oxygen had been removed, a consistent

                                                20
   reduction in the % of FF degradation products is observed as the acid content is
   raised from 0.191 pg/pl through to 0.222 and 0.234 pg/pl. The total and individual
   % degradation products at these acid values are far less than 1% in each case and
   therefore well below the identification/qualification levels for drug registration.
 5         These results also suggest that in the absence of oxygen purging an acid
   concentration in excess of about 0.22 pg/pl is actually counterproductive in
   stabilizing FF.
           In summary, based on current results a double or triple combination product
   comprising     glycopyrronium bromide       and formoterol    fumarate (and    optionally
10 beclometasone      dipropionate)   could   be   optimally  stabilized   for clinical and
   commercial purposes by inclusion of IM HCl in an amount of between 0.191 and
   0.234 pg/pl, preferably between 0.19 and 0.23 pg/pl in a solution formulation that
   has been purged of oxygen.
           Example 2
15         Stability of the triple combination aerosol solution formulations
           A study was performed to investigate the stability of a triple combination of
   formoterol fumarate (FF), glycopyrronium bromide (GLY)                and beclometasone
   dipropionate (BDP) in an aerosol solution formulation with different levels of IM
   HCl to evaluate the stabilizing effect of the acid, in conventional aluminium
20 canisters, provided with standard EPDM valves crimped under varied conditions
   (i.e. with or without oxygen removal by vacuum crimping).

          The experiment showed that concentrations of IM HCl higher than 0.230
 5 increase the formation of degradation products and in particular of DP3 in normal
   crimped    formulations.   Vacuum     crimping permits     to avoid     formation of the
   degradation products, and in particular DP3, up to IM HCl concentration of 0.243.
          In summary, the current results confirm that a triple combination product
   comprising     glycopyrronium      bromide,     formoterol    fumarate     and    optionally
10 beclometasone     dipropionate   could    be    optimally  stabilized    for   clinical and
