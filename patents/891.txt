         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates to a method for preparing a pharmaceutical
 5 intermediate which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates
   to procaine hydrochloride intermediates p-nitrobenzoic acid synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         P-nitrobenzoic acid is a kind of synthesis intermediates about pharmaceutical,
10 dyes, veterinary drugs, photographic materials. It is used for the production of
   procaine hydrochloride, procainamide hydrochloride, p-aminomethyl benzoic acid,
   folic acid, benzocaine, cephalosporin V, p-aminobenzoylglutamic acid, benier, as well
   as the production of reactive brilliant red M-8B, active red violet X-2R and filter,
   couplers color film, the metal surface rust agents, sunscreens and so on. Prussacaine
15 hydrochloride acts on the peripheral nerve to produce conduction block, it diffuses
   through the nerve cell membrane relying on the concentration gradient, blocking the
   sodium channel in the medial, increases the neuronal excitation threshold, loss of
   excitability and conductivity, the information transmission is blocked, it has good
   local anesthetic effects. As pharmaceutical intermediates of procaine hydrochloride,
20 the synthesis method of p-nitrobenzoic acid is of great significance. However, most of
   the existing synthetic methods are using the method that oxidated by p-nitrotoluene,
   oxidants can be used sodium dichromate, air, manganese ore powder, nitric acid.
   P-nitrotoluene reacted with sodium dichromate oxidation at 55       0C  in the presence of
   sulfuric acid, which produces p-nitrobenzoic acid. This method of production requires
25 extensive use of sodium dichromate, manganese ore powder, nitric acid, sulfuric acid,
   etc. as the reaction and the formation of raw materials, due to sodium dichromate,
   manganese powder resulting in environmental pollution, nitric acid, sulfuric acid
   attributes to high-risk chemicals, the process is of low safety factor, and it is
   complicated and the final yield is not very high. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a
30 new synthetic method.
