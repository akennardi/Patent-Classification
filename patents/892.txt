   1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5      The present invention relates to the technical field of food, and more
   particularly to a three-dimensional (3D) ice cream stick.
   2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART
         Foods, such as an ice cream bar and an ice cream, are popular with
   a lot of consumers and more particularly with children. At present, an ice
10 cream stick is typically disposed at a center position of a bottom end of a
   market-available ice cream, so that the consumer can hold the ice cream
   stick. Such the ice cream stick is typically made of a wood material to
   form a strip-like shape, has the simple structure but lacks of creativity,
   and is not attractive. In addition, after the ice cream is completely eaten,
15 the ice cream stick is thrown away because it has no value for collection
   and preservation, and a lot of wood resources need to be consumed for
   the ice cream sticks. The resource is wasted in our country wherein the
   forest resource is originally not rich. In addition, when the conventional
   ice cream is being eaten, the ice cream tends to detach from the ice
20 cream stick, thereby wasting the food.
