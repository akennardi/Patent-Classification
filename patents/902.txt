FITTING FOR JOINING PIPE ELEMENTS
Cross Reference to Related Application
[0001] The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application
No. <removed-apn>, which is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application
No. 2013215631, which claims priority from U.S. Patent Application No. 13/364,412, filed
2 February 2012, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
Field of Invention
[0002] This invention relates to fittings, such as elbow fittings and "tee" fittings used to join
pipe elements together.
Background
[0003] Fittings, such as elbows and tees, for joining pipe elements together end-to-end,
comprise interconnectable housing portions that are positionable circumferentially surrounding
the end portions of pipe elements. The term "pipe element" is used herein to describe any pipe
like item or component having a pipe-like form. Pipe elements include pipe stock as well as
fluid control components such as valves, strainers, restrictors, pressure regulators and the like.
[0004] Each housing portion has projections, also called "keys", which extend radially inwardly
and engage, for example, the outer surfaces of plain end pipe elements, pipe elements having a
shoulder, or shoulder and bead, or circumferential grooves that extend around each of the pipe
elements to be joined. Engagement between the keys and the pipe elements provides mechanical
restraint to the joint and ensures that the pipe elements remain coupled even under high internal
pressure thrust and external forces. The housing portions define an annular channel or pocket,
for example, a receptacle, that receives a seal, for example a ring gasket, typically an
elastomeric ring which engages the ends of each pipe element and cooperates with the housing
portions and the pipe elements to provide a fluid tight seal. A tube within the fitting extends
between the ring gaskets to ensure that the entire fitting remains fluid tight. The housing
portions have connection members, typically in the form of lugs which project outwardly from
the housings. The lugs are adapted to receive adjustable fasteners, such as nuts and bolts, which
are adjustably tightenable to draw the housing portions toward one another.

                                                   2
[0005] Methods of securing pipe elements together comprise a sequential installation process
when fittings according to the prior art are used. Typically, the fitting is received by the
technician with the housing portions bolted together, the ring gaskets and tube comprising the
sealing element being captured between the housing portions of the fittings. The technician first
disassembles the fitting by unbolting it, removes the ring gaskets, lubricates them (if not pre
lubricated) and places them around the ends of the pipe elements to be joined. Installation of the
ring gaskets often requires that they be lubricated and stretched to accommodate the pipe
elements. With the ring gaskets in place on the pipe elements, the tube is engaged with the ring
gasket on each pipe element. The housing portions are then placed one at a time around the ring
gaskets and tube, straddling the ends of the pipe elements. During placement, the housing
portions engage the ring gaskets, the keys are aligned with the grooves in the pipe elements
(when present), the bolts are inserted through the lugs, the nuts are threaded onto the bolts and
tightened, drawing the housing portions toward one another, compressing the ring gaskets to
effect a seal between the pipe elements and the tube. The keys are engaged within the grooves in
the pipe elements to provide mechanical constraint.
[0006] As evident from the previous description, installation of fittings according to the prior art
requires that the technician typically handle as many as 13 individual piece parts, and must
totally disassemble and reassemble the fitting. Significant time, effort and expense would be
saved if the technician could install a fitting without first totally disassembling it and then
reassembling it, piece by piece.
Object of the Invention
[0007] It is an object of the present invention to overcome or at least ameliorate one or more of
the foregoing disadvantages.
Summary
[0008] The present invention provides a fitting for connecting at least two pipe elements
together, said fitting comprising:
        first and second housing portions attached to one another and defining at least first and
second receptacles wherein said first receptacle is not coaxially aligned with said second
receptacle, said first and second receptacles respectively defining first and second openings for

                                                     3
receiving said pipe elements, said housing portions further defining a fluid path extending
between said first and second receptacles;
         a plurality of adjustable fasteners attaching said first and second housing portions to
one another, said fasteners being adjustably tightenable so as to draw said housing portions
toward one another and bring said receptacles into engagement with said pipe elements so as
to affix said pipe elements together;
         a first seal positioned within said first receptacle and surrounding said first opening;
         a second seal positioned within said second receptacle and surrounding said second
opening; and
         a tube extending within said fitting between said first and second seals;
         wherein said first and second housing portions are supported in spaced relation
sufficient to permit said pipe elements to be inserted into said receptacles while said housing
portions are attached to one another, said housing portions being supported by contact with
said first and second seals.
[0009] There is also disclosed herein a fitting for connecting at least two pipe elements together.
In one example embodiment, the fitting comprises first and second housing portions attached to
one another and defining at least first and second receptacles wherein the first receptacle is not
coaxially aligned with the second receptacle. The first and second receptacles respectively
define first and second openings for receiving the pipe elements. The housing portions further
define a fluid path extending between the first and second receptacles. A plurality of adjustable
fasteners attach the first and second housing portions to one another. The housing portions are
supported in spaced apart relation sufficient to permit the pipe elements to be inserted into the
receptacles while the housing portions are attached to one another. The fasteners are adjustably
tightenable so as to draw the housing portions toward one another and bring the receptacles into
engagement with the pipe elements so as to affix the pipe elements together.
[0010] According to an embodiment, the first receptacle is not coaxially aligned with the second
receptacle. In one such example embodiment, the first receptacle surrounds a first axis oriented
coaxially with the first opening and the second receptacle surrounds a second axis oriented
coaxially with the second opening, the first and second axes being angularly oriented with
respect to one another. The first and second axes may have an orientation angle from about 90'
to about 1740 with respect to one another.

                                                   4
[0011] In another embodiment, the first and second housing portions may further define a third
receptacle. In this embodiment the third receptacle defines a third opening for receiving one of
the pipe elements. The housing portions further define the fluid path to extend between the first,
second and third receptacles. In an example embodiment of a fitting having a third receptacle,
the first receptacle may surround a first axis oriented coaxially with the first opening, the second
receptacle may surround a second axis oriented coaxially with the second opening, and the third
receptacle may surround a third axis oriented coaxially with the third opening. The first and
third axes may be co-linear with one another, the second axis may be angularly oriented with
respect to the first and third axes. The first and second axes may have an orientation angle from
about 300 to about 150' with respect to one another.
[0012] An example fitting embodiment may further comprise at least a first angularly oriented
surface located on the first housing portion, and at least a second angularly oriented surface
located on the second housing portion. The first and second angularly oriented surfaces are in
facing relation and slide over one another when the fasteners are tightened to bring the first and
second angularly oriented surfaces in contact. Sliding motion between the first and second
angularly oriented surfaces causes the first and second housing portions to rotate in opposite
directions relatively to one another.
[0013] An example fitting may further comprise a plurality of lugs extending from each of the
first and second housing portions. Each of the lugs define a hole for receiving one of the
fasteners. In this example embodiment the first angularly oriented surface portion is located on
one of the lugs on the first housing portion, and the second angularly oriented surface portion is
located on one of the lugs on the second housing portion.
[0014] In another example embodiment, the fitting may comprise a plurality of lugs extending
from each of the first and second housing portions. Each of the lugs defines a hole for receiving
one of the fasteners. At least two of the lugs on the first housing portion each have a first
angularly oriented surface. At least two of the lugs on the second housing portion each have a
second angularly oriented surface. Each of the first angularly oriented surfaces are in facing
relation with a respective one of the second angularly oriented surfaces. The first and second
angularly oriented surfaces slide over one another when the fasteners are tightened to bring the
first and second angularly oriented surfaces in contact. Sliding motion between the first and

                                                  5
second angularly oriented surfaces cause the first and second housing portions to rotate in
opposite directions relatively to one another.
[0015] The fitting may further comprise a first seal positioned within the first receptacle. The
first seal surrounds the first opening. A second seal is positioned within the second receptacle
and surrounds the second opening. A tube extends within the fitting between the first and second
seals. The tube may be integrally formed with the first and second seals, or the seals may
sealingly engage the tube when they are compressed between the first and second housing
portions.
[0016] An example fitting embodiment has a first seal positioned within the first receptacle and
surrounding the first opening. A second seal is positioned within the second receptacle and
surrounds the second opening. A third seal is positioned within the third receptacle and
surrounds the third opening. A tube extends within the fitting between the first, second and third
seals.
[0017] The tube may be integrally formed with the first, second and third seals. In an alternate
embodiment, the seals sealingly engage the tube when the seals are compressed between the first
and second housing portions. The first and second housing portions may be supported in the
spaced relation by contact with the first and second seals. To that end, the first and second seals
may have an outer circumference sized to support the housing portions in spaced apart relation
sufficient to permit the pipe elements to be inserted into the receptacles. In an alternate
embodiment, the first and second seals may each have at least one projection extending radially
outwardly therefrom. The at least one projection on each of the seals engages one of the first and
second housing portions and thereby supports the housing portions in spaced apart relation
sufficient to permit the pipe elements to be inserted into the receptacles.
[0018] In a particular example embodiment, the at least one projection on each of the first and
second seals comprises an arch extending outwardly from each of the first and second seals. At
least one of the receptacles may comprise a recess positioned on an inner surface thereof for
receiving the at least one projection extending from one of the first and second seals.
[0019] In another embodiment, the first and second housing portions may be supported in the
spaced relation by contact with the first, second and third seals. The first, second and third seals

                                                   6
may have an outer circumference sized to support the housing portions in the spaced apart
relation sufficient to permit the pipe elements to be inserted into the receptacles.
[0020] In an example embodiment, the first, second and third seals each have at least one
projection extending radially outwardly therefrom. The at least one projection on each of the
seals engages one of the first and second housing portions and thereby supports the housing
portions in the spaced apart relation sufficient to permit the pipe elements to be inserted into the
receptacles. The at least one projection on each of the first and second seals may comprise an
arch extending outwardly from each of the first, second and third seals. At least one of the
receptacles may comprise a recess positioned on an inner surface thereof for receiving the at
least one projection extending from one of the first, second and third seals.
[0021] There is also disclosed herein a fitting for connecting at least two pipe elements together,
the fitting comprises first and second housing portions attached to one another and defining at
least first and second receptacles, wherein the first receptacle is not coaxially aligned with the
second receptacle. The first and second receptacles respectively define first and second openings
for receiving the pipe elements. The housing portions further define a fluid path extending
between the first and second receptacles.
[0022] A plurality of adjustable fasteners attach the first and second housing portions to one
another. The fasteners are adjustably tightenable so as to draw the housing portions toward one
another and bring the receptacles into engagement with the pipe elements so as to affix the pipe
elements together. At least a first angularly oriented surface is located on the first housing
portion, and at least a second angularly oriented surface is located on the second housing
portion. The first and second angularly oriented surfaces are in facing relation and slide over one
another when the fasteners are tightened to bring the first and second angularly oriented surfaces
in contact. Sliding motion between the first and second angularly oriented surfaces cause the
first and second housing portions to rotate in opposite directions relatively to one another.
[0023] In a particular example embodiment, the first receptacle is not coaxially aligned with the
second receptacle. The first receptacle may surround a first axis oriented coaxially with the first
opening, and the second receptacle may surround a second axis oriented coaxially with the
second opening. The first and second axes are angularly oriented with respect to one another.

                                                   7
The first and second axes may have an orientation angle from about 90' to about 1740 with
respect to one another.
[0024] In another example embodiment, the first and second housing portions may further
define a third receptacle. The third receptacle defines a third opening for receiving one of the
pipe elements. The housing portions further define the fluid path to extend between the first,
second and third receptacles. In a particular example embodiment, the first receptacle surrounds
a first axis oriented coaxially with the first opening, the second receptacle surrounds a second
axis oriented coaxially with the second opening, and the third receptacle surrounds a third axis
oriented coaxially with the third opening. The first and third axes are co-linear with one another,
the second axis is angularly oriented with respect to the first and second axes. In this example
embodiment the first and second axes may have an orientation angle from about 30' to about
150' with respect to one another.
[0025] In an example fitting embodiment, at least a second one of the lugs on the first housing
portion may have a first angularly oriented surface, and at least a second one of the lugs on the
second housing portion may have a second angularly oriented surface. Wherein, for the second
ones of the lugs on the first and second housing portions, the first angularly oriented surface is
in facing relation with the second angularly oriented surface, the first and second angularly
oriented surfaces slide over one another when the fasteners are tightened to bring the first and
second angularly oriented surfaces in contact. Sliding motion between the first and second
angularly oriented surfaces causes the first and second housing portions to rotate in opposite
directions relatively to one another.
[0026] The example fitting may further comprise a plurality of lugs extending from each of the
first and second housing portions. Each of the lugs define a hole for receiving one of said
fasteners. The first angularly oriented surface is located on one of the lugs on the first housing
portion, and the second angularly oriented surface is located on one of said lugs on the second
housing portion.
[0027] In an example fitting a first seal may be positioned within the first receptacle and
surrounding the first opening, and a second seal may be positioned within the second receptacle
and surrounding the second opening. A tube may extend within the fitting between the first and
second seals. In one example embodiment, the tube is integrally formed with the first and

                                                   8
second seals. In another example embodiment, the seals sealingly engage the tube when the
seals are compressed between the first and second housing portions.
[0028] Another example fitting embodiment further comprises a first seal positioned within the
first receptacle and surrounding the first opening, a second seal positioned within the second
receptacle and surrounding the second opening, and a third seal positioned within the third
receptacle and surrounding the third opening. A tube extends within the fitting between the first,
second and third seals. In this embodiment the tube may be integrally formed with the first,
second and third seals. Alternately, the seals may sealingly engage the tube when the seals are
compressed between the first and second housing portions.
[0029] In an example fitting embodiment, the first and second housing portions may be
supported in spaced relation sufficient to permit the pipe elements to be inserted into the
receptacles while the housing portions are attached to one another, the housing portions being
supported by contact with the first and second seals. In this embodiment, the first and second
seals may have an outer circumference sized to support the housing portions in the spaced apart
relation sufficient to permit the pipe elements to be inserted into the receptacles. Alternately, the
first and second seals may each have at least one projection extending radially outwardly
therefrom. The at least one projection on each of the seals engages one of the first and second
housing portions and thereby supports the housing portions in the spaced apart relation
sufficient to permit the pipe elements to be inserted into the receptacles. The at least one
projection on each of the first and second seals may comprise an arch extending outwardly from
each of the first and second seals. In this example, at least one of the receptacles may comprise a
recess positioned on an inner surface thereof for receiving the at least one projection extending
from one of the first and second seals.
[0030] In another example fitting, the first and second housing portions are supported in spaced
relation sufficient to permit the pipe elements to be inserted into the receptacles while the
housing portions are attached to one another, the housing portions being supported by contact
with the first, second and third seals. In this example embodiment, the first, second and third
seals may have an outer circumference sized to support the housing portions in the spaced apart
relation sufficient to permit the pipe elements to be inserted into the receptacles. Alternately, the
first, second and third seals may each have at least one projection extending radially outwardly
therefrom. The at least one projection on each of the seals engages one of the first and second

                                                    9
housing portions and thereby supports the housing portions in the spaced apart relation
sufficient to permit the pipe elements to be inserted into the receptacles. The at least one
projection on each of the first and second seals may comprise an arch extending outwardly from
each of the first, second and third seals. In this example, at least one of the receptacles may
comprise a recess positioned on an inner surface thereof for receiving the at least one projection
extending from one of the first, second and third seals.

Detailed Description
[0043] Figure 1 shows an exploded view of an example fitting 10 according to the invention.
Fitting 10 comprises first and second housing portions 12 and 14. When attached to one another,
as shown in Figure 2, the housing portions 12 and 14 define at least a first receptacle 16 and a
second receptacle 18 located at opposite ends of the fitting to one another. Receptacles 16 and
18 define respective first and second openings 20 and 22 for receiving respective pipe elements
24 and 26, shown in phantom line. Housing portions 12 and 14 together also define a fluid path
extending between the first and second receptacles 16 and 18, the fluid path being depicted by
the arrow 28 shown in Figure 1 for clarity.
[0044] A plurality of lugs 30 extend from each housing portion 12 and 14. In the example fitting
of Figure 1 each housing portion has three lugs. Lugs 30 define holes 32. When the housing
portions 12 and 14 are assembled in facing relation as shown in Figure 2, the holes 32 in lugs 30
align to receive fasteners 34 which attach the housing portions to one another to form the fitting
10. Fasteners 34 are adjustably tightenable so as to draw the first and second housing portions
12 and 14 toward one another and bring the first and second receptacles 16 and 18 into
engagement with the pipe elements 24 and 26 (respectively) so as to affix the pipe elements
together as shown in Figure 3.
[0045] In the example fitting embodiment 10, the first receptacle 16 is not coaxially aligned
with the second receptacle 18. As shown in Figure 3, the first receptacle 16 surrounds a first axis
36 oriented coaxially with the first opening 20 and the second receptacle 18 surrounds a second
axis 38 oriented coaxially with the second opening 22. Axes 36 and 38 may be used to define
the angular orientation of the receptacles 16 and 18 relatively to one another and thereby define
the type of fitting. In fitting 10, the orientation angle 40 between axes 36 and 38 is about 900,

                                                  11
marking this fitting as a 90 degree elbow. For practical elbow designs the orientation angle 40
may range from about 900 to about 174' as shown in phantom line.
[0046] To establish and maintain fluid tightness of a joint between pipe elements formed by the
fitting 10, a sealing element 42 is positioned between the housing portions 12 and 14. As shown
in Figure 1, sealing element 42 comprises a first seal44 positioned within the first receptacle 16,
a second seal 46, positioned within the second receptacle 18, and a tube 48 extending within the
fitting 10 along the fluid path 28 between the first and second seals 44 and 46. In this example,
the first and second seals 44 and 46 are integrally formed with the tube 48 in one piece. Sealing
element 42 may be formed from elastomeric materials such as EPDM, as well as nitrile,
silicone, neoprene and fluoropolymer elastomers.
[0047] Figure 2 shows the fitting 10 in the "installation ready" state, i.e., partially assembled
with the first and second housing portions 12 and 14 held in spaced apart relation sufficient to
permit the pipe elements 24 and 26 to be conveniently inserted into the respective openings 20
and 22 without disassembling the fitting 10. To effect a fluid tight joint, pipe elements 24 and 26
are inserted into opening 20 and 22 where they respectively engage the first and second seals 44
and 46. Fasteners 34 are then tightened, drawing the housing portions 12 and 14 together (as
shown in Figure 3) and compressing the first and second seals between the housing portions and
the pipe elements 24 and 26 while also engaging the receptacles 16 and 18 with their respective
pipe elements 24 and 26 to mechanically capture and retain the pipe elements. In this example,
positive mechanical engagement between the fitting 10 and the pipe elements 24 and 26 is
effected by radially projecting arcuate keys 50 positioned on each housing portion 12 and 14.
Keys 50 may have notches 52 at opposite ends to provide clearance and facilitate pipe element
insertion. Upon assembly of the fitting 10, the keys surround the openings 20 and 22 and engage
circumferential grooves 54 in the pipe elements 24 and 26 (see Figure 2). Fittings according to
the invention are of course not limited to use with grooved pipe elements, but may also be
adapted to plain end pipe elements, flared pipe elements as well as shoulder and shoulder and
bead pipe elements.
[0048] Housing portions 12 and 14 may be conveniently supported in spaced relation by contact
with the first and second seals 44 and 46. In the example fitting 10 shown in Figures 1 through
3, the first and second seals 44 and 46 each have projections 56 (see Figure 1) which extend
radially outward to engage a housing portion. In this example the projections take the form of an

                                                    12
arch 58 which has sufficient stiffness to support the housing portions, yet will collapse when
compressed between the housing portions as the fasteners are tightened to permit the seals 44
and 46 to be compressed and the keys 50 to engage the grooves 54 in the pipe elements 24 and
26. Housing portions 12 and 14 may also have recesses 60 positioned on the inner surfaces of
the receptacles 16 and 18. The recesses 60 receive the projections 56 and provide space for their
deformation when they are compressed by the housing portions 12 and 14.
[0049] Figures 4 through 6 illustrate another example embodiment of a fitting 62 according to
the invention. Similar to fitting 10, fitting 62 is comprised of housing portions 12 and 14 which
are attached to one another by adjustable fasteners 34 and define first and second receptacles 16
and 18. The receptacles define openings 20 and 22 for receiving pipe elements 24 and 26 as
shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 4, the sealing element 42 of fitting 62 is formed of three
separate components and comprises first and second seals 64 and 66 and a tube 68. Seals 64 and
66 are respectively positioned within the first and second receptacles 16 and 18 defined by the
housing portions and tube 68 extends within the fitting 62 between the seals 64 and 66. In this
embodiment the seals 64 and 66 are made of a flexible material, for example, elastomers such as
EPDM as well as nitrile, silicone, neoprene and fluoropolymer elastomers. The tube 68 is
formed of a relatively more rigid material such as glass, ceramic, metal or one or more
engineering polymers, including both thermoplastic and thermoset polymers. Exemplary rigid
engineering thermoplastic polymers that can be used to form the tube 68 include polyphenylene
and polystyrene. This choice of different materials allows the seals 64 and 66 to sealingly
engage the tube 68 when they are compressed between the housing portions 12 and 14 as
illustrated in Figure 9. Sealing interaction between the seals 64 and 66, the pipe elements 24 and
26 and the tube 68 permits a fluid tight joint to be formed when fitting 62 is used to join pipe
elements 24 and 26 together as shown in Figure 6.
[0050] Similar to fitting 10, fitting 62 has a plurality of lugs 70 which extend from the first and
second housing portions. Lugs 70 define holes 72 which align with one another and receive
adjustable fasteners 34 for attaching the housing portions to one another when the fitting 62 is
assembled as shown in Figures 5 and 6. As shown in Figure 4, housing portion 14 has two
angularly oriented surfaces 74. Housing portion 12 has similar surfaces 76 (not visible) which
are also angularly oriented and parallel to the surfaces 74. Surfaces 74 are in facing relation with
surfaces 76. When the fasteners 34 are tightened to draw the housing portions 12 and 14 toward
one another the surfaces 74 interface with surfaces 76, and, due to their angular orientation, the

                                                    13
surfaces slide relatively to one another causing the housing portions 12 and 14 to rotate in
opposite directions relatively to one another. This action is illustrated in Figures 7 and 8,
wherein Figure 7 shows the point at which the surfaces 76 on housing portion 12 just come into
contact with surfaces 74 on housing portion 14 as the fasteners 34 are tightened. Figure 8
illustrates the rotated position of the housing portions as the fasteners 34 are further tightened,
the compression force exerted by the fasteners causing the surfaces 74 and 76 to slide over one
another in opposite directions and move the housing portions 12 and 14 in opposite directions to
one another as indicated by arrows 78. This causes a misalignment of the keys 50 which
surround the openings 20 and 22 defined by the receptacles 16 and 18 (only receptacle 16 being
shown). When the keys 50 are engaged within a groove 54 in a pipe element such as 24 (see
Figures 6 and 9) the keys are forced into contact with the groove side surfaces and effect a more
rigid joint between the fitting and pipe elements than is obtained from fittings such as example
10 wherein the lug surfaces are not angularly oriented. Increased rigidity is realized in bending,
axially, as well as in torsion. In this particular example fitting, angularly oriented surfaces 74 are
positioned on lugs 70a and 70b of housing portion 14, and angularly oriented surfaces 76 are
positioned on lugs 70c and 70d of housing portion 12. Although these surfaces could be located
anywhere on the housing portions it is advantageous to locate the angularly oriented surfaces 74
and 76 near the fasteners 34 for enhanced effectiveness.
[0051] Like fitting 10, fitting 62 is also installation ready, meaning that it need not be
disassembled to form a pipe joint. Figure 5 shows the fitting 64 in the installation ready
configuration with the housing portions 12 and 14 in spaced apart relation. In this example the
housing portions are supported in spaced apart relation by contact with the first and second seals
64 and 66. As shown in Figure 4, each of the first and second seals has an outer circumference
80 sized to support the housing portions 12 and 14 in spaced apart relation sufficient to permit
the pipe elements 24 and 26 (see Figure 5) to be inserted into the openings 20 and 22 without
disassembling the fitting. Notches 52 in the ends of keys 50 facilitate pipe element insertion by
providing clearance.
[0052] A method of assembly is illustrated in Figures 5 through 8. As shown by comparison of
Figures 5 and 6, pipe elements 24 and 26 are inserted into the fitting in its installation ready
configuration (Figure 5) and the adjustable fasteners 34 are tightened to draw the housing
portions 12 and 14 toward one another (Figure 6). As the fasteners 34 are tightened, angled
surfaces 74 and 76 on lugs 70a and 70c come into contact, as do the angled surfaces 74 and 76

                                                  14
on lugs 70b and 70d (Figure 7). As the fasteners are further tightened, interfacing surfaces 74
and 76 slide relatively to one another, causing the housing portions 12 and 14 to rotate relatively
to one another in opposite directions as shown by arrows 78 in Figure 8, thereby causing the
keys 50 to move out of alignment with one another and contact the sidewalls of the groove 54 in
the pipe elements, the contact points being shown at 82 and 84 in Figure 9. In this example
fitting 62 the rotation occurs substantially about fastener 34 through lugs 70e and 70f.
[0053] Figures 10 through 12 illustrate an example tee fitting 86 according to the invention. As
shown in Figure 10, fitting 86 comprises first and second housing portions 88 and 90. When
attached to one another, the housing portions 88 and 90 define a first receptacle 92, a second
receptacle 96 and a third receptacle 94. Receptacles 92, 96 and 94 define respective first, second
and third openings 98, 102 and 100 for receiving respective pipe elements 104, 108 and 106,
shown in phantom line. Housing portions 88 and 90 together also define a fluid path extending
between the first, second and third receptacles 92, 96 and 94, the fluid path being depicted by
the arrow 110 shown in Figure 11 for clarity.
[0054] Again with reference to Figure 10, a plurality of lugs 112 extend from each housing
portion 88 and 90. In the example tee fitting 86 each housing portion has four lugs. Lugs 112
define holes 114. When the housing portions 88 and 90 are assembled in facing relation as
shown in Figure 10, the holes 114 in lugs 112 align to receive fasteners 116 which attach the
housing portions to one another to form the tee fitting 86. Fasteners 116 are adjustably
tightenable so as to draw the first and second housing portions 88 and 90 toward one another
and bring the first, second and third receptacles 92, 94 and 96 into engagement with the pipe
elements 104, 106 and 108 (respectively) so as to affix the pipe elements together as shown in
Figure 12.
[0055] In the example tee fitting embodiment 86, as shown in Figure 12, the first receptacle 92
surrounds a first axis 118 oriented coaxially with the first opening 98. The second receptacle 96
surrounds a second axis 122 oriented coaxially with the second opening 102. The third
receptacle 94 surrounds a third axis 120 oriented coaxially with the third opening 100. Axes
118, 120 and 122 may be used to describe the angular orientation of the receptacles 92, 94 and
96 relatively to one another. In the example tee fitting 86, the first receptacle 92 is co-linear with
the third receptacle 94. The second receptacle 96 is oriented angularly with respect to the first
and third receptacles. The orientation angle 124 between axes 122 and either axis 118 or 120 is

                                                  15
about 900. For practical tee designs the orientation angle 124 may range from about 30' to about
150' as shown in phantom line. It is further understood that the housing portions 88 and 90
make take any practical shape between the receptacles 92, 96 and 94. Thus, for example,
particular sections extending between receptacles may be straight segments as shown, or may be
curved, so long as the receptacles are oriented with respect to one another as defined by the
orientation angles between their respective axes as defined herein and illustrated in Figure 12.
[0056] To establish and maintain fluid tightness of a joint between pipe elements formed by the
tee fitting 86, a sealing element 126, shown in Figure 11, is positioned between the housing
portions 88 and 90. Sealing element 126 comprises a first seal 128 positioned within the first
receptacle 92, a second sea1130, positioned within the second receptacle 94, and a third seal 132
positioned within the third receptacle 96. A tube 134 extends within the tee fitting 86 along the
fluid path described by arrow 110 between the first, second and third seals 128, 130 and 132. In
this example, the first second and third seals are separate from the tube 134, but it is understood
that the sealing element 126 comprising the three seals and the tube could be formed integrally
from one piece similar to the sealing element 42 shown in Figure 1. When formed from one
piece the sealing element 126 may be formed from elastomeric materials such as EPDM, as well
as nitrile, silicone, neoprene and fluoropolymer elastomers. When sealing element 126 is formed
as separate pieces as shown in Figure l Ithe seals 128, 130 and 132 may be formed of a flexible
elastic material, for example an elastomer such as EPDM, as well as nitrile, silicone, neoprene
and fluoropolymer elastomers. The tube 68 is formed of a relatively more rigid material such as
glass, ceramic, metal or one or more engineering polymers, including both thermoplastic and
thermoset polymers. Exemplary rigid engineering thermoplastic polymers that can be used to
form the tube 68 include polyphenylene and polystyrene.
[0057] Figure 10 shows the tee fitting 86 in the "installation ready" state, i.e., partially
assembled with the first and second housing portions 88 and 90 held in spaced apart relation
sufficient to permit the pipe elements 104, 106 and 108 to be conveniently inserted into the
respective openings 98, 100 and 102 without disassembling the tee fitting. To effect a fluid
tight joint, pipe elements 104, 106 and 108 are inserted into openings 98, 100 and 102 where
they respectively engage the first, second and third seals 128, 130 and 132. Fasteners 116 are
then tightened, drawing the housing portions 88 and 90 together (as shown in Figure 12) and
compressing the first, second and third seals between the housing portions and the pipe
elements 104, 106 and 108 while also engaging the receptacles 92, 94 and 96 with their

                                                     16
respective pipe elements 104, 106 and 108 to mechanically capture and retain the pipe
elements together. In this example, positive mechanical engagement between the tee fitting 86
and the pipe elements 104, 106 and 108 is effected by radially projecting arcuate keys 136
positioned on each housing portion 88 and 90. Keys 136 may have notches 138 at opposite
ends to provide clearance and facilitate pipe element insertion. Upon assembly of the tee
fitting 86, the keys surround the openings 98, 100 and 102 and engage circumferential grooves
140 in the pipe elements 104, 106 and 108. Tee fittings according to the invention are of
course not limited to use with grooved pipe elements, but may also be adapted to plain end
pipe elements, flared pipe elements as well as shoulder and shoulder and bead pipe elements.
[0058] Housing portions 88 and 90 may be conveniently supported in spaced relation by contact
with the first, second and third seals 128, 130 and 132. In the example tee fitting 86 shown in
Figures 10 through 12, the housing portions 88 and 90 are supported in spaced apart relation by
contact with the first, second and third seals 128, 130 and 132. As shown in Figure 10, each of
the seals has an outer circumference 142 sized to support the housing portions 88 and 90 in
spaced apart relation sufficient to permit the pipe elements 104, 106 and 108 to be inserted into
the openings 98, 100 and 102 without disassembling the tee fitting. In an alternate embodiment
of the sealing element similar to sealing element 42 described previously and shown in Figure 1,
the first, second and third seals 128, 130 and 132 of the sealing element 126 may each have
projections which extend radially outward to engage a housing portion. The projections may
take the form of an arch which has sufficient stiffness to support the housing portions, yet will
collapse when compressed between the housing portions as the fasteners are tightened to permit
the seals 128, 130 and 132 to be compressed and the keys 136 to engage the grooves 140 in the
pipe elements 104, 106 and 108. When a seal with projections is used the housing portions 88
and 90 may also have recesses similar to recesses 60 shown in Figure 1. The recesses would be
positioned on the inner surfaces of the receptacles 92, 94 and 96. The recesses would be
designed to receive the projections and provide space for their deformation when they are
compressed by the housing portions 88 and 90.
[0059] The tee fitting 86 may be designed to provide a relatively flexible joint, or a relatively
rigid joint. To effect a relatively flexible joint, the lugs 112 interface with one another at
surfaces which are not angularly oriented. Such surfaces do not cause relative rotation between
the housing portions 88 and 90 and the keys 136 may be designed to engage the grooves 140
and contact only one groove side surface. To effect a more rigid joint as in the example tee

                                                   17
fitting 86 as shown, two of the lugs 112a and 112b on housing portion 90 each have an
angularly oriented surface 144. Lugs 112c and 112d on housing portion 88 have similar surfaces
146 (not visible) which are also angularly oriented and parallel to the surfaces 144 on lugs 112a
and 112b. Surface 144 on lug 112a is in facing relation with surface 146 on lug 112c; surface
144 on lug 1 12b is in facing relation with surface 146 on lug 1 12d. When the fasteners 116 are
tightened to draw the housing portions 88 and 90 toward one another the surfaces 144 interface
with surfaces 146, and, due to their angular orientation, the surfaces slide relatively to one
another causing the housing portions 88 and 90 to rotate in opposite directions relatively to one
another. This action is illustrated in Figure 12, which shows the rotated position of the housing
portions as the fasteners 116 are fully tightened. The compression force exerted by the fasteners
causes the surfaces 144 and 146 to slide over one another in opposite directions and move the
housing portions 88 and 90 in opposite directions to one another as indicated by arrows 148.
This causes a misalignment of the keys 136 which surround the openings 98, 100 and 102
defined by the receptacles 92, 94 and 96. When the keys 136 are engaged within a groove 140 in
a pipe element such as 104, 106 or 108, the keys are forced into contact with the groove side
surfaces and effect a more rigid joint between the fitting and pipe elements than is obtained from
fittings wherein the lug surfaces are not angularly oriented. Increased rigidity is realized in
bending, axially, as well as in torsion.
[0060] Elbow and tee fittings according to the invention provide for greatly increased efficiency
in the formation of pipe joints as it is not necessary to disassemble and reassemble the fitting to
create the joint.
