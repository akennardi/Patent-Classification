                                           Technical Field
[0002]       This invention relates to a decontamination or sterilization process wherein spores
are killed using a sporicidal vaporous mixture derived from an aqueous composition containing a
peroxide (e.g., hydrogen peroxide).
                                             Background
[0003]       Spores are a highly resistant, dormant cell type formed by some types of bacteria.
Endospores (or simply spores) form within the vegetative mother cell in response to adverse
changes in the environment, most commonly nutrient depletion. The mother cell undergoes an
asymmetrical cell division, where it replicates its genetic material, which is then surrounded by
multiple concentric and spore specific layers. The mother cell then disintegrates, releasing the
mature dormant spore which requires neither nutrients, water nor air for survival and is protected
against a variety of trauma, including extremes of temperature, radiation, and chemical assault.
Spore forming bacteria cause a number of serious diseases in humans, including botulism, gas
gangrene, tetanus, and acute food poisoning. Anthrax results from infection by the aerobic spore
form Bacillus anthracis.
                                               Summary
[0004]       Spores are difficult to kill and a problem in the art of decontamination and
sterilization relates to providing an effective process for killing spores. This invention provides a
solution to this problem. This invention relates to a decontamination or sterilization process
wherein spores are killed using a sporicidal vaporous mixture derived from an aqueous
composition that contains a peroxide (e.g., hydrogen peroxide).
[0005]       This invention relates to a process, comprising: forming droplets of an aqueous
composition comprising water and a peroxide, the aqueous composition having a concentration
of peroxide in the range from about 0.01 to about 14% by weight, or from about 0.01 to about
12% by weight, or from about 0.01 to about 10% by weight, or from about 0.01 to about 8% by

weight, or from about 0.01 to about 7% by weight, or from about 0.05 to about 7% by weight, or
from about 0.1 to about 7% by weight, or from about 0.1 to about 6.5% by weight; vaporizing
the droplets to form a sporicidal vaporous mixture; and contacting spores with the sporicidal
vaporous mixture for a sufficient period of time to effect at least a 4 log reduction, or at least a 5
log reduction, or at least a 6 log reduction in the number of spores capable of returning to
vegetative growth.
[0006]      In an embodiment, the droplets are dispersed in a carrier gas.

agent.
[0008]      In an embodiment, the carrier gas comprises a gaseous antimicrobial agent.
[0009]      In an embodiment, the sporicidal gaseous mixture contacts the spores, and an
antimicrobial agent contacts the spores, the antimicrobial agent comprising a gas, a vapor, a
liquid, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The contacting of the spores with the sporicidal
vaporous mixture and the antimicrobial agent may occur simultaneously.            Alternatively, the
contacting may occur sequentially with the contacting with the sporicidal vaporous mixture
preceding the contacting with the antimicrobial agent.

composition is in the range from about 0.001 to about 7% by weight, or from about 0.001 to
about 6%, or from about 0.001 to about 5% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 4% by
weight, or from about 0.001 to about 3% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 2% by weight,
or from about 0.001 to about 1.5% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 1% by weight, or
from about 0.001 to about 0.5% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 0.4% by weight, or
from about 0.001 to about 0.3% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 0.2% by weight, or
from about 0.001 to about 0.16% by weight.
[0011]      In an embodiment, the concentration of the antimicrobial agent in the aqueous
composition is in the range from about 0.005 to about 0.5% by weight, or from about 0.005 to
about 0.4% by weight, or from about 0.005 to about 0.3% by weight, or from about 0.005 to
about 0.2% by weight, or from about 0.005 to about 0.16% by weight.
[0012]      In an embodiment, the weight ratio of the antimicrobial agent to the peroxide in the
aqueous composition is in the range from about 0.001 to about 0.5, or from about 0.003 to about

0.4, or from about 0.006 to about 0.3, or from about 0.008 to about 0.2, or from about 0.01 to
about 0.1.
[0013]      In an embodiment, the sporicidal vaporous mixture is applied to spores in a defined
area, the concentration of the peroxide in the defined area being in the range up to about 1000
parts per million (ppm), or from about 5 to about 1000 ppm, or from about 5 to about 800 ppm,
or from about 5 to about 700 ppm, or from about 5 to about 600 ppm, or from about 5 to about
500 ppm, or from about 5 to about 400 ppm, or from about 5 to about 300 ppm, or from about 5
to about 200 ppm, or from about 5 to about 100 ppm, or from about 5 to about 75 ppm, or from
about 5 to about 50 ppm, or from about 5 to about 25 ppm, or from about 5 to about 15 ppm, or
from about 5 to about 10 ppm.
[0014]      In an embodiment, the sporicidal vaporous mixture is applied to spores in a defined
area, the concentration of the antimicrobial agent in the defined area being in the range up to
about 70,000 ppm, or from about 5 to about 70,000 ppm, or from about 5 to about 50,000 ppm,
or from about 5 to about 30,000 ppm, or from about 5 to about 10,000 ppm, or from about 5 to
about 5000 ppm, or from about 5 to about 1000 ppm.
[0015]      In an embodiment, the time required to effect at least a 4 log reduction, or at least a 5
log reduction, or at least a 6 log reduction in the number of spores capable of returning to
vegetative growth is in the range from about 30 seconds to about 20 minutes, or from about 30
seconds to about 10 minutes.
                                Brief Description of the Drawings
[0016]      Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of a bacterial spore that can be killed in accordance
with the invention.
[0017]      Fig. 2 is a schematic illustration of a vaporization system that may be used in
accordance with the invention.
                                       Detailed Description
[0018]      All ranges and ratio limits disclosed in the specification and claims may be combined
in any manner. It is to be understood that unless specifically stated otherwise, references to "a,"
"an," and/or "the" may include one or more than one, and that reference to an item in the
singular may also include the item in the plural.

[0019]       The phrase "and/or" should be understood to mean "either or both" of the elements
so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present
in other cases. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically
identified by the "and/or" clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically
identified unless clearly indicated to the contrary. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference
to "A and/or B," when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as "comprising" can
refer, in one embodiment, to A without B (optionally including elements other than B); in
another embodiment, to B without A (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another
embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.
[0020]       The word "or" should be understood to have the same meaning as "and/or" as
defined above. For example, when separating items in a list, "or" or "and/or" shall be interpreted
as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also including more than one, of a
number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted items.          Only terms clearly
indicated to the contrary, such as "only one of' or "exactly one of," may refer to the inclusion of
exactly one element of a number or list of elements. In general, the term "or" as used herein
shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e. "one or the other but not both")
when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as "either," "one of," "only one of," or "exactly one
of."
[0021]       The phrase "at least one," in reference to a list of one or more elements, should be
understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list
of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically
listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of
elements.    This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the
elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase "at least one"
refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified.      Thus, as a non
limiting example, "at least one of A and B" (or, equivalently, "at least one of A or B," or,
equivalently "at least one of A and/or B") can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one,
optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements
other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B,
with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment,
to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more
than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.

[0022]        The transitional words or phrases, such as "comprising," "including," "carrying,"
"having," "containing," "involving," "holding," and the like, are to be understood to be open
ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to.
[0023]        The term "killing" (or "kill") spores refers to rendering the spores incapable of
returning to vegetative growth. In an embodiment, the term killing spores refers to rendering the
spores incapable of reproduction, metabolism and/or growth.
[0024]        The term "log reduction" is a mathematical term to show the number of live spores
killed by contacting the spores with the aqueous composition of the invention.               A "4 log
reduction" means that the number of live spores is 10,000 times smaller. A "5 log reduction"
means that the number of live spores is 100,000 times smaller. A "6 log reduction" means that
the number of live spores is 1,000,000 times smaller.
[0025]        The term "antimicrobial agent" refers to a substance that kills microorganisms or
inhibits their growth.
[0026]        The term "disinfectant" refers to a substance that is applied to non-living objects to
kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms that are on the objects.
[0027]        The term "antibiotic" refers to a substance that kills or inhibits the growth of
microorganisms within the body.
[0028]        The term "antiseptic" refers to a substance that kills or inhibits the growth of
microorganisms on living tissue.
[0029]        The term "biocide" refers to a substance that kills or inhibits the growth of living
organisms.      The biocide can be a pesticide.       The biocide can be a fungicide, herbicide,
insecticide, algaecide, molluscicide, miticide or rodenticide.
[0030]        The term "sanitizer" refers to a substance that cleans and disinfects.
[0031]        Sterilization with respect to spores is often taken as referring to a process for
achieving a total absence of living spores. Processes that are less rigorous than sterilization may
include decontamination processes. The process provided for herein may be used to achieve at
least a 4 log reduction, or at least a 5 log reduction, or at least a 6 log reduction in the number of
spores capable of returning to vegetative growth, or in an embodiment capable of reproduction,
metabolism and/or growth. When at least a 6 log reduction is achieved, the process may be
referred to as a sterilization process. When a 4 log reduction or a 5 log reduction is achieved, the

process may be considered to be less rigorous than a sterilization, but nevertheless useful for
various decontamination applications.
[0032]      Bacterial spores typically comprise multiple concentric layers surrounding a central
core. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 wherein a bacterial spore is shown which has a central core,
inner membrane, germ cell wall, cortex, outer membrane, spore coat and occasionally an
exosporium. Oxidizing agents for years have been thought to attack DNA, RNA, protein and
most organic matter equally. However, while not wishing to be bound by theory, with the
present invention it is believed that the mechanism that is provided involves the peroxide (e.g.,
hydrogen peroxide) first piercing holes in multiple layers surrounding the central core of the
spores, and then the antimicrobial agent advancing through the pierced holes and attacking the
central core to kill the spores. In an embodiment, this mechanism is believed to occur when
using sporicidal vaporous mixtures with relatively low concentrations of peroxide (e.g., in the
range up to about 1000 ppm). The antimicrobial agent may also be present and may be at a
relatively low concentration (e.g., in the range from up to about 70,000 ppm).              In an
embodiment, this mechanism is believed to occur when relatively low concentrations of the
antimicrobial agent and peroxide are used, as indicated above, and the antimicrobial agent to
peroxide weight ratio is relatively low (e.g., in the range from about 0.001 to about 0.5).
[0033]      Advantages of the inventive process include relatively low costs due to the fact that
the concentrations of the antimicrobial agent and peroxide used in the process are relatively low
in comparison to concentrations used in other processes using these ingredients.             Other
advantages include low levels of corrosion of surfaces treated due to the low concentrations of
the antimicrobial agent and peroxide.
[0034]      The water may comprise tap water, deionized water, distilled water, water purified
by osmosis, or a mixture of two or more thereof.
[0035]      The peroxide may comprise any compound containing an oxygen-oxygen single
bond, or a peroxide group or peroxide ion.          Examples include hydrogen peroxide; organic
peroxides (e.g., benzoyl peroxide, acetyl acetone peroxide, acetyl benzoyl peroxide, diacetyl
peroxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, methyl isobutyl ketone peroxide, acetone peroxide, or a
mixture of two or more thereof); peroxy acids (e.g., peroxy carboxylic acid); organic
hydroperoxides (e.g., t-butyl hydroperoxide, ethylhydroperoxide, or cumene hydroperoxide);
inorganic peroxides such as peroxide salts (e.g., alkali metal or alkaline earth metal peroxides);
acid peroxides (e.g., peroxymonosulfuric acid or peroxydisulfuric acid); and mixtures of two or
more thereof.

[0036]      The hydrogen peroxide may be derived from any source of hydrogen peroxide.
Hydrogen peroxide is typically available as a solution in water.              Hydrogen peroxide
concentrations of about 3 to about 8% by weight may be used. Commercial grades of about 30%
to about 40% by weight, or about 35% by weight, hydrogen peroxide may be used. Commercial
grades of about 70 to about 98% by weight hydrogen peroxide may be used.               The higher
concentrations would be diluted to provide the desired concentrations of hydrogen peroxide that
are indicated above.
[0037]      The antimicrobial agent may comprise a disinfectant, antibiotic, antiseptic, biocide
and/or sanitizer. The antimicrobial agent may comprise peracetic acid. The antimicrobial agent
may comprise an alcohol, chlorine, a chlorine compound, an aldehyde, an oxidizing agent,
iodine, ozone, a phenolic, a quaternary ammonium compound, or a mixture of two or more
thereof.     The  antimicrobial    agent   may   comprise  formaldehyde,    ortho-phthalaldehyde,
glutaraldehyde, silver dihydrogen citrate, polyaminopropyl biguanide, sodium bicarbonate, lactic
acid, chlorine bleach, or a mixture of two or more thereof.         The antimicrobial agent may
comprise methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, isopropanol, or a mixture of
two or more thereof. The antimicrobial agent may comprise a hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, a
dichloroisocyanurate, a monochloroisocyanurate, a halogenated hydantoin, or a mixture of two
or more thereof.      The antimicrobial agent may comprise sodium hypochlorite, calcium
hypochlorite,      sodium        dichloroisocyanurate,      sodium      chlorite,     N-chloro-4
methylbenzenesulfonamide sodium salt, 2,4-dichorobenzyl alcohol, or a mixture of two or more
thereof.   The antimicrobial agent may comprise performic acid, potassium permanganate,
potassium peroxymonosulfate, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The antimicrobial agent
may     comprise     phenol,    o-phenylphenol,     chloroxylenol,   hexachlorophene,     thymol,
amylmetacresol, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The antimicrobial agent may comprise
benzalkonuim     chloride,   cetyltrimethyl   ammonium     bromide,    cetylpyridinium   chloride,
benzethonium chloride, boric acid, Brilliant green, chlorhexidine gluconate, tincture of iodine,
providone-iodine,      mercurochrome,        manuka     honey,     octenidine     dihydrochloride,
polyhexamethylene biguamide, balsam of Peru, or a mixture of two or more thereof. Many of
these antimicrobial agents may not be effective in the killing of spores on their own, but when
combined with hydrogen peroxide at the concentration levels indicated above many of these
antimicrobial agents are useful for killing spores.
[0038]      The carrier gas may comprise air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, helium, argon, or a
mixture of two or more thereof.        In an embodiment, the carrier gas comprises air.     In an
embodiment, the carrier gas comprises a gaseous antimicrobial agent.

[0039]        The gaseous antimicrobial agent may comprise ozone, chlorine dioxide, nitric oxide,
or a mixture of two or more thereof.
[0040]        The inventive process may comprise forming droplets of the aqueous composition,
vaporizing the droplets to form the sporicidal vaporous mixture, and contacting spores with the
sporicidal vaporous mixture for a sufficient period of time to effect a desired level of reduction
(e.g., at least a 4 log reduction, or at least a 5 log reduction, or at least a 6 log reduction) in the
number of spores capable of returning to vegetative growth, or in an embodiment, capable of
reproduction, metabolism and/or growth. In an embodiment, the droplets may be dispersed in
the carrier gas.
[0041]        The spores that may be treated (i.e., killed) include bacterial spores. The spores may
comprise bacteria of the Bacillus or Clostridia genera. The spores may comprise Geobacillus
stearothermophilus, Bacillus atrophaeus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus coagulans,
Clostridium sporogenes, Bacillus subtilis globigii, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus
anthracis, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The spores may comprise one or more Bacillus
subtilis strains and/or wild type Bacillus subtilis spores.
[0042]        The temperature of the sporicidal vaporous mixture when contacting the spores may
be in the range from about 10 C to about 70'C, or from about 20'C to about 60'C, or from about
25'C to about 55 0 C, or from about 30'C to about 50'C. The temperature may be in the range
from about 20'C to about 26'C, or from about 21PC to about 25'C, or from about 22'C to about
24'C, or about 22'C, or about 23'C. The temperature may be room temperature.
[0043]        The   sporicidal   vaporous    mixture    may   be  used in     a   defined  area   (e.g.,
decontamination      or sterilization chamber, room, building, etc.) wherein the pressure is
atmospheric pressure, above atmospheric pressure or below atmospheric pressure.
[0044]        The spores that may be treated (i.e., killed) may be in the defined area. The defined
area may comprise a decontamination chamber. The defined area may comprise a sterilization
chamber. The defined area may comprise a large enclosure such as a building or a room. The
defined area may comprise a hospital, laboratory, office building, airplane, airport hanger,
railroad car, bus, truck, automobile, hotel, or manufacturing facility.
[0045]        The spores that may be treated (i.e., killed) may be on a substrate. The substrate may
be made of a material comprising metal, rubber, plastic, glass, wood, painted or coated surface,
or a combination of two or more thereof. The substrate may comprise a table top, counter top,
floor, wall, ceiling, window, door, door handle, sink, faucet, toilet or toilet seat. The substrate

may comprise a medical, dental, pharmaceutical, veterinary or mortuary device. The substrate
may comprise an endoscope. The substrate may comprise a pharmaceutical, food or beverage
packaging item. The substrate may comprise processing equipment for pharmaceuticals or food.
The substrate may comprise a freeze dryer or meat processing equipment.
[0046]       A system 10 for killing spores, which can be used in accordance with the invention,
is illustrated in Fig. 2.   Referring to Fig. 2, the system 10 includes flash vaporizer 20 and
chamber 70. Items contaminated with spores are loaded into the chamber 70 through opening
72. Door 74 is then closed to seal the chamber 70. The sporicidal vaporous mixture is formed in
vaporizer 20, flows from vaporizer 20 through tubular line 22 into chamber 70 where it contacts
the spores and the contaminated items and kills the spores.
[0047]       The vaporizer 20 includes an induction vessel 24, which is positioned in a magnetic
field and is heated by electric current inductively generated in the induction vessel 24 by the
magnetic field.     The induction vessel 24 transfers heat to heating tube 26 via conduction,
radiation and/or convection.
[0048]       The heating tube 26 has a tube wall 28 defining an interior passage or bore 30, which
may be cylindrical in shape.      The heating tube 26 may be formed from an electrically and
thermally conductive material, such as iron, carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper,
brass, bronze, electrically conductive ceramic and polymer composites, or other materials
capable of being inductively heated. An induction coil 31 is wrapped around an outer surface 32
of the tube 26 in a helix, along all or a portion of the tube length. The induction coil 31 may be
spaced from the tube by a layer of insulation material (not shown in the drawing).               An
electrically insulative housing 34 surrounds the coil 31 and insulation material.
[0049]       The aqueous composition flows from liquid container 52 through tubular line 54
towards heating tube 26.     The carrier gas flows from carrier gas line 58 into tubular line 54
where it contacts the aqueous composition. In the tubular line 54, the carrier gas disperses the
aqueous composition to form a dispersion of droplets of the aqueous composition in the carrier
gas.   The heating tube 26 provides bore 30 for receiving the dispersion and vaporizing the
droplets.    The heating tube 26 may be sized to receive a volume of the dispersion that is
sufficiently small so that the droplets can be vaporized rapidly as they enter and contact the
interior walls of the heating tube 26 in a flash vaporization process. While the heating tube 26 is
shown in Fig. 2 as being vertically aligned along its axis, it is to be appreciated that the heating
tube 26 may alternatively be aligned horizontally or have portions arranged with different
orientations.   Also, although not shown in Fig. 2, the interior heating tube 26 may include

interior baffles which extend from the interior walls of the heating tube 26 into the bore 30.
These baffles may be used to provide turbulence to the flow of the dispersion, and enhance the
transfer of heat to the droplets.
[0050]       An upper end or outlet 36 of the heating tube 26 is fluidly connected with the tubular
line 22. Valve 38 in the tubular line 22 may be used to adjust the amount of the sporicidal
vaporous mixture flowing into the chamber 70. The tubular line 22 or a fitting (not shown)
connecting the tubular line 22 with the heating tube 26, may be formed of a material such as
copper, brass or polymer.
[0051]       An AC source 40 supplies an alternating current to the coil 31 via electric circuit 42.
In response to the applied current, the coil 31 produces an alternating magnetic field, which
passes through the heating tube 26. This may cause eddy currents which heat the tube 26. The
heat passes through to an inner surface 37 of the tube 26 and heats the dispersion flowing
through the bore 30. The electrical current and the rate of heating of the heating tube 26 may be
adjustable, for example, with a current adjustment mechanism 39.            The current adjustment
mechanism 39, which may comprise a pulse width modulator, a variable resistor, or the like, in
the electrical circuit 42 connecting the AC source 40 and the induction coil 31. Alternatively, or
additionally, the current adjustment mechanism 39 may include an on/off switch 44 for the
circuit 42.
[0052]       The current adjustment mechanism 39 may be controlled by controller 50, which
may also control other aspects of the system 10. For example, the controller 50 may receive
temperature measurements from temperature monitor 52, which may be in the form of a
thermocouple, and is positioned adjacent the outlet end 36 of the heating tube 26, or elsewhere in
the system 10, such as in the tubular line 22.         The controller 50 may control the current
adjustment mechanism 39 in response to the measured temperature in the chamber 70 to
maintain a preselected operating temperature. The controller 50 may also be connected with one
or more of temperature monitors 76 and pressure monitors 78 positioned within the chamber 70
or elsewhere in the system 10. The controller 50 may be used to regulate the vaporizer 20 to
maintain the desired temperature and pressure.
[0053]       The flow of the aqueous composition into inlet tubular line 54 may be regulated by
adjustable inlet valve 56. The valve 56 may be a solenoid valve controlled by controller 50. The
inlet tubular line 54 is connected to a second end or inlet end 57 of the heating tube 26. As with
the outlet tubular line 22, the inlet tubular line 54, or a fitting (not shown) connecting the inlet
tubular line 54 with the heating tube 26, may be formed from copper, brass or polymer.

[0054]       The inductively generated heat flash vaporizes the droplets in the bore 30 to produce
the sporicidal vaporous mixture.       The dispersion may be introduced to the bore 30 as a
continuous stream under pressure.
[0055]       The droplets may be vaporized when they contact the inner surface 37 of the heating
tube 26. The carrier gas may be used to assist in propelling the droplets through the bore 30.
Additionally, carrier gas line 60 may be connected with the tubular line 22, such that additional
carrier gas may be mixed in mixing zone 66 with the already formed sporicidal vaporous
mixture. Mixing the carrier gas with the sporicidal vaporous mixture after vapor formation in
the heating tube 26 may increase the throughput of the heating tube 26. Valves 61 and 62 in the
carrier gas lines 58 and 60 may be used to regulate the flow rate of carrier gas through the lines
58 and 60, respectively.
[0056]       The carrier gas may be air at atmospheric pressure or it may be supplied from a tank
or other reservoir (not shown).    The incoming carrier gas may pass through filter 63, which may
be a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, to remove airborne particulates, through a
dryer 64 to remove excess moisture, and heated by a heater 65 to raise the temperature of the
carrier gas.
[0057]       The pressure of the carrier gas supplied to lines 58 and 60 may vary with the
production rate of the sporicidal vaporous mixture and restrictiveness of passages in the
vaporizer 20, and typically may vary from about 1 to about 2 atmospheres absolute (101.3 to
202.7 kilopascals absolute), i.e., about 0 to about 1 atmosphere gauge (0 to 101.3 kilopascals), or
about 0.06 to about 0.14 atmosphere gauge (6.1 to 14.2 kilopascals).
[0058]       The flash vaporization and sweeping carrier gas may ensure that the sporicidal
vaporous mixture does not condense and form a puddle in the heating tube 26.
[0059]       The carrier gas may tend to cool the bore 30, reducing the rate at which the droplets
may be vaporized. Consequently, it may be desirable to maintain the carrier gas at or slightly
above a minimum flow rate needed to carry the dispersion through the bore 30 without
significant degradation of the vapor, but at a flow rate which is low enough such that appreciable
cooling of the dispersion by the carrier gas does not occur. The flow rate of the part of the
carrier gas that flows through line 58 and bore 30 may be lower than the flow rate of the part of
the carrier gas that flows through line 60. The part of the carrier gas that flows through line 60
may be injected into the sporicidal gaseous mixture flowing out of the bore 30 in mixing zone

66, which is positioned downstream of the bore 30. The resulting sporicidal vaporous mixture
may then flow into the chamber 70 via line 22.
[0060]      A sensor 80, such as a peroxide sensor, may be used to detect the concentration of
peroxide in the chamber 70.           The controller 50 may receive the detected concentration
measurements or signals indicative thereof, as well as temperature and pressure measurements
from monitors 76 and 78, and regulate the supply of fresh sporidical gaseous mixture to the
chamber 70.       Alternatively, the controller 50 may be preprogrammed with expected
concentrations of peroxide or other data which allows the controller 50 to maintain selected
chamber conditions by controlling and/or measuring various parameters of the system, such as
chamber temperature and pressure, as well as peroxide and carrier gas flow rates.
[0061]       Spent gas and vapor may exit the chamber 70 via outlet line 84. The spent gas and
vapor may pass through a destroyer 86, which may be a catalytic converter, to convert any
remaining peroxide to oxygen and water, before releasing it to the atmosphere. The removal of
spent gas and vapor may be assisted using vacuum pump 88 and valve 90. Spent liquid may be
removed from the chamber 70 through line 92 using valve 94.
[0062]      Alternatively, the outlet line 84 may be coupled with the carrier gas inlet line 58
and/or 60 as a recirculating flow through system, whereby the spent gas and vapor, preferably
after passing through the destroyer 86, is returned to the inlet line 58, intermediate the filter 63
and dryer 64, or prior to the filter 63, such that the spent gas and vapor is dried and heated before
mixing once more with the aqueous composition, droplets or vapor.
[0063]       The temperature within the chamber 70 may be at room temperature, below room
temperature, or above room temperature. The temperature may be in the range from about 10 C
to about 70'C, or from about 20'C to about 60'C, or from about 25'C to about 55 0 C, or from
about 30'C to about 50'C. The temperature may be in the range from about 20'C to about 26'C,
or from about 21PC to about 25'C, or from about 22'C to about 24'C, or about 22'C, or about
23'C. If it is desired to heat the chamber 70, a heater 96, which may be a resistance heater which
surrounds all or part of the chamber 70 may be used. The heater 96 may be controlled using the
controller 50.    The pressure within the chamber 70 may be atmospheric pressure, below
atmospheric pressure, or above atmospheric pressure.
[0064]       The sporicidal vaporous mixture within the chamber 70 may be continually or
intermittently replenished. The system 10 may be operated as a deep vacuum system, in which
the chamber 70 is evacuated to a pressure of, for example about 10 torr or below, prior to

introduction of the sporicidal vaporous mixture. One or more pulses of the sporicidal vaporous
mixture may be introduced to the chamber 70, with vacuum pulses between them.
[0065]      In an embodiment, the spores may be positioned in a lumen, and a vacuum may be
used to draw the sporicidal vaporous mixture into the lumen in contact with the spores. This is
disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,527,508, which is incorporated herein by reference.
[0066]      For sterilizing larger enclosures, such as buildings, rooms, and the like, additional
vaporizers 20 may be employed, each one being under the control of the controller 50.
[0067]      The concentration of the peroxide used in the chamber 70 may be in the range up to
about 1000 parts per million (ppm), or from about 5 to about 1000 ppm, or from about 5 to about
800 ppm, or from about 5 to about 700 ppm, or from about 5 to about 600 ppm, or from about 5
to about 500 ppm, or from about 5 to about 400 ppm, or from about 5 to about 300 ppm, or from
about 5 to about 200 ppm, or from about 5 to about 100 ppm, or from about 5 to about 75 ppm,
or from about 5 to about 50 ppm, or from about 5 to about 25 ppm, or from about 5 to about 15
ppm, or from about 5 to about 10 ppm.
[0068]      The concentration of the antimicrobial agent used in the chamber 70 may be in the
range up to about 70,000 ppm, or from about 5 to about 70,000 ppm, or from about 5 to about
50,000 ppm, or from about 5 to about 30,000 ppm, or from about 5 to about 10,000 ppm, or from
about 5 to about 5000 ppm, or from about 5 to about 1000 ppm.
[0069]       The progress of the decontamination or sterilization process may be monitored
using one or more decontamination or sterilization indicators. These indicators may contain a
biological indicator. The biological indicator may comprise one or more test organisms which
may be more resistant to the decontamination or sterilization process than the organisms to be
destroyed by the decontamination or sterilization process. The test organism may be placed in
contact with an incubation medium to determine whether the decontamination or sterilization
process was effective.
Examples
[0070]      The efficacy of the inventive process is assessed using a time kill suspension test
method and spores of Bacillus subtilis.
[0071]      Peracetic acid (PAA) and hydrogen peroxide (H202) are prepared as concentrated
stocks (3x concentrate).   Each test contains 100 d of the PAA concentrate and 100 pl of the

H202 concentrate.     Controls containing only PAA or H202 are also prepared. These contain
100 pl of either the PAA concentrate or H202 concentrate and 100 pl of de-ionized water. To
each test, 100 ptl of spores are added while starting the timer concurrently.     The samples are
mixed thoroughly. The temperature of the samples is room temperature (i.e., about 26'C). At
the appropriate contact times, 10 ptl of the appropriate test sample are placed into 90 Pl of the
appropriate neutralizing solution, mixed thoroughly and incubated for at least 10 minutes. Ten
fold serial dilutions are prepared through 10-6 and plated using the drop counting method. The
plates are then incubated aerobically at 37 'C for 1-2 days.        Following incubation, colony
forming units (CFU) are counted using standard plate count techniques and converted to loglO
values for analysis.

[0073]       The values shown in Table 1 represent the time taken (minutes) to achieve a 4 log
reduction in spore count in the presence of either PAA or H 2 0 2 alone, or in combination with
each other. For PAA concentrations 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04% (in the absence of H 2 0 2 ), the
values shown are extrapolated based on the experimental data obtained for PAA concentrations
0.08, 0.16 and 0.32%. Similarly, for H2 0 2 concentrations 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4% (in the absence of
PAA), the values shown are extrapolated from experimental data. All other values are generated
from spore kill data.
[0074]       Table 2 illustrates the potentiation of spore killing by PAA when in the presence of
H202. At higher PAA concentrations (0.08 and 0.16% PAA) relatively little activity is gained
by the addition of even very high concentrations of H202. For example, 0.16% PAA is only
3.41 times more active in the presence of 6.4% H202, as compared to the activity of 0.16% PAA
alone.
[0075]       However, as the concentration of PAA is reduced, the effect of adding H202
becomes more dramatic, with PAA spore killing activity being hundreds, thousands and even
tens of thousands of times greater when in the presence of low concentrations of H202. For
example, 0.02% PAA is 333.11 times more active in combination with 0.8% H202 than when
used alone.
[0076]       Table 3 illustrates the potentiation of spore killing by H202 when in the presence of
PAA. The enhancement of the spore killing activity of H202 when in the presence of PAA is far
less pronounced, with relative improvement in the spore killing activity of H202 in combination
with all but the highest concentrations of PAA being no greater than about 100 times.
[0077]       While the invention has been explained in relation to various embodiments, it is to be
understood that modifications thereof may become apparent to those skilled in the art upon
reading the specification.     Therefore, it is to be understood that the scope of the invention
specified herein is intended to include all modifications that may fall within the scope of the
appended claims.
