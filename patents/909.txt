                                             Technical Field
            The present invention relates to the field of plating, including, but not limited to
   electroplating metallic articles, for example metallic discs that can be used as, or converted
 5 into, coins. Embodiments of the present invention described herein incorporate luminescent
   particles into plated metallic layers so that they can be detected for security purposes.
                                               Background
            The counterfeiting of coins (e.g., monetary currency and tokens) and other metal
   objects is an ongoing problem. (Coins may also be referred to herein as "coinage.") Many
10 measures have been put into place to increase the difficulty with which coins can be
   counterfeited. This includes complex three-dimensional patterning on surfaces of the coins.
            Other types of currency, such as bank notes, often include certain security features.
   These security features may include metallic strips, watermarks, holograms, fluorescent
   markers, optically variable inks, complex printed patterns, and embossing.         However, it is
15 more difficult, or impractical, to include similar security features in coins.
            Coins are typically produced by mechanically stamping (also referred to as striking) a
   metal disc (or blank), to form a three-dimensional pattern on the disc, which provides the
   coin with its identity and denotes its value. Some recent methods of producing coins involve
   providing a coin blank, typically of a less expensive metal, and plating (e.g., electroplating or
20 electroless plating) metals of higher value onto the coin blank. The plated coin blank can
   then be struck to form the final coin. For any security feature to be incorporated into such a
   coin, it should not affect the patterning of the coin, including the quality of its finish (of its
   plated surface), nor its structural integrity. The incorporation of a security feature into a coin
   should also be reasonably economical to avoid increasing the cost of coin production to
25 unacceptable levels. The functioning of any security feature should also ideally last and
   remain sufficiently constant for the entire duration that a coin is in commercial (e.g., public)
   circulation, which in many cases is a number of years.

   comprising providing a plating solution comprising a liquid medium, a precursor species
   suitable for forming a metallic layer on the articles, and a plurality of luminescent particles

            In a fourth aspect, there is provided a plating solution comprising a liquid medium, a
   precursor species for forming a metallic layer during a plating process, and a plurality of

   referred to herein as "taggant particles" or simply "taggants" or "markers") within a plated
35 (e.g., electro- or electroless plating) layer on an article to provide a security feature. In some

   particles are deposited, a layer of metal may first be laid down (i.e., plated) that is essentially
   free of luminescent particles. However, using techniques described herein, the depth of this
   particle-free layer can be reduced.      Embodiments described herein are applicable to the
   production of coins or coin blanks (also referred to as "coinage").

                                         Detailed Description
           It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as
 5 generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, may be arranged and designed in a
   wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the descriptions of the embodiments of the
   present invention, as represented in the figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the
   invention as claimed, but is merely representative of selected embodiments of the invention.
           The features, structures, or characteristics of the invention described throughout this
10 specification may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. For
   example, the usage of the           phrases     "examples," "example embodiments," "some
   embodiments," "embodiments," or other similar language, throughout this specification refers
   to the fact that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with
   the embodiment may be included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus,
15 appearances of the phrases "in embodiments," "example embodiments," "in some
   embodiments," "in other embodiments," or other similar language, throughout this
   specification do not necessarily all refer to the same group of embodiments, and the
   described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in
   one or more embodiments.
20         Embodiments of the present invention provide the previously mentioned aspects,
   including optional and preferred features of the various aspects as further described below.
   Unless otherwise stated, any optional or preferred feature may be combined with any other
   optional or preferred feature, and with any of the aspects of the invention mentioned herein.
           Herein, "suspension," "colloidal suspension," "stable suspension," or any similar
25 terminology generally refers to a mixture of two or more materials where at least one is
   dispersed in the other at a microscopic level, but not chemically bonded to it. The particles
   that act as the colloid in a suspension tend to be evenly distributed throughout the
   suspension if it has been recently mixed or stirred, but will settle to the bottom of the solution
   (also referred to herein as "sedimentation") due to gravity if it is allowed to sit undisturbed for
30 an extended period of time.
           Herein, "electroplating," "plating," "plating process," or any similar terminology refers
   to formation of a metallic layer on a substrate.
           Plating methods described herein may involve the reduction of a precursor species
   comprising metal ions in the carrier medium, such that the metal ions form a metallic layer.

   more, and optionally n is selected from 3 to 15, optionally from 3 to 10, optionally from 3 to
   12. If the articles have regular shapes, the sides of the shapes may be straight or curved.
10 The discs may be apertured or non-apertured.              In some embodiments, the disc may
   comprise an aperture, which may be located in a central portion of the face of the disc, and
   optionally extend the entire way through the disc. Optionally, the aperture may, for example,
   be for receiving a further smaller disc in the production of a bimetallic coin. The discs may
   have a thickness that is substantially the same across their entire face (or cross-section).

   plating may be measured using any suitable technique, including, but not limited to x-ray
   fluorescence ("XRF") and scanning electron microscopy ("SEM").
           The plating may be carried out while the articles are within a receptacle that is placed
   within the container of plating solution.  In embodiments, the receptacle moves within the
 5 plating solution. The receptacle may act to tumble the articles within the receptacle during
   the plating.    In embodiments, the receptacle rotates within the plating solution.      Such a
   receptacle may be in the form of a barrel. This may be termed barrel plating. The articles
   may be free to move within the receptacle (e.g., barrel) such that when the receptacle
   rotates, the articles move (e.g., rotate and/or tumble) within the receptacle relative to one
10 another. This has been found to provide a relatively consistent plate thickness on all sides
   of the articles.
           In embodiments of the present invention, the plating is carried out while the articles
   are within a receptacle that moves continuously during the plating process. The plating may
   be carried out while the articles are within a receptacle that rotates continuously during the
15 plating process. The receptacle may rotate on an axis that is substantially horizontal. The
   receptacle may move (e.g., rotate) at a constant rate during the plating.        Optionally, the
   articles are continuously rotated in a barrel, and optionally at a constant rate, during the
   plating of the plurality of articles.   Optionally, the rotation of the barrel is periodically
   interrupted. The receptacle (e.g., barrel) may rotate at a speed of 1 to 50 rpm, optionally
20 from 4 to 30 rpm, optionally from 4 to 15 rpm, optionally from 4 to 12 rpm, optionally from 6
   to 10 rpm, optionally about 8 rpm. The rate of rotation may be varied during plating or be
   held constant, for example for the entire duration of the plating.
           In some embodiments, an electrical potential is applied to the articles, such that they
   form a cathode within the plating solution, and a further electrode is present within the
25 plating solution that forms an anode.     The anode may be in any suitable form.        In some
   embodiments, the anode comprises a metallic mesh material, which may form a basket. If
   the articles are within a receptacle as described above, the receptacle may comprise or be
   formed out of a non-conducting material, such as plastic, and an electrode may extend into
   the receptacle, this electrode acting as a cathode during plating. The electrode acting as a
30 cathode may contact at least some of the articles within the receptacle during plating.
           Luminescent, or fluorescent, materials or particles (fluorescent particles are a subset
   of luminescent particles) described herein may absorb light at a first wavelength and then

            Luminescent particles may be or comprise a phosphor material.                Phosphors
   materials are typically comprised of a host, typically comprised of a crystalline lattice, doped
 5 with luminescence centers comprised of trace amount of dopants, usually comprised of a
   transition metal, lanthanides, or actinides. A description of the design, synthesis, and optical
   characteristics of phosphors is provided in Chapter 6 of "Luminescence and the Solid State"
   by R.C. Ropp, second edition, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.
            In embodiments, the luminescent materials may comprise an inorganic phosphor, for
10 example a phosphor selected from an yttrium aluminum garnet ("YAG") phosphor. The YAG
   phosphor may comprise yttrium aluminum garnet doped with a metal, for example a metal
   selected from a transition metal, a lanthanide, and an actinide. The YAG phosphor may
   comprise yttrium aluminum garnet doped with a metal selected from Ce, Nd, Tb, Sm, Dy,
   and Cr(IV).
15          In embodiments of the present invention, at least some of the luminescent particles
   have a diameter of 10 pm or less, optionally 5 pm or less, optionally 3 pm or less, optionally
   2 pm or less. In embodiments, at least some of the luminescent particles have a diameter of
   from 0.5 pm to 1 pm, optionally from 0.6 pm to 1 pm, optionally from 0.7 pm to 0.9 pm,
   optionally about 0.8 pm. As further described in the Examples herein, particle size can have
20 an effect on, amongst other factors, the luminescent signal emitted from the luminescent
   particles once incorporated in the plated layer. As shown in Figure 2, luminescent particles
   having diameters of from approximately 0.5 pm to 1 pm were found to have the strongest
   (highest) luminescent signals, and did not appear to affect the surface quality (e.g., quality of
   finish of the surface) of the articles even after they had been struck into coins. They also
25 allowed for a relatively stable suspension of the luminescent particles when in the plating
   solution.
            The diameter (and correspondingly, determinations of the mean diameters) of a
   luminescent particle and/or any particle size distribution measurements may be measured
   using any suitable technique, including, but not limited to, scanning electron micrograph
30 ("SEM"), and/or laser light scattering, for example in accordance with ASTM UOP856-07.
   The diameter of a luminescent particle may be the largest dimension measured across the
   particle.   ASTM UOP856-07 is a well-known standardized method for determining the
   particle size distribution of powders and slurries using laser light scattering. This standard is
   commercially available from ASTM International. The laser light scattering measurements in
35 accordance with this standard may be performed with a Microtrac Model S3500 instrument
   commercially available from Microtrac Inc., or a Malvern Instruments Mastersizer 3000. In

   embodiments, the luminescent particles may be characterised as described in ASTM F1877
   05(2010).    The particle size distribution measured in accordance with ASTM UOP856-07,
   e.g. for D50, D90 and D99, may be defined as the volume particle size distribution. The
   mean particle size, measured in accordance with ASTM UOP856-07, may be defined as the
 5 volumetric mean particle size.
            Luminescent particles utilized in plating processes described herein may have a
   mean diameter of 10 pm or less, optionally 5 pm or less, optionally 3 pm or less, optionally 2
   pm or less. In embodiments, the luminescent particles may have a mean diameter of from
   0.5 pm to 5 pm, e.g. 0.5 pm to 1 pm, optionally from 0.6 pm to 1 pm, optionally from 0.7 pm
10 to 0.9 pm, optionally about 0.8 pm. The mean diameter of the particles may be measured
   before the particles are incorporated into the plating solution.
            Luminescent particles utilized in plating processes described herein may have a D50
   distribution of 10 pm or less, optionally 5 pm or less, optionally 3 pm or less, optionally 2 pm
   or less. A D50 distribution is defined as 50% of the population of particles having sizes less
15 than the D50 value, and 50% of the population of particles having sizes greater than the D50
   value. In embodiments, the luminescent particles have a D50 distribution of from 0.5 pm to
   1 pm, optionally from 0.6 pm to 1 pm, optionally from 0.7 pm to 0.9 pm, optionally about 0.8
   pm.    The D50 distribution of the particles may be measured before the particles are
   incorporated into the plating solution. D50 is sometimes termed d5o in the art.
20          Luminescent particles utilized in plating processes described herein may have a D90
   distribution of 10 pm or less, optionally 5 pm or less, optionally 3 pm or less, optionally 2 pm
   or less, optionally 1 pm or less. A D90 distribution is defined as 90% of the population of
   particles having sizes less than the D90 value, and 10% of the population of particles having
   sizes greater than the D90 value. The luminescent particles may have a D90 distribution of
25 from 0.5 pm to 5 pm, optionally from 1 pm to 4 pm, optionally from 1 pm to 3 pm. The D90
   distribution of the particles may be measured before the particles are incorporated into the
   plating solution. D90 is sometimes termed d9 o in the art.
            In embodiments, luminescent particles, for example in the plating solution and/or in
   the articles described herein, lack or substantially lack particles having a diameter of 10 pm
30 or more, optionally 8 pm or more, optionally 7 pm or more, optionally 5 pm or more,
   optionally 4 pm or more, optionally 3 pm or more. "Substantially lack" may indicate 5 wt% of
   the particles or less, optionally 2 wt% or less, optionally 1 wt% or less have the stated
   diameter. Optionally, the particles may have a D99 distribution of 10 pm or less, optionally 8
   pm or less, optionally 7 pm or less, optionally 5 pm or more, optionally 4 pm or less,
35 optionally 3 pm or less. A D99 distribution is defined as 99% of the population of particles
   having sizes less than the D99 value, and 1% of the population of particles having sizes

            In embodiments of the present invention, before or during plating of the plurality of
   articles, the plating solution may be subjected to an ultrasound, or ultrasonic, ("US")
15 treatment (also referred to herein as sonication).           Subjecting the plating solution to
   ultrasound treatment before the plating process commences was found to produce a very
   stable suspension of the particles in the plating solution, which in turn led to higher
   luminescent signals from the luminescent particles in the final plated articles. Subjecting the
   plating solution to ultrasound treatment during the plating process was found in
20 embodiments to reduce the depth of the initial luminescent particle-free portion (layer) of the
   metallic layer (see, e.g., layer B in Figure 3). Such an initial layer is a natural result of the
   plating process in which this initial nucleation, or seed, layer becomes deposited first with
   only the metal particles as the metal cations from the plating solution undergo an electronic
   reduction on the surface of the cathode (i.e., the article being plated) to form the metallic
25 plated layer. After this initial layer forms, then the luminescent particles will be incorporated
   into the growing metal matrix (the metal plated layer) as they come in contact with the
   cathode surface as a result of being suspended in the plating solution. Since this initial
   luminescent particle-free portion is non-functional (i.e., does not emit electromagnetic
   energy), it is desired in embodiments that the thickness, or depth, of this initial layer be
30 minimized.
            The plating solution may be subjected to ultrasound treatment before commencing
   the formation of the metallic layer (i.e., plating process) (e.g., for a period of at least 30
   minutes), optionally for a period of at least 1 hour before commencing the formation of the
   metallic layer, optionally for a period of at least 3 hours before commencing the formation of
35 the metallic layer, optionally for a period of at least 4 hours before commencing the formation
                                                     14

   of the metallic layer, optionally for a period of at least 5 hours before commencing the
   formation of the metallic layer.
           The ultrasound treatment may be applied during the plating process for the whole
   period of the plating or during only part of the period of the plating. The ultrasound may be
 5 applied during an initial period of the plating, for example for a period of from 5 minutes to an
   hour, for example for a period of from 15 minutes to an hour from commencement of the
   plating of the articles, with the entire plating process taking 2 hours or more, or until a
   desired depth of the metallic layer is deposited on the substrate of the article (e.g., disc). For
   example, the ultrasound treatment may be applied for a period of at least 15 minutes from
10 commencement of the plating of the articles. In embodiments, after the plating solution has
   been subjected to the ultrasound treatment during plating of the articles, the plating of the
   articles continues until a predetermined depth of the metallic layer has been deposited on
   the articles.  The ultrasound treatment may be applied during the treatment for a time
   mentioned in this paragraph and before the treatment for a time mentioned in the
15 immediately preceding paragraph.
           Before and/or during the plating process, the frequency of the applied ultrasound
   treatment may be at least 10 kHz, optionally at least 15 kHz, optionally from 10 kHz to 30
   kHz, optionally from 15 kHz to 25 kHz, optionally about 20 kHz. The ultrasound frequency
   as disclosed in this paragraph may be applied before the treatment for a time previously
20 disclosed herein. The ultrasound frequency as disclosed in this paragraph may be applied
   during the treatment for a time previously disclosed herein. The ultrasound frequency as
   disclosed in this paragraph may be applied before the treatment for a time previously
   disclosed herein and during the treatment for a time previously disclosed herein.
           Before and/or during the plating process, the power of the applied ultrasound
25 treatment may be at least 100 W, optionally at least 200 W, e.g. at least 1000 W, optionally
   at least 1400 W. Before or during the plating process, the power of the applied ultrasound
   treatment may be a value from 100 W to 2000 W (e.g. 1000 W or 1400 W to 2000 W),
   optionally a value from 100 W to 1800 W, optionally a value from 200 W to 700 W, optionally
   about 500 W. The ultrasound power as disclosed in this paragraph may be applied before
30 the treatment for a time previously disclosed herein. The ultrasound power as disclosed in
   this paragraph may be applied during the treatment for a time previously disclosed herein.
   The ultrasound power as disclosed in this paragraph may be applied before the treatment for
   a time previously disclosed herein and during the treatment for a time previously disclosed
   herein.

   stirrer rotating at a speed of from 500 to 1800 rpm. In embodiments of the present invention,
   stirring the plating solution below the critical angular speed at which a vortex would form in
   the plating solution is a stir speed that creates sufficient turbulence in the plating solution to
   prevent agglomeration of particles, but allows co-deposition of the luminescent particles and
15 the plated metal.
            In a further aspect, there is provided a method for plating articles, the method
   comprising providing a plating solution comprising a liquid medium, a precursor species
   suitable for forming a metallic layer on the articles, and a plurality of luminescent particles
20 suspended in the liquid medium; and plating the articles within the plating solution, such that
   the precursor species forms the metallic layer on the articles and the luminescent particles
   are deposited within the metallic layer while it is formed, wherein, before and/or during the
   plating of the articles, the plating solution is agitated.
25          In an embodiment, in any of the aspects described herein, the plating solution may
   be agitated before and/or during the formation of the metallic layer (i.e., plating process). In
   an embodiment, the plating solution is agitated by subjecting the plating solution to high
   shear.     High shear may be defined as any turbulent movement of the plating solution,
   preferably turbulent flow that can cause deagglomeration of agglomerated luminescent
30 particles within the plating solution, which may be as defined herein. High shear may be
   defined as subjecting the plating solution to turbulent flow. The plating solution may be
   agitated in the container in which the plating is carried out or in a separate unit, which may
   be termed an agitation unit herein.         The plating solution may be agitated by a method
   selected from stirring the plating solution, shaking the plating solution, subjecting the plating
35 solution to ultrasound, and any other suitable method.           In an embodiment, the plating
   solution may be agitated by passing the plating solution through a centrifugal pump. In an

   embodiment, the plating solution is agitated by rotating an impeller in the plating solution,
   and preferably wherein the impeller has at least one blade that has, preferably a plurality of
   blades and each of which has, a surface that is substantially at a right angle to the plane that
   is at a right angle to the axis of rotation of the blade. In other words, the impeller may have
 5 an axis of rotation, and a plane can be defined such that the axis of rotation is perpendicular
   to the plane, and the impeller has one or more blades that has a surface that is substantially
   at a right angle to said plane. Such impellers may sometimes be referred to as high shear
   impellers, since the blades of the impeller effect turbulent, rather than laminar, flow of a
   liquid. The one or more blades of the impeller may extend radially from the axis of the
10 impeller, or extend from a sheet that lies in the plane to which the axis of rotation is
   perpendicular. "Substantially at a right angle" may indicate an angle of from 700 to 1100,
   optionally from 800 to 1000, optionally from 85         0 to 950, optionally about 900. In an
   embodiment, the plating solution is agitated by rotating an impeller, which may be a high
   shear impeller, in the plating solution with a tip speed of at least 1 m/S, optionally a tip speed
15 of at least 3 m/s, preferably a tip speed of at least 5 m/s. The impeller, which may be a high
   shear impeller and/or an impeller of the centrifugal pump, may rotate with a tip speed of from
   5 m/s to 50 m/s, optionally a tip speed of from 5 m/s to 40 m/s, optionally a tip speed of from
   5 m/s to 40 m/s, optionally a tip speed of from 5 to 25 m/s. In an embodiment, the impeller,
   e.g. the high shear impeller, is located within the container in which the articles are plated.
20 In an embodiment, the impeller, e.g. the high shear impeller, is located in a separate
   container from the one in which the articles are plated, i.e. the agitation unit.
            In an embodiment, the plating solution is agitated by passing the plating solution
   through a homogenizer, preferably a high pressure homogenizer. The homogenizer may be
25 one that effects turbulent high velocity flow, which subjects the plating solution to high shear.
   A high pressure homogenizer may involve passing the plating solution along a conduit under
   pressure until a point at which the flow is diverted at an angle of approximately 90 .
            In an embodiment, plating is carried out while the articles are within a receptacle that
30 is placed within the container of plating solution (this container being termed a plating
   container herein for brevity), and the plating solution, before and/or during the plating is
   diverted from the container of plating solution to an agitation unit, in which the plating
   solution is agitated, and then returned to the plating container, and optionally the diverting of
   the plating solution to the agitation unit and return of the plating to the receptacle in which
35 the articles are being plating is continuous, e.g. occurs during the entire plating of the
   metallic layer on the articles. In an embodiment, the plating is carried out while the articles

   are within a receptacle that is placed within the container of plating solution, and the plating
   solution, before and/or during the plating is circulated from the container of plating solution to
   an agitation unit, in which the plating solution is agitated, and then returned to the container
   of plating solution.
 5
            In an embodiment, plating is carried out while the articles are within a receptacle that
   is placed within the container of plating solution, and the plating solution, during the plating,
   which may be for part or all of the plating to form the metallic layer, is diverted, e.g. along a
   conduit such as a pipe, e.g. by being pumped, from the container of plating solution to an
10 agitation unit in which the plating solution is agitated, and then returned to the plating
   container and optionally the diverting of the plating solution to the agitation unit and return to
   the receptacle in which the articles are being plating is continuous. This can be even more
   effective than subjecting the plating solution to ultrasound, since more of the luminescent
   particles from the plating solution can incorporated into the metallic layer on the articles.
15 The agitation unit may comprise a means selected from an impeller, e.g. a high shear
   impeller, a centrifugal pump, an ultrasound unit for subjecting the plating solution to
   ultrasound, a homogeniser (which may use high pressure to cause turbulent flow), a static
   mixer, and any other means for subjecting the plating solution to turbulent flow. A static
   mixer is one in which a liquid is caused to flow past a series of static baffles, the flow past
20 the static baffles inducing turbulent flow in the liquid. The agitation unit may comprise a
   centrifugal pump, which may be as described below.
         The agitation may involve a method selected from stirring, shaking, subjecting the
   plating solution to ultrasound, and any other suitable method, e.g. any other method that
25 subjects the plating solution to turbulent flow.
          In an embodiment, plating is carried out while the articles are within a receptacle that is
   placed within the container of plating solution, and the plating solution, before and/or during
   the plating is diverted from the container of plating solution to a centrifugal pump, and then
30 returned to the plating container, and optionally the diverting of the plating solution to the
   centrifugal pump and return of the plating to the receptacle in which the articles are being
   plating is continuous.
         A centrifugal pump can be a pump in which liquid (e.g. the plating solution in the
35 present application) is passed along a conduit, which may be along the direction of the axis
   of a rotating impeller, until it reaches a rotating impeller, the impeller then directing the liquid
                                                     20

   radially outward. After the liquid is directed radially outward, the liquid may be directed along
   a conduit to a desired location, e.g. back to the container in which the articles are being
   plated.
 5        The centrifugal pump may comprise a rotating impeller that rotates about an axis,
   causing the plating solution to be directed radially outward and, optionally, a stator, through
   which the plating solution flows as it is directed radially outward. If a centrifugal pump has a
   rotating impeller and a stator, this may be termed a 'rotor stator' herein. A stator remains
   substantially stationary while the impeller is rotating. The stator may be an annular body
10 having a plurality of apertures through which the plating solution flows as it is directed
   radially outward.     In an embodiment, the impeller comprises an annular body having a
   plurality of apertures spaced circumferentially around the annular body. In an embodiment,
   the   impeller comprises an annular body having a plurality of apertures                  spaced
   circumferentially around the annular body, and the apertures are defined by walls that are
15 optionally at an angle that is offset from an angle that is radially outward from the axis of the
   impeller.   In an embodiment, the stator comprises an annular body having a plurality of
   apertures spaced circumferentially around the annular body, and the apertures are defined
   by walls that are optionally at an angle offset from an angle that is radially outward from the
   axis of the impeller.
20
          In an embodiment, the impeller has a plurality of annular bodies arranged
   concentrically, and each annular body may have a plurality of apertures spaced
   circumferentially around the annular body, and, optionally, the stator has an annular body
   having a plurality of apertures spaced circumferentially around the annular body and which is
25 arranged between at least two of the concentrically arranged annular bodies of the impeller.
          In an embodiment, the stator has a plurality of annular bodies arranged concentrically,
   each annular body having a plurality of apertures spaced circumferentially around the
   annular body, and, optionally, the impellor has an annular body having a plurality of
30 apertures spaced circumferentially around the annular body and which is arranged between
   at least two of the concentrically arranged annular bodies of the stator.
          In an embodiment, the stator and impeller each has a plurality of annular bodies
   arranged concentrically, each annular body having a plurality of apertures spaced
35 circumferentially around the annular body, the annular bodies of the stator and impeller
   interlocking such that there is an alternate arrangement concentrically of stator annular
                                                    21

    WO 2014/181127                                                                 PCT/GB2014/051431
   bodies and and impeller annular bodies. In such an arrangement, the plating solution would
   pass radially alternately through the apertures of the stator and the impeller.
            In an embodiment, the centrifugal pump does not have a stator.
 5
            The impeller of the centrifugal pump may rotate with a tip speed of at least 1 m/S,
   optionally a tip speed of at least 3 m/s, preferably a tip speed of at least 5 m/s. The impeller
   of the centrifugal pump may rotate with a tip speed of from 5 m/s to 50 m/s, optionally a tip
   speed of from 5 m/s to 40 m/s, optionally a tip speed of from 5 m/s to 40 m/s, optionally a tip
10 speed of from 5 m/s to 25 m/s. Tip speed of an impeller can be defined as the peripheral
   speed, in m/s, of the part of the impeller located furthest, radially, from the axis of rotation of
   the impeller. Tip speed = the angular velocity (in revolutions per second) x diameter of the
   impeller x -rr. It has been found that when using an impeller having a tip speed within the
   ranges stated above, a suitable balance between high shear forces and flow rate can be
15 found, such that high volumes of plating solution can be passed through the centrifugal
   pump, while still subjecting the plating solution to a reasonable amount of shear. This has
   been found to promote inclusion of a reasonably high amount of luminescent particles in the
   metallic layer.
20          In an embodiment, the container in which the plating is carried out, can contain or
   contains a volume, V 1, of plating solution, and the plating solution, before and/or during the
   plating, is circulated from the container of plating solution to an agitation unit, which may be
   a centrifugal pump, in which the plating solution is agitated, and then returned to the
   container of plating solution, and the volume of liquid V2 passed through the agitation unit,
25 per hour is n X V 1, wherein n is at least 1, optionally at least 3, optionally at least 5,
   optionally at least 10, optionally at least 15. Optionally, n is from 3 to 25, optionally from 5 to
   25. In an embodiment, the impeller of the centrifugal pump rotates with a tip speed of at
   least 5 m/s, optionally at least 10 m/s, optionally at least 15 m/s, optionally from 15 m/s to 30
   m/s, optionally from 15 m/s to 25 m/s and n is at least 10, optionally at least 15, optionally
30 from 10 to 25, optionally from 15 to 20. Optionally, the impeller of the centrifugal pump
   rotates with a tip speed of from 15 m/s to 30 m/s and n is from 10 to 25, optionally from 15 to
   20.
            The container in which the plating of the articles is carrier out may contain at least 1 L
35 of plating solution, optionally at least 5 L of plating solution optionally at least 10 L of plating
   solution, optionally at least 15 L of plating solution, optionally at least 20 L of plating solution,
                                                    22

    WO 2014/181127                                                                PCT/GB2014/051431
   optionally at least 30 L of plating solution, optionally at least 50 L or plating solution,
   optionally at least 100 L of plating solution, optionally at least 200 L of plating solution,
   optionally at least 250 L of plating solution, optionally at least 300 L of plating solution. It has
   been found that ultrasound techniques, as described herein, are particularly effective when
 5 the volume of plating solution is up to about 20 L. However, when the volume of plating
   solution is more than 20 L, while ultrasound techniques still work, they become less efficient
   and can be more costly. It was a challenge therefore to devise a technique that would allow
   the same or similar efficacy as ultrasound, while being more energy efficient than ultrasound
   and not adversely affecting the plating of the metallic layer and deposition of the luminescent
10 particles.    The circulation of the plating solution to the agitation unit, as described herein,
   was found to provide a suitable alternative to ultrasound, and can be used at all volumes of
   plating solution, including high volumes, e.g. of at least 100 L, e.g. at least 300 L.
            The plating may be carried out while the articles are within a receptacle that is placed
15 within the container of plating solution, and the plating solution diverted, or circulated, to an
   agitation unit and then returned to the container of the plating solution (in which the plating is
   carrier out), and optionally, the receptacle moves within the plating solution. The receptacle
   may act to tumble the articles within the receptacle during the plating. In embodiments, the
   receptacle rotates within the plating solution. Such a receptacle may be in the form of a
20 barrel. This may be termed barrel plating. The articles may be free to move within the
   receptacle (e.g., barrel) such that when the receptacle rotates, the articles move (e.g., rotate
   and/or tumble) within the receptacle relative to one another. This has been found to provide
   a relatively consistent plate thickness on all sides of the articles.
25          In an embodiment, plating is carried out while the articles are within a receptacle that
   is placed within the container of plating solution, and the plating solution, either before or
   during the plating is diverted, e.g. circulated, from the receptacle to an agitation unit, e.g, a
   centrifugal pump, in which the plating solution is agitated, and then returned to the plating
   container, and the receptacle moves, e.g. rotates, within the plating solution, preferably
30 moves, e.g. rotates, continuously (optionally rotating at a constant speed) within the plating
   solution throughout the entire duration of the plating. The receptacle (e.g., barrel) may rotate
   at a speed of 1 to 50 rpm, optionally from 4 to 30 rpm, optionally from 4 to 15 rpm, optionally
   from 4 to 12 rpm, optionally from 6 to 10 rpm, optionally about 8 rpm. The rate of rotation
   may be varied during plating or be held constant, for example for the entire duration of the
35 plating. The articles may be free to move within the receptacle (e.g., barrel) such that when
                                                   23

 5 method of any of the aspects described herein.             In an embodiment, the apparatus
   comprises:

            a means, e.g. a receptacle, for holding a plurality of articles within the plating
   solution, and, optionally,
10          a means for agitating the plating solution before and/or during the plating.
            The container for holding a plating solution may be termed a plating container herein
   for brevity. The apparatus may comprise a means for applying an electrical potential to the
   articles when they are within the container of the plating solution, e.g. such that
15 electroplating may be carried out.
            The means, e.g. receptacle, for holding a plurality of articles within the plating
   solution may be configured to move continuously during the plating process. The means,
   e.g. receptacle, for holding a plurality of articles may be configured to rotate on an axis that
20 is substantially horizontal. The means, e.g. receptacle, for holding a plurality of articles may
   be configured to move (e.g., rotate) at a constant rate during the plating. Optionally, the
   receptacle is or comprises a barrel and the apparatus is adapted such that the articles are
   continuously rotated in a barrel, and optionally at a constant rate, during the plating of the
   plurality of articles. Optionally, the rotation of the barrel is periodically interrupted. The
25 receptacle (e.g., barrel) may rotate at a speed of 1 to 50 rpm, optionally from 4 to 30 rpm,
   optionally from 4 to 15 rpm, optionally from 4 to 12 rpm, optionally from 6 to 10 rpm,

           As described herein, embodiments of the present invention provide a plating solution
 5 comprising a liquid medium, a precursor species for forming a metallic layer during a plating
   process, and a plurality of luminescent particles suspended in the liquid medium, at least
   some of which have diameters of 10 pm or less. The liquid medium, a precursor species,
   metallic layer, plating process, and luminescent particles may be as described herein.
            In embodiments, at least some of the luminescent particles in the plating solution
10 have diameters of 5 pm or less. In embodiments, at least some of the luminescent particles
   in the plating solution have diameters of 0.5 pm to 1 pm.
            In embodiments, in the plating solution, the precursor species are for forming the
   metallic layer during a plating process, wherein the metallic layer may comprise a metal
   selected from zinc, copper, tin, nickel, and alloys of one or more thereof.
15         Articles plated in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention have
   a homogenous distribution (this may also be referred to herein as a uniform or statistically
   random distribution, or spatial homogeneity) of luminescent particles throughout the metallic
   layer.     Embodiments of the present invention may produce plated articles with a
   homogenous distribution by utilizing a combination of a particular particle size range of
20 luminescent particles (e.g., particles having a diameter of from 0.5 pm to 1 pm) and constant
   motion of the articles (e.g., in a receptacle that rotates continuously) during the plating
   process. As is further discussed herein, the level of luminescent signal emitted from the
   luminescent particles co-deposited into the plated metal layer may be proportional to the
   volume percent of luminescent particles incorporated into the plated layer.          As is also
25 discussed hereinafter, to achieve at least a good quality finish of the plated layer and a
   constant signal throughout the lifetime of utilization of the plated article, these luminescent
   particles have a homogenous distribution in the plated layer. As a corollary, a plated article
   with a homogenous distribution of luminescent particles in the plated metal layer will typically
   produce a more consistent luminescent signal as the plated article wears in use over time
30 (e.g., a coin in public circulation).
           A homogenous distribution of the luminescent particles co-deposited within the plated
   metal layer may be determined using a variety of methods. Robust statistical methods to
   determine the levels of spatial homogeneity are readily available, for example, nearest
   neighbor methods and Ripley's k-function. Referring to Figures 9-10, another method for

   a cross-section of the plated article into three relatively equidistant layers. In Figures 9-10,
   these equidistant layers are indicated by the four horizontal black lines across the images of
   the exemplary plated samples. Comparison of the approximate percentages of the plated
   layer occupied by luminescent particles (the light spots) in each layer provides an estimate
 5 of the homogeneity. Analysis of the percentage in each layer may be determined using
   image processing software, such as the GNU* Image Manipulation Program or Adobe*
   Photoshop.      Figure 9 shows a digital image of a cross-section of an article plated with a
   metal layer co-deposited with luminescent particles in accordance with embodiments of the
   present invention, wherein it can be readily observed that there is a homogenous distribution
10 of the luminescent particles throughout the plated metal layer. In contrast, Figure 10 shows
   a digital image of a cross-section of an article plated with a metal layer co-deposited with
   luminescent particles, wherein it can be readily observed that there is not a homogenous
   distribution of the luminescent particles throughout the plated metal layer.
            As described herein, embodiments of the present invention provide an article having
15 an electroplated metallic layer thereon, wherein luminescent particles are dispersed in the
   electroplated layer, wherein at least some of luminescent particles have a diameter of 10 pm
   or less and the distribution of the luminescent particles in the plated metal layer is
   homogenous (except for the initial luminescent particle-free layer).        The article may be
   producible in accordance with methods described herein. The article, the metallic layer, and
20 the luminescent particles may be as described herein.
             Referring to Figure 3 as an example, embodiments of the present invention provide
   an article (layer C) having an electroplated metallic layer (layers A and B) thereon, where
   luminescent particles are dispersed in the electroplated layer in a first portion (layer A) of the
   electroplated layer, and a second portion (layer B) of the electroplated layer substantially
25 absent of luminescent particles (the initial luminescent particle-free layer) is disposed
   between the first portion (layer A) and the article (layer C), wherein the depth of the second
   portion (layer B) may be less than 4 pm. The plated article may be producible in accordance
   with methods described herein. The article, the metallic layer, and the luminescent particles
   may be as described herein. In embodiments, the article may be in the form of a disc. In
30 embodiments, the article may be in the form of a disc having a three-dimensional pattern
   stamped thereon after formation of the plated metallic layer. In embodiments, the article
   may comprise steel, and the metallic layer may comprise a metal selected from zinc, copper,
   tin, nickel, and an alloy selected from one or more thereof.

            The following non-limiting Examples may utilize variations of the plating steps
   illustrated in Figure 11.   As has already been discussed, and as will be further described
   hereinafter, a plating solution is prepared in step 1101 with inclusion of the metal particles to
   be plated and the accompanying luminescent particles. Sonication of the plating solution
10 may be performed in step 1102 in various implementations described herein. The plating
   solution may also be stirred, or agitated, in step 1103 in various implementations described
   herein. The plating process is performed in step 1104 in various implementations described
   herein. And, if required for the final plated article, the plated article may be patterned (e.g.,
   mechanically stamped or striked) in step 1105, wherein the plated layer is also subjected to
15 such patterning.
            Luminescent particles having a D90 distribution of approximately 10.636 microns and
   a mean particle size of approximately 8.95 microns were dosed into Nickel Sulphamate at
   approximately 15 g/l and agitated, stirred, and sonicated for approximately 6 hours; the
   solution was then left to settle. After 1 hour, the top 50% of solution was decanted into a
20 separate vessel. This top solution was then passed through several paper cartridge filters to
   reduce the mean particle size. This final filtrate was then evaporated and the remaining
   concentrate dosed into Nickel Sulphamate to electroplate articles (e.g., coinage) with
   luminescent particles of a reduced size. This particle size was verified by SEM analysis of
   the plated articles.
25          The luminescent particles were a doped lanthanide oxysulfide.              A matrix of
   experiments was designed and carried out (also referred to herein as "trials," "trial runs," or
   "plating runs" or similar terminology) firstly using a Nickel Sulphamate based plating solution,
   Copper (cyanide), and then direct Brass (cyanide) plating solutions.
            The steel metal articles (e.g., coin blanks) were weighed and then transferred to a
30 plating barrel. Before this, they may be cleaned in an alkaline cleaner at approximately 600C
   to remove any cutting oil, which may have remained. The steel articles (which may be mild
   steel) then may be rinsed in demineralised water also at approximately 60*C and then acid
   etched (e.g., using a 120 g/l solution of sulphuric acid at 500C). The steel articles were then
   transferred to the plating bath and an electrical current applied.            The plating barrel
35 continually rotated with no interruption to the current or rotation during the entire plating
   operation.

    WO 2014/181127                                                              PCT/GB2014/051431
            After the plating cycle was complete, the plated articles were removed from the
   plating solution and again rinsed in hot demineralised water. They were then dried (e.g.,
   transferred to a lab tray and placed in a hot air drier until dry). They were then annealed
   (e.g., heated in a controlled atmosphere) to soften the base metal and plated layer,
 5 producing an oxide layer on the surface of the plated article.         This oxide layer may be
   removed during a finishing process (e.g., using an acid soap and stainless steel media in a
   rotary high energy finisher).       The finished plated article, depending on a customer
   requirement, may be supplied finished as a blank (e.g., coin blank) or struck with a pattern
   (e.g., to produce coinage).
10          The plated articles, when cold, were re-weighed, and examined for plate thickness
   (e.g., using X-ray fluorescence ("XRF")). Signal strength (emitted electromagnetic energy)
   from the luminescent particles co-deposited in the plated layer was measured (e.g., with an
   appropriate signal measuring device capable of measuring electromagnetic energy, or at
   least relative signal strengths emitted from each article).      The plated articles were then
15 further processed and struck with a pattern. The luminescent signal strength was measured
   at each such stage, and the plated articles were cut into cross-sections and examined (e.g.,
   under a scanning electron microscope ("SEM")).
            From analysis of the results of the experiments, optimum conditions, parameters, and
   variables were derived. A series of confirmation plating runs were carried out to confirm the
20 findings. Further details on the experiments carried out, and the results, are provided below.

   the plating process in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, which may
   utilize the following list of commercially available items.       Embodiments of the present

            (ii)        A desired amount of luminescent particles (taggant), surfactants, and other
   additives were added to the plating bath (the taggant was present in an amount of
   approximately 3 to 6 g/L).
            (iii)       The articles were weighed and counted.       A typical load for the plating
 5 barrel was between 150-450 g of articles.
            (iv)        The sonotrode was set to the required amplitude and timed for pre
   sonication of the plating bath.
            (v)         Cutting oil was removed from the articles with a caustic-based cleaner.
   The cleaner was heated to approximately 600C. The articles and cleaner were and loaded
10 into a receptacle. The receptacle was loaded into an offline tumbler and rotated at a speed
   of approximately 10 rpm for 10 minutes.
            (vi)        The cleaner was removed from the articles with demineralised water.
            (vii)       The surfaces of the articles were activated with sulphuric acid. The acid
   was heated to approximately 500C.          The articles and the acid were and loaded into a
15 receptacle. The receptacle was loaded into an offline tumbler and rotated at a speed of
   approximately 10 rpm for 5 minutes.
            (viii)The acid was removed from the articles with demineralised water.
            (ix)        The articles were loaded into the plating barrel, attached to the plating rig
   and submerged in the electrolyte (plating bath).
20          (x)         The sonotrode was set to the required amplitude for plating.
            (xi)        The required current was set by manipulation of the rectifier current output
   and a resulting voltage was applied across the articles.
            (xii)       A number of standard analytical methods were performed to ensure that
   respective solute concentrations in the electrolyte (plating bath) were within the desired
25 specification limits (e.g., see Table 2).
            (xiii) pH was measured with the Mettler Toledo pH probe and controlled with chemical
   additions specific to the plating bath chemistry.
            (xiv)       After the required residence time was reached, the current was stopped,
   and the plating barrel removed from the rig and rinsed in demineralised water.
30          (xv)        The rinsed plated articles were towel dried, placed onto a metal tray and
   dried at approximately 1200C until all water was removed.
            (xvi)       The plated articles were allowed to cool and then re-weighed to determine
   the change in mass.

           (xviii)     Luminescent signal amplitude was determined using the measurement
   device from a sample of the 25 plated articles.
           (xix)      Three quarters of the plated articles were annealed using a Belt Furnace
   with a reducing atmosphere and a maximum furnace temperature of approximately 8500C.
 5         (xx)        Luminescent signal amplitude was determined on a sample of the 25
   annealed and plated articles using the measurement device; the signal results were again
   recorded on the lab data sheet.
           (xxi)      Two thirds of the annealed and plated articles were loaded into a
   receptacle with a 1:1 mass ratio of stainless steel media.
10         (xxii)     Additions of approximately 25 ml of demineralised water and approximately
   0.5 ml of acid soap was added to the receptacle which was run for approximately 15 minutes
   at 10 rpm in the tumbler to simulate a finishing procedure on surfaces of the annealed and
   plated articles.
           (xxiii)     Luminescent   signal    amplitude  was   again   determined      using   the
15 measurement device from a sample of the finished articles.
           (xxiv)     Some of the finished articles were pressed with a pattern either on the
   production or trial Schuler press to strike a coin.
           (xxv)       Luminescent signal amplitudes were measured from a sample of the struck
   coins using the measurement device.

           A plurality of trial runs were carried out generally utilizing the foregoing method, each
   with varying factors, such as taggant (luminescent) particle size, the use of ultrasound before
 5 and/or during plating, electrochemical parameters such as current densities, and creating
   turbulence (e.g., stirring) in the plating solution. Each trial run was analysed after striking on
   a striking press (e.g., Schuler), luminescent signal measurements being taken before and
   after striking as a control.        The luminescent signal strength was measured using a
   measurement device. Details of some of the runs are outlined in Table 3.

             As has been discussed herein, the quality of the finish of the plated article can be a
     determining factor for which parameters and variables are to be implemented in
 5   embodiments of the present invention. The prior art has never determined what parameters
     and variables produce various finish qualities, whereas the inventors have done so. The
     Run Reference Nos. 1, 16, and 17 in Table 3 correspond to these Run Reference Nos. in
     Table 2. Table 3 provides examples of plated articles that had various finish qualities and
     luminescent signal strengths, and which parameters, variables, etc. produced such finish
10   qualities.  Quality of Finishes of plated articles were classified as "Very Poor," "Poor,"
     "Good," and "Excellent" quality of finishes.   For a comparison of these quality of finish
     determinations produced on plated articles, refer to Figures 5-8. Figure 5 shows a digital

            1. Discussion of Results
            a.   Particle Size Distribution
15          From an analysis of the results, luminescent particle size can have an influence on a
   number of properties of the resultant plated article.         Referring to Figure 2, the highest
   luminescent signal measurement from each particle size distribution was plotted against
   signal strength.     In this Figure, "particle size" on the x axis, and in the discussion below,
   indicates mean diameter, using SEM analysis. The y axis shows measured luminescent
20 signal strength (e.g., using an LED and filtered photodiode signal detector appropriately
   chosen for the phosphor used in the experiments). The "Small," "Medium," and "Large" size
   designations in Figure 2 are further described hereinafter. Note further that the Run number
   designations in Figure 2 also correspond to the Run Reference Nos. in Tables 2 and 3. The
   mean particle sizes in Figure 2 are in microns.
25          The results indicate that an increase in luminescent signal corresponds to an
   increase in the amount of particulate material (luminescent particles) co-deposited into an
   electroplated layer. Through SEM analysis of a variety of surfaces of the plated examples
   and the signal response of those surfaces, the highest particle populations also returned the
   largest signals.
30          b. Sonication of the Plating Solution During the Plating Process
            It was found that, at higher luminescent particle sizes (approximately >1 pm), the
   application of sonication (ultrasound treatment) of the plating bath decreased the
   luminescent signal received by the signal detector. This implies that the amount of co
   deposited luminescent particles decreases significantly with sonication during plating. For
35 example, at Large sizes of particles, approximately 1.0-5.0 pm, the sonication of the bath
                                                     37

    WO 2014/181127                                                                 PCT/GB2014/051431
   during plating decreased the signal to approximately 120 from an original signal of
   approximately 165 units magnitude (approximately a 30% decrease).
           The approximately 0.5-1.0 pm luminescent particle size range (Medium size)
   behaved in a similar manner to the larger particle sizes under sonication, showing a dramatic
 5 decrease to approximately 184 from an original signal of approximately 1262 units
   magnitude (approximately an 85% decrease) in the signal when compared to silent
   conditions. The Small size, approximately 0.2-0.5 pm, particles showed no change in
   luminescent signal with respect to any change in sonication parameters.
           As well as the luminescent signal strength, process considerations, such as
10 sedimentation and fouling rates, were also altered by sonication of the plating solution.
   These factors are further discussed below.
           Sonication of the plating solution was shown to inhibit the co-deposition of
   agglomerated luminescent particles within the plated metal matrix.                 If the colloid is
   sufficiently de-agglomerated at a pre-plating stage (before commencing the plating process),
15 few agglomerated luminescent particles were co-deposited under sonicated or silent (i.e., no
   sonication) plating conditions.
           c.    Effect of Pre-Plating Sonication of the Plating Solution
           For particles in the Small size range of approximately 0.2-0.5 pm, pre-plating
   sonication (before commencing the plating process) had no effect on the luminescent signal
20 strength.     For the largest particles, approximately 5-10 pm and 10+ pm, pre-plating
   sonication may have little effect on the luminescent signal strength.                   However, at
   approximately 0.5-1.0 pm, the pre-plating sonication may increase the resultant luminescent
   signal level from the metal plated layer.
           d. Sonication during the initial period of time after commencing the plating process
25         Figure 3 shows an image of a cross-section of an exemplary substrate (article)
   electroplated in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.
           In Figure 3, layer C denotes a portion of the substrate of the article, layer B denotes a
   portion of the initial luminescent-free layer of electroplated metal initially laid down during the
   plating process, and layer A denotes a portion of the electroplated layer having luminescent
30 particles dispersed therein.
           The extremely low luminescent particle content at the electroplate-substrate interface
   (which is inherent to any co-deposition process) may be significantly decreased when the
   ultrasound treatment (sonication) is applied for approximately the first 30 minutes of plating.
   This luminescent particle-free layer (layer B in Figure 3) has been observed to reach up to
35 approximately 2-4 pm in thickness.         However, with application of sonication, it can be
   reduced (e.g., approximately 1 pm). The benefit of the application of sonication is a greater
                                                    38

    WO 2014/181127                                                               PCT/GB2014/051431
   proportion of the plated layer with an ideal particle distribution and also a cost saving as less
   plate can be applied whilst still ensuring the same functional life-time expectations.
           e.   Physical Effect of Sonication on the Process
           Sonication provides energy for dispersing the solid particulates in a suspension
 5 throughout the liquid phase (medium) of the plating solution.         It was observed during the
   experiments that the suspension was much more uniform under sonicated conditions.
   Without the sonication, sedimentation of some of the solid particulates was observed in all
   low energy areas of the plating baths.
           From the results it was observed that, without sonication, a relatively poor
10 suspension and high rates of sedimentation for all particle sizes greater than approximately
   1 pm was observed.          At particle sizes less than approximately 1 pm, a reasonable
   suspension was possible, but this was always observed to be enhanced by sonication of the
   plating bath.
           The pre-sonication of the plating bath (i.e., prior to commencing plating) proved to be
15 the most effective. The best suspensions were formed at all particle sizes when the plating
   bath was sonicated (e.g., for approximately 5 hours) prior to plating as well as through the
   plating process (although this did not necessarily give the best signal strength in the final
   plated article).
           Sonication performed solely during the plating process (i.e.,             no pre-plating
20 sonication) did      produce a reasonable suspension at particle sizes greater than
   approximately 1 pm, and a good suspension at particle sizes less than approximately 1 pm.
           However, in all cases except the smallest (e.g., approximately 0.2-0.5 pm) particles,
   pre-sonication is more effective. This may be attributed to the fact that, while the plating
   solution remains un-agitated prior to plating, agglomerates of the luminescent particles are
25 formed, which require more energy to dissociate than can be provided by solely providing
   sonication during the plating process.
           The discrepancy at the smallest particle range (e.g., approximately 0.2-0.5 pm) has
   been attributed to an intrinsic property of all small particles (agglomerations are
   thermodynamically favorable as surface area and thus free energy are reduced). With the
30 smallest particles trialed, this effect was exaggerated to the point where, without sonication
   during the trial, larger agglomerates immediately formed.
           In all cases, sonication improved the condition of the plating bath (i.e., there was
   significantly less fouling of the pipework and plating bath and sedimentation with plating
   processes in which sonication was performed). Any sediment that did form during sonicated
35 runs was easily removed with a jet of demineralised water. Sediment formed much more
   rapidly when the plating bath remained silent (no sonication), and the sediment formed a
                                                   39

    WO 2014/181127                                                                PCT/GB2014/051431
   clay-like texture that was extremely difficult to fully remove. Sonication prior and throughout
   the plating process provided the best process conditions, but it was observed the pre-plating
   sonication was a more significant factor in preventing fouling, as most sediment is formed
   prior to plating while the plating bath is idle. The fouling and sedimentation has a negative
 5 effect on heat exchanger, pump, and filter efficiency.
            f.   Current Density
            It was found that for the plating process, a very effective current density lay within the
   region of 0.3-1.0 A/dM 2 .      This takes into account both composite formation and matrix
   plating conditions.     The current density used takes into account standard electroplating
10 problems such as the throwing power (the ability of a plating solution to produce a relatively
   uniform distribution of metal upon a cathode of irregular shape). For this reason, the current
   density significantly depends on the geometry of the plated substrate (article).
            g. Turbulence
            During the experiments, turbulence in the plating bath was introduced (e.g., mixing
15 using a stirrer and eductor system).        The angular velocity of the stirrer, diameter of the
   stirrer, and the bath geometry affect the level of turbulence in the bath. It was found that the
   lower the revolutions per minute ("rpm") of the stirrer impeller, the higher the rate of
   sedimentation in the plating bath and the lower concentration of particulate matter in the bulk
   liquid phase. This worse suspension led to lower co-deposition levels and the previously
20 mentioned process problems related to fouling.
            Running the stirrer at a reasonable speed (e.g., less than the speed (critical angular
   velocity) where vortexes are formed), provided adequate stirring and maximum levels of co
   deposition of the luminescent and metal particles in the plated layer. Increasing the stirrer
   speed beyond this critical angular velocity did not provide a measurably better suspension or
25 increase the levels of co-deposition.
            During the electroplating trials where the angular velocity of the stirrer was increased
   to give extremely high levels of turbulence, it was observed that - although a good
   suspension was present - the rates of co-deposition were low.             It is believed that over
   agitation (e.g., angular velocity at a speed greater than where vortexes are formed in the
30 plating bath) of the suspension removes the luminescent particles from the substrate surface
   being plated during the loose adsorption step of the co-deposition process. It is believed
   that this phenomenon was analogous to the decrease in levels of co-deposition seen in the
   electroplating trials where the plating bath was sonicated during plating.
            Agitation of the plating bath helped to provide a better suspension, but sedimentation
35 still occurred at a lower rate at all the stirrer speeds trialed. Once a sedimentation layer has
   been formed, the turbulence of the plating bath could not provide the energy required to re
                                                      40

     WO 2014/181127                                                             PCT/GB2014/051431
   disperse the particulate matter.        Sonication of the plating bath helps to break up the
   sediment layer and helps prevent its formation.
            Reasonable levels of agitation (e.g., below the critical angular velocity) combined
   with sonication provided better process conditions.          The sonication de-agglomerates the
 5 particles in the plating solution (making their effective particle diameter smaller and thus
   having a lower sedimentation rate) as well as breaking up any sediment. The mechanical
   agitation combined with the sonication provides the energy to disperse these particles and
   keep the plating bath in a good colloidal suspension.
            h. Electrochemical Parameters
10          Different current densities were used during the electroplating trials, ranging from
   approximately 0.3-1.0 A/diM2 . The effect of current density on incorporation of particles was
   obfuscated by the significant change in throwing power.
            The average plate thickness was measured from a random sample of 25 articles
   plated in the experiment. From this data, it was clear that the volume of co-deposited matter
15 did not significantly alter the plate thickness.
            The pre- and post-plating masses of the articles were recorded.            The cathode
   efficiency determined using Faraday's law by comparison to ideal plating constants. It was
   determined that the presence of particulate matter had a negligible effect on the cathode
   efficiency.
20          i.   Quality of Final Product
            With respect to the production of coinage, the quality of the resultant electroplated
   finish on a coin that has been struck (i.e., stamped or patterned with the coin's final design)
   may be the ultimate determining factor for which electroplating parameters achieve a quality
   of finish on the surface of a struck coin that is acceptable for use in public commerce. Note,
25 however, that the following discussion with respect to finish quality is not limited to the
   production of coinage, but may apply to any plated article where the quality of the finish of
   the surface is important to utilization of the plated article.
            The quality of the surface of a struck coin after being plated in accordance with
   embodiments of the present invention was observed to be a function of many of the
30 variables. The luminescent particle size gave a very significant contribution to the plate
   quality and the resultant finish.        Particles larger than approximately 5 pm seemed to
   decrease the quality of the surface finish, as can be seen in Figure 4. In Figure 4, the white
   arrows are pointing to some of the pitting on the surface of the plated article.
            The highest quality plated articles were made with the smallest luminescent particle
35 size (approximately 0.2-0.5 pm).          The plated articles from the particle size range of
   approximately 0.5-1.0 pm were also very good.
                                                     41

    WO 2014/181127                                                               PCT/GB2014/051431
           Any agglomerates present gave a dramatic decrease in the surface quality of the
   finished plated article. As the agglomerates are embedded in the electroplated surface, they
   can break up causing pits on the surface of the finished plated article as shown in Figure 4.
   This process may occur due to the fact that the particle-particle adhesion in agglomerates is
 5 very weak. In contrast, singular luminescent particles incorporated in the plated layer are
   held in place mechanically by the grain structure of the plated metal matrix, which makes for
   a stronger composite product with a superior surface finish.             Therefore, smaller de
   agglomerated particles are desired from a quality of finish perspective.
           2.   Conclusions
10         a.   Particle Size
           A Medium luminescent particle size distribution of approximately 0.5 to 1.0 pm may
   produce an excellent quality of finish article (e.g., see Figure 8) with high luminescent signal
   output under the correct process conditions. A good quality of finish on plated articles may
   be obtained with particles having a size of approximately 0.2 to 5.0 pm (e.g., see Figure 7).
15         Luminescent particles above approximately 10.0 pm are not easily incorporated into
   the electrodeposited layer at the plate thicknesses trialed.
           Luminescent particles above approximately 5.0 pm may produce a product with
   surface pitting (e.g., see Figure 4).
           The smaller the luminescent particle size, the more readily a good suspension is
20 formed of the particles in a plating bath.
           The smaller the particle size, the more susceptible the luminescent particles are to
   agglomerating.
           Luminescent particles in the approximately 0.2-0.5 pm range spontaneously form
   agglomerations.
25         b. Sonication
           Optimum sonication conditions were deduced. Excellent results were obtained when
   the plating bath was sonicated prior to initiating the plating process (e.g., for approximately 5
   hours) and for the first minutes (e.g., 30) of plating. Other conclusions relating to sonication
   are outlined below.
30         Sonication aids the formation of a homogenous colloidal suspension of the particles
   in the plating bath.
           Sonication of the plating bath during the first minutes (e.g., 30-60) of plating
   significantly reduces the thickness of the luminescent particle-free nucleation zone (e.g.,
   layer B in Figure 3).
                                                   42

    WO 2014/181127                                                              PCT/GB2014/051431
           Pre-sonication (e.g., for approximately 5 hours) significantly reduces the fouling of
   the plating process instruments and sedimentation (e.g., at the bottom of the plating vessel)
   that occurs during the plating process.
           Sonication (e.g., for approximately 5 hours) before plating as well as during plating
 5 can be used to produce good colloidal suspensions from systems that, under silent
   conditions, would not form a stable suspension.
           Sonication during the plating process inhibits the inclusion of luminescent particles
   into the metal matrix being plated on the article.
           Sonication during the plating process is not as effective as pre-sonication (e.g.,
10 approximately 5 hours) at keeping a stable suspension. This was observed for all particle
   sizes, except for particles in the approximately 0.2-0.5 pm range.
           c.   Turbulence
           With respect to agitation (degree of turbulence), very good conditions for the process
   were found to be a stirrer (e.g., overhead type) set to an rpm that stirred the plating bath just
15 below the critical angular velocity for producing a vortex (which may be combined with a
   recirculation stream for the low energy areas).       Mechanical bath agitation combined with
   sonication provided excellent process conditions. Other conclusions are summarised below.
           The higher the degree of turbulence, the lower the rate of sedimentation in the plating
   bath, and the higher the concentration of luminescent particulate matter in the plating
20 solution.
           Increasing turbulence increased the degree of co-deposition of luminescent particles
   up to a critical point. Beyond the critical point, the degree of co-deposition did not increase,
   and in fact decreased at extremely high levels of turbulence.
           If a layer of sedimentation is formed, turbulence alone cannot return the particulate
25 matter into suspension.
           Reasonable levels of turbulence combined with sonication provided an excellent
   suspension.
           d. Electrochemical Parameters
           Any change in cathode efficiency caused by the presence of particulate matter within
30 the plating solution was immeasurable and therefore insignificant.
           Particulate material could be co-deposited from each of the current densities trialed.
           There was no measurable change in plate thickness between a composite and pure
   metal product.

 5 The present inventors also have carried out an alternative plating process that uses a high
   shear pump instead of ultrasound.      In this alternative plating process, the plating solution,
   during plating, was diverted from the plating bath, passed through a high shear centrifugal
   pump, then re-circulated to the plating bath.
   The experimental setup of the equipment is the same as for Example 1 except the
10 recirculation pump has been replaced by a high shear pump and the sonotrode is not used.
   An example of the equipment can be seen in Figure 12.
   Figure 12 illustrates schematically an apparatus 1200 that may be used for carrying out the
   plating process. The apparatus 1200 includes a receptacle 1201 for retaining the plating
15 solution, a tumbler (e.g. rotary) 1202 for tumbling the articles within the plating solution
   during plating process, an electrode 1203 that acts as a cathode during the plating process,
   this electrode extending into the barrel of the rotary tumbler, a power source 1204, a further
   electrode 1205 (e.g., in the form of a basket), which acts as an anode during the plating
   process, a temperature transmitter ("TT") device 1206 for temperature measurement (e.g. at
20 pt1OO sensor) which is linked via a connector 1208 to a temperature controller ("TC") device
   1207, a stirrer 1209, a high shear pump 1210 that circulates plating solution (for example
   around a conduit 1211 and valve 1212, which maybe a pneumatic valve).
   The de-agglomeration chamber can be either set up as a rotor stator or as a simple impeller;
25 the results below are using a rotor stator. The plating parameters were very similar to those
   mentioned above for the technique that used ultrasound (Example 1), so they will not be
   further described here.    In the following, we describe the use of the high shear pump
   apparatus, and the parameters employed. The high shear inlet pipe is connected directly to
   the outlet on the side of the tank the return leg is fed over the side of the tank. The high
30 shear pump was operated with a tip speed (circumferential speed of impeller) of 25m/s and
   at a bath turnover rate of 7.5 bath volume/hr. The high shear pump is used continuously
   during plating runs to ensure maximum de-agglomeration. The results in Figure 13 show a
   comparison trial which compares ultrasonic de-agglomeration prior to plating (not during
   plating as it negatively affects incorporation) with high shear de-agglomeration during
35 plating. Figure 13 shows a comparison of percentage incorporation under high shear (HS)
   and standard (std) run conditions (i.e. without high shear)
                                                   44

  It can be clearly seen in Figure 13 that the volume per cent of the deposit occupied with
  taggant increased under the high shear treatment. Under the standard run conditions, the
  mean volume percentage of incorporation was determined to be 0.37%vol. While using the
  high shear setup, the mean volume percentage of incorporation was determined to be
5 1.57%vol.
