                                         BACKGROUND
1.       Field
[0002]           This disclosure relates generally to context-aware computing, and more
specifically, to identifying and providing suggested contact information and event
information to users.
2.       Description of Art
[0003]           Modem electronic devices allow users to be more connected than ever to
friends, colleagues and activities. However, managing contacts and calendar events on
electronic devices can be burdensome. For example, adding or updating a contact or calendar
event typically requires several manual steps. As a result, many users neglect to maintain
their address books and calendars, choosing instead to rely on an inefficient search of stored
messages and other content on their devices when they need to locate information on people
or events. This can create a frustrating user experience and lead to a loss in productivity.

                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0035]         In the following description of the disclosure and embodiments, reference is
made to the accompanying drawings in which it is shown by way of illustration specific
embodiments that can be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments and
examples can be practiced and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the
disclosure.
[0036]         As noted above, managing contacts and calendar events on an electronic
device can be burdensome to a user because adding or updating contacts and calendar events
requires several manual steps that adds up over time. Because of this, many users simply
neglect to keep their address books and calendars up to date, which costs them time later
when they need to manually search their device for particular contact or event information.
This can lead to a frustrating user experience and loss in productivity.

    WO 2015/184163                                                           PCT/US2015/033023
[0037]           The present disclosure addresses this problem by providing an electronic
device that automatically suggests contacts and calendar events for users based on their
messages. The device can analyze a user's messages for contact and event information and
automatically generate or update suggested contacts and calendar events for the user based on
this information. The suggested contacts and calendar events can be searchable as if they
were manually entered by the user, and the user can choose to add or ignore the suggested
contacts and calendar events. In this manner, a user's contacts and calendar events can be
maintained with no or minimal effort on the user's part, which can save the user time,
enhance productivity and produce a more efficient human-machine interface.
1.        EXEMPLARY DEVICES
[0038]           Below, FIGS. 1A-IB, 2, and 3 provide a description of exemplary devices for
performing the techniques for suggesting contact and event information. FIGS. 4A-4B and
6A-6G illustrate exemplary user interfaces for suggesting contact and event information. The
user interfaces in the FIGS. are also used to illustrate the processes described below,
including the processes in FIGS. 7A-13.
[0039]           Although the following description uses terms "first," "second," etc. to
describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by the terms. These terms are
only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first touch could be
termed a second touch, and, similarly, a second touch could be termed a first touch, without
departing from the scope of the various described embodiments. The first touch and the
second touch are both touches, but they are not the same touch.
[0040]           The terminology used in the description of the various described embodiments
herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be
limiting. As used in the description of the various described embodiments and the appended
claims, the singular forms "a", "an," and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as
well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term
"and/or" as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one
or more of the associated listed items. It will be further understood that the terms "includes,"
"including," "comprises," and/or "comprising," when used in this specification, specify the
presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do
not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps,
operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.
[0041]           The term "if' may be construed to mean "when" or "upon" or "in response to
determining" or "in response to detecting," depending on the context. Similarly, the phrase
"if it is determined" or "if [a stated condition or event] is detected" may be construed to mean
                                                 -5-

    WO 2015/184163                                                           PCT/US2015/033023
"upon determining" or "in response to determining" or "upon detecting [the stated condition
or event]" or "in response to detecting [the stated condition or event]," depending on the
context.
[0042]          Embodiments of electronic devices, user interfaces for such devices, and
associated processes for using such devices are described. In some embodiments, the device
is a portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also contains other
functions, such as PDA and/or music player functions. Exemplary embodiments of portable
multifunction devices include, without limitation, the iPhone®, iPod Touch@, and iPad@
devices from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California. Other portable electronic devices, such as
laptops or tablet computers with touch-sensitive surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays and/or
touchpads), are, optionally, used. It should also be understood that, in some embodiments,
the device is not a portable communications device, but is a desktop computer with a touch
sensitive surface (e.g., a touch screen display and/or a touchpad).
[0043]          In the discussion that follows, an electronic device that includes a display and
a touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however, that the electronic
device optionally includes one or more other physical user-interface devices, such as a
physical keyboard, a mouse, and/or a joystick.
[0044]          The device may support a variety of applications, such as one or more of the
following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word processing application, a
website creation application, a disk authoring application, a spreadsheet application, a gaming
application, a telephone application, a video conferencing application, an e-mail application,
an instant messaging application, a workout support application, a photo management
application, a digital camera application, a digital video camera application, a web browsing
application, a digital music player application, and/or a digital video player application.
[0045]          The various applications that are executed on the device optionally use at least
one common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface. One or more
functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information displayed on the
device are, optionally, adjusted and/or varied from one application to the next and/or within a
respective application. In this way, a common physical architecture (such as the touch
sensitive surface) of the device optionally supports the variety of applications with user
interfaces that are intuitive and transparent to the user.
[0046]          Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable devices with touch
sensitive displays. FIG. 1A is a block diagram illustrating portable multifunction device 100
with touch-sensitive display system 112 in accordance with some embodiments. Touch
sensitive display 112 is sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience and is sometimes
                                                 -6-

    WO 2015/184163                                                             PCT/US2015/033023
known as or called a "touch-sensitive display system." Device 100 includes memory 102
(which optionally includes one or more computer-readable storage mediums), memory
controller 122, one or more processing units (CPUs) 120, peripherals interface 118, RF
circuitry 108, audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, microphone 113, input/output (1/0) subsystem
106, other input control devices 116, and external port 124. Device 100 optionally includes
one or more optical sensors 164. Device 100 optionally includes one or more contact
intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of contacts on device 100 (e.g., a touch-sensitive
surface such as touch-sensitive display system 112 of device 100). Device 100 optionally
includes one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating tactile outputs on device
100 (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive
display system 112 of device 100 or touchpad 355 of device 300). These components
optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines 103.
[0047]          As used in the specification and claims, the term "intensity" of a contact on a
touch-sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a contact (e.g., a
finger contact) on the touch-sensitive surface, or to a substitute (proxy) for the force or
pressure of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface. The intensity of a contact has a range of
values that includes at least four distinct values and more typically includes hundreds of
distinct values (e.g., at least 256). Intensity of a contact is, optionally, determined (or
measured) using various approaches and various sensors or combinations of sensors. For
example, one or more force sensors underneath or adjacent to the touch-sensitive surface are,
optionally, used to measure force at various points on the touch-sensitive surface. In some
implementations, force measurements from multiple force sensors are combined (e.g., a
weighted average) to determine an estimated force of a contact. Similarly, a pressure
sensitive tip of a stylus is, optionally, used to determine a pressure of the stylus on the touch
sensitive surface. Alternatively, the size of the contact area detected on the touch-sensitive
surface and/or changes thereto, the capacitance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the
contact and/or changes thereto, and/or the resistance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate
to the contact and/or changes thereto are, optionally, used as a substitute for the force or
pressure of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, the
substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are used directly to determine whether
an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is described in units
corresponding to the substitute measurements). In some implementations, the substitute
measurements for contact force or pressure are converted to an estimated force or pressure,
and the estimated force or pressure is used to determine whether an intensity threshold has
been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is a pressure threshold measured in units of
                                                  -7-

    WO 2015/184163                                                             PCT/US2015/033023
pressure). Using the intensity of a contact as an attribute of a user input allows for user
access to additional device functionality that may otherwise not be accessible by the user on a
reduced-size device with limited real estate for displaying affordances (e.g., on a touch
sensitive display) and/or receiving user input (e.g., via a touch-sensitive display, a touch
sensitive surface, or a physical/mechanical control such as a knob or a button).
[0048]          As used in the specification and claims, the term "tactile output" refers to
physical displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical
displacement of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to another
component (e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the component relative to a center
of mass of the device that will be detected by a user with the user's sense of touch. For
example, in situations where the device or the component of the device is in contact with a
surface of a user that is sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm, or other part of a user's hand),
the tactile output generated by the physical displacement will be interpreted by the user as a
tactile sensation corresponding to a perceived change in physical characteristics of the device
or the component of the device. For example, movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a
touch-sensitive display or trackpad) is, optionally, interpreted by the user as a "down click" or
"up click" of a physical actuator button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation
such as an "down click" or "up click" even when there is no movement of a physical actuator
button associated with the touch-sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced)
by the user's movements. As another example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is,
optionally, interpreted or sensed by the user as "roughness" of the touch-sensitive surface,
even when there is no change in smoothness of the touch-sensitive surface. While such
interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to the individualized sensory perceptions of
the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch that are common to a large majority of
users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as corresponding to a particular sensory
perception of a user (e.g., an "up click," a "down click," "roughness"), unless otherwise
stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical displacement of the device or a
component thereof that will generate the described sensory perception for a typical (or
average) user.
[0049]          It should be appreciated that device 100 is only one example of a portable
multifunction device, and that device 100 optionally has more or fewer components than
shown, optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has a different
configuration or arrangement of the components. The various components shown in FIG. 1A
are implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both hardware and software,
including one or more signal processing and/or application-specific integrated circuits.

[0050]          Memory 102 may include one or more computer readable storage mediums.
The computer readable storage mediums may be tangible and non-transitory. Memory 102
may include high-speed random access memory and may also include non-volatile memory,
such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non
volatile solid-state memory devices. Memory controller 122 may control access to memory
102 by other components of device 100.
[0051]          Peripherals interface 118 can be used to couple input and output peripherals of
the device to CPU 120 and memory 102. The one or more processors 120 run or execute
various software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in memory 102 to perform
various functions for device 100 and to process data. In some embodiments, peripherals
interface 118, CPU 120, and memory controller 122 may be implemented on a single chip,
such as chip 104. In some other embodiments, they may be implemented on separate chips.
[0052]          RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also called
electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from electromagnetic
signals and communicates with communications networks and other communications devices
via the electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 optionally includes well-known circuitry for
performing these functions, including but not limited to an antenna system, an RF transceiver,
one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one or more oscillators, a digital signal processor, a CODEC
chipset, a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, memory, and so forth. RF circuitry 108
optionally communicates with networks, such as the Internet, also referred to as the World
Wide Web (WWW), an intranet and/or a wireless network, such as a cellular telephone
network, a wireless local area network (LAN) and/or a metropolitan area network (MAN),
and other devices by wireless communication. The RF circuitry 108 optionally includes well
known circuitry for detecting near field communication (NFC) fields, such as by a short
range communication radio. The wireless communication optionally uses any of a plurality
of communications standards, protocols, and technologies, including but not limited to Global
System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE),
high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), high-speed uplink packet access (HSUPA),

[0053]            Audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, and microphone 113 provide an audio
interface between a user and device 100. Audio circuitry 110 receives audio data from
peripherals interface 118, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and transmits the
electrical signal to speaker 111. Speaker 111 converts the electrical signal to human-audible
sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 also receives electrical signals converted by microphone
113 from sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 converts the electrical signal to audio data and
transmits the audio data to peripherals interface 118 for processing. Audio data may be
retrieved from and/or transmitted to memory 102 and/or RF circuitry 108 by peripherals
interface 118. In some embodiments, audio circuitry 110 also includes a headset jack (e.g.,
212, FIG. 2). The headset jack provides an interface between audio circuitry 110 and
removable audio input/output peripherals, such as output-only headphones or a headset with
both output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears) and input (e.g., a microphone).
[0054]            1/0 subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100, such as
touch screen 112 and other input control devices 116, to peripherals interface 118. 1/0
subsystem 106 optionally includes display controller 156, optical sensor controller 158,
intensity sensor controller 159, haptic feedback controller 161, and one or more input
controllers 160 for other input or control devices. The one or more input controllers 160
receive/send electrical signals from/to other input control devices 116. The other input
control devices 116 optionally include physical buttons (e.g., push buttons, rocker buttons,
etc.), dials, slider switches, joysticks, click wheels, and so forth. In some alternate
embodiments, input controller(s) 160 are, optionally, coupled to any (or none) of the
following: a keyboard, an infrared port, a USB port, and a pointer device such as a mouse.
The one or more buttons (e.g., 208, FIG. 2) optionally include an up/down button for volume
control of speaker 111 and/or microphone 113. The one or more buttons optionally include a
push button (e.g., 206, FIG. 2).
[0055]            A quick press of the push button may disengage a lock of touch screen 112 or
begin a process that uses gestures on the touch screen to unlock the device, as described in
U.S. Patent Application 11/322,549, "Unlocking a Device by Performing Gestures on an
Unlock Image," filed December 23, 2005, U.S. Pat. No. 7,657,849, which is hereby
incorporated by reference in its entirety. A longer press of the push button (e.g., 206) may
turn power to device 100 on or off. The user may be able to customize a functionality of one

or more of the buttons. Touch screen 112 is used to implement virtual or soft buttons and one
or more soft keyboards.
[0056]          Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output interface
between the device and a user. Display controller 156 receives and/or sends electrical signals
from/to touch screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the user. The visual
output may include graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination thereof (collectively
termed "graphics"). In some embodiments, some or all of the visual output may correspond to
user-interface objects.
[0057]          Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor, or set of sensors that
accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen 112 and
display controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions in
memory 102) detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the contact) on touch screen
112 and convert the detected contact into interaction with user-interface objects (e.g., one or
more soft keys, icons, web pages, or images) that are displayed on touch screen 112. In an
exemplary embodiment, a point of contact between touch screen 112 and the user
corresponds to a finger of the user.
[0058]          Touch screen 112 may use LCD (liquid crystal display) technology, LPD
(light emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting diode) technology,
although other display technologies may be used in other embodiments. Touch screen 112
and display controller 156 may detect contact and any movement or breaking thereof using
any of a plurality of touch sensing technologies now known or later developed, including but
not limited to capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well
as other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of
contact with touch screen 112. In an exemplary embodiment, projected mutual capacitance
sensing technology is used, such as that found in the iPhone@ and iPod Touch@ from Apple
Inc. of Cupertino, California.
[0059]          A touch-sensitive display in some embodiments of touch screen 112 may be
analogous to the multi-touch sensitive touchpads described in the following U.S. Patents:
6,323,846 (Westerman et al.), 6,570,557 (Westerman et al.), and/or 6,677,932 (Westerman),
and/or U.S. Patent Publication 2002/0015024A1, each of which is hereby incorporated by
reference in its entirety. However, touch screen 112 displays visual output from device 100,
whereas touch sensitive touchpads do not provide visual output.

"Multi-Functional Hand-Held Device," filed March 3, 2006. All of these applications are
incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
[0061]           Touch screen 112 may have a video resolution in excess of 100 dpi. In some
embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately 160 dpi. The user
may make contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable object or appendage, such as a
stylus, a finger, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user interface is designed to work
primarily with finger-based contacts and gestures, which can be less precise than stylus-based
input due to the larger area of contact of a finger on the touch screen. In some embodiments,
the device translates the rough finger-based input into a precise pointer/cursor position or
command for performing the actions desired by the user.
[0062]           In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100 may include
a touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular functions. In some
embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch
screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad may be a touch-sensitive surface that is
separate from touch screen 112 or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed by the
touch screen.
[0063]           Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various
components. Power system 162 may include a power management system, one or more
power sources (e.g., battery, alternating current (AC)), a recharging system, a power failure
detection circuit, a power converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a light-emitting
diode (LED)) and any other components associated with the generation, management and
distribution of power in portable devices.
[0064]           Device 100 may also include one or more optical sensors 164. FIG. 1A shows
an optical sensor coupled to optical sensor controller 158 in 1/0 subsystem 106. Optical
sensor 164 may include charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide
                                                -12-

    WO 2015/184163                                                           PCT/US2015/033023
semiconductor (CMOS) phototransistors. Optical sensor 164 receives light from the
environment, projected through one or more lenses, and converts the light to data representing
an image. In conjunction with imaging module 143 (also called a camera module), optical
sensor 164 may capture still images or video. In some embodiments, an optical sensor is
located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112 on the front of the
device so that the touch screen display may be used as a viewfinder for still and/or video
image acquisition. In some embodiments, an optical sensor is located on the front of the
device so that the user's image may be obtained for video conferencing while the user views
the other video conference participants on the touch screen display. In some embodiments,
the position of optical sensor 164 can be changed by the user (e.g., by rotating the lens and
the sensor in the device housing) so that a single optical sensor 164 may be used along with
the touch screen display for both video conferencing and still and/or video image acquisition.
[0065]          Device 100 optionally also includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165.
FIG. 1A shows a contact intensity sensor coupled to intensity sensor controller 159 in 1/0
subsystem 106. Contact intensity sensor 165 optionally includes one or more piezoresistive
strain gauges, capacitive force sensors, electric force sensors, piezoelectric force sensors,
optical force sensors, capacitive touch-sensitive surfaces, or other intensity sensors (e.g.,
sensors used to measure the force (or pressure) of a contact on a touch-sensitive surface).
Contact intensity sensor 165 receives contact intensity information (e.g., pressure information
or a proxy for pressure information) from the environment. In some embodiments, at least
one contact intensity sensor is collocated with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface
(e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112). In some embodiments, at least one contact
intensity sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112,
which is located on the front of device 100.
[0066]          Device 100 may also include one or more proximity sensors 166. FIG. 1A
shows proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately, proximity
sensor 166 may be coupled to input controller 160 in 1/0 subsystem 106. Proximity sensor
166 may perform as described in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 11/241,839, "Proximity
Detector In Handheld Device"; 11/240,788, "Proximity Detector In Handheld Device";
11/620,702, "Using Ambient Light Sensor To Augment Proximity Sensor Output";

and 11/638,251, "Methods And Systems For Automatic Configuration Of Peripherals," which
are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In some embodiments, the proximity
sensor turns off and disables touch screen 112 when the multifunction device is placed near
the user's ear (e.g., when the user is making a phone call).

[0067]          Device 100 optionally also includes one or more tactile output generators 167.
FIG. 1A shows a tactile output generator coupled to haptic feedback controller 161 in 1/0
subsystem 106. Tactile output generator 167 optionally includes one or more electroacoustic
devices such as speakers or other audio components and/or electromechanical devices that
convert energy into linear motion such as a motor, solenoid, electroactive polymer,
piezoelectric actuator, electrostatic actuator, or other tactile output generating component
(e.g., a component that converts electrical signals into tactile outputs on the device). Contact
intensity sensor 165 receives tactile feedback generation instructions from haptic feedback
module 133 and generates tactile outputs on device 100 that are capable of being sensed by a
user of device 100. In some embodiments, at least one tactile output generator is collocated
with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112) and,
optionally, generates a tactile output by moving the touch-sensitive surface vertically (e.g.,
in/out of a surface of device 100) or laterally (e.g., back and forth in the same plane as a
surface of device 100). In some embodiments, at least one tactile output generator sensor is
located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112, which is located on the
front of device 100.
[0068]          Device 100 may also include one or more accelerometers 168. FIG. 1A shows
accelerometer 168 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately, accelerometer 168 may
be coupled to an input controller 160 in 1/0 subsystem 106. Accelerometer 168 may perform
as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050190059, "Acceleration-based Theft
Detection System for Portable Electronic Devices," and U.S. Patent Publication No.
20060017692, "Methods And Apparatuses For Operating A Portable Device Based On An
Accelerometer," both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In some
embodiments, information is displayed on the touch screen display in a portrait view or a
landscape view based on an analysis of data received from the one or more accelerometers.
Device 100 optionally includes, in addition to accelerometer(s) 168, a magnetometer (not
shown) and a GPS (or GLONASS or other global navigation system) receiver (not shown) for
obtaining information concerning the location and orientation (e.g., portrait or landscape) of
device 100.
[0069]          In some embodiments, the software components stored in memory 102 include
operating system 126, communication module (or set of instructions) 128, contact/motion
module (or set of instructions) 130, graphics module (or set of instructions) 132, text input
module (or set of instructions) 134, Global Positioning System (GPS) module (or set of
instructions) 135, and applications (or sets of instructions) 136. Furthermore, in some
embodiments, memory 102 (FIG. 1A) or 370 (FIG. 3) stores device/global internal state 157,
                                                -14-

    WO 2015/184163                                                            PCT/US2015/033023
as shown in FIGS. 1A and 3. Device/global internal state 157 includes one or more of: active
application state, indicating which applications, if any, are currently active; display state,
indicating what applications, views or other information occupy various regions of touch
screen display 112; sensor state, including information obtained from the device's various
sensors and input control devices 116; and location information concerning the device's
location and/or attitude.
[0070]           Operating system 126 (e.g., Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X, iOS,
WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various software
components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g., memory
management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and facilitates communication
between various hardware and software components.
[0071]          Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other devices over
one or more external ports 124 and also includes various software components for handling
data received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124. External port 124 (e.g., Universal
Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to other devices or
indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some embodiments, the
external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or similar to and/or
compatible with, the 30-pin connector used on iPod@ (trademark of Apple Inc.) devices.
[0072]          Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects contact with touch screen 112
(in conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch-sensitive devices (e.g., a
touchpad or physical click wheel). Contact/motion module 130 includes various software
components for performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as
determining if contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an
intensity of the contact (e.g., the force or pressure of the contact or a substitute for the force or
pressure of the contact), determining if there is movement of the contact and tracking the
movement across the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging
events), and determining if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a break
in contact). Contact/motion module 130 receives contact data from the touch-sensitive
surface. Determining movement of the point of contact, which is represented by a series of
contact data, optionally includes determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude and
direction), and/or an acceleration (a change in magnitude and/or direction) of the point of
contact. These operations are, optionally, applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts)
or to multiple simultaneous contacts (e.g., "multitouch"/multiple finger contacts). In some
embodiments, contact/motion module 130 and display controller 156 detect contact on a
touchpad.

    WO 2015/184163                                                          PCT/US2015/033023
[0073]          In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 uses a set of one or more
intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user (e.g., to
determine whether a user has "clicked" on an icon). In some embodiments, at least a subset
of the intensity thresholds are determined in accordance with software parameters (e.g., the
intensity thresholds are not determined by the activation thresholds of particular physical
actuators and can be adjusted without changing the physical hardware of device 100). For
example, a mouse "click" threshold of a trackpad or touch screen display can be set to any of
a large range of predefined threshold values without changing the trackpad or touch screen
display hardware. Additionally, in some implementations, a user of the device is provided
with software settings for adjusting one or more of the set of intensity thresholds (e.g., by
adjusting individual intensity thresholds and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity thresholds
at once with a system-level click "intensity" parameter).
[0074]          Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects a gesture input by a user.
Different gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns (e.g.,
different motions, timings, and/or intensities of detected contacts). Thus, a gesture is,
optionally, detected by detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger
tap gesture includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (liftoff)
event at the same position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g.,
at the position of an icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the
touch-sensitive surface includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or
more finger-dragging events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (liftoff)
event.
[0075]          Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for
rendering and displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including
components for changing the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation,
contrast, or other visual property) of graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the term
"graphics" includes any object that can be displayed to a user, including ,without limitation,
text, web pages, icons (such as user-interface objects including soft keys), digital images,
videos, animations, and the like.
[0076]          In some embodiments, graphics module 132 stores data representing graphics
to be used. Each graphic is, optionally, assigned a corresponding code. Graphics module 132
receives, from applications etc., one or more codes specifying graphics to be displayed along
with, if necessary, coordinate data and other graphic property data, and then generates screen
image data to output to display controller 156.

[0077]          Haptic feedback module 133 includes various software components for
generating instructions used by tactile output generator(s) 167 to produce tactile outputs at
one or more locations on device 100 in response to user interactions with device 100.
[0078]          Text input module 134, which may be a component of graphics module 132,
provides soft keyboards for entering text in various applications (e.g., contacts 137, e-mail
140, IM 141, browser 147, and any other application that needs text input).
[0079]          GPS module 135 determines the location of the device and provides this
information for use in various applications (e.g., to telephone 138 for use in location-based
dialing, to camera 143 as picture/video metadata, and to applications that provide location
based services such as weather widgets, local yellow page widgets, and map/navigation
widgets).

[0099]           Each of the above-identified modules and applications corresponds to a set of
executable instructions for performing one or more functions described above and the
methods described in this application (e.g., the computer-implemented methods and other
information processing methods described herein). These modules (e.g., sets of instructions)
need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures, or modules, and thus
various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise rearranged in various
embodiments. For example, video player module may be combined with music player
module into a single module (e.g., video and music player module 152, FIG. 1A). In some
embodiments, memory 102 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified
above. Furthermore, memory 102 may store additional modules and data structures not
described above.
[00100]          In some embodiments, device 100 is a device where operation of a predefined
set of functions on the device is performed exclusively through a touch screen and/or a
touchpad. By using a touch screen and/or a touchpad as the primary input control device for

operation of device 100, the number of physical input control devices (such as push buttons,
dials, and the like) on device 100 may be reduced.
[00101]          The predefined set of functions that are performed exclusively through a touch
screen and/or a touchpad optionally include navigation between user interfaces. In some
embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates device 100 to a main, home,
or root menu from any user interface that is displayed on device 100. In such embodiments, a
"menu button" is implemented using a touchpad. In some other embodiments, the menu
button is a physical push button or other physical input control device instead of a touchpad.
[00102]          FIG. lB is a block diagram illustrating exemplary components for event
handling in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 (FIG.
1A) or 370 (FIG. 3) includes event sorter 170 (e.g., in operating system 126) and a respective
application 136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137-151, 155, 380-390).
[00103]          Event sorter 170 receives event information and determines the application
136-1 and application view 191 of application 136-1 to which to deliver the event
information. Event sorter 170 includes event monitor 171 and event dispatcher module 174.
In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes application internal state 192, which
indicates the current application view(s) displayed on touch-sensitive display 112 when the
application is active or executing. In some embodiments, device/global internal state 157 is
used by event sorter 170 to determine which application(s) is(are) currently active, and
application internal state 192 is used by event sorter 170 to determine application views 191
to which to deliver event information.
[00104]          In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes additional
information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application 136-1
resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates information being displayed
or that is ready for display by application 136-1, a state queue for enabling the user to go back
to a prior state or view of application 136-1, and a redo/undo queue of previous actions taken
by the user.
[00105]          Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals interface 118.
Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch
sensitive display 112, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface 118 transmits
information it receives from 1/0 subsystem 106 or a sensor, such as proximity sensor 166,
accelerometer(s) 168, and/or microphone 113 (through audio circuitry 110). Information that
peripherals interface 118 receives from 1/0 subsystem 106 includes information from touch
sensitive display 112 or a touch-sensitive surface.

    WO 2015/184163                                                           PCT/US2015/033023
[00106]         In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the peripherals
interface 118 at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals interface 118 transmits
event information. In other embodiments, peripherals interface 118 transmits event
information only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a
predetermined noise threshold and/or for more than a predetermined duration). In some
embodiments, event sorter 170 also includes a hit view determination module 172 and/or an
active event recognizer determination module 173.
[00107]         Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for
determining where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views when touch
sensitive display 112 displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and other
elements that a user can see on the display.
[00108]         Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of
views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which
information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a
respective application) in which a touch is detected may correspond to programmatic levels
within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For example, the lowest level
view in which a touch is detected may be called the hit view, and the set of events that are
recognized as proper inputs may be determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the
initial touch that begins a touch-based gesture.
[00109]         Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to sub-events
of a touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized in a hierarchy,
hit view determination module 172 identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the hierarchy
which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level
view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (e.g., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub
events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is identified by the hit view
determination module 172, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same
touch or input source for which it was identified as the hit view.
[00110]         Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which view or
views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some
embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that only the hit
view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, active event
recognizer determination module 173 determines that all views that include the physical
location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that all actively
involved views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments,
                                               -23-

even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular
view, views higher in the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.
[00111]          Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an event
recognizer (e.g., event recognizer 180). In embodiments including active event recognizer
determination module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to an
event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination module 173. In some
embodiments, event dispatcher module 174 stores in an event queue the event information,
which is retrieved by a respective event receiver 182.
[00112]          In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170.
Alternatively, application 136-1 includes event sorter 170. In yet other embodiments, event
sorter 170 is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory 102, such as
contact/motion module 130.
[00113]          In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event handlers
190 and one or more application views 191, each of which includes instructions for handling
touch events that occur within a respective view of the application's user interface. Each
application view 191 of the application 136-1 includes one or more event recognizers 180.
Typically, a respective application view 191 includes a plurality of event recognizers 180. In
other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers 180 are part of a separate module, such
as a user interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object from which application 136-1
inherits methods and other properties. In some embodiments, a respective event handler 190
includes one or more of: data updater 176, object updater 177, GUI updater 178, and/or event
data 179 received from event sorter 170. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater
176, object updater 177, or GUI updater 178 to update the application internal state 192.
Alternatively, one or more of the application views 191 include one or more respective event
handlers 190. Also, in some embodiments, one or more of data updater 176, object updater
177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a respective application view 191.
[00114]          A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g., event data
179) from event sorter 170 and identifies an event from the event information. Event
recognizer 180 includes event receiver 182 and event comparator 184. In some embodiments,
event recognizer 180 also includes at least a subset of: metadata 183, and event delivery
instructions 188 (which may include sub-event delivery instructions).
[00115]          Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170. The
event information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch
movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional
information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a
                                               -24-

touch, the event information may also include speed and direction of the sub-event. In some
embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to another (e.g., from
a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the event information
includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also called device attitude)
of the device.
[00116]          Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined event or
sub-event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event, or
determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event
comparator 184 includes event definitions 186. Event definitions 186 contain definitions of
events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (187-1), event 2 (187
2), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event (187) include, for example,
touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one
example, the definition for event 1 (187-1) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double
tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, a first liftoff (touch end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch
(touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, and a second liftoff (touch
end) for a predetermined phase. In another example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a
dragging on a displayed object. The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on
the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch
sensitive display 112, and liftoff of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event
also includes information for one or more associated event handlers 190.
[00117]          In some embodiments, event definition 186 includes a definition of an event
for a respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator 184 performs
a hit test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event. For
example, in an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on touch
sensitive display 112, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display 112, event
comparator 184 performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is
associated with the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated with a respective
event handler 190, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine which
event handler 190 should be activated. For example, event comparator 184 selects an event
handler associated with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit test.
[00118]          In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event (187) also includes
delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been determined
whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event recognizer's
event type.

[00119]         When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of sub
events do not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective event
recognizer 180 enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it
disregards subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event
recognizers, if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process sub
events of an ongoing touch-based gesture.
[00120]         In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes metadata
183 with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery
system should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
how event recognizers may interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.
[00121]         In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates event
handler 190 associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are
recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 delivers event
information associated with the event to event handler 190. Activating an event handler 190
is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and
event handler 190 associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined process.
[00122]         In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub-event
delivery instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an
event handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the
event information and perform a predetermined process.
[00123]         In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used in
application 136-1. For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number used in
contacts module 137, or stores a video file used in video player module. In some
embodiments, object updater 177 creates and updates objects used in application 136-1. For
example, object updater 177 creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a
user-interface object. GUI updater 178 updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater 178
prepares display information and sends it to graphics module 132 for display on a touch
sensitive display.

[00124]           In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to data
updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments, data updater
176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single module of a respective
application 136-1 or application view 191. In other embodiments, they are included in two or
more software modules.
[00125]           It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event handling
of user touches on touch-sensitive displays also applies to other forms of user inputs to
operate multifunction devices 100 with input devices, not all of which are initiated on touch
screens. For example, mouse movement and mouse button presses, optionally coordinated
with single or multiple keyboard presses or holds; contact movements such as taps, drags,
scrolls, etc. on touchpads; pen stylus inputs; movement of the device; oral instructions;
detected eye movements; biometric inputs; and/or any combination thereof are optionally
utilized as inputs corresponding to sub-events which define an event to be recognized.
[00126]           FIG. 2 illustrates a portable multifunction device 100 having a touch screen
112 in accordance with some embodiments. The touch screen optionally displays one or
more graphics within user interface (UI) 200. In this embodiment, as well as others described
below, a user is enabled to select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture on the
graphics, for example, with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one
or more styluses 203 (not drawn to scale in the figure). In some embodiments, selection of
one or more graphics occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more graphics. In
some embodiments, the gesture optionally includes one or more taps, one or more swipes
(from left to right, right to left, upward and/or downward), and/or a rolling of a finger (from
right to left, left to right, upward and/or downward) that has made contact with device 100.
In some implementations or circumstances, inadvertent contact with a graphic does not select
the graphic. For example, a swipe gesture that sweeps over an application icon optionally
does not select the corresponding application when the gesture corresponding to selection is a
tap.
[00127]           Device 100 may also include one or more physical buttons, such as "home" or
menu button 204. As described previously, menu button 204 may be used to navigate to any
application 136 in a set of applications that may be executed on device 100. Alternatively, in
some embodiments, the menu button is implemented as a soft key in a GUI displayed on
touch screen 112.
[00128]           In some embodiments, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu button
204, push button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device, volume
adjustment button(s) 208, subscriber identity module (SIM) card slot 210, headset jack 212,

and docking/charging external port 124. Push button 206 is, optionally, used to turn the
power on/off on the device by depressing the button and holding the button in the depressed
state for a predefined time interval; to lock the device by depressing the button and releasing
the button before the predefined time interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock the device or
initiate an unlock process. In an alternative embodiment, device 100 also accepts verbal input
for activation or deactivation of some functions through microphone 113. Device 100 also,
optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of
contacts on touch screen 112 and/or one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating
tactile outputs for a user of device 100.
[00129]          FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a display
and a touch-sensitive surface in accordance with some embodiments. Device 300 need not be
portable. In some embodiments, device 300 is a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a
tablet computer, a multimedia player device, a navigation device, an educational device (such
as a child's learning toy), a gaming system, or a control device (e.g., a home or industrial
controller). Device 300 typically includes one or more processing units (CPUs) 310, one or
more network or other communications interfaces 360, memory 370, and one or more
communication buses 320 for interconnecting these components. Communication buses 320
optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls
communications between system components. Device 300 includes input/output (1/0)
interface 330 comprising display 340, which is typically a touch screen display. 1/0 interface
330 also optionally includes a keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 350 and
touchpad 355, tactile output generator 357 for generating tactile outputs on device 300 (e.g.,
similar to tactile output generator(s) 167 described above with reference to FIG. 1A), sensors
359 (e.g., optical, acceleration, proximity, touch-sensitive, and/or contact intensity sensors
similar to contact intensity sensor(s) 165 described above with reference to FIG. 1A).
Memory 370 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR
RAM, or other random access solid state memory devices; and optionally includes non
volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage
devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory 370
optionally includes one or more storage devices remotely located from CPU(s) 310. In some
embodiments, memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures analogous to the
programs, modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of portable multifunction
device 100 (FIG. 1A), or a subset thereof. Furthermore, memory 370 optionally stores
additional programs, modules, and data structures not present in memory 102 of portable
multifunction device 100. For example, memory 370 of device 300 optionally stores drawing
                                                -28-

module 380, presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation module
386, disk authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102 of
portable multifunction device 100 (FIG. 1A) optionally does not store these modules.
[00130]         Each of the above-identified elements in FIG. 3 may be stored in one or more
of the previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above-identified modules
corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above. The above
identified modules or programs (e.g., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as
separate software programs, procedures, or modules, and thus various subsets of these
modules may be combined or otherwise rearranged in various embodiments. In some
embodiments, memory 370 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified
above. Furthermore, memory 370 may store additional modules and data structures not
described above.
[00131]         Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces that may be
implemented on, for example, portable multifunction device 100.
[00132]         FIG. 4A illustrates an exemplary user interface for a menu of applications on
portable multifunction device 100 in accordance with some embodiments. Similar user
interfaces may be implemented on device 300. In some embodiments, user interface 400
includes the following elements, or a subset or superset thereof:
     e   Signal strength indicator(s) 402 for wireless communication(s), such as cellular and
        Wi-Fi signals;
     e  Time 404;
     e  Bluetooth indicator 405;
     e  Battery status indicator 406;
     e  Tray 408 with icons for frequently used applications, such as:
            o   Icon 416 for telephone module 138, labeled "Phone," which optionally
                includes an indicator 414 of the number of missed calls or voicemail
                messages;
            o   Icon 418 for e-mail client module 140, labeled "Mail," which optionally
                includes an indicator 410 of the number of unread e-mails;

            o   Icon 422 for video and music player module 152, also referred to as iPod
                 (trademark of Apple Inc.) module 152, labeled "iPod;" and
     e  Icons for other applications, such as:
            o   Icon 424 for IM module 141, labeled "Messages;"
            o   Icon 426 for calendar module 148, labeled "Calendar;"

             o  Icon 428 for image management module 144, labeled "Photos;"

             o  Icon 446 for a settings application or module, labeled "Settings," which
                provides access to settings for device 100 and its various applications 136.
[00133]         It should be noted that the icon labels illustrated in FIG. 4A are merely
exemplary. For example, icon 422 for video and music player module 152 may optionally be
labeled "Music" or "Music Player." Other labels are, optionally, used for various application
icons. In some embodiments, a label for a respective application icon includes a name of an
application corresponding to the respective application icon. In some embodiments, a label
for a particular application icon is distinct from a name of an application corresponding to the
particular application icon.
[00134]         FIG. 4B illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device 300,
FIG. 3) with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, FIG. 3) that is
separate from the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Device 300 also, optionally,
includes one or more contact intensity sensors (e.g., one or more of sensors 357) for detecting
intensity of contacts on touch-sensitive surface 451 and/or one or more tactile output
generators 359 for generating tactile outputs for a user of device 300.
[00135]         Although some of the examples which follow will be given with reference to
inputs on touch screen display 112 (where the touch-sensitive surface and the display are
combined), in some embodiments, the device detects inputs on a touch-sensitive surface that
is separate from the display, as shown in FIG. 4B. In some embodiments, the touch-sensitive
surface (e.g., 451 in FIG. 4B) has a primary axis (e.g., 452 in FIG. 4B) that corresponds to a
primary axis (e.g., 453 in FIG. 4B) on the display (e.g., 450). In accordance with these
embodiments, the device detects contacts (e.g., 460 and 462 in FIG. 4B) with the touch
sensitive surface 451 at locations that correspond to respective locations on the display (e.g.,
in FIG. 4B, 460 corresponds to 468 and 462 corresponds to 470). In this way, user inputs
(e.g., contacts 460 and 462, and movements thereof) detected by the device on the touch
sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in FIG. 4B) are used by the device to manipulate the user interface
                                                 -30-

    WO 2015/184163                                                            PCT/US2015/033023
on the display (e.g., 450 in FIG. 4B) of the multifunction device when the touch-sensitive
surface is separate from the display. It should be understood that similar methods are,
optionally, used for other user interfaces described herein.
[00136]         Additionally, while the following examples are given primarily with reference
to finger inputs (e.g., finger contacts, finger tap gestures, finger swipe gestures), it should be
understood that, in some embodiments, one or more of the finger inputs are replaced with
input from another input device (e.g., a mouse based input or stylus input). For example, a
swipe gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click (e.g., instead of a contact) followed
by movement of the cursor along the path of the swipe (e.g., instead of movement of the
contact). As another example, a tap gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click while
the cursor is located over the location of the tap gesture (e.g., instead of detection of the
contact followed by ceasing to detect the contact). Similarly, when multiple user inputs are
simultaneously detected, it should be understood that multiple computer mice are, optionally,
used simultaneously, or a mouse and finger contacts are, optionally, used simultaneously.
[00137]         As used here, the term "affordance" refers to a user-interactive graphical user
interface object that may be displayed on the display screen of devices 100, 300, and/or 500
(FIGS. 1, 3, and 5). For example, an image (e.g., icon), a button, and text (e.g., hyperlink)
may each constitute an affordance.
[00138]         As used herein, the term "focus selector" refers to an input element that
indicates a current part of a user interface with which a user is interacting. In some
implementations that include a cursor or other location marker, the cursor acts as a "focus
selector" so that when an input (e.g., a press input) is detected on a touch-sensitive surface
(e.g., touchpad 355 in FIG. 3 or touch-sensitive surface 451 in FIG. 4B) while the cursor is
over a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider or other user interface
element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected
input. In some implementations that include a touch screen display (e.g., touch-sensitive
display system 112 in FIG. 1A or touch screen 112 in FIG. 4A) that enables direct interaction
with user interface elements on the touch screen display, a detected contact on the touch
screen acts as a "focus selector" so that when an input (e.g., a press input by the contact) is
detected on the touch screen display at a location of a particular user interface element (e.g., a
button, window, slider, or other user interface element), the particular user interface element
is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some implementations, focus is moved
from one region of a user interface to another region of the user interface without
corresponding movement of a cursor or movement of a contact on a touch screen display
(e.g., by using a tab key or arrow keys to move focus from one button to another button); in
                                                 -31-

    WO 2015/184163                                                            PCT/US2015/033023
these implementations, the focus selector moves in accordance with movement of focus
between different regions of the user interface. Without regard to the specific form taken by
the focus selector, the focus selector is generally the user interface element (or contact on a
touch screen display) that is controlled by the user so as to communicate the user's intended
interaction with the user interface (e.g., by indicating, to the device, the element of the user
interface with which the user is intending to interact). For example, the location of a focus
selector (e.g., a cursor, a contact, or a selection box) over a respective button while a press
input is detected on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touchpad or touch screen) will indicate
that the user is intending to activate the respective button (as opposed to other user interface
elements shown on a display of the device).
[00139]          As used in the specification and claims, the term "characteristic intensity" of a
contact refers to a characteristic of the contact based on one or more intensities of the contact.
In some embodiments, the characteristic intensity is based on multiple intensity samples. The
characteristic intensity is, optionally, based on a predefined number of intensity samples, or a
set of intensity samples collected during a predetermined time period (e.g., 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,
1, 2, 5, 10 seconds) relative to a predefined event (e.g., after detecting the contact, prior to
detecting liftoff of the contact, before or after detecting a start of movement of the contact,
prior to detecting an end of the contact, before or after detecting an increase in intensity of the
contact, and/or before or after detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact). A
characteristic intensity of a contact is, optionally based on one or more of: a maximum value
of the intensities of the contact, a mean value of the intensities of the contact, an average
value of the intensities of the contact, a top 10 percentile value of the intensities of the
contact, a value at the half maximum of the intensities of the contact, a value at the 90 percent
maximum of the intensities of the contact, or the like. In some embodiments, the duration of
the contact is used in determining the characteristic intensity (e.g., when the characteristic
intensity is an average of the intensity of the contact over time). In some embodiments, the
characteristic intensity is compared to a set of one or more intensity thresholds to determine
whether an operation has been performed by a user. For example, the set of one or more
intensity thresholds may include a first intensity threshold and a second intensity threshold.
In this example, a contact with a characteristic intensity that does not exceed the first
threshold results in a first operation, a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds the
first intensity threshold and does not exceed the second intensity threshold results in a second
operation, and a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds the second threshold
results in a third operation. In some embodiments, a comparison between the characteristic
intensity and one or more thresholds is used to determine whether or not to perform one or
                                                  -32-

    WO 2015/184163                                                           PCT/US2015/033023
more operations (e.g., whether to perform a respective operation or forgo performing the
respective operation) rather than being used to determine whether to perform a first operation
or a second operation.
[00140]          In some embodiments, a portion of a gesture is identified for purposes of
determining a characteristic intensity. For example, a touch-sensitive surface may receive a
continuous swipe contact transitioning from a start location and reaching an end location, at
which point the intensity of the contact increases. In this example, the characteristic intensity
of the contact at the end location may be based on only a portion of the continuous swipe
contact, and not the entire swipe contact (e.g., only the portion of the swipe contact at the end
location). In some embodiments, a smoothing algorithm may be applied to the intensities of
the swipe contact prior to determining the characteristic intensity of the contact. For
example, the smoothing algorithm optionally includes one or more of: an unweighted sliding
average smoothing algorithm, a triangular smoothing algorithm, a median filter smoothing
algorithm, and/or an exponential smoothing algorithm. In some circumstances, these
smoothing algorithms eliminate narrow spikes or dips in the intensities of the swipe contact
for purposes of determining a characteristic intensity.
[00141]          The intensity of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface may be characterized
relative to one or more intensity thresholds, such as a contact-detection intensity threshold, a
light press intensity threshold, a deep press intensity threshold, and/or one or more other
intensity thresholds. In some embodiments, the light press intensity threshold corresponds to
an intensity at which the device will perform operations typically associated with clicking a
button of a physical mouse or a trackpad. In some embodiments, the deep press intensity
threshold corresponds to an intensity at which the device will perform operations that are
different from operations typically associated with clicking a button of a physical mouse or a
trackpad. In some embodiments, when a contact is detected with a characteristic intensity
below the light press intensity threshold (e.g., and above a nominal contact-detection intensity
threshold below which the contact is no longer detected), the device will move a focus
selector in accordance with movement of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface without
performing an operation associated with the light press intensity threshold or the deep press
intensity threshold. Generally, unless otherwise stated, these intensity thresholds are
consistent between different sets of user interface figures.
[00142]          An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below
the light press intensity threshold to an intensity between the light press intensity threshold
and the deep press intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as a "light press" input. An
increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the deep press
                                                -33-

    WO 2015/184163                                                           PCT/US2015/033023
intensity threshold to an intensity above the deep press intensity threshold is sometimes
referred to as a "deep press" input. An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from
an intensity below the contact-detection intensity threshold to an intensity between the
contact-detection intensity threshold and the light press intensity threshold is sometimes
referred to as detecting the contact on the touch-surface. A decrease of characteristic
intensity of the contact from an intensity above the contact-detection intensity threshold to an
intensity below the contact-detection intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as detecting
liftoff of the contact from the touch-surface. In some embodiments, the contact-detection
intensity threshold is zero. In some embodiments, the contact-detection intensity threshold is
greater than zero.
[00143]          In some embodiments described herein, one or more operations are performed
in response to detecting a gesture that includes a respective press input or in response to
detecting the respective press input performed with a respective contact (or a plurality of
contacts), where the respective press input is detected based at least in part on detecting an
increase in intensity of the contact (or plurality of contacts) above a press-input intensity
threshold. In some embodiments, the respective operation is performed in response to
detecting the increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity
threshold (e.g., a "down stroke" of the respective press input). In some embodiments, the
press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input
intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input
intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the
subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below the press-input threshold
(e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input).
[00144]          In some embodiments, the device employs intensity hysteresis to avoid
accidental inputs sometimes termed "jitter," where the device defines or selects a hysteresis
intensity threshold with a predefined relationship to the press-input intensity threshold (e.g.,
the hysteresis intensity threshold is X intensity units lower than the press-input intensity
threshold or the hysteresis intensity threshold is 75%, 90%, or some reasonable proportion of
the press-input intensity threshold). Thus, in some embodiments, the press input includes an
increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity threshold and a
subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold that
corresponds to the press-input intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed
in response to detecting the subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below
the hysteresis intensity threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input).
Similarly, in some embodiments, the press input is detected only when the device detects an
                                                 -34-

    WO 2015/184163                                                            PCT/US2015/033023
increase in intensity of the contact from an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity
threshold to an intensity at or above the press-input intensity threshold and, optionally, a
subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact to an intensity at or below the hysteresis
intensity, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the press input
(e.g., the increase in intensity of the contact or the decrease in intensity of the contact,
depending on the circumstances).
[00145]          For ease of explanation, the descriptions of operations performed in response
to a press input associated with a press-input intensity threshold or in response to a gesture
including the press input are, optionally, triggered in response to detecting either: an increase
in intensity of a contact above the press-input intensity threshold, an increase in intensity of a
contact from an intensity below the hysteresis intensity threshold to an intensity above the
press-input intensity threshold, a decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input
intensity threshold, and/or a decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity
threshold corresponding to the press-input intensity threshold. Additionally, in examples
where an operation is described as being performed in response to detecting a decrease in
intensity of a contact below the press-input intensity threshold, the operation is, optionally,
performed in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact below a hysteresis
intensity threshold corresponding to, and lower than, the press-input intensity threshold.
2.       STRUCTURED SUGGESTIONS
[00146]          In embodiments of the present disclosure, the electronic device can structure
suggested contacts and calendar events for users from their messages. The suggested contacts
and calendar events can be searchable as if they were manually entered by the user, and the
user can choose to add or ignore (e.g., reject) the suggested contacts and calendar events. In
this manner, a user's contacts and calendar events can be maintained with no or minimal
effort on the user's part, which can save the user time, enhance productivity and produce a
more efficient human-machine interface.
2.1      Suggested Contact Information
[00147]          FIG. 5A illustrates an exemplary data architecture 502A for suggested contacts
in accordance with some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 5A, electronic device 500 can
associate (e.g., store) contact information 520A from message 510 with a corresponding
contact 530A. Message 510 can include any type of message that can be sent or received by
the user of device 500, such as an email, instant message, messaging via an application on
device 500, etc., and can include any attachment to message 510.
[00148]          Contact information 520A can include information typically associated with a
contact entry in an address book database, such as name, phone number, address, business or
                                                 -35-

    WO 2015/184163                                                          PCT/US2015/033023
social networking handle, etc., of an entity. Contact entries are typically organized or
indexed by the entity, which can include an individual, group, organization, company, etc.
Contact information 520A can be stored in any suitable format that applications, such as
contacts module 137, can recognize in order to process contact information 520A. Contact
information 520 can also be formatted according to standard protocols, such as the CardDAV
protocol, to allow for updating or synchronization over a network with other clients.
[00149]         In some embodiments, the identified contact information 520A can be
associated with contact 530A in any one of three mutually exclusive states - suggested state
540, added state 550 and rejected state 560. Suggested state 540 can reflect a state in which
the user has not yet confirmed or approved the addition of contact information 520A to a
contact. Added state 550 can reflect a state in which the user has confirmed or approved the
addition of contact information 520A to a contact. Rejected state 560 can reflect a state in
which the user has rejected the addition of contact information 520A to a contact. Contact
530A can also be associated with any one of these three states when all associated contact
information belongs to the same state.
[00150]         In some embodiments, added state 550 can be treated by device 500 as a
default state, meaning that no additional data is required to be associated with such contacts
to indicate that they are in added state 550. For example, user added contacts on device 500
can be defaulted to added state 550.
[00151]         In embodiments in which added state 550 is treated as the default state, device
500 can associate data with contact information 520A to indicate that contact information
520A belongs to either suggested state 540 or rejected state 560. This data can take any
suitable form, such as metadata, which can be used by applications processing contact
information 520A to recognize that contact information 520A is in either suggested state 540
or rejected state 560. Device 500 can also associate data with contact 530A to indicate that
contact 530A and all associated contact information belong to either suggested state 540 or
rejected state 560.
[00152]         By storing contact information 520A in suggested state 540, device 500 (e.g.,
via an application running on device 500) can include the suggested contact information in
searches of contacts. To avoid user confusion, device 500 can also indicate to the user that
contact information 520A is in suggested state 540 by providing a visual indication (e.g., via
labeling or highlighting) and/or preventing a user from directly acting on contact information
520A (e.g., by requiring the user to provide an additional input before allowing the user to act
on contact information 520A). Input can refer to any suitable manner in input, such as touch,
mouse, speech, etc.
                                               -36-

    WO 2015/184163                                                          PCT/US2015/033023
[00153]         By storing contact information 520A in rejected state 560, device 500 can
remember previously suggested contact information that the user had rejected so as not to
suggest it again to the user. Contact information 520A in rejected state 560 can be ignored by
applications that process contact information in added state 550 and suggested state 540.
[00154]         Device 500 can store contact information 520A locally on device 500, and
refrain from synchronizing contact information 520A to remote databases until contact
information 520A is changed from suggested state 540 to added state 550. In other
embodiments, contact information 520A can be updated to remote databases while in
suggested state 540.
[00155]         Device 500 can identify contact information 520A from structured or
unstructured content in message 510. Structured content refers to content with formal
organization or structure arranged according to a predefined format, such as automated e
mails provided by online travel agencies that lay out flight, hotel and/or car reservation
information in the same predefined way (e.g., using the same HTML structure). In some
embodiments, to identify contact information 520A from structured content, device 500 can
use templates configured to recognize contact information in the particular format provided
by such messages. In some embodiments, device 500 can add and/or update these templates
over a network.
[00156]         Unstructured content refers to content without formal organization or
structure, such as natural language content (e.g., someone says in a message that they have a
new number) and email signatures. To identify contact information 520A from unstructured
content, device 500 can use data detectors that are configured to identify predefined
references to contact information, such as particular phrases like "I got a new number, it's
<number>." Device 500 can also add and/or update these data detectors over a network.
Device 500 can improve the predefined references relied on by the data detectors by cross
correlating contact information on device 500 (e.g., in an address book database) with
language associated with that contact information on device 500 (e.g., in messages). The
correlated language can then be used to refine the predefined references for subsequent use.
The message content analyzed by device 500 can include any information that is recognizable
by device 500, including message metadata.
[00157]         In some embodiments, the device receives an instruction (e.g., a user request)
to initiate a communication (e.g., a phone call, instant message, email) with a contact (e.g., an
individual or a business). The device determines that the contact is not in the device's
address book. In response, the device locates contact information (e.g., a phone number, a
username, an email address) based on one or more communications (e.g., instant messages,
                                               -37-

    WO 2015/184163                                                          PCT/US2015/033023
emails, calendar entries). In other words, the device searches through a database of potential
contacts to disambiguate the requested contact referenced in the instruction. Optionally, the
device presents a ranked list of potentially matching contacts and receives user input selecting
the intended contact. In response to the user input selecting the intended contact, the device
may initiate the communication (e.g., a phone call, instant message, email) with the intended
contact.
2.2     Suggested Event information
[00158]         FIG. 5B illustrates an exemplary data architecture 502B for suggested calendar
events in accordance with some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 5B, electronic device 500
can associate (e.g., store) event information 520B from message 510 with a corresponding
calendar event 530B. Message 510 can include any type of message that can be sent or
received by the user of device 500, such as an email, instant message, messaging via an
application on the device, etc., and can include any attachment to the message.
[00159]         Event information 520B can include information typically associated with a
calendar entry in a calendar database, such as time, date, location, etc. Event information
520B can be stored in any suitable format that applications, such as calendar module 148, can
recognize in order to process event information 520B. Event information 520B can also be
formatted according to standard protocols, such as the CalDAV protocol, to allow for
updating or synchronization over a network with other clients.
[00160]         In some embodiments, the identified event information 520B can be associated
with calendar event 530B in any one of three mutually exclusive states - suggested state 540,
added state 550 and rejected state 560. Suggested state 540 can reflect a state in which the
user has not yet confirmed or approved the addition of event information 520B to a calendar
event. Added state 550 can reflect a state in which the user has confirmed or approved the
addition of event information 520B to a calendar event. Rejected state 560 can reflect a state
in which the user has rejected the addition of event information 520B to a calendar event.
Calendar event 530B can also be associated with any one of these three states when all
associated calendar event information belongs to the same state.
[00161]         In some embodiments, added state 550 can be treated by device 500 as a
default state, meaning that no additional data is required to be associated with such calendar
events to indicate that they are in added state 550. For example, user added calendar events
on device 500 can be defaulted to added state 550.
[00162]         In embodiments in which added state 550 is treated as the default state, device
500 can associate data with event information 520B to indicate that event information 520B
belongs to either suggested state 540 or rejected state 560. This data can take any suitable
                                                -38-

    WO 2015/184163                                                          PCT/US2015/033023
form, such as metadata, which can be used by applications processing event information
520B to recognize that event information 520B is in either suggested state 540 or rejected
state 560. Device 500 can also associate data with calendar event 530B to indicate that
calendar event 530B and all associated event information belong to either suggested state 540
or rejected state 560.
[00163]         By storing event information 520B in suggested state 540, device 500 (e.g., via
an application running on device 500) can include the suggested event information in
searches of calendar events. To avoid user confusion, device 500 can also indicate to the user
that event information 520B is in suggested state 540 by providing a visual indication (e.g.,
via labeling or highlighting) and/or preventing a user from directly acting on event
information 520B (e.g., by requiring the user to provide an additional input before allowing
the user to act on event information 520B). Input can refer to any suitable manner in input,
such as touch, mouse, speech, etc.
[00164]         By storing event information 520B in rejected state 560, device 500 can
remember previously suggested event information that the user had rejected so as not to
suggest it again to the user. Event information 520B in rejected state 560 can be ignored by
applications that process event information in added state 550 and suggested state 540.
[00165]         Device 500 can store event information 520B locally on device 500, and
refrain from synchronizing event information 520B to remote databases until event
information 520B is changed from suggested state 540 to added state 550. In other
embodiments, event information 520B can be updated to remote databases while in suggested
state 540.
[00166]         Device 500 can identify event information 520B from structured or
unstructured content in message 510. Structured content refers to content with formal
organization or structure arranged according to a predefined format, such as automated e
mails provided by online travel agencies that lay out flight, hotel and/or car reservation
information in the same predefined way (e.g., using the same HTML structure). In some
embodiments, to identify event information 520B from structured content, device 500 can use
templates configured to recognize event information in the particular format provided by such
messages. In some embodiments, device 500 can add and/or update these templates over a
network.
[00167]         Unstructured content refers to content without formal organization or
structure, such as natural language content (e.g., someone says in a message that they'll meet
you somewhere at a particular time) and email signatures. To identify event information
520B from unstructured content, device 500 can use data detectors that are configured to
                                               -39-

    WO 2015/184163                                                          PCT/US2015/033023
identify predefined references to event information, such as particular phrases like "meet me
at <address> at <time>." Device 500 can also add and/or update these data detectors over a
network. Device 500 can improve the predefined references relied on by the data detectors
by cross-correlating event information on device 500 (e.g., in a calendar database) with
language associated with that event information on device 500 (e.g., in messages). The
correlated language can then be used to refine the predefined references for subsequent use.
The message content analyzed by device 500 can include any information that is recognizable
by device 500, including message metadata.
[00168]         In some examples, the device identifies one or more communications (e.g.,
email or other content) associated with a calendar event (e.g., a user-added calendar event or a
received meeting invite accepted by the user). For example, the device may determine that a
communication is associated with a calendar event when the communication describes an
event of the same or similar name, an event of the same or similar day/time and/or duration,
and/or an event of the same location. For another example, the device may determine that a
communication is associated with a calendar event based on the calendar event including the
same or similar language used in the communication. The one or more communications and
the associated calendar event are analyzed and/or compared to better identify candidate
communications for which a future calendar entry should be created or suggested. For
example, a machine learning technique can be employed to learn patterns of event creation by
training from/analyzing emails on which events are based (using support vector machine and
a corpus of emails that were used to create calendar events).
[00169]         For example, the device may receive an email communication from an auto
parts shop that includes the language "Hi, Can you swing by the parts shop tomorrow to get
the replacement part?" The email may also include an email signature that includes the street
address of the parts shop. The user may then manually create a calendar event, including the
language "swing by the parts shop to get the replacement part". The calendar event may also
include the street address of the parts shop as the location of the calendar event. Based on the
email communication and the calendar event, the device may use machine learning to
determine that this type of email communication warrants a suggestion for a calendar entry.
The determination may be based on: the similarity between the "swing by the parts shop to
get the replacement part" in the email communication and the calendar event, the similarity
between the street address in the email communication and the calendar event, a similarity in
the day/time identified in the email communication and the calendar event, or a combination
of two or more of the these.
                                               -40-

    WO 2015/184163                                                            PCT/US2015/033023
[00170]         In some examples, the device identifies event information from (e.g., during)
an instant message conversation (e.g., an SMS or text message conversation). During the
conversation, the device collects information relevant to an event. After a relevant portion of
the conversation (e.g., after a predetermined set of information has been collected), the device
produces a suggested calendar event. In some examples, the suggested calendar event is
updated based on messages in the conversation sent or received after the initial suggested
calendar event is produced. This conversational event creation technique allows users to
quickly and efficiently add events to their calendars based on messages in an instant message
conversation.
[00171]         For example, the device may be displaying an instant message conversation
between the device's user and a representative from an auto parts shop. The conversation
may include a message from the representative include the language "Hi, Can you swing by
the parts shop tomorrow to get the replacement part?" The conversation may also include a
message from the representative that includes the street address of the parts shop. The user
may respond "yes, I'll be there!" In response to a relevant portion of the conversation (e.g.,
the confirmation of attendance "yes, I'll be there!"; or receiving the time "tomorrow" and the
location (street address)), the device produces a suggested calendar event. The device may
update the suggested calendar event if the device subsequently receives a message from the
representative that indicates an updated time (e.g., "Actually, tomorrow won't work, but this
Friday will work."), location, or other event component.
[00172]         It should be recognized that exemplary data architectures 520A and 520B can
be the same or different. For example, a single data architecture can be used for suggested
contacts as for suggested calendar events. Alternatively, one data architecture can be used for
suggested contacts, while another, different data architecture can be used for suggested
calendar events.
[00173]         It should also be recognized that message 510 can be processed for only
suggested contacts, only suggested calendar events, or both suggested contacts and suggested
calendar events. When processed for both suggested contacts and suggested calendar events,
message 510 can be processed for suggested contacts and suggested calendar events in series
or parallel. For example, message 510 can be first processed for suggested contacts, and then
processed for suggested calendar events. Alternatively, message 510 and a copy of message
510 can be processed for suggested contacts and suggested calendar events in parallel.
[00174]         In some examples, a notification or reminder may be presented to the user
(e.g., through a visual notification, a haptic notification, an audio notification, or a
combination of one or more notifications on device 500) based on event information
                                                -41-

identified from structured or unstructured content in a message or other media. In some
examples, the notification or reminder may be presented to the user even though the event
information is not associated with the added state. For example, the device may remind a
user to pack a suitcase based on an email received about an upcoming camping trip, even
though the camping trip has not been added to the user's calendar. Thus, reminders may be
presented for calendar entries, events, and the like that are in a suggested state (e.g., not
explicitly accepted or declined).
3.       USER INTERFACES AND ASSOCATED PROCESSES
[00175]          FIGS. 6A- 13 depict embodiments of user interfaces ("UI") and associated
processes that may be implemented on device 500. In some embodiments, device 500
corresponds to devices 100 or 300.
[00176]          FIGS. 6A and 6G illustrate exemplary user interfaces for providing suggested
contacts and calendar events in accordance with some embodiments.
[00177]          In particular, FIG. 6A shows the display, by contacts module 137 for example,
of a user interface corresponding to a contact with suggested contact information (i.e., contact
information in suggested state 540), for example, after processing a message as described
above. In this example, the contact is associated with an individual named John Appleseed
and includes a company name ("Any Company Inc."), work number ("405-555-1234") and a
mobile number ("405-123-6633"). The company name and work number are confirmed items
of contact information and belong to added state 550. The mobile number is a suggested item
of contact information and belongs to suggested state 540.
[00178]          Device 500 can provide user interface object 600 (e.g., the word "suggestion")
in the user interface to indicate to the user that the mobile number is a suggested item of
contact information and not one that has been confirmed by the user. Any suitable user
interface object can be used for this purpose, including a label, icon, or other visual indication
that the mobile number is a suggested item of contact information. When the same contact
includes items of contact information in suggested state 540 and items of contact information
in added state 550, as in the case in FIG. 6A, device 500 can display the items in suggested
state 540 below, or in a position of lesser priority to, all items in added state 550.
[00179]          Device 500 can also prevent the user from directly invoking an application
(e.g., telephone module138) to call John Appleseed at the suggested number from this initial
user interface. For example, device 500 can provide the text and/or region associated with the
suggested number with a different visual appearance than that of confirmed items of contact
information, such as a grayed out appearance (not shown), to indicate that a selection of the
suggested number by the user will not directly call the number. Rather, upon selecting the
                                                 -42-

    WO 2015/184163                                                          PCT/US2015/033023
suggested number by the user, device 500 can replace the current user interface with a second
user interface through which the user can review and call the suggested number.
[00180]         As shown in FIG. 6B, the second user interface (labeled "Review Suggestion")
includes suggestion portion 606 in the form of a banner that includes user interface object 602
(labeled "Add to Contact") associated with the suggested number. Selecting user interface
object 602 by the user can cause device 500 to add the suggested number to the contact in
added state 550 (e.g., change the state of the suggested number from suggested state 540 to
added state 550). Upon selection of the mobile number or similar indication, such as the
telephone icon displayed next to the mobile number, by the user in this subsequent user
interface, device 500 can invoke an application (e.g., telephone module 138) to call John
Appleseed at the suggested number. In some embodiments, device 500 can retain the mobile
number in suggested state 540 if the user does not select user interface object 602 but does
select the mobile number or similar indication (e.g., a user calling the suggested number is
not treated as an implicit approval of the suggested number for the contact). In other
embodiments, device 500 can change the state of the mobile number to added state 550 upon
the user selecting the mobile number, even if the user had not selected user interface object
602 (e.g., a user calling the suggested number is treated as an implicit approval of the
suggested number for the contact).
[00181]         The second user interface in FIG. 6B also includes user interface object 604
(labeled "Ignore") associated with the suggested number. Selection of user interface object
604 by the user can cause device 500 to cease displaying user interface object 602, which
removes the option of adding to the number to the contact. Upon selecting user interface
object 604, device 500 can change the state of the suggested number from suggested state 540
to rejected state 560. In rejected state 560, device 500 can be configured to no longer display
or suggest the suggested number in association with this contact.
[00182]         Additionally, the second user interface in FIG. 6B includes message portion
608 (labeled as "Related email") that includes a portion of the message from which the
suggested number was identified by device 500. Thus, in providing an interface for
reviewing suggested contact information, the user interface of FIG. 6B can provide the user
with message context associated with the suggested contact information. As shown in FIG.
6B, device 500 can display a limited section of the e-mail relating to the portion with the
mobile number. Upon the user selecting the displayed portion of the message, device 500 can
cause a message application (e.g., E-mail Client Module 140) to open the entire e-mail for the
user. In some embodiments, the entire e-mail can be displayed with the suggested contact
information in a user interface corresponding to that shown in Fig. 6D.

[00183]         FIG. 6C shows a user interface that is displayed in response to the user
selecting the "Edit" user interface object in FIG. 6A. In this edit user interface, the user can
also directly call the suggested number, represented by user interface object 610, which is
highlighted (i.e., in bold) to indicate that the number is in suggested state 540. Any suitable
visual indication can be used to indicate that user interface object 610 is in suggested state
540.
[00184]         FIG. 6D shows a screen that a user can view upon opening a message on
device 500 (e.g., an e-mail displayed by E-mail Client Module 140) with device 500 having
identified suggested contact information in the message. The user interface of FIG. 6D
includes suggestion portion 612 and message portion 614. Message portion 614 includes the
content of the message as received by device 500. Suggestion portion 612 includes a user
interface object corresponding to the identified entity ("John Appleseed"), a user interface
object corresponding to the identified contact information ("405-123-6633") and user
interface object 618 (labeled "Add to Contacts") associated with the identified contact
information that, when selected, causes the device to add the suggested number to the contact
in added state 550. Suggestion portion 612 includes user interface object 620 (labeled
"Ignore") associated with the identified contact information that, upon selection, causes
device 500 to change the state of the identified contact information from suggested state 540
to rejected state 560. In rejected state 560, device 500 can be configured to no longer display
or suggest the suggested contact information in association with this contact. Selecting
identified contact information 616 of suggestion portion 612 above the "Ignore" and "Add to
Contacts" tile can bring up a user interface corresponding to the contact associated with the
identified entity. For example, device 500 can present the contact information for "John
Appleseed" in a user interface corresponding to that shown in FIG. 6A in this embodiment.
[00185]         FIG. 6E shows a screen that a user can view upon opening a message on
device 500 (e.g., an e-mail displayed by E-mail Client Module 140) with device 500 having
identified suggested event information in the message. The user interface of FIG. 6E includes
suggestion portion 620 and message portion 622. Message portion 622 includes the content
of the message as received by device 500. Suggestion portion 620 includes a user interface
object corresponding to the identified event information ("Dinner", "Any Sushi Bar", "Fri,
March 7th", or "9:50 PM") and user interface object 626 (labeled "Add to Calendar")
associated with the identified event information that, when selected, causes device 500 to add
the suggested event information to a calendar event in added state 550. Suggestion portion
620 includes user interface object 628 (labeled "Ignore") that, upon selection, causes device
500 to change the state of the identified event information from suggested state 540 to

rejected state 560. In rejected state 560, device 500 can be configured to no longer display or
suggest the suggested event information in association with this calendar event. Selecting
identified event information 624 of suggestion portion 620 above the "Ignore" and "Add to
Calendar" tile can bring up a user interface (not shown) corresponding to a calendar event
associated with the identified event information (e.g., displayed by contacts module 137 for
example), through which the user can select a user interface object to add the suggested event
information to a calendar event in added state 550.
[00186]          In some examples, the device may display a calendar event on a calendar of
the device, wherein the calendar event corresponds to event information in the suggested state
540. Calendar events in the suggested state 540 that are displayed on the calendar of the
device may optionally be grayed out to indicate that they are in the suggested state 540. The
device may display details of the calendar event (e.g., when the user activates an affordance
associated with the calendar event), including at least a portion of the source of the event
information (e.g., a portion of the communication, such as an email, on which the suggested
event information is based). Alternatively, or in addition, the device may display an
affordance which when activated causes the device to display at least a portion of the
communication (e.g., an email) on which the suggest event information is based. The
displayed details of the suggested calendar event may also optionally include an affordance to
ignore (or reject) the suggested calendar event or accept the suggested calendar event. Thus,
a user can see suggested calendar events on a calendar of the device and the user can quickly
and efficiently reject or accept the suggested calendar event.
[00187]          FIG. 6F shows a screen that a user can view upon opening a message on
device 500 (e.g., an e-mail displayed by E-mail Client Module 140) with device 500 having
identified multiple suggested contacts and/or calendar events in the message. The user
interface of FIG. 6F includes suggestion portion 630 and message portion 632. Message
portion 632 includes the content of the message as received by device 500. Suggestion
portion 630 further includes a user selectable region that, when selected, causes device 500 to
display a subsequent user interface having a list of the multiple instances of identified contact
or event information as shown in FIG. 6G. Confining suggestion portion 630 of FIG. 6F to a
single banner rather than incorporating all of the suggestions of FIG. 6G into the user
interface of FIG. 6F prevents the suggestion portion of FIG. 6F from interfering with the
user's ability to view and read the message in the message portion with ease.
[00188]          FIG. 6G shows the subsequent user interface having the list of suggested
contact and event information identified in the message associated with the user interface of
FIG. 6F. As shown in FIG. 6G, the suggestions are organized by type (e.g., suggested

calendar events are grouped together and suggested contacts are grouped together) and each
suggestion includes the "Ignore" and "Add to Contact" and "Add to Calendar" functionality
described above. The user interface of FIG. 6G also includes user interface object 634 ("Add
All") that, when selected, causes device 500 to add each of a grouping of the multiple
instances of identified contact or event information (e.g., the two suggested calendar events
shown in FIG. 6G) to a corresponding contact or calendar event in added state 550.
[00189]         FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate a flow diagram of an exemplary process for
generating a suggested contact in accordance with some embodiments. The process can be
performed at an electronic device (e.g., device 500).
[00190]         The electronic device can receive (702) a message (e.g., FIG. 6D, email in
message portion 614) and identify (704), in the received message, an entity (e.g., FIG. 6D,
"John Appleseed") and contact information (e.g., FIG. 6D, "405-123-6633") associated with
the entity. The device can determine (722) that a contact (e.g., FIG. 5A, contact 530A)
associated with the identified entity does not exist among a plurality of contacts in a database
(e.g., storage on device 500, such as an address book database), and in response to this
determination (724), the device can generate a contact associated with the entity, the
generated contact including the contact information and an indication (e.g., metadata) that the
generated contact is a suggested contact (e.g., in suggested state 540). It is noted that when
the device generates the "John Appleseed" contact as a suggested contact, each item of
contact information in the contact can be indicated as a suggested item of contact information
and stored in suggested state 540 or the entire contact as a whole can be indicated as a
suggested contact and stored in suggested state 540. It is also noted that any message resident
on the device can be analyzed using the disclosed process, such as incoming and outgoing
messages.
[00191]         In some embodiments, the identified entity is (706) a name and the identified
contact information is a phone number, address, business or social networking handle.
[00192]         In some embodiments, the device can identify unstructured content in the
message by recognizing signature blocks in the message. For example, to identify the entity
and associated contact information in the message, the device can identify (708) a signature
block of the message and analyze the identified signature block for the entity and the contact
information. The message can include (710) an email and the signature block can be an e
mail signature. The email can include (712) one or more prior emails in an email thread, and
the identifying of the e-mail signature can include analyzing the one or more prior emails in
the email thread. By unrolling the quoting layers of the e-mail the device can avoid
misassociating contact information location in different e-mails in an e-mail thread.

[00193]         In some embodiments, the device can identify unstructured content in the
message by searching for definitive phrases with data detectors. For example, to identify the
entity and associated contact information in the message, the device can identify (714) in the
message one or more phrases based on a collection of predefined phrases, and analyze the one
or more identified phrases for the entity and the contact information. The device can update
(716) the collection of predefined phrases over a network, which can allow the device to
continue to use accurate phrases. The device can also downgrade (718) one or more of the
predefined phrases as a result of a request to reject the suggested contact. In other words, if
users continue to reject suggestions identified through the use of particular phrases, that can
be an indication that those phrases are inaccurate. The device can also generate (720) one or
more of the predefined phrases by cross-correlating contact information in the database with
language associated with contact information on the electronic device (such as messages,
calendar events, etc.) In this manner the device can determine what exact language in a
message with contact information, for example, led a user to create or update a contact with
the contact information.
[00194]         In some embodiments, the suggested contact can be searchable in view of the
data architecture of FIG. 5A. For example, the device can receive (726) a request for a
contact (e.g., by a user searching for a contact via an application on the device) and, in
response to the request for a contact, search the suggested contact.
[00195]         In some embodiments, the device can (728), in response to the generation of
the contact, refrain from storing the suggested contact in a remote database over a network.
For example, if the suggested contact is in suggested state 540, the device can refrain from
pushing the contact to an updating or synchronization service (e.g., an application on the
device) that allows contacts to be updated on multiple clients over a network.
[00196]         In some embodiments, the device can (730) receive a request to add the
suggested contact (e.g., FIG. 6D, "Add to Contacts" 618) to the database and in response to
the request, store the generated contact, without the indication that the generated contact is a
suggested contact (e.g., change the state of the contact from suggested state 540 to added state
550), in the database. In response to the request to add the suggested contact to the database,
the device can store (732) the generated contact, without the indication that the generated
contact is a suggested contact, in a remote database over a network by, for example, pushing
the contact to an updating or synchronization service.
[00197]         In some embodiments, the device can (734) receive a request to reject the
suggested contact (e.g., FIG. 6D, "Ignore" 620) and, in response to the request, reject the
suggested contact, preventing the suggested contact from being generated in the future as a

result of the entity and the contact information being identified in a future message. This can
be implemented by storing rejected contacts in rejected state 560, so that the device can know
what has already been rejected.
[00198]         FIGS. 8A and 8B illustrate a flow diagram of an exemplary process for
updating an existing contact with a suggested item of contact information in accordance with
some embodiments. The process can be performed at an electronic device (e.g., device 500).
[00199]         The electronic device can receive (802) a message (e.g., FIG. 6D, email in
message portion 614) and identify (804), in the received message, an entity (e.g., FIG. 6D,
"John Appleseed") and an item of contact information (e.g., FIG. 6D, "405-123-6633")
associated with the entity. The device can determine (822) that a contact (e.g., FIG. 5A,
contact 530A) associated with the identified entity exists among a plurality of contacts in a
database and that the contact does not include the identified item of contact information. In
response to this determination (824), the device can update the contact to include the item of
contact information and an indication (e.g., metadata) that the item of contact information is a
suggested item of contact information (e.g., in suggested state 540). It is also noted that any
message resident on the device can be analyzed using the disclosed process, such as incoming
and outgoing messages.
[00200]         In some embodiments, the identified entity is (806) a name and the identified
item of contact information is a phone number, address, business or social networking handle.
[00201]         In some embodiments, the device can identify unstructured content in the
message by recognizing signatures in the message. For example, to identify the entity and
associated item of contact information in the message, the device can identify (808) a

the item of contact information. The message can include (810) an email and the signature
block can be an e-mail signature. The email can include (812) one or more prior emails in an
email thread, and the identifying of the e-mail signature can include analyzing the one or
more prior emails in the email thread. By unrolling the quoting layers of the e-mail the
device can avoid misassociating contact information location in different e-mails in an e-mail
thread.
[00202]         In some embodiments, the device can identify unstructured content in the

entity and associated item of contact information in the message, the device can identify (814)
in the message one or more phrases based on a collection of predefined phrases, and analyze
the one or more identified phrases for the entity and the item of contact information. The
device can update (816) the collection of predefined phrases over a network, which can allow

data architecture of FIG. 5A. For example, the device can receive (826) a request for a
contact (e.g., by a user searching for a contact via an application on the device) and, in
response to the request for a contact, search the suggested item of contact information.
[00204]          In some embodiments, the device can (828), in response to the updating of the
contact, refrain from storing the suggested item of contact information in a remote database
over a network. If the suggested item of contact information is in suggested state 540, the
device can refrain from pushing the item of contact information to an updating or
synchronization service (e.g., an application on the device) that allows contacts to be updated
on multiple clients over a network.
[00205]          In some embodiments, the device can (830) receive a request to add the
suggested item of contact information to the database (e.g., FIG. 6B, "Add to Contacts" 602)
and in response to the request, store the updated contact, without the indication that the item
of contact information is a suggested item of contact information (e.g., change the state of the
contact information from suggested state 540 to added state 550), in the database. In response
to the request to add the suggested item of contact information to the database, the device can
store (832) the updated contact, without the indication that the item of contact information is
a suggested item of contact information, in a remote database over a network by, for example,
pushing the contact information to an updating / synchronization service.
[00206]          In some embodiments, the device can (834) receive a request to reject the
suggested item of contact information (e.g., FIG. 6B, "Ignore" 604) and, in response to the
request, reject the suggested item of contact information, preventing the contact from being
updated in the future with the suggested item of contact information as a result of the entity
and the item of contact information being identified in a future message. This can be
implemented by storing rejected contact information in rejected state 560, so that the device
can know what has already been rejected.

displaying a contact with suggested contact information in accordance with some
embodiments. The process can be performed at an electronic device with a display (e.g.,
device 500).
[00208]         The electronic device can receive (902) a message (e.g., FIG. 6D, email in
message portion 614) and identify (904), in the received message, an entity (e.g., FIG. 6D,
"John Appleseed") and contact information (e.g., FIG. 6D, "405-123-6633") associated with
the entity. The device can generate (906) an indication (e.g., metadata) that the identified
contact information is suggested contact information, and display (908) a first user interface
(e.g., FIG. 6A) corresponding to a contact associated with the entity. The first user interface
can include a first user interface object (e.g., "Suggestion") based on the generated indication,
indicating that the identified contact information is suggested contact information.
[00209]         In some embodiments, the device can prevent (910) an input corresponding to
a selection of the suggested contact information from invoking an application to contact the
entity (e.g., FIG. 6A, selecting the suggested number does not call the number).
[00210]         In some embodiments, the device can (912) detect an input corresponding to a
selection of the suggested contact information in the first user interface, and in response to the
detection, display a second user interface (e.g., FIG. 6B) including a second user interface
object (e.g., FIG. 6B, "Add to Contacts" 602) associated with the identified contact
information that, when selected, causes the electronic device to add the identified contact
information to a database. The second user interface can (914) include a third user interface
object (e.g., FIG. 6B, "Ignore" 604) associated with the identified contact information that,
when selected, causes the electronic device to cease displaying the second user interface
object. Displaying the second user interface can cease (916) displaying the first user
interface. The device can, in response to adding the identified contact information to the
database, cease (918) display of the first user interface object.
[00211]         In some embodiments the second user interface can display (920) at least a
portion of the message (e.g., FIG. 6B, "Related email"). The device can (922) detect an input
corresponding to a selection of the displayed message and, in response to the detection,
invoke an application (e.g., E-mail Client Module 140) to open the message (e.g., FIG. 6D).
The message can (924) be an email and the application can be an email application.
[00212]         In some embodiments the device can detect (926) an input corresponding to a
selection of the suggested contact information in the second user interface, and in response to

the electronic device to add the identified contact information to a database (e.g., store the
contact information as a contact). The second portion can (1012) include a fourth user
interface object (e.g., FIG. 6D, "Ignore" 620) associated with the identified contact
information that, when selected, causes the electronic device to cease displaying the third user
interface object.
[00216]          FIGS. 11 A and 11 B illustrate a flow diagram of an exemplary process for
generating a suggested calendar event in accordance with some embodiments. The process
can be performed at an electronic device (e.g., device 500).
[00217]          The electronic device can receive (1102) a message (e.g., FIG. 6E, email in
message portion 622) and identify (1104), in the received message, event information (e.g.,
FIG. 6E, "Dinner", "Any Sushi Bar", "Fri, March 7th", or "9:50 PM"). The device can
generate (1122) a calendar event (e.g., FIG. 5B, calendar event 530B) associated with the
identified event information, the generated calendar event including the event information
                                                -51-

    WO 2015/184163                                                           PCT/US2015/033023
and an indication (e.g., metadata) that the generated calendar event is a suggested calendar
event (e.g., in suggested state 540).
[00218]          In some embodiments, the identified event information is (1106) a date and a
time.
[00219]          In some embodiments, the device can identify structured content in the
message by using templates configured to recognize event information in the particular
format provided by such messages. For example, to identify the event information in the
message, the device can (1108) identify a format of content in the message, identify a
template from a collection of predefined templates that is configured to recognize event
information in the format of the content in the message, and analyze the content with the
identified template for the event information. The message can include (1110) an email and
the content can include a reservation (e.g., FIG. 6E). The device can update (1112) the
collection of predefined templates over a network, which can allow the device to continue to
use accurate templates.
[00220]          In some embodiments, the device can identify unstructured content in the
message by searching for references to event information with data detectors. For example,
to identify the event information in the message, the device can identify (1114) in the
message one or more references to a date and time based on a collection of predefined
references to a date and time, and analyze the one or more identified references to a date and
time for the event information. The device can update (1116) the collection of predefined
references to a date and time over a network, which can allow the device to continue to use
accurate references. The device can downgrade (1118) one or more of the predefined
references to a date and time as a result of a request to reject the suggested calendar event. In
other words, if users continue to reject suggestions identified through the use of particular
references to date and time, that can be an indication that those references are inaccurate. The
device can generate (1120) one or more of the predefined references to a date and time by
cross-correlating event information in a database including a plurality of calendar events with
language associated with event information on the electronic device. In this manner the
device can better determine what language in a message with event information, for example,
led a user to create or update a calendar event with the event information.
[00221]          In some embodiments, the suggested calendar event can be searchable in view
of the data architecture of FIG. 5. For example, the device can receive (1124) a request for a
calendar event (e.g., by a user searching for a calendar event via an application on the device)
and, in response to the request for a calendar event, searching the suggested calendar event.
                                                -52-

    WO 2015/184163                                                           PCT/US2015/033023
[00222]         In some embodiments, the device can, in response to the generation of the
calendar event, refrain (1126) from storing the suggested calendar event in a remote database
over a network. For example, if the suggested calendar event is in suggested state 540, the
device can refrain from pushing the calendar event to an updating or synchronization service
(e.g., an application on the device) that allows calendar events to be updated on multiple
clients over a network.
[00223]         In some embodiments the device can (1128) receive a request to add the
suggested calendar event (e.g., FIG. 6E, "Add to Calendar" 626) to a database including a
plurality of calendar events, and in response, storing the generated calendar event, without the
indication that the generated calendar event is a suggested calendar event (e.g., change the
state of the calendar event from suggested state 540 to added state 550), in the database. In
response to the request to add the suggested calendar event to the database, the device can
store (1130) the generated calendar event, without the indication that the generated calendar
event is a suggested calendar event, in a remote database over a network by, for example,
pushing the calendar event to an updating or synchronization service.
[00224]         In some embodiments, the device can (1132) receive a request to reject the
suggested calendar event (e.g., FIG. 6E, "Ignore" 628), and, in response to the request to
reject, prevent the suggested calendar event from being generated in the future as a result of
the event information being identified in a future message. This can be implemented by
storing rejected events in rejected state 560, so that the device can know what has already
been rejected.
[00225]         FIG. 12 illustrates a flow diagram of an exemplary process for displaying
suggested event information with a message in accordance with some embodiments. The
process can be performed at an electronic device with a display (e.g., device 500).
[00226]         The electronic device can receive (1202) a message (e.g., FIG. 6E, email in
message portion 622) and identify (1204), in the received message, event information (e.g.,
FIG. 6E, "Dinner", "Any Sushi Bar", "Fri, March 7th", or "9:50 PM"). The message can be
(1206) an email. The identified event information can (1208) be a date and a time.
[00227]         The device can display (1210) a first user interface (e.g., FIG. 6E)
corresponding to the received message. The first user interface can include a first portion
(e.g., FIG. 6E, message portion 622) including content of the message as received by the
electronic device and a second portion (e.g., FIG. 6E, suggestion portion 620) including a first
user interface object (e.g., FIG. 6E, "Dinner", "Any Sushi Bar", "Fri, March 7th", or "9:50
PM") corresponding to the identified event information and a second user interface object
(e.g., FIG. 6E, "Add to Calendar" 626) associated with the identified event information that,

when selected, causes the electronic device to add the identified event information to a
database including a plurality of calendar events (e.g., store the event information as a
calendar event). The second portion can (1212) include a third user interface object (e.g.,
FIG. 6E, "Ignore" 628) associated with the identified event information that, when selected,
causes the electronic device to cease displaying the second user interface object.
[00228]         FIG. 13 illustrates a flow diagram of an exemplary process for displaying
multiple suggested contact or event information with a message in accordance with some
embodiments. The process can be performed at an electronic device with a display (e.g.,
device 500).
[00229]         The electronic device can receive (1302) a message (e.g., FIG. 6F, email in
message portion 632) and identify (1304), in the received message, multiple instances of
contact or event information (e.g., FIG. 6F, "2 Events, 1 Contact" in attached travel itinerary).
[00230]         The device can display (1306) a first user interface (e.g., FIG. 6F)
corresponding to the received message. The first user interface can include a first portion
(e.g., FIG. 6F, message portion 632) including content of the message as received by the
electronic device and a second portion (e.g., FIG. 6F, suggestion portion 630) that, when
selected, causes the electronic device to display a second user interface (FIG. 6G) including a
list of the multiple instances of identified contact or event information.
[00231]         In some embodiments, the device can (1308) detect an input corresponding to
a selection of the second portion of the first user interface and, in response to the detection,
display the second user interface including the list of the multiple instances of identified
contact or event information and, for each of the multiple instances of identified contact or
event information, a first user interface object (e.g., FIG. 6G, "Add to Calendar", or "Add to
Contacts") that, when selected, causes the electronic device to add the identified information
to a database (e.g., store the event information as a calendar event, or the contact information
as a contact). The second user interface can (1310) include, for each of the multiple instances
of identified contact or event information, a second user interface object (e.g., FIG. 6G,
"Ignore") that, when selected, causes the electronic device to cease displaying the first user
interface object. The second user interface can (1312) include a third user interface object
(e.g., FIG. 6G, "Add All" 634) that, when selected, causes the electronic device to add each
of a grouping (e.g., calendar events or contacts) of the multiple instances of identified contact
or event information to a database. Displaying the second user interface can cease (1314)
displaying the first user interface.

display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application
136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event
information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a
first location on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub event,
such as activation of an affordance on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or
sub-event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the
detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or
object updater 177 to update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event
handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the
application. Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other
processes can be implemented based on the components depicted in FIGS. lA-lB.

the principles of the various described embodiments. It is understood by persons of skill in
the art that the functional blocks described in FIG. 17 are, optionally, combined or separated
into sub-blocks to implement the principles of the various described embodiments.
Therefore, the description herein optionally supports any possible combination or separation
or further definition of the functional blocks described herein.

1730.
[00259]          The processing unit 1708 is configured to: receive (e.g., with receiving unit
1710) a message; identify (e.g., with identifying unit 1712), in the received message, an entity
and an item of contact information associated with the entity; determine (e.g., with
determining unit 1714) that a contact associated with the identified entity exists among a
plurality of contacts in a database and that the contact does not comprise the identified item of

includes a receiving unit 2110, an identifying unit 2112, and a display enabling unit 2114.
[00314]          The processing unit 2108 is configured to: receive (e.g., with receiving unit
2110) a message; identify (e.g., with identifying unit 2112), in the received message, event
information; and enable display (e.g., with display enabling unit 2114) of a first user interface
corresponding to the received message, the first user interface comprising: a first portion
comprising content of the message as received by the electronic device; and a second portion
comprising: a first user interface object corresponding to the identified event information;
and a second user interface object associated with the identified event information that, when
selected, causes the electronic device to add the identified event information to a database
comprising a plurality of calendar events.
[00315]          In some embodiments, the second portion comprises a third user interface
object associated with the identified event information that, when selected, causes the
electronic device to cease displaying the second user interface object.
[00316]          In some embodiments, the message comprises an email.
[00317]          In some embodiments, the identified event information comprises a date and a
time.
[00318]          The operations described above with reference to FIG. 12 are, optionally,
implemented by components depicted in FIGS. lA-lB or FIG. 21. For example, receive
operation at block 1202, identify operation at block 1204, and display operation at block 1210
may be implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event

monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and event
dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application 136-1. A respective
event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event information to respective event
definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first location on the touch
sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub event, such as activation of an
affordance on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is detected,
event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event
or sub-event. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or object updater 177 to
update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a
respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it
would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be
implemented based on the components depicted in FIGS. lA-1B.

diagram of an electronic device 2200 configured in accordance with the principles of the
various described embodiments. The functional blocks of the device are, optionally,
implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software to carry out
the principles of the various described embodiments. It is understood by persons of skill in
the art that the functional blocks described in FIG. 22 are, optionally, combined or separated
into sub-blocks to implement the principles of the various described embodiments.
Therefore, the description herein optionally supports any possible combination or separation
or further definition of the functional blocks described herein.
[00320]          As shown in FIG. 22, an electronic device 2200 includes a display unit 2202
configured to display graphical objects and one or more RF units 2206 configured to

[00322]          In some embodiments, the processing unit 2208 is further configured to: detect
(e.g., with detecting unit 2216) an input corresponding to a selection of the second portion of
the first user interface; and in response to the detection of the input corresponding to a
selection of the second portion of the first user interface, enable display (e.g., with display
enabling unit 2214) of the second user interface comprising: the list of the multiple instances
of identified contact or event information; and for each of the multiple instances of identified
contact or event information, a first user interface object that, when selected, causes the
electronic device to add the identified information to a database.
[00323]          In some embodiments, the second user interface comprises, for each of the
multiple instances of identified contact or event information, a second user interface object
that, when selected, causes the electronic device to cease displaying the first user interface
object.
[00324]          In some embodiments, the second user interface comprises a third user
interface object that, when selected, causes the electronic device to add each of a grouping of
the multiple instances of identified contact or event information to a database.
[00325]          In some embodiments, to enable display of the second user interface ceases
display of the first user interface.
[00326]          The operations described above with reference to FIG. 13 are, optionally,
implemented by components depicted in FIGS. lA-lB or FIG. 22. For example, receive
operation at block 1302, identify operation at block 1304, and display operation at block 1306
may be implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event
monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and event
dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application 136-1. A respective
event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event information to respective event
definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first location on the touch
sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub event, such as activation of an
affordance on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is detected,
event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event
or sub-event. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or object updater 177 to
update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a
respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it
would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be
implemented based on the components depicted in FIGS. lA-1B.
[00327]          The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with
reference to specific embodiments. However, the illustrative discussions above are not
                                                 -70-

    WO 2015/184163                                                            PCT/US2015/033023
intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many
modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments
were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the techniques and their
practical applications. Others skilled in the art are thereby enabled to best utilize the
techniques and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular
use contemplated.
[00328]         Although the disclosure and examples have been fully described with
reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and
modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and
modifications are to be understood as being included within the scope of the disclosure and
examples as defined by the claims.
[00329]         As described above, one aspect of the present technology is the gathering and
use of data available from various sources to improve the delivery to users of invitational
content or any other content that may be of interest to them. The present disclosure
contemplates that in some instances, this gathered data may include personal information data
that uniquely identifies or can be used to contact or locate a specific person. Such personal
information data can include demographic data, location-based data, telephone numbers,
email addresses, home addresses, or any other identifying information.
[00330]         The present disclosure recognizes that the use of such personal information
data, in the present technology, can be used to the benefit of users. For example, the personal
information data can be used to deliver targeted content that is of greater interest to the user.
Accordingly, use of such personal information data enables calculated control of the delivered
content. Further, other uses for personal information data that benefit the user are also
contemplated by the present disclosure.
[00331]         The present disclosure further contemplates that the entities responsible for the
collection, analysis, disclosure, transfer, storage, or other use of such personal information
data will comply with well-established privacy policies and/or privacy practices. In
particular, such entities should implement and consistently use privacy policies and practices
that are generally recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or governmental requirements
for maintaining personal information data private and secure. For example, personal
information from users should be collected for legitimate and reasonable uses of the entity
and not shared or sold outside of those legitimate uses. Further, such collection should occur
only after receiving the informed consent of the users. Additionally, such entities would take
any needed steps for safeguarding and securing access to such personal information data and
ensuring that others with access to the personal information data adhere to their privacy
                                                 -71-

    WO 2015/184163                                                           PCT/US2015/033023
policies and procedures. Further, such entities can subject themselves to evaluation by third
parties to certify their adherence to widely accepted privacy policies and practices.
[00332]          Despite the foregoing, the present disclosure also contemplates embodiments
in which users selectively block the use of, or access to, personal information data. That is,
the present disclosure contemplates that hardware and/or software elements can be provided
to prevent or block access to such personal information data. For example, in the case of
advertisement delivery services, the present technology can be configured to allow users to
select to "opt in" or "opt out" of participation in the collection of personal information data
during registration for services. In another example, users can select not to provide location
information for targeted content delivery services. In yet another example, users can select to
not provide precise location information, but permit the transfer of location zone information.
[00333]          Therefore, although the present disclosure broadly covers use of personal
information data to implement one or more various disclosed embodiments, the present
disclosure also contemplates that the various embodiments can also be implemented without
the need for accessing such personal information data. That is, the various embodiments of
the present technology are not rendered inoperable due to the lack of all or a portion of such
personal information data. For example, content can be selected and delivered to users by
inferring preferences based on non-personal information data or a bare minimum amount of
personal information, such as the content being requested by the device associated with a
user, other non-personal information available to the content delivery services, or publically
available information.
