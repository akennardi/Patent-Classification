                                           ABSTRACT
Measurement of circulating ST2 and/or IL-33 concentrations is useful for the prognostic
evaluation of subjects, in particular for the prediction of adverse clinical outcomes, e.g.,
mortality, and the detection of severe disease.

         PREDICTING MORTALITY AND DETECTING SEVERE DISEASE
         This is a divisional of Australian patent application No. <removed-apn>, which in turn is a
divisional of Australian patent application No. 2012202069, which in turn is a divisional of
Australian patent application No. 2007244927, the entire contents of which are incorporated
herein by reference.
                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The invention relates to methods for predicting mortality and detecting the
presence of severe disease by measuring circulating levels of ST2 and/or IL-33, alone
or in combination with other biomarkers.
                                     BACKGROUND
         Clinical evaluation of subjects, particularly those with non-specific symptoms
 such as chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, eructation,
 sweating, palpitations, lightheadedness, fatigue, or fainting, can present significant
 challenges, as the cause and severity of the subject's condition may not always be
 apparent. The decision whether to treat a subject aggressively or conservatively, or to
 admit the subject as an inpatient or to send them home, may sometimes be made
 solely on a physician's clinical assessment or "gut feeling" as to the individual's
 actual condition. Biomarkers that indicate a subject's likelihood of an adverse
 outcome, e.g., mortality, and/or the presence of severe disease, would significantly
 enhance the physician's ability to make informed treatment decisions.
                                       SUMMARY
         The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that serum
levels of the biomarker ST2 (Growth Stimulation-Expressed Gene 2, also known as
Interleukin I Receptor Like 1 (ILlRL-1)) can be used to predict clinical outcome,
e.g., death, within a specific time period, e.g., 30 days, 3 or 6 months, or a year or
more, or to detect the presence of severe disease, regardless of the underlying causes
of symptoms or ultimate diagnosis. Changes in the level of ST2 over time, e.g., over
a few days or more, can also be used to predict clinical outcome, e.g., in patients
hospitalized after an acute event.
        The methods described herein include measuring ST2 levels as well as
monitoring changes in ST2 levels over time (e.g., ratios) to provide diagnostic and
prognostic evaluation of patients, e.g., patients with non-specific symptoms, e.g,
acutely dyspneic patients and those with chest pain.
                                                    1

       WO 2007/127749                                                                  PCT/US2007/067333
                      IL-33 has been identified as the ligand for ST2. Thus, the invention includes
             methods for evaluating patients by monitoring biomarker levels of ST2 and/or IL-33
             levels, as well as ST2/IL-33 complexes, and ratios of ST2:IL-33 complexes to free
            ST2 and/or IL-33.
     5               In addition, the methods can include using additional diagnostic methods,
            including evaluating organ function and/or levels of adjunct biomarkers such as
           troponin (Tn, e.g., TnI or TnT), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), proBNP, NT
           proBNP, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), NT-proANP, proANP, C-reactive peptide
           (CRP), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), D-dimers (degradation products of cross-linked
   10      fibrin, whose level becomes elevated following clot formation), albumin, liver
          function enzymes, measures of renal function (e.g., creatinine, creatinine clearance
          rate, or glomerular filtration rate) and/or bacterial endotoxin. In some embodiments,
          the methods include measuring ST2 and/or a change in ST2 levels over time in
          addition to BUN, NT-proBNP or BNP, and/or TnI.
  15                Thus, in one aspect, the invention features methods for evaluating the risk of
          death or readmission within a specific time period, e.g., 30, 60, 90, or 180 days (e.g.,
          one, two, three, or six months), or one, two, or five years, for a subject. The methods
         include obtaining a sample, e.g., blood, serum, plasma, urine, or body tissue from the
         subject; determining a biomarker level of ST2 and/or IL-33 in the sample; and
 20      comparing the biomarker level of ST2 and/or IL-33 in the sample to a reference level
         of ST2 and/or IL-33. A comparison of the biomarker level of ST2 and/or IL-33 in the
         sample versus the reference indicates the subject's risk of death or readmission within
        the specific time period. In some embodiments, the specific time period is one year.
                  In some embodiments, the reference level represents a level in a subject who
25      has a low risk of death within one year. In some embodiments, e.g., wherein the
        biomarker level of ST2 is measured using an immunoassay, e.g., an enzyme-linked
        immunosorbent assay (ELISA), e.g., as described in Example 1, the reference level of
        ST2 is between about 0.2 and 0.3 ng/ml of serum, e.g., the level can be 0.20, 0.23,
       0.25, 0.27, or 0.29 ng/ml of serum, and a level in the sample that is greater than or
30     equal to the reference level indicates that the subject has an elevated, i.e., statistically
       significantly elevated, risk of death within one year. If an analytical technique other
       than the ELISA described in Example 1 is employed, the reference ST2 level may be
       different than described herein; the specific numbers recited herein should be
                                                      2

        WO 2007/127749                                                                  PCT/US2007/067333
             construed to be equivalent to corresponding numbers generated using other analytical
             techniques. In some embodiments, the elevated risk of death is at least 20% higher,
             e.g., 30%, 40%, or 50% higher.
                      In another aspect, the invention features methods for determining the severity
     5      of one or more diseases, e.g., the present severity of diseases, in a subject. The
            methods include obtaining a sample from the subject; determining a biomarker level
            of ST2 and/or IL-33 in the sample; and comparing the biomarker level of ST2 and/or
            EL-33 in the sample to a reference level of ST2 and/or ]L-33. The biomarker level of
            ST2 and/or ]L-33 in the sample as compared to the reference indicates whether the
   10       one or more diseases the subject has are severe, e.g., life-threatening.
                     In a further aspect, the invention includes methods for monitoring a subject's
           condition, e.g., for deciding whether a subject has improved, e.g., improved
           sufficiently to be discharged from the hospital. The methods include determining a
           first biomarker level of ST2 and/or IL-33 in the subject, e.g., a baseline level; and
  15      determining at least one subsequent biomarker level of ST2 and/or IL-33 in the
          subject, e.g., a treatment level. Then, the first level and the subsequent levels are
          compared. If the biomarker level of ST2 and/or IL-33 decreases sufficiently, e.g.,
         statistically significantly, or by at least 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, or more, from the first to
         the subsequent levels, then the subject's condition is likely to be improving and, if
 20      either one or both levels are low enough, e.g., below a selected threshold, then the
         subject can be discharged, e.g., for outpatient treatment.
                   In some embodiments, the methods include determining a level of ST2 that
         indicates a subject's risk, and optionally selecting or modifying a treatment for the
        subject, based on a ratio of a first ST2 level, e.g., a baseline level, to a second ST2
25      level, e.g., a level taken some time later, e.g., one, two, three, four, or more days later.
        For example, if the second level of ST2 is more than a selected percentage of the first
        level, then the subject has a high risk and should be treated more aggressively; if the
        subject is already being treated, then the subject is not responding favorably to the
       current treatment and a new treatment should be-selected, i.e., an alternate treatment
30     to which the patient may respond more favorably. As one example, if the second level
       is about 85% or more of the first level (i.e., has decreased by about 15% or less), then
       the subject is not improving and still has a high risk of death.
                                                        3

       WO 2007/127749                                                                 PCT/US2007/067333
                     In some embodiments, the level of ST2 in a subject is compared to a reference
            level that represents a level in a subject who does not have severe disease, e.g., has no
           disease or has no acute, severe disease, e.g., when measured using an ELISA, e.g., as
           described herein. The reference level of ST2 can be between about 0.2 and 0.3 ng/ml,
     5     e.g., the level can be about 0.20, 0.23, 0.25, 0.27, or 0.29 ng/ml of serum or plasma
           (as noted above, the thresholds recited herein apply when using an ELISA method as
           described herein; other threshold numbers can be considered as equivalent to these
          numbers when determined using a different method). A level in the sample that is
          greater than or equal to the reference level indicates that the subject has one or more
   10     severe diseases, e.g., present diseases.
                   In some embodiments, the reference level represents a subject with a certain
         prognosis. For example, when the level of ST2 is measured using an ELISA, e.g., as
         described herein in Example 1, the reference level can be used to determine prognosis
         as follows: an ST2 < about 0.2 or 0.23 ng/ml indicates that the subject has a good
  15     prognosis, e.g., is likely to recover; an ST2 of from about 0.2 or 0.23 ng/ml to 0.7
         ng/ml (or an equivalent thereof) indicates that the subject has a poor prognosis, e.g., is
         less likely to recover. Finally, an ST2 of greater than 0.7 ng/ml indicates a very poor
        prognosis, e.g., the subject is not likely to recover. In this embodiment poor
        prognosis would indicate that the patient is at risk of death or developing more severe
 20     disease within one year possibly requiring hospital admission. Very poor prognosis
        indicates that the patient has a high probability of death or developing more severe
        disease within 90 days possibly requiring hospital admission. In one study patients
        with an ST2 level higher than 0.7 ng/ml had a mortality rate of over 30%.
                  In some embodiments, the subject exhibits one or more non-specific
25     symptoms, e.g., chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath (dyspnea), nausea,
       vomiting, eructation, sweating, palpitations, lightheadedness, fatigue, and fainting. In
       some embodiments, the symptom is dyspnea or chest pain.
                 In some embodiments, the subject does not have a cardiovascular disorder. In
       various embodiments, the subject has a pulmonary disorder, e.g., acute infection (e.g.,
30     pneumonia), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary
       embolism.
                                                      4

       WO 2007/127749                                                                    PCT/US2007/067333
                      In certain embodiments, the subject has a liver disorder, e.g., a liver disorder
            associated with chemotherapy, alcohol toxicity, or drug toxicity as determined by
            standard liver function laboratory tests.
                     In some embodiments, the methods further include determining the level of an
     5     adjunct (non-ST2, non-IL-33) biomarker, e.g., Troponin, NT-proBNP, BNP, proBNP,
           NT-proANP, proANP, ANP, CRP, D-dimers, BUN, albumin, liver function enzymes,
           measures of renal function, e.g., creatinine, creatinine clearance rate, or glomerular
           filtration rate, and/or bacterial endotoxin, in the sample; and comparing the level of
          the adjunct biomarker in the sample to a reference level of the adjunct biomarker. The
   10     level of the adjunct biomarker in the sample as compared to the reference, in
          combination with the level of ST2 in the sample as compared to an ST2 reference
          level, indicates whether the subject has an elevated risk of death within a specific time
         period, and/or has a present severe disease. In some embodiments, the methods
         include determining a change in levels over time (e.g., a ratio) for the adjunct
  15     biomarker, by comparing a first level, e.g., a baseline level, to a second level, e.g., a
         level taken some time later, e.g., one, two, three, four, or more days later. In
         embodiments where a ratio of ST2 is calculated, a ratio of an adjunct biomarker can
         also be calculated, e.g., based on the same time period as the ratio of ST2.
                   In some embodiments, the subject has a BMI of 25-29, a BMI of           30, or
 20     renal insufficiency, e.g., the subject is selected on the basis that they have a BMI of
        25-29, a BMI of> 30, or renal insufficiency.
                   In some embodiments, the methods include determining a level of ST2 and a
        level of IL-33 in the sample; determining a ratio of ST2:IL-33 in the sample; and
        comparing the ratio of ST2:IL-33 to a reference ratio. The ratio of ST2:IL-33 in the
25      sample as compared to the reference ratio indicates whether the subject has an
        elevated risk of death within a specific time period, and/or has present severe disease.
                  In another aspect, the invention provides methods for evaluating the risk of
        death within a specific time period, e.g., 30, 60, 90, or 180 days (6 months), or one,
       two, or five years, e.g., for a subject who exhibits one or more non-specific
30     symptoms. The methods include obtaining a sample from the subject; determining a
       biomarker level of ST2 and/or IL-33 in the sample, and optionally a level of NT
       proBNP, proBNP, or BNP in the sample; and comparing the level of ST2 and/or IL-33
       in the sample, and the level of NT-proBNP in the sample (if determined), to
                                                      5

          corresponding reference levels. The level of ST2 and/or IL-33 in the sample, and the
         level of NT-proBNP, proBNP, or BNP in the sample, as compared to the respective
         reference levels indicate the subject's risk of death within the specific time period.
                 In some embodiments, the methods include determining levels of (i) NT
    5    proBNP, proBNP, or BNP and (ii) ST2 in the sample. In some embodiments, the
         subject's risk of death within one year is as follows:
                                                 ST2<0;2       gm
                   NT-proBNP~ <986 pg/ml         Lowest Risk           Medium Risk
                   NT-proBNP        986 pg/m     Medium Risk          Highest Risk
                In certain embodiments, if the subject has the highest level of risk of death or
        hospital readmission, the subject is treated aggressively.
  10            In a further aspect, the invention includes methods for monitoring a subject's
        condition, e.g., for deciding whether a subject has improved, e.g., improved
        sufficiently to discharge the subject from the hospital. The methods include
       determining a first level of (i) a non-ST2 biomarker, e.g., NT-proBNP, proBNP, or
       BNP and (ii) ST2 and/or IL-33 in the subject, e.g., a baseline level; and determining at
 15    least one subsequent level of (i) the non-ST2 biomarker, e.g., NT-proBNP, proBNP, or
       BNP and (ii) ST2 and/or IL-33 in the subject, e.g., a treatment level. Then, the first
       level and the subsequent levels are compared. If the level of ST2 and/or IL-33
      decreases from the first to the subsequent levels, then the subject is likely to be
      improving and, if the level is low enough, then the subject has improved, e.g.,
20    improved sufficiently to be discharged, e.g., for outpatient treatment. In some
      embodiments, the methods include determining at least a first, second, and third level
      of (i) a non-ST2 biomarker, e.g., NT-proBNP, proBNP, or BNP and (ii) ST2 and/or IL
      33 in the subject, and comparing the levels. A difference between the levels indicates
      whether the subject has improved sufficiently to be discharged. Thus, for example, a
25    decision to discharge or continue to treat on an inpatient basis can be made as follows:

                   Also provided herein are kits including one or more antibodies that bind

         instructions for performing one or more of the methods described herein.
                  In a further aspect, the invention provides methods for evaluating a subject's
        condition. The methods include obtaining a sample from the subject; determining a
        biomarker level of ST2 and/or IL-33 in the sample, and determining presence or a
  10    level of one or more, e.g., all, of the following other biomarkers:
                  (i) NT-proBNP, proBNP, or BNP;
                 (ii) NT-proANP, proANP, orANP;

                (ix) one or more liver function enzymes; and
20     comparing the level of ST2 and/or IL-33 in the sample, and the level of the one or
       more other biomarkers in the sample, to corresponding reference levels. The level of
       ST2 and/or IL-33 in the sample, and the level of the other biomarker in the sample, as
      compared to the reference levels indicate the severity of the subject's condition.
25             In some embodiments, the methods described herein include measuring levels
      or ratios of ST2 and/or IL-33 in combination with BNP or NT-proBNP; with troponin,

      clearance rate, or glomerular filtration rate.

                    In another aspect, the invention includes methods for evaluating the efficacy
           of a treatment in a subject. The methods include determining a first (e.g., baseline)
           level of circulating ST2 and/or IL-33 in a subject; comparing the first level of
     5     circulating ST2 and/or IL-33 in the subject to a predetermined reference level;
          selecting the subject if the first level of ST2 is above the predetermined reference
          level; administering a treatment to the subject; determining a second level of
          circulating ST2 and/or IL-33 in a subject; and
          comparing the first and second levels of circulating ST2 and/or IL-33. A difference
   10     between the first and second levels of circulating ST2 and/or IL-33 indicates the
          efficacy of the treatment in the subject. For example, a second level of circulating
          ST2 and/or IL-33 that is lower than the first level indicates that the treatment is
         effective.
                  As used herein, a "sample" includes any bodily fluid or tissue, e.g., one or
  15     more of blood, serum, plasma, urine, and body tissue. In certain embodiments, a
         sample is a serum, plasma, or blood sample.
                  An antibody that "binds specifically to" an antigen, binds preferentially to the
        antigen in a sample containing other proteins.
                  The methods and kits described herein have a number of advantages. For
 20     example, the methods can be used to determine whether a patient should be admitted
        or held as an inpatient for further assessment, regardless of whether a definitive
        diagnosis has been made. For example, the methods can be used for risk stratification
        of a given subject, e.g., to make decisions regarding the level of aggressiveness of
       treatment that is appropriate for the subject, based on their ST2 levels. Better
25     treatment decisions can lead to reduced morbidity and mortality, and better allocation
       of scarce health care resources. The methods described herein can be used to make
       general assessments as to whether a patient should be further tested to determine a
       specific diagnosis. The methods described herein can also be used for patient
       population risk stratification, e.g., to provide information about clinical performance
30     or expected response to a therapeutic intervention. The methods described herein can
       be used regardless of the underlying cause or ultimate diagnosis, and therefore are not
       limited to specific indications.

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                Clinical evaluation of patients, particularly patients with non-specific
       symptoms such as dyspnea or chest pain, is often challenging. The results described
25     herein provide evidence that ST2 is useful in the prognostic evaluation of patients,
       regardless of the underlying cause of their disease. ST2 is a powerful indicator of
       severe disease and imminent death, as demonstrated herein in several completely
       different populations with completely different symptoms (see Examples 1-6).
                Predicting Mortality
30             Elevated concentrations of ST2 are markedly prognostic for death within one
       year, with a dramatic divergence in survival curves for those with elevated ST2 soon
       after presentation, regardless of the underlying diagnosis. As one example, there is a
                                                    10

       WO 2007/127749                                                                PCT/US2007/067333
            dramatic relationship between elevations of ST2 and the risk for mortality within one
           year following presentation with dyspnea. The relationship between ST2 and death in
           dyspneic patients was independent of diagnosis, and superseded all other biomarker
           predictors of mortality in this setting, including other markers of inflammation,
     5     myonecrosis, renal dysfunction, and most notably NT-proBNP, a marker recently
           described as having value for predicting death in this population (Januzzi et al., Arch.
          Intern. Med. 2006;166(3):315-20). Indeed, most of the mortality in the study was
          concentrated among subjects with elevated ST2 levels at presentation; however, the
          combination of an elevated ST2 and NT-proBNP was associated with the highest rates
   10     of death within one year.
                  Such a multi-marker approach for risk stratification has been proposed for
          patients with acute coronary syndromes (Sabatine et al., Circulation
          2002;105(15):1760-3), but no such strategy has yet been proposed for the evaluation
         for the patient with non- specific symptoms such as undifferentiated dyspnea or
  15     general complaint of chest pain.
                 Determining Severity of Disease
                 Elevated concentrations of ST2 are correlated with the presence of severe
         disease in a subject, regardless of the underlying cause of the disease. As one
 20      example, in a population of patients presenting with chest pain, the highest levels of
        disease were associated with severe disease including chronic obstructive pulmonary
        disease (COPD), lymphoma, sepsis, alcohol abuse, and pulmonary embolism (see
        Example 5).
                 Therefore, for undiagnosed subjects, the methods described herein can be used
 25     to determine how aggressively a diagnosis should be sought; a high ST2 level would
        indicate the presence of severe disease, and suggest that the subject should be treated
        as a high-risk case. For subjects with a known diagnosis, the methods described
       herein can be used to help determine the severity of the underlying pathology; again, a
       higher ST2 level is associated with more severe disease.

                General Methodology
                In general, the methods described herein include evaluating circulating levels
       (e.g., levels in blood, serum, plasma, urine, or body tissue) of ST2 and/or IL-33 in a
                                                      11

       WO 2007/127749                                                                PCT/US2007/067333
             subject, e.g., a mammal, e.g., a human. These levels provide information regarding
            the subject's likelihood of experiencing an adverse outcome, e.g., mortality, e.g.,
            within a specific time period, e.g., 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 6 months, one year, two
            years, three years, or five years. These levels also provide information regarding the
     5      severity of disease in the subject. In some embodiments, the level of ST2 and/or IL
           33 is determined once, e.g., at presentation. In some embodiments, the level of ST2
           and/or IL-33 is determined 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and/or 24 hours, and/or 1-7 days after the
           onset of symptoms. Where more than one level is determined, a ratio of ST2 can be
           calculated that quantifies whether and how much the level of ST2 in the subject has
   10      increased or decreased.
                   In some embodiments, the level of ST2 and/or IL-33 is determined more than
          once; in that case, the higher measurement, or the most recent measurement, can be
          used. In embodiments where the level of ST2 and/or IL-33 is determined more that
          once, the highest level can be used, or the difference between the levels (i.e., the
  15      magnitude and direction of the difference) can be determined and used. Thus, a ratio
          of ST2 can be determined that represents the change (e.g., the magnitude and
         direction, e.g., increase or decrease) in ST2 levels overtime, e.g., over the course of a
         few days, e.g., 3 days or more, or over the course of weeks or months; the ratio is
         indicative of the subject's risk level and the presence of severe disease. Levels of ST2
 20      and/or IL-33 can also be determined multiple times to evaluate a subject's response to
         a treatment. For example, a biomarker level of ST2 and/or IL-33 taken after
        administration of a treatment, e.g., one or more doses or rounds of a treatment, can be
        compared to levels of ST2 and/or IL-33 before the treatment was initiated. The
        difference between the ST2 levels would indicate whether the treatment was effective;
25      e.g., a reduction in ST2 levels would indicate that the treatment was effective. The
        difference between the ST2 levels can also be used to monitor a subject's condition,
       e.g., to determine if the subject is improving, e.g., improving enough to be discharged
       from a hospital, to be treated less aggressively, or to be followed up at greater time
       intervals.
30               Evaluating circulating levels of ST2 and/or IL-33 in a subject typically
       includes obtaining a biological sample, e.g., serum, plasma or blood, from the subject.
       Levels of ST2 and/or IL-33 in the sample can be determined by measuring levels of
       polypeptide in the sample, using methods known in the art and/or described herein,
                                                     12

       WO 2007/127749                                                                  PCT/US2007/067333
            e.g., immunoassays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).
            Alternatively, levels of ST2 and/or IL-33 mRNA can be measured, again using
            methods known in the art and/or described herein, e.g., by quantitative PCR or
           Northern blotting analysis.
     5              Once a level or ratio of ST2 and/or IL-33 has been determined, the level or
           ratio can be compared to a reference level or ratio. In some embodiments, e.g., where
           the level of ST2 is determined using an ELISA, e.g., as described in Example 1, the
          reference level will represent a threshold level, above which the subject has an
          increased risk of death, and/or has a severe disease. The reference level chosen may
   10     depend on the methodology used to measure the levels of ST2. For example, in some
          embodiments, where circulating levels of soluble ST2 are determined using an
          immunoassay, e.g., as described herein, the reference level is about 0.20, 0.23, or 0.29
          ng/ml of serum, and a level of ST2 above that reference level indicates that the subject
         has an increased risk of death, and/or has a severe disease.
  15               Where a ratio has been determined, e.g., using a first and second measurement
         of ST2, the reference ratio will represent an amount and direction of change that
         indicates whether the subject has an increased risk of death and/or has a severe
         disease. As one example, an ST2 ratio can be calculated based on a first
        measurement, e.g., a baseline measurement taken when a subject presents for
 20     treatment, e.g., to an ED, and a second measurement, e.g., a measurement taken about
        three to four days later. If the ratio of first and second ST2 levels over time is about
        0.85 or higher, i.e., the ST2 levels have decreased less than about 15% (or have stayed
        the same or increased), then the subject has a very high risk of imminent death.
       Ratios below about 0.85 (where the ST2 levels have decreased more than about 15%)
25     indicate that the subject has a lower risk of imminent death.
                  This information allows a treating physician to make more accurate treatment
       decisions; for example, when the results of the determination indicate that the subject
       has a level equal to or above a reference level, e.g., above about 0.20 ng/ml, 0.23
       ng/ml, or 0.29 ng/ml of serum, or a ratio above a reference ratio, the subject may be
30     admitted to the hospital as an inpatient, e.g., in an acute or critical care department. In
       some embodiments, comparison of ST2 to a reference level or ratio can be used to
       determine a subject's prognosis. For example, when the level of ST2 is measured
       using an ELISA, e.g., as described herein in Example 1,the reference level can be
                                                     13

       WO 2007/127749                                                                   PCT/US2007/067333
            used to determine prognosis as follows: an ST2 <about 0.20 ng/ml or 0.23 ng/ml
            indicates that the subject has a good prognosis, e.g., is likely to recover; an ST2 of
            from about 0.20 ng/ml or 0.23 ng/ml to about 0.7 ng/ml indicates that the subject has
            a poor prognosis, e.g., is less likely to recover. Finally, an ST2 of greater than about
     5     0.7 ng/ml indicates a very poor prognosis, e.g., the subject is not likely to recover. As
           another example, a ratio of first and second ST2 levels over time above about 0.85
           indicates a poor prognosis, while a ratio of about 0.85 of below indicates a good
          prognosis.
                   Additional testing may be performed, to determine the subject's actual
   i      condition. More aggressive treatment may be administered either before or after
          additional testing. For example, in the case of a suspected MI the subject may be sent
          for more extensive imaging studies and/or cardiac catheterization.
                  In some embodiments, both levels of ST2 and IL-33 are determined, and the
         information from the comparison of both biomarkers with their respective reference
  15     levels provides cumulative information regarding an increased risk of death, and/or
        presence of a severe disease in the subject. In some embodiments, the ratio of ST2 to
        IL-33 may be determined, and the ratio compared to a reference ratio that represents a
        threshold ratio above which the subject has an increased risk of death, and/or has a
        severe disease. In some embodiments, the presence of IL-33/ST2 complexes is
 20     detected, and the level of such complexes is indicative of risk of death and/or the
        presence of severe disease.
                 In some embodiments, the methods include the use of additional diagnostic
        methods to identify underlying pathology. Any diagnostic methods known in the art
       can be used, and one of skill in the art will be able to select diagnostic methods that
25     are appropriate for the subject's symptoms. In some embodiments, the methods
       described herein include other diagnostic methods in addition to or as an alternative to
       the measurement of other biomarkers, e.g., physical measurements of lung function or
       cardiac function as are known in the art.
                 For example, the methods described herein include measuring levels of ST2
3o     and/or IL-33 and one or more additional biomarkers that aid in the subject's diagnosis.
       As one example, for a subject who has chest pain or dyspnea, biomarkers indicative of
       cardiac disease can be measured, e.g., cardiac troponin (cTn), e.g., cTnI, BNP, and/or
       ANP; alternatively or in addition, biomarkers of pulmonary disease can be measured,
                                                       14

            e.g., D-dimers for pulmonary embolism. Thus, in subjects presenting with symptoms
            that include MI in their differential diagnoses, the methods can include measuring
            levels of, cTnI, BNP or NTproBNP or proBNP in addition to ST2 and/or IL-33, to
            determine whether the subject is having an MI. In subjects presenting with symptoms
     5     that include heart failure (HF) in their differential diagnoses, the methods can include
           measuring levels of BNP or NTproBNP or proBNP in addition to ST2 and/or IL-3 3, to
           determine whether the subject is having HF. In subjects presenting with symptoms
           that include COPD in their differential diagnoses, the methods can include measuring
           lung function in addition to levels of ST2 and/or IL-33, to determine whether the
   10     subject has COPD. One of skill in the art will appreciate that there are a number of
          additional diagnostic methods that can be applied, depending on the situation and the
          subject's condition. In some embodiments, the methods include measuring levels of
          BUN, and the presence of elevated BUN and elevated ST2 places the subject in the
          highest risk category.

                   ST2
                   The ST2 gene is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family, whose protein
         product exists both as a trans-membrane form, as well as a soluble receptor that is
         detectable in serum (Kieser et al., FEBS Lett. 372(2-3):189-93 (1995); Kumar et al., J.
 20      Biol. Chem. 270(46):27905-13 (1995); Yanagisawa et al., FEBS Lett. 302(l):51-3
         (1992); Kuroiwa et al., Hybridoma 19(2):151-9 (2000)). ST2 was recently described
        to be markedly up-regulated in an experimental model of heart failure (Weinberg et
        al., Circulation 106(23):2961-6 (2002)), and preliminary results suggest that ST2
        concentrations may be elevated in those with chronic severe HF (Weinberg et al.,
25      Circulation 107(5):721-6 (2003)) as well as in those with acute myocardial infarction
        (MI) (Shimpo et al., Circulation 109(18):2186-90 (2004)).
                  The trans-membrane form of ST2 is thought to play a role in modulating
       responses of T helper type 2 cells (Lohning et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.
       95(12):6930-5 (1998); Schmitz et al., Immunity 23(5):479-90 (2005)), and may play a
30     role in development of tolerance in states of severe or chronic inflammation (Brint et
       al., Nat. Immunol. 5(4):373-9 (2004)), while the soluble form of ST2 is up-regulated
       in growth stimulated fibroblasts (Yanagisawa et al., 1992, supra). Experimental data
       suggest that the ST2 gene is markedly up-regulated in states of myocyte stretch
                                                     15

            (Weinberg et al., 2002, supra) in a manner analogous to the induction of the BNP
           gene (Bruneau et al., Cardiovasc. Res. 28(10):1519-25 (1994)).
                    Tominaga, FEBS Left. 258:301-304 (1989), isolated murine genes that were
           specifically expressed by growth stimulation in BALB/c-3T3 cells; they termed one
     5     of these genes St2 (for Growth Stimulation-Expressed Gene 2). The St2 gene encodes
          two protein products: ST2, which is a soluble secreted form; and ST2L, a
          transmembrane receptor form that is very similar to the interleukin- I receptors. The
          HUGO Nomenclature Committee designated the human homolog, the cloning of
         which was described in Tominaga et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1171:215-218
   10    (1992), as Interleukin 1 Receptor-Like I (ILIRLI). The two terms are used
         interchangeably herein.
                   The mRNA sequence of the shorter, soluble isoform of human ST2 can be
         found at GenBankAcc. No. NM_003856.2, and the polypeptide sequence is at
         GenBank Acc. No. NP_003847.2; the mRNA sequence for the longer form of human
  15     ST2 is at GenBankAcc. No. NM_016232.4; the polypeptide sequence is at GenBank

25      described in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2005/0250156.
                 In some embodiments, the methods include determining the identity of the
       nucleotide sequence at RefSNP ID: rs1041973.
                 IL-33
30              IL-33 was recently identified as the ligand for ST2, and the presence of
       increased levels of IL-33 in various inflammatory disorders has been described (see
       Schmitz et al., Immunity 23(5):479-90 (2005); U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2005/0203046). In

                    Other Biomarkers
                    The methods described herein can also include measuring levels of other
  15     biomarkers in addition to ST2 and/or IL-33. Suitable biomarkers include proBNP,
         NT-proBNP, BNP, NT-proANP, proANP, ANP, troponin, CRP, IL-6, D-dimers, BUN,
         liver function enzymes, albumin, measures of renal function, e.g., creatinine,

                  In these embodiments, levels of ST2 and/or IL-33 and one or more additional
       biomarkers are determined, and the information from the comparison of the
       biomarkers with their respective reference levels provides additional information
3o     regarding the subject's risk of death and/or the presence of a severe disease in the
       subject, which may provide more accurate and specific information regarding the
       subject's risk. The levels can then be compared to a reference ratio that represents a
                                                    17

       WO 2007/127749                                                                    PCT/US2007/067333
           threshold ratio above which the subject has an increased risk of death, and/or has a
           severe disease.
                   As one example, the methods can include determining levels of NT-proBNP
          and ST2. The levels indicate the subject's risk of death, e.g., as shown in Table 1A.
     5
                  Table IA: Risk of Death Based on Circulating Levels of NT-proBNP and
          ST2
                                                   ~ST2<0.20 ug/ini ST2> 0.2 ng/mi~~J

                    NT-prBNP         986 pg/mi       Medium Risk             Highest Risk
                  As shown in Table 1A, the lowest risk of death, e.g., no greater risk of death
  10     than in normal patients or healthy individuals, occurs when both ST2 and NT-proBNP
         levels are low, and the highest risk of death, i.e., a statistically significantly increased
        risk, e.g., greater than 20% increased risk of death, e.g., a greater than 30,-40, or 50%
        higher risk than a normal patient or healthy individual, occurs when both ST2 and NT
        proBNP levels are high.
 15              As another example, the methods can include determining levels of ST2 and
        BUN. The levels indicate the subject's risk of death, e.g., as shown in Table lB.
                 Table 1B: Risk of Death Based on Circulating Levels of BUN and ST2
                                                 ST2 <0.2Ong/mlI          ST22> 0.20 ng/ml
                                                    Lowest Risk             Medium Risk
                                                    Medium Risk             Highest Risk
                As shown in Table IB, the lowest risk of death, e.g., no greater risk of death
       than in normal patients or healthy individuals, occurs when both ST2 and BUN levels
20     are low, and the highest risk of death, e.g., a statistically significantly increased risk of
       death, e.g., a risk greater than 30, 40, or 50% higher risk than a normal patient or
       healthy individual, occurs when both ST2 and BUN levels are high.
                Selecting a Treatment - Aggressive vs. Conservative
25              Once it has been determined that a subject has a circulating level of ST2
       and/or IL-33 above a predetermined reference level, the information can be used in a
                                                    18

        WO 2007/127749                                                                  PCT/US2007/067333
            variety of ways. For example, if the subject has elevated ST2 levels, e.g., as
            compared to a reference level, a decision to treat aggressively can be made, and the
            subject can be, e.g., admitted to a hospital for treatment as an inpatient, e.g., in an
           acute or critical care department. Portable test kits could allow emergency medical
     5     personnel to evaluate a subject in the field, to determine whether they should be
           transported to the ED. Triage decisions, e.g., in an ED or other clinical setting, can
           also be made based on information provided by a method described herein. Those
          patients with high ST2 and/or IL-33 levels can be prioritized over those with lower
          ST2 or IL-33 levels.
   10             The methods described herein also provide information regarding whether a
          subject is improving, e.g., responding to a treatment, e.g., whether a hospitalized
          subject has improved sufficiently to be discharged and followed on an outpatient
         basis. In general, these methods will include determining the levels of ST2 and/or IL
         33 in the subject multiple times. A decrease in ST2 and/or IL-33 levels over time
  15     indicates that the subject is likely to be improving. The most recent levels of ST2
         and/or IL-33 can also be compared to a threshold, as described herein, to determine
         whether the subject has improved sufficiently to be discharged.
                 The subject may also be considered for inclusion in a clinical trial, e.g., of a
        treatment that carries a relatively high risk. The subject can be treated with a regimen
 20     that carries a relatively higher risk than would be considered appropriate for someone
        who had a lower risk of imminent mortality, e.g., mortality within 30 days or within 1
        year of presentation.
                 Beyond the clinical setting, information regarding a subject's ST2 and/or IL
        33 can be used in other ways, e.g., for payment decisions by third party payors, or for
25      setting medical or life insurance premiums by insurance providers. For example, a
        high level of ST2 and/or IL-33, e.g., a level above a predetermined threshold level,
       may be used to decide to increase insurance premiums for the subject.
                Patient Populations
3               The methods described herein are useful in a wide variety of clinical contexts.
       For example, the methods can be used for general population screening, including
       screening by doctors, e.g., in hospitals and outpatient clinics, as well as the ED. As
                                                     19

       WO 2007/127749                                                                PCTIUS2007/067333
            one example, levels of ST2 and/or IL-33 can be determined at any time, and if ST2
            and/or IL-33 is elevated, the physician can act appropriately.
                    Although the methods described herein can be used for any subject, at any
           time, they are particularly useful for those subjects for whom a diagnosis, or the
     5     severity of a condition, is difficult to determine. For example, such subjects may
           present with non-specific symptoms, e.g., symptoms that do not indicate a specific
           diagnosis. Non-specific symptoms include, but are not limited to, chest pain or
           discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, eructation, sweating, palpitations,
          lightheadedness, fatigue, and fainting. Each symptom can have varied etiology.
   10              Chest Pain
                  Chest pain is the chief complaint in about I to 2 percent of outpatient visits,
          and although the cause is often noncardiac, heart disease remains the leading cause of
          death in the United States. Therefore, distinguishing between serious and benign
          causes of chest pain is crucial. The methods described herein are useful in making
  15     this determination.
                  A subject presenting to the ED with chest pain may have esophageal pain, an
         ulcer, acute lung problems such as pulmonary embolus (PE) (potentially fatal),
         rupturing or dissecting aneurysm (highly lethal), gall bladder attack, pericarditis
         (inflammation of the sack around the heart), angina pectoris (cardiac pain without
 20      damage), or an MI (potentially fatal). A precise diagnosis may be difficult to make
        immediately, but the decision whether to admit the subject or to treat them
        conservatively should generally be made immediately. If the methods described
        herein indicate that the subject has an increased risk of an adverse clinical outcome,
        e.g., imminent mortality or severe disease, then the decision can be made to treat the
25      subject aggressively, to potentially prevent the adverse outcome.
                 Additional information about treatment and diagnosis of chest pain may be
       found, e.g., in Cayley, Am. Fam. Phys. 72(10):2012-2028 (2005).
                Dyspnea
                Dyspnea, or shortness of breath (also defined as abnormal or uncomfortable
30     breathing), is a common symptom of subjects on presentation to the ED. The
       differential diagnosis for dyspnea includes four general categories: (1) cardiac, (2)
       pulmonary, (3) mixed cardiac or pulmonary, and (4) noncardiac or nonpulmonary.

                    Cardiac causes of dyspnea include right, left, or biventricular congestive heart
           failure with resultant systolic dysfunction, coronary artery disease, recent or remote
           myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, valvular dysfunction, left ventricular
           hypertrophy with resultant diastolic dysfunction, asymmetric septal hypertrophy,
     5     pericarditis, and arrhythmias.
                   Pulmonary causes include obstructive (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary
          disease (COPD) and asthma) and restrictive processes (e.g., extrapulmonary causes
          such as obesity, spine or chest wall deformities, and intrinsic pulmonary pathology
          such as interstitial fibrosis, pneumoconiosis, granulomatous disease or collagen
   10     vascular disease).
                  Mixed cardiac and pulmonary disorders include COPD with pulmonary
          hypertension and cor pulmonale, deconditioning, pulmonary emboli, and trauma.
                  Noncardiac or nonpulmonary disorders include metabolic conditions such as
         anemia, diabetic ketoacidosis and other, less common causes of metabolic acidosis,
  15     pain in the chest wall or elsewhere in the body, and neuromuscular disorders such as
         multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy. Obstructive rhinolaryngeal problems
         include nasal obstruction due to polyps or septal deviation, enlarged tonsils, and
        supraglottic or subglottic airway stricture.
                 Dyspnea can also present as a somatic manifestation of psychiatric disorders,
 20     e.g., an anxiety disorder, with resultant hyperventilation.
                 Additional information regarding the evaluation and treatment of dyspnea can
        be found, e.g., in Morgan and Hodge, Am. Fam. Phys. 57(4):711-718 (1998).
                 Special Populations
                 Certain populations of subjects may benefit particularly from the methods
25      described herein. These subjects include people for whom BNP or NT-proBNP is less
       useful, such as in those with impaired renal function (Anwaruddin et al., J. Am. Coll.
       Cardiol. 47(1):91-7 (2006); McCullough et al., Am. J. Kidney Dis. 41(3):571-9
       (2003)), or in those who are overweight (Body Mass Index (BMI) of 25-29) or obese
       (BMI> 30) (Krauser et al., Am. Heart J. 149(4):744-50 (2005); McCord et al., Arch.
30     Intern. Med. 164(20):2247-52 (2004)). It is known and accepted in the field that
       patients with a high BMI usually have levels of natriuretic peptide that are lower than
       expected relative to a normal body mass patient for the same level of disease; the
       exact mechanism for this phenomenon is not known. It has been shown that

            circulating levels of ST2 are not influenced by BMI, therefore, the determination of
            ST2 levels is more useful than natriuretic peptide levels in subjects with high BMI.
           Thus, the methods described herein can include determining a subject's BMI, and if
           the subject is overweight or obese, selecting the patient for determination of ST2
      5    and/or IL-33 levels, as described herein.
                                                  EXAMPLES
                   The invention is further described in the following examples, which do not
          limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.
          Example 1: Sandwich ELISA Assay
   10              This example uses the ST2 ELISA Kit manufactured by Medical & Biological
         Laboratories Co., Ltd. (MBL International Corp., Woburn, MA), no. 7638. This kit is
         a sandwich ELISA assay utilizing monoclonal antibodies for both capture and
         detection. This procedure is intended to analyze a full plate of samples assayed in
         replicates at a 1:3 dilution factor and closely follows the manufacturers' protocol.
  15     Kits should be stored at 4'C until use. The procedure described in this example is
         optimized for human serum or plasma collected in citrate or EDTA anticoagulant
        tubes. Plasma collected in heparin anticoagulant tubes should not be used in this
        assay as heparin binds ST2 and inhibits measurement by this ELISA protocol. Plasma
        or serum samples may be used fresh or stored frozen. This assay is not adversely
 20     effected by up to 3 freeze and thaw cycles of plasma samples.
                  Reagents should be prepared fresh from a new kit immediately before
        performing the assays. Allow the kit to equilibrate to room temperature prior to use.
        Reagents not explicitly discussed below are provided by the manufacturer ready to
        use.
25           1. Wash solution - wash solution is provided by the manufacturer as a lOX
                 concentrate solution. To make 1 liter of wash solution dilute 100 ml of the
                 lOX concentrate provided with 900 ml of distilled water.
            2. Detector solution - the detector solution is prepared by diluting the detector
                 concentrate 1:101 with the detector diluent. For a full 96 well plate of samples
30               10 ml of detector solution is required. To prepare 10 ml of detector solution
                use a pipette to transfer 10 ml of the blue colored detector diluent to a 15 ml
                                                     22

                    volume of detector diluent.
                        a. NOTE: this reagent should be prepared during the first assay
                           incubation step.
     5        3. Calibrator stock - reconstitute the calibrator protein by dissolving the
                   lyophilized protein in the amount of distilled water defined by the
                   manufacturer for this manufacturing lot to yield a stock solution of 8 ng/ml.
                   This volume specification is included in the product insert.
                  Preparation of standards and samples:

                  to be transferred to the assay plate with the P200 pipetter.
                  Standards:
                  The standard curve is prepared by making 2 fold serial dilutions of the 8 ng/ml
        stock solution.
  15         1. Using a P1000 pipette transfer 250 ptl of Assay Diluent to 8 1.5 ml
                  polypropylene tubes labeled S1-S8.
            2. Using the same P1000 pipette transfer 250 [d of the 8 ng/ml Calibrator stock
                  solution to tube Si. This tube is now 4 ng/ml calibrator protein.
                      a. Mix thoroughly by gently pipetting 3 times being careful not to create
 20                       bubbles.
            3. Using the same P1000 pipette and a fresh tip for each of the following
                 transfer 250 ttl of the reagent in tube SI to tube S2, repeat the mixing.
            4. Repeat step 3 for S2 to S3, S3 to S4, S4 to S5, S5 to S6 and S6 to S7. S8 will
                be the reagent blank so do not transfer the calibrant protein to this well.
25                    a. Tubes S-S6 and S8 will now have 250 [d of reagent and tube S7 will
                          have 450 pl
                Samples:
                The plate is set up so that each sample is analyzed as a 1:3 dilution in
       duplicate.

    5   Example 2. Measurement of Soluble ST2 Concentrations for the Evaluation of
        Patients with Acute Dyspnea
                In this example, the utility of ST2 measurement for evaluation of dyspneic
        patients was assessed.
                The subjects used in this Example took part in the ProBNP Investigation of
  10    Dyspnea in the Emergency Department (PRIDE) Study, a prospective, blinded study
        of 599 dyspneic subjects presenting to the ED of the Massachusetts General Hospital,
       and was performed for the purpose of validation of the diagnostic and prognostic use
       of NT-proBNP testing. The results of the PRIDE study were recently reported
       (Januzzi et al., Am. J. Cardiol. 95(8):948-54 (2005)).
 15             The gold standard for the diagnosis of acute HF was based on the impression
       of reviewing physicians, blinded to NT-proBNP values, who had all available
       information from presentation through the 60-days of follow-up; for the few patients
      in whom a diagnosis was uncertain, the reviewers were instructed to utilize the
      guidelines as reported by the Framingham Heart Study (McKee et al., N. Engl. J.
20    Med. 285(26):1441-6 (1971)).
               As reported, 209 subjects (35%) in the PRIDE study were adjudicated to have
      dyspnea due to acute destabilized HF, of whom 17 had mild (Class 11) symptoms by
      the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, 80 had moderate (Class III)
      symptoms, and 112 had severe (Class IV symptoms). Of those without acute HF, the
25    most common diagnoses were exacerbation of obstructive airways disease (n = 150;
                                                   25

       WO 2007/127749                                                                 PCT/US2007/067333
            includes exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 120) and asthma
            (n = 30) as well as acute pneumonia (n = 64).
                    At the end of one year, the managing physician for each patient was contacted
           to ascertain the vital status of the patient. As reported, follow-up at one year was
     5     complete in 597 subjects overall (Januzzi et al., Arch Intern Med 2006; 166(3):315
           20).
                    NT-proBNP was measured in the PRIDE study using a commercially available
           immunoassay (ELECSYS* ProBNP assay, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN),
          using established methodology. In the PRIDE study, the assay had inter-run
   10     coefficients of variation of 0.9%. Blood collected at the time of presentation was later
          analyzed for concentrations of ST2, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
          (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd.), as described in Example 1 herein.
         This assay utilizes monoclonal antibodies to human ST2 for both capture and
         detection, and had a relative percent difference of 17.5% in the present analysis. The
  15     plasma used for the present study had been previously subjected to a single freeze
         thaw cycle.
                   Comparisons Between Groups
                  Comparisons of clinical characteristics between patients were performed
         utilizing chi-square tests for categorical data and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for
 20     continuous data. Comparisons of ST2 concentrations between diagnostic, New York
        Heart Association (NYHA) symptom classes and outcome categories were performed
        using non-parametric testing.
                  Correlations
                  ST2 and NT-proBNP results were log-transformed to establish normal
25      distribution. Correlations between these log-transformed variables were evaluated
        with the Spearman correlation coefficient. There was a modest correlation between
        concentrations of log-transformed ST2 and log-NT-proBNP in all subjects (r       = 0.58,
       p <0.001), those without acute HF (r = 0.47, p <0.001) and those with acute HF
       (r = 0.40, p <0.001).
30               Cut-point analyses
                 Patient characteristics as a function of an ST2 concentration of above or below
       0.20 ng/ml are detailed in Table 3, which demonstrates the expected prevalence of
       factors consistent with a diagnosis of incident HF.

            These results indicate that ST2 is not generally correlated with BMI, but is associated
            with a number of other indices including serum creatinine levels and clearance, prior
           congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus.
           Example 3. Measurement of Soluble ST2 Concentrations for the Determination
     5     of Risk of Death in Patients with Acute Dyspnea
                   Factors predictive of mortality within one year following presentation with
           dyspnea were evaluated in the population described in Example 2. Candidate ST2
          diagnostic cut points were evaluated with the use of bootstrapping techniques using
          the STATA SWBOOT program; this was followed by multivariable logistic
   10     regression analyses. Each of the estimation procedures was coded in programming
          language then subjected to the STATA bootstrap prefix command for 10 bootstrap
          repeated random samples, followed by 100 replications for those variables selected in
         the initial analyses. The bootstrap sample size was 593 (the size of the entire data
         set). Factors entered into the analysis included elements from past and present
  15     medical history, symptoms and signs, medication use, as well as results of diagnostic
         studies including radiographic studies, electrocardiography, hematology, and blood
         chemistries. Measures of renal function included serum creatinine results as well as
         estimated glomerular filtration rate (Levey et al., Ann. Intern. Med. 130(6):461-70
        (1999)). Following, candidate predictors of mortality (i.e., those with greater than 70
 20     selections in bootstrap replications) were entered into multivariable logistic regression
        analyses, with acute HF as the dependent variable. For each logistic regression,
        results were entered in a single forward step with tail-probability to enter set at p
       0.01 and to remove the effect from the regression at p = 0.02, and goodness-of-fit was
       evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
25               In mortality analyses including NT-proBNP, this variable was modeled
       dichotomously, with a threshold value of 986 pg/ml for predicting death within one
       year, as identified previously (Januzzi et al., 2006, supra). After the SWBOOT run,
       the resulting validated candidate independent variables were entered stepwise into a
       Cox Proportional Hazards model; the proportions for this model were checked and
30     were found to be appropriate. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI (confidence interval)
       were generated for each independent predictor of death by one year.
                Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to compare mortality rates
       within one year in groups divided as a function of ST2 concentrations (as well as
                                                    28

            diagnosis), using the log-rank test to compare the significance of the rates of
            mortality.
                    For all statistical analyses, either SPSS (Chicago, IL, USA) or STATA
           (College Station, TX) software was used; all p values are two-sided, with composite
     5     results <0.05 considered significant.
                    Within one year, 93 subjects (15.7%) had died. The median concentrations of
           ST2 were significantly higher among decedents (1.03 ng/ml, IQR (interquartile range)
           =0.38 -2.43) than survivors (0.18 ng/ml, IQR =0.08 -0.51; p <0.001). This pattern
           of higher ST2 concentrations in decedents remained when subjects were considered as
   1o      a function of the absence of acute HF (1.14 vs 0.13 ng/ml; p <0.001), as well as in
          those with acute HF (0.90 vs 0.45 ng/ml; p <0.001).
                   Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using Analyse-It
          software (Analyse-It, Ltd, Leeds, UK) was performed for ST2, using the gold
          standard diagnosis of HF or survival within one year as the reference standard, and
  15      area under the curve (AUC) was estimated; following, potential cut points for both
          diagnosis and prognosis were identified, and their sensitivity, specificity, as well as
         positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were estimated. To further
         evaluate the utility of optimal ROC-optimal cut-points, patients were also divided into
         deciles based on their ST2 concentrations, and evaluated for ST2 threshold effects on
 20      the frequency of mortality.
                  ROC analyses demonstrated an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI = 0.75 - 0.84, p<0.001)
         for ST2 and one year mortality (Figure 1); the optimal cut point as identified by ROC
        was 0.29 ng/ml, which was 87% sensitive (95% CI = 79 - 93%), 63% specific (95%
        CI = 58 - 67%), and had a PPV of 30% and NPV of 96%. In decile analyses, a
25      threshold effect for mortality was noted at the ST2 median of 0.20 ng/ml (Figure 2).
        A graded relationship between ST2 concentrations and the likelihood for death was
        also found, such that those subjects below the median concentration of ST2 (n = 236)
        enjoyed the lowest rates of death (2%) compared to those in the highest two deciles (n
       = 117) who demonstrated a 42% rate of death within one year, a HR of 43.0 (95% CI
30     =   15.0 - 123.0, p<0.001).
                 In a final bootstrap model for prediction of death within one year (Table 4), an
       ST2 concentration > 0.20 ng/ml was selected in 96 of 100 replications and represented
       the strongest predictor of death within one year in breathless patients (HR = 5.6, 95%

 CI = 2.2-14.2; p <0.001). Notably, even with the inclusion of NT-proBNP into the
 models, an ST2 >0.20 ng/ml remained the most selected variable in bootstrap
 replications (86 of 100 selections), and remained the strongest predictor of death
 within one year (HR=4.6, 95% CI =1.8-11.8; p 0.002).

              The results of Table 4 are based on 100 bootstrap replications, followed by
     multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards analysis are shown in the absence and
     presence of NT-proBNP results in the model. Only those variables selected >70 of
     100 times in bootstrap replications are shown.
10           Kaplan-Meier hazard curves demonstrate that among subjects with ST2
     concentrations > 0.20 ng/ml, rates of death rose rapidly from enrollment, and
    continued to rise within one year (Figure 3A; Log rank p value <0.001). Similar
    relationships between ST2 values > 0.20 ng/ml in those without and with the
    diagnosis of acute HF at presentation (Figure 3B; Log-rank p value for both <0.001).
15           Therefore, ST2 levels are an excellent predictor of mortality.

                  The majority of mortality among subjects in the PRIDE study occurred in
          those with elevated levels of ST2 (equal to or above 0.20 ng/mI) and NT-proBNP
  10     (equal to or above 986 pg/ml) (Table 5 and Figure 4).
                 Thus, the combination of NT-proBNP and ST2 levels is useful in predicting
         risk of mortality.
        Example 5. Elevated ST2 Concentrations in Patients in the Absence of M[
                 ST2 concentrations were determined as described in Example 1, above, in a
 15     population of 350 patients who presented to the ED with chest pain. Serum samples
        were obtained and ST2 measurements made at baseline, and 90 and 180 minutes later
        for most patients. Also, for most patients, the baseline sample was collected within 2
       hours of onset of symptoms.
                17 patients had final diagnosis of MI, and 5 of these had ST2 ; 0.23 (0.25
20     0.65). Two of these patients were troponin negative. 11 patients had very high ST2
       levels (0.97 - 9.22), but none of these patients had confirmed final diagnosis of MI,
       though all had severe diseases, including COPD, lymphoma, sepsis, alcohol abuse,
       and pulmonary embolism. The diagnoses for these 11 patients are shown in Table 6;
      ST2 1 is the baseline level, ST2 2 is 90 minutes later, and ST2 3 is at 180 minutes.

       diagnosed with and admitted for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) to the
       San Diego Veterans' Administration Hospital. Some patients had a new diagnosis of
 10   ADHF and other patients had an acute exacerbation of existing heart failure. Samples
      were taken on successive days in a number of patients, though not every patient gave
      a sample every day. Length of stay (LOS) in the hospital for these patients ranged
      from 1 to 24 days with an average of 5 days. Table 7 shows the characteristics of the
     population; as expected, given that the population was drawn from the San Diego

              In this small and extremely homogeneous population, the biomarkers that
1o   most accurately predicted the reported events included change in ST2 for 30 and 90
     day mortality, and NT-proBNP levels at discharge for both 30 and 90-day mortality.
     As expected, the homogeneity of this cohort resulted in the AUC using the admission
     measurement for each biomarker being lower than what was observed in the PRIDE
     cohort (described in examples 2-3). The high number of patients without diagnosed
15   heart failure reported in the PRIDE cohort resulted in a high discriminatory power of

        ST2 at the admission measurement. In this specialized cohort, where every patient
        already had a diagnosis of heart failure, the ST2 level at admission is expected to be
        somewhat elevated; consequently, the predictive power for subsequent events is
        somewhat diminished as compared to a heterogenous cohort that is more
   5   representative of the general population.
                A univariate model of predictors of 90 day mortality was analyzed including
       the same markers, as well as BUN and creatinine clearance, which are markers of

10            In this analysis, for the dichotomous variables (all but BUN and creatinine) the
      odds ratio represents the increased odds of death within 90 days for a positive test vs.
     a negative test. For the continuous variables (BUN and creatinine) the odds ratio
     represents the increased odds of death within 90 days for each 1 mg/dL increase. As
     shown in Table 10, change in ST2 provided the best indication of 90 day mortality,
15   with an OR of 11.55 (p = 0.002).
             A multivariate model was also constructed that included BNP, NT-ProBNP,
     BUN and creatinine clearance levels with change in ST2. The results are shown in
     Table 11.

                When only change in ST2 (the difference between the ST2 levels) was
       considered, the R2 for the model was 0.223. As can be seen in Table 11, in each case
       change in ST2 was the stronger predictor due to its having the smaller p-value.
   5   Moreover, only admission NT-ProBNP, discharge NT-ProBNP, and admission BUN
       provided additional prediction beyond change in ST2 that achieved a statistical
       significance (p < 0.05) (see bold R2 values), while discharge BNP achieved marginal
      statistical significance (p = 0.07).
               Next, the ROC was compared for change in BNP and change in ST2. As
 10   shown in Figure 5, the AUC for change in BNP during hospitalization was 0.67, while
      the AUC for change in ST2 was 0.78, significantly higher, indicating that change in
      ST2 is a much more accurate predictor of 90-day mortality than BNP.
               The change in ST2 was analyzed in conjunction with BUN levels to determine
     whether the two markers, when used together provided additional predictive
15   information. The results, shown in Figure 6, demonstrate that BUN levels and
     changes in ST2 levels can be used to categorize patients by risk: patients with low
     levels of BUN (less than 40 mg/dL) and levels of ST2 that decreased by 15% or more
     had the lowest risk levels; patients with higher BUN and levels of ST2 that decreased
     by less than 15% (or increased or held steady) had the highest risk levels, while
20   subjects with either high BUN and ST2 decreased by at least 15%, or low BUN and
                                                      37

            ST2 decreased by 15% or more, had a medium level of risk (which was still much
            increased over that of the lowest risk category, see Figure 6).
                    Changes in ST2 levels over time were evaluated on a lapsed-time basis to
            determine an optimal length of time between first and second ST2 measurements.
     5     The results, shown in Tables llA and 11B, indicate that a lapsed time of at least two
           days and within four days between the first and second measurement of ST2 provides
           the best information regarding likelihood of death within 90 days.

       died with a ratio below 0.85 initially decreased and remained low.
                 When average ST2 values over time were tracked in this population, a clear
       increase in correlation of risk of mortality within 90 days was seen at three to four
       days after the initial measurement was made, as shown in Table 12A and Figures 7A

          illustrates that distinction between survivors and decedents is clearly resolved with the
          ST2 value. The ST2 results contrast with results generated by comparing either BNP
          or NT-proBNP over these same days of treatment. Although the mean values for each
          of these markers is distinct between survivors and decedents the groups are not
     5   statistically distinct from each other, as shown in Figures 7C and 7D. Unlike ST2 the
         survivor and decedent groups for BNP and NT-proBNP overlap significantly between
         the 25f' and 75f'percentiles. In this analysis ST2 is a more accurate marker than BNP
         or NT-proBNP alone for predicting mortality as a function of change over time during
         hospitalization.
   10             When average ratios of ST2 were calculated, again, a significant difference
         was seen; the results are shown in Table 12B and Figure 8.

                  These results demonstrate that the change in ST2 over time is a powerful
        predictor of mortality, e.g., within 90 days, in both univariate or multivariate
        predictive analysis; change in ST2 was shown to be the strongest univariate predictor
        of patient outcome in this population, with optimal predictive value seen after 3 days
   5    of hospitalization. Combining change in ST2 data with a measure of renal function
        (e.g., BUN) provided additional predictive value, as did including an NT-proBNP
       measurement with change in ST2.
       Example 7. ST2 Concentrations for Risk Stratification in Patients with
       Pulmonary Disease
 10              Of the 599 subjects in the PRIDE population (described in Examples 2 and 3),
       209 had acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Of the remaining 390 subjects,
      236 had "pulmonary disease"; of those with available data, 5 had uncomplicated
      bronchitis; 18 had pulmonary embolism (PE); 64 had pneumonia; and 149 had
      COPD/asthma. Of the 149 with COPD/asthma, 69 had asthma; 67 had emphysema;
15    and 13 had chronic bronchitis.
                To evaluate the usefulness of ST2 as a marker of risk in these patients, ST2
      levels were assessed in each diagnostic category. Concentrations for each diagnostic
     category are shown in Table 13.

       0.83; P <0.0001). The optimal cut point was 0.20 ng/ml, with 88% sensitivity and
       52% specificity (PPV =22%; NPV = 96%). Figure 10 further illustrates this point.
 10    The median ST2 concentrations in subjects who were still alive at one year was 0.19
      ng/ml (IQR 0.08-0.59, n = 211); while median concentrations in subjects who had
      died within one year were 1.19 ng/ml (IQR 0.28-2.2, n = 25). Finally, as shown in

      using a threshold of 0.2 ng/ml.

   5  Example 8. ST2 Concentrations are Not Affected by Renal Insufficiency
             The effect of renal impairment on ST2 concentrations was evaluated in a
      population of 135 patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency. None of the
     patients were on dialysis, and none were previously diagnosed with CVD. All of the
     patients were evaluated using glomerular filtration rate (GFR in mls/min) as
 10  determined by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) method as a
     measure of renal function. Echocardiography and coronary artery calcium (CAC)
     measurements were also performed on each subject to detect latent CVD. Multiple
     biomarkers were also evaluated.
             The descriptive statistics for this cohort are shown in Table 16; the mean GFR

                These results demonstrate that, as was expected in this population of subjects
        with chronic, managed renal insufficiency, there is no correlation between ST2 levels
        and either GFR (p = 0.75) or creatinine clearance (p = 0.851) in this population. This
        indicates that renal insufficiency, by itself, does not cause an elevation of ST2 levels.
   5            The same analyses were carried out in a population of 139 subjects at the San
       Diego Veteran's Administration Hospital. All of the subjects had previously been
       diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), and the mean ST2 level
       was about twice that seen in the population of patients with chronic renal
       insufficiency but no HF (see tables 17-18). There is an almost ubiquitous correlation
 10   between renal insufficiency and heart failure, with an almost 80% confluence of
      patients with stage I/IV HF also having impaired renal function (Fonarow and
      Heywood, Am. J. Med. (2006) 119(12A):S17-S25. Thus, because ADHF is
      correlated with ST2 levels, one would expect to see a correlation between renal
      insufficiency (as measured by GFR) and ST2 levels. This was exactly what was seen,
15    as shown in Tables 19 and 20.

               These results demonstrate that, in subjects with ADHF, ST2 values, whether
      represented as a single level or a ratio, are correlated with measures of renal
      insufficiency, but are independent of the renal insufficiency.
   5  Example 9. Risk of Mortality Correlates with ST2 Concentrations
              The amount of increased risk of mortality was evaluated in the subjects who
      participated in the PRIDE study and the veterans in the population described in
      Example 8.
              Both 0.2 and 0.7ng/ml ST2 thresholds were evaluated across the entire
 10  population (Table 21) and the just the ADHF subset (Table 22). The biggest
     difference between the two thresholds is that the PPV increases and the NPV
     decreases for the 0.7 ng/ml threshold in both patient sets.
