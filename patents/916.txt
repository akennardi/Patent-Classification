                 DISPOSABLE MODULAR MATERIAL HANDLING CHUTE
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            The present invention relates to material handling equipment and in one
   aspect relates to a disposable ore chute for use in the mining industry.
 5 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            Mineral processing plants typically comprise a range of equipment including
   conveyor systems, screen separators and crushers. In order to transfer the material
   between different pieces of equipment, material handling chutes are typically used.
            These material handling chutes traditionally are constructed typically from
10 12mm mild steel, however the thickness may vary depending upon the application.
   Since the movement of the material through the chutes causes wear, sacrificial wear
   plates are attached to an inner surface of the chute in order to protect the mild steel.
   This liner must be replaced at regular intervals to ensure adequate protection of the
   parent metal.
15          However, due to changes in the material being handled, such as when
   different grades of ore material are being transported, at times there is increased
   wear which may result in an unexpected increase in the rate of wear and therefore
   repair to the underlying parent metal is required.
            Rotable chutes are useful since they can be repeatedly restored to a fully
20 serviceable condition. However, there can be high cost associated with transport of
   the chute being repaired to a manufacturing facility, and/or the stripping, inspection
   and refurbishment of the chute. Depending on the size of the chute, it can take
   several days for the worn liners to be removed and new liners fitted. This may mean
   that the processing plant is out of action for lengthy periods which is costly for
25 commercial enterprises. Furthermore, if the wear liners have been worn away
   partially or completely, the underlying parent metal may need to be repaired, which
   may require the chute to be sent away offsite for repairs. Accordingly, surface
   protection of the parent metal is sometimes used to minimise this risk, however this
   increases the weight of the chute and the cost of the device.

                                                  2
            The replaceable liners or wear plates have to be small enough so that they
   can be lifted and handled by a single person. This means that the inner surface of a
   convention chute is lined with numerous small wear plates. The use of numerous
   small plates results in a plurality of interfaces where they abut, which increases wear
 5 streaming.
            Furthermore, each plate or liner is attached to the patent metal using
   conventional fasteners, such as bolts. The heads of these bolts protrude inwardly of
   the chute which can increase wear and hang up of material.
            Some systems, such as that disclosed in US Patent Application 20070258791
10 to DAVIES, have been proposed which include a fastener system for fixing hardened
   plates includes a fastener element having a frusto-conical head. Although the
   system disclosed in DAVIES goes some way to overcome the problem associate with
   having the head of the bolt protruding inward of the chute the system still use multiple
   wear plates and therefore still suffers from many of the above issues.
15         Accordingly, the current practice of building a chute body from mid steel and
   then lining the inside chute with a plurality of wear plates that are replace when worn
   out, has a range of problems and limitations.
            It should be appreciated that any discussion of the prior art throughout the
   specification is included solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present
20 invention and should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art
   was widely known or formed part of the common general knowledge in the field as it
   existed before the priority date of the application.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
            In one aspect of the invention, but not necessarily the broadest or only
25 aspect, there is proposed a modular disposable material handling chute, comprising:
   a screening chute reversibly attachable to a material handling assembly, the
   screening chute including an inlet for receiving a material therethrough and an outlet;
   and
   a screen discharge chute reversibly attachable to said material handling assembly
30 and engaging or abutting a lower part of said screening chute, the screen discharge
   chute including an inlet, for alignment with said outlet of the screening chute, and an
   outlet for positioning vertically adjacent a conveyor of the material handling

                                                3
   assembly;
   wherein the screening chute and screen discharge chute are constructed from a
   wear resistant hard alloy, whereby upon wearing of the wear resistant hard alloy the
   screening chute or screen discharge chute, or part thereof, are replaceable.
 5          The screen discharge chute and/or screening chute is/are preferably
   attachable to a frame of said material handling assembly.
            In one form the screening chute and screen discharge chute are constructed
   substantially from said wear resistant hard alloy.
            Preferably, the wear resistant hard alloy is a chromium-carbide rich alloy,
10 wherein carbides are embedded in a matrix.
            In one form the screen discharge chute may include four generally planar
   walls, wherein the walls are generally perpendicular to adjoining or adjacent walls. A
   junction between adjacent walls may include an intermediate wall portion oblique to
   each of the adjoining walls.
15          The screen discharge chute may include a rear wall adjoining respective
   intermediate wall portions on either side thereof, opposing side walls adjoining a
   respective intermediate wall portion, and a front wall extending between the opposing
   side walls at an opposite end to said rear wall.
            Preferably, the rear wall and opposing side walls may be at an angle to a
20 vertical axis and the front wall aligns a generally vertical plane or axis.
            The inlet of the screen discharge chute may have a circumferential edge that
   is generally horizontal. The outlet of the screen discharge chute may have a
   circumferential edge that is generally planer and may be at an angle to the horizontal.
           A beam or beams may extend horizontally through the screen discharge
25 chute and/or screening chute. The beam or beams may extend between the front
   and rear walls, and/or between opposing side walls. The beam or beams are
   configured to reduce the velocity of the material as it passes through the screen
   discharge chute and/or screening chute.

                                                4
            In one form a longitudinal beam in the form of a longitudinal impact bar
   extends between the front wall and rear wall, and a lateral beam in the form of a
   lateral impact bar extends between opposing side walls.
            In one form the screening chute may include four walls that are generally
 5 tapered inwardly, downwardly in a vertical direction. Each of the four walls may
   include at least two adjoining generally planar panels. Each of the four walls adjoin
   two adjacent walls, to thereby form a generally rectangular funnel.
            The screening chute may include a rear wall, front wall and opposing side
   walls. The rear wall preferable includes an upper planar panel that is generally
10 vertical and an adjoining lower planar panel having a bottom edge that slopes
   inwardly of the screening chute. The front wall preferably includes an upper planar
   portion having a bottom edge that slopes inwardly of the screening chute and adjoins
   a generally vertical lower planar panel. The opposing side walls preferable include
   respective upper planar panels that are generally vertical and respective adjoining
15 lower planar panels having respective bottom edges that slope inwardly of the
   screening chute.
            The inlet of the screening chute may have a circumferential edge that is at an
   angle to the horizontal and is preferably stepped down above the front wall. The inlet
   is preferably covered by a screen for separation of large conglomerates of material or
20 rocks that may block the chute. The outlet of the screening chute may have a
   circumferential edge that is generally planer and is horizontal. The outlet of the
   screening chute may be configured to engage or at least abut the inlet of the screen
   discharge chute.
            Fixing brackets may be attached to respective outer surfaces of the screening
25 chute and/or screen discharge chute to facilitate connection to the frame of the
   material handling assembly.
            Each fixing bracket of the screen discharge chute may comprise a mono rail
   and a removable lifting point, to assist with the easy removal and installation of the
   screen discharge chute.
30          The material that is moving through the material handling chute may be an
   ore material, mineral, rock, sand, gravel, in any state from run-of-mine, (ROM) to any
   processed form.

                                                5
           Preferably ore material would pass from a bin or hopper through the material
   handling chute and be deposited onto a conveyor belt that transports the ore material
   to a desired location.
           Wear plates or lines may be attached to an inner surface or inner surfaces of
 5 the modular disposable material handling chute in locations where the greatest
   amount of wear would occur.
           In one form, the rear walls of the screening chute and screen discharge chute
   comprise 20 mm overlay wear material on a 12 mm steel backing plate or framework,
   which is where most of the wear will occur. The opposing side walls of the screening
10 chute and screen discharge chute may comprise 17 mm overlay wear material on a
   12 mm steel backing plate or framework, and the front wall of the screening chute
   and screen discharge chute comprises a 10 mm overlay wear material on a 12 mm
   steel backing plate or framework, since this is where the least amount of wear will
   occur.
15         In this way, the thickness of the walls may be tailored such that it is thicker
   where the most amount of wear will occur, while minimising the overall weight of the
   material handling chute.
           A plurality of wear resistant plates may be attached to opposing side walls of
   the screen discharge chute adjacent the rear wall.
20         However, the skilled addressee will appreciate that the chute may be
   constructed substantially from a wear resistant material, wherein the main body of
   the chute is formed by wear resistant material, but may include some limited mild
   steel backing or framework.
           In another aspect of the invention there is proposed a method of forming a
25 chute for a material handling assembly, including the steps of:
   providing a modular disposable material handling chute, comprising a screening
   chute and a screen discharge chute;
   attaching the screen discharge chute to a frame of said material handling assembly,
   whereby an outlet of the screen discharge chute is positioned vertically adjacent a
30 conveyor of the material handling assembly;
   positioning the screening chute such that an outlet thereof aligns an inlet of said
   screen discharge chute;

                                                 6
   wherein when said modular disposable material handling chute is worn down by a
   predetermined amount by a material passing therethrough, said screening chute
   and/or said screen discharge chute or part/s thereof may be replaced.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED AND EXEMPLIFIED
   EMBODIMENTS
           Similar reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the
15 drawings. Dimensions of certain parts shown in the drawings may have been
   modified and/or exaggerated for the purposes of clarity or illustration.
           Referring to the drawings for a more detailed description, there is illustrated a
   modular material handling chute 10, demonstrating by way of examples,
   arrangements in which the principles of the present invention may be employed.
20         Figure 1 illustrates an embodiment of the modular disposable material
   handling chute 10 for use in a material handling assembly 12. The material handling
   assembly 12 comprises a base frame 14, conveyor 16, conveyor rollers 18 and
   support beams 20. Other parts are illustrated and will not be described since they
   are common to the art and are not particularly relevant to description of the present
25 invention.
           Furthermore, some components are not illustrated, for instance, the
   feed/surge bin or hopper is not shown, which allows for a supply of ore material to
   build up in the bin. This is normally needed because the ore supply is not constant.

                                                 8
   This stock pile of ore flows out of the bin at a designed rate to ensure a constant
   supply to the rest of the processing plant.
           As further illustrated in Figure 1, the modular disposable material handling
   chute 10 includes a screening chute 22 and a screen discharge chute 24.
 5          Figure 2 illustrates the screening chute 22 and screen discharge chute 24,
   wherein a material 26 is received in through the inlet 28 of the screening chute 22 in
   the direction of the arrow and then passes downwardly through the modular material
   handling chute 10 and exits through the outlet 30 of the screen discharge chute 24, in
   the direction of the arrow. The reader should appreciate that the shading of the lower
10 screen discharge chute 24 is provided to simply distinguish the different parts of the
   modular material handling chute 10.
            The screen discharge chute 24, as illustrated in Figures 3 to 7, includes a rear
   wall 32, opposing side walls 34, 36, and a front wall 38. Intermediate wall portions
   40, 42 are positioned between the rear wall 32 and respective side walls 34 or 36.
15 The intermediate wall portions 40, 42 are oblique to the adjoining walls.
            The walls, 32, 34, 36, 38 and intermediate wall portions 40, 42 are generally
   planar and upper edges thereof form a circumferential edge 44, which delineates an
   inlet 46. The circumferential edge 44 is generally positioned along a horizontal
   plane, whereas the circumferential edge 48 of the outlet 30 is at an angle to the
20 horizontal. The skilled addressee should however appreciate that the circumferential
   edges 44 and 48 may be at different angle to that discussed above and may be of a
   configuration that is not generally planar.
           As illustrated in Figure 4, when viewed from above the rear wall 32 and
   opposing side walls 34, 36 are angled inwardly, downwardly in a vertical direction,
25 while the front wall 38 generally aligns a vertical plane.
           As can be best seen in Figure 3, the screen discharge chute 24 is constructed
   from a wear resistant hard alloy plate 50, that is folded or joined to provide a smooth
   inner surface for the chute. An outer framework or lattice 52 surrounds the wear
   resistant plate material and may be constructed from a mild steel. The wear resistant
30 hard alloy plate 50 is fixed to the mild steel outer framework or lattice 52, by way of
   welding or other conventional means.

                                                  9
           As illustrated in Figures 8 to 12, the screening chute 22 also includes four
   walls each having at least a portion that is generally tapered inwardly, downwardly in
   a vertical direction, as best illustrated in Figures 8, 9 and 10, to thereby form a
   generally rectangular funnel.
 5          The screening chute 22 is likewise constructed from wear resistant hard alloy
   plate 54, that is folded or joined to provide a smooth inner surface for the chute, and
   an outer framework or lattice 56 that may be constructed from a mild steel.
            The four walls of the screening chute 22 of the present embodiment comprise
   a rear wall 58, front wall 60 and opposing side walls 62, 64. The rear wall 58
10 includes an upper panel 66 that is generally vertical and an adjoining lower panel 68
   having a bottom edge that slopes inwardly of the screening chute 22. The front wall
   60 includes an upper portion 70 having a bottom edge that slopes inwardly of the
   screening chute 22 and adjoins a generally vertical lower panel 72. The opposing
   side walls 62, 64 include a respective upper panel 74 or 76, which are generally
15 vertical and a respective adjoining lower panel 78 or 80, having respective bottom
   edges that slopes inwardly of the screening chute 22.
            The inlet 28 of the screening chute 22 has a circumferential edge 82 that is at
   an angle to the horizontal and is stepped down vertically above the front wall 60. The
   outlet 84 of the screening chute 22 has a circumferential edge 86 that is generally
20 planer and horizontal. The outlet 84 of the screening chute 22 is configured to
   engage or at least abut the inlet 46 of the screen discharge chute 24, as will be
   discussed with respect to Figure 14.
            Figure 13 illustrates a side cross-sectional view of another embodiment of the
   modular disposable material handling chute 10, illustrating the beams 88, 90 of the
25 material handling assembly 12 that need to be removed for installation of the present
   invention.
           As further illustrated in Figure 13, in one embodiment a horizontal longitudinal
   beam 92 extends between the rear wall 32 and front wall 38 of the screen discharge
   chute 24, and a horizontal lateral beam 94 extending between opposing side walls
30 34, 36. The beams 92, 94 are configured to act as impact bars to thereby reduce the
   velocity of the ore material 26 as it passes through the screen discharge chute 24, to
   prevent damage to the conveyor 16.

                                                 10
            In the present embodiment, wear plates or liners 96 may be attached to an
   inner surface or surfaces of the modular disposable material handling chute 10 at
   specific locations where the greatest amount of wear would occur. The localised use
   of wear plates or liners may be used to increase the usable lifespan of the modular
 5 disposable material handling chute 10, but are not essential.
            As illustrated in Figure 14 the horizontal abutment interface between the
   underside 86 of the screening chute 22 and the upper edge 44 of the screen
   discharge chute 24 includes a rubber locating member or seal 98. Furthermore, as
   illustrated in Figure 14 the inner surface of the screening chute 22 overhangs the
10 inner surface of the screen discharge chute 24, to inhibit hang up of material or
   increased wear at the horizontal interface between the screening chute 22 and
   screen discharge chute 24.
            The reader should appreciate that the measurements provided in Figures 13,
    14 and 16 to 18 are provided as illustrative only and the scope of the invention is not
15 limited thereto.
            Figure 15 illustrates an upper portion of a conventional chute 100, overlaying
   an upper part of the chute 10 of the present invention. The figure compares the
   configuration of the chute of the present invention against that of a conventional
   chute. As illustrated, the contour of the rear wall increases from 60 degree in the
20 conventional chute 100, to 75 degrees in the chute 10 of the present invention. This
   results in a larger outlet 30 for the chute 10 compared to existing chutes.
            Figures 16 to 19 illustrate a further embodiment of the screen discharge chute
   24 that includes fixing brackets 11 Oa, 11 Ob, 11 Oc, 11 Od, attached to the outer surface
   of opposing walls 34, 36. Each of the fixing bracket 11 Oa, 11 Ob, 11 Oc, 11 Od includes
25 a respective mono rail 112 and a removable lifting point 114, to assist with the easy
   removal of the screen discharge chute 24. The screening chute 22 may also include
   similar fixing brackets but will not be shown in detail.
            Figure 20 illustrates the interface between wall 34 and adjoining intermediate
   wall portion 42. A fabricator leaves a gap of approximately 2 mm and forces wire into
30 joint at 120. The gap 120 may need to be opened up with cutting disc.

                                                11
           The channel at 122 may also need to be opened up by a fabricator with
   grinding disc. The fabricator then welds the junction from the mild steel side and
   grinds flush.
           The interface between walls of the screening chute 22 may likewise be
 5 constructed.
           Although not illustrated the thickness of the walls may be varied and tailored
   such that they are thicker where the most amount of wear will occur, while minimising
   the overall weight of the material handling chute 10. Furthermore, this overcomes
   the issues of having wear liners of different thicknesses, which may get mixed up
10 during installation. The difference between 10mm liners on 12mm parent metal
   verses 20mm liners on 12mm parent metal is oblivious, however when installing
   17mm liners on 12mm parent metal verses 20mm liners on 12mm parent metal,
   mistakes can easily be made with existing systems.
           The skilled addressee will now appreciate the advantages of the illustrated
15 invention over the prior art. In one form the invention provides a disposable modular
   chute therein there is no, or limited, handling of small wear liners during replacement
   thereof, which reduces the risk of manual handling injuries. The removal of the old
   disposable chute and replacement with a new disposable chute also reduces
   maintenance time and means there is no requirement to repair a mild steel parent
20 metal chute. Furthermore, there is no requirement for surface protection of the mild
   steel patent metal since the chute can be disposed of or recycled at the end of its
   working life.
           The use of large sections of wear resistant material, instead of multiple small
   plates, results in less interfaces which thereby reduces wear streaming and
25 increasing the working life of the wear resistant material.
           Another advantage of the present invention is that it reduces the overall mass
   by removal of the chute shell. Therefore, the liner material can be thicker and
   heavier, where it was previously restricted, because of the additional mass of the
   chute shell.
30         The present invention may also reduce the costs of labour associate with
   removing and replacing the multiple wear plates, and the downtime of the processing
   plant when a chute is being repaired.
