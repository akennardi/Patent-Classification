                                                                1
                                  Sequence symmetric modified IgG4 bispecific antibodies
                The entire disclosure in the complete specification of our Australian Patent
   Application No. 2013224003 is by this cross-reference incorporated into the present
 5 specification.
                The present invention relates to a bispecific IgG4 antibody having an altered
   arrangement of disulphide bonds compared to a wild type antibody and a method to produce
   the improved antibody. In a further aspect the present disclosure provides an efficient method
   for preparing bispecific antibodies.
10        The biopharmaceutical                 industry encompassing     recombinant  proteins,    monoclonal
   antibodies (mAbs) and nucleic acid-based drugs is growing rapidly. Antibody engineering
   has resulted in the design and production of antibody fragments or alternative formats.
   Preferred molecular format along with other aspects such as production yield, protein quality
   and storage stability are taken into consideration when selecting an antibody-based protein as
15 a therapeutic agent.
          The basic structure of all immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules comprises two identical heavy
   chains (HCs) and two identical light chains (LCs) which are coupled by disulphide bonds.
   Each LC consists of a variable (VL) and constant domain (CL). Based on the HC, five main
   Ig classes are recognized: IgG, IgA, IgD, IgE and IgM. For IgG, the HC consists of one
20 variable domain (VH) and three constant domains (CH1-3).                   The CH2 and CH3 domains form
   the Fc part of the molecule that is responsible for stimulating effector function and is linked
   to the Fab fragment (VHVL and                  CHCL)  by a hinge region which confers flexibility to the IgG
   molecule. Two antigen recognition sites are located at the ends of the VL and VH domains.
   IgG is further subdivided into 4 different isotypes: IgGI, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4.
25        Fc-mediated                effector functions i.e. antibody   dependent cytotoxicity     (ADCC)     or
   complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) are isotype dependent. Each isotype has evolved
   to perform a specific function within the body.                    The IgGI isotype is currently the most
   widely used as a therapeutic due to its extended half-life, enhanced ADCC activation and
   complement activation. Other isotypes are employed as therapeutic agents as appropriate to
30 the target and desired effect. For instance, when target antigens are simply to be neutralized
   and effector functions are less important, alternative isotypes such as IgG2 and IgG4 can be
   used. Alternatively, IgG with re-engineered Fc/effector function may be considered.

         IgG2 also has minimal associated effector function but is prone to dimerisation which is
   not fully understood.
         IgG4 remains a useful isotype because of its relative lack of effector function induction.
   However, IgG4 also has some inherent practical difficulties namely its shorter serum half-life
 5 and its ability to undergo "Fab-arm exchange" (also referred to as dynamic heavy chain
   exchange or heavy chain exchange), wherein the heavy chain and its attached light chain of
   one antibody is exchanged with the heavy chain and its attached light chain of another
   antibody to form another whole antibody composed of two heavy chains and two attached
   light chains (van der Neut Kolfschoten et al., 2007 Science 317, 1554-1557).
10       In vivo, Fab-arm exchange results in bispecific antibodies that, due to their different
   variable domains, can co-engage distinct target antigens. This produces a large percentage of
   circulating IgG4 which have been observed to be bispecific, but functionally monovalent. (
   Schuurman,J., Van Ree,R., Perdok,G.J., Van Doom,H.R., Tan,K.Y., Aalberse,R.C., 1999.
   Normal human immunoglobulin G4 can be bispecific: it has two different antigen-combining
15 sites. Immunology 97, 693-698).
         In vitro, when IgG4 antibodies are analysed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, they have been
   observed to form so called ' halfmolecules'           each comprising a single covalently assatiated
   heavy-light chain pair caused by the absence of inter heavy chain disulphide bonds typically
   due to the formation of intra heavy chain disulphide bonds within the hinge region. The
20 heavy chain of a "half-molecule" may non-covalently associate with its heavy chain paired
   partner, the association being maintained by CH3:CH3 domain interactions. In solution such
   ' halfmolecules' are actually observed using methods suchas size exclusion chromatography
   to be full sized, that is approximately 150kDa but on non-reducing SDS-PAGE are comprised
   of 75kDa LC:HC pairings (so-called "half-molecule").
25       A Ser to Pro mutation at position 241 (numbered according to the Kabat numbering
   system) in the hinge reduces the appearance of these ' half molecules' by no-reducing, SDS
   PAGE (Angal,S. et al., 1993. A single amino acid substitution abolishes the heterogeneity of
   chimeric mouse/human (IgG4) antibody as observed during SDS-PAGE analysis Mol
   Immunol 30, 105-108).             In addition, this point mutation does not influence the compact
30 structure of IgG4 thereby allowing IgG4 to retain its reduced ability to activate complement.
         Following the discovery of the S241P mutation, further mutations to IgG4 have been
   investigated in order to understand the inter-heavy chain interaction in IgG4 antibodies,
   reduce IgG4 effector function and enhance structural stability.               In Schuurman et al.

   (Schuurman,J et al., 2001. The inter-heavy chain disulphide bonds of IgG4 are in equilibrium
   with intra-heavy chain disulphide bonds. Molecular Immunology 38, 1-8), the observed
   instability of inter-heavy chain disulphide bonds of IgG4 was investigated using IgG4
   mutants. In mutant M1 Cys 131 (numbered according to EU numbering system or Cys 127
 5 according to Kabat numbering system), which is involved in the inter-heavy-light chain (CL
   CHI)     disulphide bond, was replaced by serine and it was found that this mutant resulted in the
   formation of dimers of light chains and dimers of heavy chains. In mutant M2 cysteine 226
   (226 numbered according to EU numbering system or 239 according to Kabat numbering
   system), which is involved in an inter-heavy chain disulphide bond in the hinge, was replaced
10 by serine and it was found that this mutant had a more stable inter-heavy chain linkage
   compared to IgG4 and prevents the formation of an intra-heavy chain disulphide bond.
         Mutations in the CH2 and CH3 domains of IgG4 antibodies have also been investigated in
   order to reduce the formation of aggregates of IgG4 antibodies. US 2008/0063635 Takahashi
   et al. has investigated a mutant of IgG4 in which arginine at position 409 (409 numbered
15 according to EU numbering system or 440 numbered according to the Kabat numbering
   system) in the CH3 domain is substituted with lysine, threonine, methionine or leucine in
   order to inhibit aggregate formation at low pH. Further mutations at L235, D265, D270,
   K322, P329 and P331 (L235, D265, D270, K322, P329 and P331 numbered according to EU
   numbering system or L248, D278, D283, K341, P348 and P350 numbered according to the
20 Kabat         numbering           system) are also taught in order to attenuate   CDC activity.
   W02008/145142 Van de Winkel et al. discloses stable IgG4 antibodies that have a reduced
   ability to undergo Fab-arm exchange by substitution of the arginine residue at position 409,
   the Phe residue at position 405 or the Lys at position 370 (R409, F405 and K370 numbered
   according to EU numbering system or R440, F436 and K393 numbered according to the
25 Kabat numbering system) even in the absence of the S228P (S228 numbered according to EU
   numbering system or S241 according to the Kabat numbering system) mutation in the hinge
   region.
          The present invention provides new mutant antibodies which have advantageous
   properties including improved biophysical properties compared to wild-type antibodies, in
30 particular wild-type IgG4 antibodies and fragments. In particular it has been surprisingly
   found that a change of the location of the cysteine residue in the heavy chain of an IgG4
   antibody which forms a disulphide bond with a cysteine in the light chain provides an IgG4
   antibody having improved stability compared to a wild-type IgG4 antibody. It has also been

                                                                4
   found that the mutant IgG4 antibodies are capable of forming bispecific antibodies having
   advantageous Fab-arm exchange properties.
         In vitro the exchange of the Fab-arms can be promoted by employing high concentrations
   of antibodies and/or employing chemical stimulants such as glutathione to generate a
 5 bispecific format that is stable and suitable for use as a therapeutic agent.                       This has
   application in the field pharmaceutical biological products because bispecific entities can be
   difficult to express as a single construct.

                Summary of the Invention
                In one aspect, the present invention provides a symmetric bispecific antibody of the
   class IgG4 comprising two heavy chains which each comprise a variable region, a CHI
15 domain and a hinge region, wherein in each heavy chain:
                        a. the cysteine in the CHI domain which forms an inter-chain disulphide bond
                               with a cysteine in a light chain is substituted with another amino acid; and
                       b. one or more of the amino acids positioned in the upper hinge region is
                               substituted with cysteine,
20 wherein the constant region sequence of each heavy chain is similar or identical and the
   variable region in each heavy chain is different.
                In one embodiment the cysteine in the CHI domain which forms an inter-chain
   disulphide bond with a cysteine in a light chain is the cysteine at position 127, numbered
   according to the Kabat numbering system, for example as shown in Figure lb.
25              In one embodiment the inter-chain cysteine at position 127, numbered according to
   the Kabat numbering system, in the CH I domain is substituted with another amino acid in one
   or both heavy chains.
                The one or more amino acids positioned in the upper hinge region which are
   substituted with cysteine may be selected from 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 237 and 238,
30 numbered according to the Kabat numbering system, as shown in Figure lb (underlined
   amino acids in upper hinge region).                     In one embodiment the one or more amino acids
   positioned in the upper hinge region which are substituted with cysteine are one or more of
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                               5
   the amino acids at positions selected from 227, 228, 229 and 230, numbered according to the
   Kabat numbering system, as shown in Figures lb and 2a.
                In one embodiment a mutation to cysteine at position 229 reduces Fab-arm exchange.
                In one embodiment a mutation to cysteine at position 230 in combination with a
 5 mutation at position 241 to a non-polar amino acid, for example selected from proline,
   alanine, glycine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and valine, is employed.
                In one embodiment Fab-arm may be increased employing a mutation to a                  polar
   residue, for example selected rom arginine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, lysine,
   threonine and tyrosine, such as threonine.
10              In one embodiment there is provide a mutation at position 241 to a non-polar amino
   acid, for example selected from proline, alanine, glycine, isoleucine, phenylalanine,
   tryptophan and valine, is employed.
                In a further aspect, the present invention also provides a symmetric bispecific
   antibody of the class IgG4 comprising two heavy chains which each comprise a variable
15 region, a CHI domain and a hinge region, wherein in each heavy chain:
                        a. the cysteine at position 127, numbered according to the Kabat numbering
                               system, is substituted with another amino acid; and
                       b. the cysteine at position 239 or the cysteine at position 242, numbered
                               according to the Kabat numbering system, are substituted with another amino
20                             acid,
   wherein the constant region sequence of each heavy chain is similar or identical and the
   variable region in each heavy chain is different.
                The antibodies provided by the present invention have no effector function and may
   show advantageous properties compared to a wild-type IgG4 antibody, for example improved
25 stability, such as improved thermal stability.
                Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory it is hypothesized that the modified hinge in
   the antibodies according to the present disclosure relieves internal strain inherent in the IgG4
   molecule and thereby promotes improved stability.
                The natural processes of heavy chain exchange can be promoted in IgG4 antibodies to
30 facilitate the preparation of bispecific IgG4 antibodies according to the present disclosure, for
   example in vitro by employing high concentrations of antibodies and/or employing a
   chemical stimulant of exchange such as glutathione.

                The antibodies of the present disclosure may be beneficial in that they have improved
   stability over wild-type IgG4 molecules and/or improved heavy chain exchange.                  The
   antibodies of the present invention may demonstrate reduced heavy chain exchange
   compared to wild-type IgG4, which provides a bispecific antibody which demonstrates little
 5 or no exchange with wild-type IgG4 in vivo due to its reduced propensity to exchange
   compared to IgG4 and also due to the relatively low concentration of a bispecific antibody in
   vivo compared to natural circulating IgG4 antibodies.
                Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory it is thought that the exchange between
   similar type constructs as those described according to the present invention is more
10 favorable than exchange between a construct of the present disclosure and a wild-type IgG4.
                The bispecific antibodies of the present invention may demonstrate reduced heavy
   change exchange at concentrations greater than in vivo concentrations, for example
   concentrations of 0.5mM or less compared to IgG4 wild type.                  Whilst the bispecific
   antibodies of the invention demonstrate reduced heavy chain exchange compared to wild type
15 IgG4, they do demonstrate a degree of heavy chain exchange, compared to IgG1 wt and IgG4
   S241P, which is sufficient to create the bispecific antibody from two antibodies having
   different antigen specificities in vitro. The symmetry in the constant region of the constructs
   herein advantageously minimizes the internal strain of the antibody and therefore aids
   stability.
20              Accordingly, the present invention also provides method of generating a symmetric
   bispecific antibody comprising the step of mixing a first IgG4 antibody with a second IgG4
   antibody ex vivo, under conditions conducive to heavy chain exchange, wherein the antigen
   specificity of variable regions in the first the antibody are different to antigen specificity of
   the variable regions in the second antibody.
25              The method of the present disclosure allows the efficient preparation of bispecific
   symmetrical antibodies employing only routine techniques and stimulation of naturally
   occurring processes.

   Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments of the Invention
   The present invention will now be described in more detail.
                A symmetric antibody as employed herein is antibody or antibody fragment wherein
   the heavy chains have a similar or identical sequence in the region outside the variable
 5 regions.
                Similar as employed herein is wherein the amino acid sequence is 95% or greater
   identity over the whole sequence analyzed, for example 96, 97, 98 or 99% identity.               The
   percentage identity can be assessed using software known to those skilled in the art.
                Identical as employed herein refers to where there is a 100% sequence identity over
10 the sequence analyzed, for example over the whole sequence.
                In one embodiment the heavy chain sequences in the antibodies of the present
   disclosure are covalently linked, for example through an inter-chain disulfide bond, for
   example a bond that is present naturally in the corresponding wild-type fragment or a bond
   that has been genetically engineered to be present in the desired location in the chains.
15              In one aspect the antibodies of the present disclosure are characterized in that both of
   the heavy chain sequences or fragments have an IgGI type hinge.
                The wild-type IgGI upper and core hinge has the sequence EPKSCDKTHTCPPCP
   (SEQ ID No: 224).
                The wild-type IgG4 upper and core hinge has the sequence EPKYGPPCPSCP (SEQ
20 ID No: 225).
          IgGI type hinge as employed herein is intended to refer to wherein one or more, for
   example 1 to 5, such as 1, 2 or 3 amino acids are inserted into the IgG4 hinge, in particular
   between EPKYGPP (SEQ ID No: 319) and CPSC and/or one or more of the amino acids
   YGPP in the IgG4 hinge are replaced, for example to correspond to an amino acid in the
25 IgG 1 hinge, in particular G (from YGPP in the IgG4 hinge) is replaced with C or where Y
   (from YGPP in the IgG4 hinge) is replaced with C or S.
                Thus the present invention also provides a symmetric bispecific antibody comprising
   IgG4 heavy chains with an upper hinge, core and lower hinge, wherein said upper hinge and
   core in the heavy chain or each heavy chain therein has a length of 13 to 17, such as 15
30 amino acids.
                In one embodiment the symmetric bispecific antibody with a first IgG4 heavy chain
   has an upper hinge and core of 15 amino acids in length.

                In one embodiment the upper hinge and core of the heavy chains comprises the
   natural 12 amino acids found in an IgG4 hinge and a further three amino acids, for example 3
   alanine residues, or 3 glycine residues or a combination thereof.
                In one embodiment the hinge has the one of the following sequences:

                In one embodiment the core hinge region in one or both heavy chain sequences or
   fragments thereof has the sequence CPPCP SEQ ID No: 318.
                Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory it is thought that this sequence is likely to
   block dynamic exchange of the antibody arms at "in vivo" type concentrations for example
30 concentration of less than 0.5mM reductant, in particular concentrations of reductant in the
   order of 5uM are thought to be physiologically relevant (Zilmer et al., 2005 Drug Design

                In one embodiment of the present invention, each heavy chain of the bispecific
   antibody has identical upper and core hinge regions selected from the sequences above, and
   may also have an identical lower hinge region. In a further embodiment, each heavy chain of
   the bispecific antibody has identical CHI regions, and may also have identical CH2 and CH3
 5 regions. Accordingly, each heavy chain may have identical heavy chain constant region
   sequences.
                "Different variable regions" as employed herein is intended to refer to wherein the
   said variable regions have specificity for different antigens. That is to say that the antigen to
   which each variable region is specific is a different antigen or a different part of an antigen,
10 eg a different epitope.
                "Specific" as employed herein refers to the fact the binding domains recognized a
   target antigen with greater affinity and/avidity than other antigens to which it is not specific
   (for example 10, 20, 50, 10 or 1000 greater). It does not necessarily imply that the specific
   binding region does not bind any non-target antigens but rather the interaction with the target
15 is such that it can be used to purify the target antigen (to which it is specific) from a complex
   mixture of antigens, including antigens in the same family of proteins.
                In one embodiment the antibody according to the present disclosure is isolated.
                Isolated as employed herein is intended to refer to an antibody that is isolated from
   the human body, for example: prepared by recombinant techniques, purified using a
20 technique such as chromatography, and/or in a pharmaceutical formulation.
                The present invention also provides an expression vector comprising a sequence
   which encodes the antibodies of the present invention and a host cell comprising the
   expression vector.
                The present invention also provides an antibody as defined above for use in the
25 treatment of a disease or disorder. Further provided is a method for the treatment of a disease
   or disorder comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody as
   defined above.
                In one embodiment the antibody according the present disclosure comprises one or
   two heavy chain sequences independently selected from a heavy chain sequence disclosed
30 herein.
                The terms "protein" and "polypeptide" are used interchangeably herein, unless the
   context indicates otherwise. "Peptide" is intended to refer to 10 or less amino acids.

                The terms "polynucleotide" includes a gene, DNA, cDNA, RNA, mRNA etc unless
   the context indicates otherwise.
                As used herein, the term "comprising" in context of the present specification should
   be interpreted as "including".
 5              The term "wild-type" in the context of the present invention means an antibody as it
   may occur in nature or may be isolated from the environment, which does not comprise any
   genetically engineered mutations.
                The designation for a substitution mutant herein consists of a letter followed by a
   number followed by a letter.         The first letter designates the amino acid in the wild-type
10 protein. The number refers to the amino acid position where the amino acid substitution is
   being made, and the second letter designates the amino acid that is used to replace the wild
   type amino acid.
   The residues in antibody variable and constant domains are conventionally numbered
   according to a system devised by Kabat et al. This system is set forth in Kabat et al., 1987,
15 in Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, US Department of Health and Human
   Services, NIH, USA (hereafter "Kabat et al. (supra)").
                The Kabat residue designations do not always correspond directly with the linear
   numbering of the amino acid residues. The actual linear amino acid sequence may contain
   fewer or additional amino acids than in the strict Kabat numbering corresponding to a
20 shortening of, or insertion into, a structural component, whether framework or
   complementarity determining region (CDR), of the basic variable domain structure. The
   correct Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment of
   residues of homology in the sequence of the antibody with a "standard" Kabat numbered
   sequence.
25 Alternatively, the numbering of amino acid residues may be performed by the EU-index or
   EU numbering system (also described in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of
   Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health,
   Bethesda, MD. (1991)).
   A further numbering system of amino acid residues in antibodies is the IMGT numbering
30 system (Lefranc, M.-P. et al., Dev. Comp. Immunol., 29, 185-203 (2005)).
                The Kabat numbering system is used in the present specification except where
   otherwise indicated that the EU numbering system or IMGT numbering system is used.

                Between the four IgG4 isotypes, the intrachain disulphide bonding arrangements in
   the heavy and light chain are similar whereas the interchain disulphide bonding arrangements
   are unique for each isotype [Reviewed by (Wypych,J., Li,M., Guo,A., Zhang,Z., Martinez,T.,
   Allen,M.J., Fodor,S., Kelner,D.N., Flynn,G.C., Liu,Y.D., Bondarenko,P.V., Ricci,M.S.,
 5 Dillon,T.M., Balland,A., 2008. Human IgG2 antibodies display disulphide-mediated
   structural isoforms. J Biol Chem. 283, 16194-16205)].
                As shown in Figure 1b, the hinge region sequences of the four IgG4 isotypes differ.
   The complete or genetic hinge region typically consists of residues 226 to 251 (numbering
   based on Kabat numbering system). Figure lb shows the upper, core and lower sections of
10 the hinge regions of the four IgG4 isotypes. For the IgGI isotype, the upper hinge region is
   residues 226 to 238, the core hinge region is residues 239 to 243 and the lower hinge region
   is residues 244 to 251. For the IgG4 isotype, the upper hinge region is residues 226 to 238,
   the core hinge region is residues 239 to 243 and the lower hinge region is residues 244 to
   251.         The new mutant IgG4 antibodies according to the present invention have been
15 developed by modifying the interchain disulphide bond arrangements within IgG4,
   specifically the              CL-CHl interchain disulphide bond arrangement between the light chain (LC)
   and heavy chain (HC) has been modified.
                Figure lb shows sections of the human IgG heavy and light chain sequences for the
   IgG 1-4 isotypes indicating the cysteine positions (underlined) that form the CL-CHI
20 interchain disulphide bonds. The inter CL-CH1 disulphide bond of IgGI is formed between
   the LC C214 (Kabat numbering system) and C233 (Kabat numbering system) of the HC just
   before the hinge region. In contrast, the CHl-CL disulphide bond for IgG2, 3 and 4 is formed
   between the LC C214 and C 127 N-terminal to the intrachain disulphide bond of the HC. The
   LC and HC sequences surrounding the cysteine residues involved in the CL-CH1 disulphide
25 bond formation are shown and aligned in Figure lb.
                The present invention has investigated how the CL-CH1 disulphide bond affects the
   properties of an IgG4 antibody including the thermostability, structural stability and affinity
   of the antibody.
                Mutants of IgG4 were generated by substitution of the cysteine residue in CHl at
30 position 127 with another amino acid as well as substituting one or more of the amino acids
   in the upper hinge region, preferably amino acids at positions selected from 227, 228, 229
   and 230, numbered according to the Kabat numbering system, with cysteine. Positions 227,
   228, 229 or 230 are at or near to the position that the IgGI cysteine 233 is situated.

                                                      19
                Each heavy chain may comprise further mutations including the substitution of one or
   both cysteine residues 239 and 242 in the IgG4 hinge region with another amino acid. A
   mutation to lengthen the IgG4 hinge region by three amino acids between positions 238 and
   239 to be the same length as the IgGI hinge was also included in some antibodies. The
 5 S241P mutation was also introduced in some antibodies.
                The formation of half molecules of IgG4 can be reduced by introduction of a Ser to
   Pro mutation at position 241 (numbered according to the Kabat numbering system) in the
   hinge (Angal,S. et al., 1993. A single amino acid substitution abolishes the heterogeneity of
   chimeric mouse/human (IgG4) antibody. Mol Immunol 30, 105-108). In addition, this point
10 mutation did not influence the compact structure of IgG4 thereby allowing IgG4 to retain its
   reduced ability to activate complement.
                However, in vitro exchange of these mutated antibodies can be promoted by using
   high concentrations of antibodies, for example 1-10mIM or more, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
   9mM.It has been found that the mutant IgG4 antibodies according to the present invention
15 show advantageous properties, for example improved stability.
                In one embodiment, the mutant IgG4 antibodies according to the present invention
   show increased thermostability compared to a wild-type IgG4 antibody.                It has been
   surprisingly found that the mutant IgG4 antibodies which have been mutated to replace the
   cysteine at position 127 in the CHI domain with another amino acid and in which a cysteine
20 has been introduced in the heavy chain hinge region between positions 227 to 230 show
   improved thermostability compared to a wild type IgG4 antibody. The mutation to remove
   cysteine at position 127 alters the position at which the inter-chain disulphide bond forms
   between the heavy chain and the light chain (CL-CH1) and forces the light chain to form a
   disulphide bond with a cysteine which is introduced between positions 227 and 230 in the
25 hinge region of the heavy chain. Hence in one embodiment, an IgG4 antibody is provided in
   which the cysteine 127 is substituted for another amino acid and the cysteine of the light
   chain is linked via a disulphide bond to an engineered cysteine at position 227, 228, 229 or
   230.
                A further improvement to thermostability was also surprisingly found by adding three
30 amino acids to the IgG4 hinge region in order to lengthen the IgG4 hinge region.
                It has also been surprisingly found that the mutant IgG4 antibodies which have been
   mutated to replace the cysteine at position 127 in the CHI domain with another amino acid
   and to replace the cysteine at position 239 or at position 242 in the heavy chain hinge region

   with another amino acid showed improved thermostability compared to a wild type IgG4
   antibody.
                In one embodiment the antibodies of the present invention show reduced formation of
   so-called half-molecules, which are formed of a single light chain and a single heavy chain
 5 (HL). Antibodies of the present invention which comprise a mutation at C239 but do not
   carry a mutation at C242 generally show reduced half-molecule formation. Without being
   bound by theory it is thought that this is due to removal of the Cysteine at position 239
   reduces the formation of intra-chain disulphide bond in the heavy chain and therefore reduces
   the number of half-molecules compared to antibodies which do not carry a mutation at C239
10 or the C242. Antibodies which carry a mutation at C242 but do not carry a mutation at C239
   appear to form more half-molecule compared to antibodies which carry a mutation at C239
   but do not carry a mutation at C242. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the
   cysteine at position 239 is more reactive compared to the cysteine at position 242 and is
   capable of forming a disulphide bond with either a heavy chain hinge cysteine or the light
15 chain cysteine.
                Antibodies which carry mutation at both C239 and C242 form a high proportion of
   half-molecules due to no inter-chain disulphide bond formation between two heavy chains.
   However, antibodies comprising mutations at both C239 and C242 are still capable of
   forming whole antibody molecules due to the bonding of heavy chains via non-covalent
20 bonds.
   Reduced half-molecule formation is also observed in antibodies carrying the S241P mutation.
                Antibodies according the present invention also show comparable affinity towards the
   target antigen compared the wild-type IgG4 antibody.
                Mutations to the heavy chain constant regions of the bispecific antibodies of the
25 present invention are described in more detail below. The methods for replacing amino acids
   are well known in the art of molecular biology.           Such methods include for example site
   directed mutagenesis using methods such as PCR to delete and/or substitute amino acids or
   de novo design of synthetic sequences.
                Figure 2a shows the hinge residues of IgGI wild type, IgG4 wild type and the
30 positions where mutations have been introduced in the antibodies of the present invention.
   Numbering based on Kabat numbering system.
                The antibodies according to the present invention comprise a mutation at position 127
   (C127), wherein the cysteine residue is replaced by another amino acid, preferably an amino
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                       21
   acid that does not contain a thiol group. By replace or substitute we mean that where the
   interchain cysteine 127 would normally be found in the antibody heavy chain another amino
   acid is in its place. The mutation at C127 may be any suitable mutation to one, two or three
   of the nucleotides encoding the amino acid at position 127 which changes the amino acid
 5 residue from cysteine to another suitable amino acid.            Examples of suitable amino acids
   include serine, threonine, alanine, glycine or any polar amino acid. A particularly preferred
   amino acid is serine.
                The substitution of the cysteine at position 127 with another amino acid removes the
   cysteine in the CHI domain which normally forms a disulphide bond with a cysteine in the
10 light chain in the wild-type IgG4. Therefore, in order to form a light chain and heavy chain
   pairing via an inter-chain disulphide bond the light chain must form a disulphide bond with a
   cysteine which is positioned in the hinge region of the heavy chain.
                In a first aspect of the invention, antibodies according to the present invention
   comprise a heavy chain wherein one or more of the amino acids at positions selected from
15 227, 228, 229 and 230, numbered according to the Kabat numbering system, is substituted
   with cysteine. Accordingly, antibodies according to the present invention may carry one or
   more of the following mutations: S227C; K228C; Y229C; G230C
                In one embodiment only one residue selected from 227, 228, 229 and 230 is
   substituted with a cysteine residue.
20              In one embodiment antibodies of the present invention carry the mutation Y229C or
   G230C.
                The inclusion of a cysteine residue at a position selected from 227, 228, 229 and 230,
   in the hinge region of the heavy chain provides a new position for an inter-chain disulphide
   bond to form between the heavy chain and the light chain. It has been found by the present
25 inventors that this new inter-chain disulphide bond arrangement provides IgG4 antibodies
   having improved thermostability compared to a wild-type IgG4 antibody.
                Further mutations may be introduced to the antibodies of this aspect of the present
   invention. In one embodiment the cysteine at position 239 (C239) and/or the cysteine at
   position 242 (C242), numbered according to the Kabat numbering system, in the heavy chain
30 are substituted with another amino acid, preferably an amino acid that does not contain a thiol
   group. By replace or substitute we mean that where the cysteine 239 and/or the cysteine 242
   would normally be found in the antibody heavy chain another amino acid is in its place. The
   mutation at C239 and/or C242 may be any suitable mutation to one, two or three of the
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                            22
   nucleotides encoding the amino acid which changes the amino acid residue from cysteine to
   another suitable amino acid.               Examples of suitable amino acids include serine, threonine,
   alanine, glycine or any polar amino acid. A particularly preferred amino acid is serine.
                In one embodiment the cysteine at position 239 in the heavy chain is substituted with
 5 another amino acid and the cysteine at position 242 in the heavy chain is substituted with
   another amino acid. In this embodiment, the substitution of both C239 and C242 removes
   both cysteine residues in the hinge region of the heavy chain which normally form inter
   heavy chain disulphide bonds with the corresponding cysteines in another heavy chain. The
   resulting half-molecules may form whole antibody molecules through non-covalent bonding
10 between two heavy chains.
                In an alternative embodiment the cysteine at position 239 in the heavy chain is
   substituted with another amino acid. In this embodiment the cysteine at position 242 is not
   substituted with another amino acid.
                In a further alternative embodiment the cysteine at position 242 in the heavy chain is
15 substituted with another amino acid. In this embodiment the cysteine at position 239 is not
   substituted with another amino acid.
                The substitution of either C239 or C242, leaves one cysteine in the heavy chain which
   is capable of forming an inter-heavy chain disulphide bond with a cysteine in another heavy
   chain. Without being bound by theory it is thought that the substitution of one cysteine in the
20 hinge region, particularly substitution of C239, reduces the formation of an intra-chain
   disulphide bond in the hinge region and therefore may reduce the formation of half antibody
   molecules.
                In one embodiment of the present invention, wherein the serine at position 227 is
   substituted with a cysteine, the antibody preferably does not comprise mutations at positions
25 C239 and C242. In another embodiment, wherein the serine at position 227 is substituted
   with a cysteine, the cysteine at position 239 in the heavy chain is preferably substituted with
   another amino acid but the cysteine at position 242 is not substituted with another amino
   acid.
                In one embodiment the antibodies of the present invention comprise an IgG4 heavy
30 chain which is mutated to insert one or more amino acids between amino acids 226-243. The
   number of amino acids inserted may be 1 to 10, 1 to 5, 1 to 3, preferably 1, 2, 3 or 4 amino
   acids are inserted.               The amino acids are preferably inserted between amino acids 238 and
   239.        Any suitable amino acids may be inserted in the hinge region, such as alanines,

   glycines, serines or threonines and combinations thereof. Preferably three alanines (AAA),
   three glycines (GGG), three serines (SSS) or three threonines (TTT) are inserted or a
   threonine, histidine and another threonine (THT). It has been found that antibodies of the
   present invention comprising an IgG4 heavy chain which has been mutated to insert three
 5 amino acids in the hinge region show improved thermostability.
                A further mutation which may be introduced in the antibodies according to the
   present invention is the mutation S241P. This mutation has been previously shown to reduce
   the formation of half molecules (Angal,S. et al., 1993. A single amino acid substitution
   abolishes the heterogeneity of chimeric mouse/human (IgG4) antibody. Mol Immunol 30,
10  105-108).             It has been surprisingly found that mutant antibodies of the present invention
   which comprise the S241P mutation demonstrate some heavy chain exchange in vitro under
   strong reducing conditions compared to IgG4 P (IgG4 with S241P). This allows the creation
   of bispecific antibodies in vitro from mutant IgG4 antibodies of the present invention. The
   antibodies according to the present invention may comprise one or more further mutations in
15 the hinge region.                 For example the antibodies may further comprise one or more of the
   following mutations S227P, Y229S, P237D and P238K.
                In one embodiment the antibody according to the present invention effectively
   comprises an IgGI hinge region from residue 226 to 243 (upper hinge and core hinge).
   Accordingly, the antibody of the present invention comprises a hinge region wherein the
20 glycine at position 230 is substituted with cysteine, the serine at position 227 is substituted
   with proline, the tyrosine at position 229 is substituted with serine, the proline at position 237
   is substituted with aspartic acid, the proline at position 238 is substituted with lysine, the
   amino acid sequence threonine-histidine-threonine is inserted between positions 238 and 239
   and the serine at position 241 is substituted with proline.              These mutations may also be
25 written as S227P, Y229S, G230C, P237D, P238KTHT and S241P, as shown in Figure 2a. It
   has been found that the introduction of these further mutations to the IgG4 hinge region
   provides an antibody having improved thermostability.
                The antibody according to the present invention preferably has an IgG4 lower hinge
   from residue 244 to 251 (APEFLGGP SEQ ID No: 229). Without being bound by theory it is
30 believed that the IgG4 lower hinge region contributes to the lack of effector function of an
   IgG4 antibody.
                In a second aspect of the present invention, symmetric bispecific antibody is provided
   wherein in one or both heavy chains the inter-chain cysteine at position 127 is substituted

                                                       24
   with another amino acid, as described above, and the cysteine at position 239 or the cysteine
   at position 242, numbered according to the Kabat numbering system, in the heavy chain is
   substituted with another amino acid. In this second aspect, none of the residues at positions
   227, 228, 229 and 230 are substituted with a cysteine residue.
 5              A symmetric bispecific antibody of the class IgG4 comprising two heavy chains
   which each comprise a variable domain, CHI domain and hinge region, , wherein in each
   heavy chain the inter-chain cysteine at position 127, numbered according to the Kabat
   numbering system, is substituted with another amino acid; and the cysteine at position 239
   and/or the cysteine at position 242, numbered according to the Kabat numbering system, is
10 substituted with another amino acid, wherein the constant region sequence of each heavy
   chain is similar or identical and the variable region in each heavy chain is different.
                Antibodies according to the second aspect of the present invention have surprisingly
   been found to have improved thermostability compared to a wild-type IgG4 antibody.
                In the second aspect of the present invention, the antibody may comprise one or more
15 further mutations. In one embodiment the antibody comprises an IgG4 heavy chain which is
   mutated to insert three amino acids between amino acids 226-243, preferably between amino
   acids 238 and 239, as described above.         In a further embodiment the antibody comprises the
   mutation S241P. In a further embodiment, the antibody may further comprise one or more of
   the following mutations S227P, Y229S, P237D and P238K.
20              Figures 3a and 4a also show the mutations introduced in IgG4 antibodies according to
   the present invention. Figures 3b and 4b show the positions of the cysteine residues in the
   IgG4 antibodies of the present invention and also show the predicted bonding of the cysteine
   to a cysteine in the light chain (LC) or another heavy chain (HC). For cysteine residues
   which show (LC or HC), it is possible that the cysteine is binding to a cysteine in the light
25 chain or the heavy chain but where either the LC or HC is underlined this is the disulphide
   bond which is believed to predominantly occur.
                In one embodiment, the present invention provides an antibody comprising two heavy
   chains which each comprise a variable region, a CHI domain and a hinge region and each
   heavy chain comprises the mutations of an antibody selected from 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 28,

   44, 44P, 45, 46, 47 and 48, as shown in Table 1. Accordingly, the present invention provides
   an antibody comprising two heavy chains which each comprise a variable region, a CHI
 5 domain, a hinge region, a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain and each heavy chain comprises
   one of the following sequences: SEQ ID NO: 281, SEQ ID NO: 282, SEQ ID NO: 283 , SEQ

   ID NO: 304, SEQ ID NO: 305 and SEQ ID NO: 306.
                A particularly preferred antibody of the present invention comprises two heavy chains
   which each comprise a variable region, a CHI domain and a hinge region, wherein the heavy
   chain comprises SEQ ID NO: 267 (antibody 28P), SEQ ID NO: 268 (antibody 44P) or SEQ
15 ID NO: 266 (antibody 48). A further particularly preferred antibody of the present invention
   comprises two heavy chains which each comprise a variable region, a CHI domain, a hinge
   region, a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain wherein the heavy chain comprises SEQ ID NO:
   305 (antibody 28P), SEQ ID NO: 306 (antibody 44P) or SEQ ID NO: 304 (antibody 48).
   Antibodies 28P, 44P and 48 are particularly preferred because they exhibit significantly
20 improved thermostability and further exhibit reduced half-molecule formation.
                Antibodies 2, 3 and 8 have been shown to form significant quantity of so-called half
   molecules (HL). These mutants may form whole antibody molecules (H2L2) in vitro under
   non-denaturing conditions but any non-covalent associations between the heavy chains
   and/or between heavy and light chains is removed under non-reducing SDS-PAGE
25 conditions.             Whilst it often taught to be desirable to reduce the formation of half-molecules,
   antibodies which have an increased tendency to form half-molecules may be advantageous
   for certain uses. Antibodies which form stable half-molecules (HL) and little or no whole
   antibody (H2L2) due to the antibody heavy chain being incapable to form a covalent or non
   covalent association with another heavy chain are of particular interest. Antibodies which
30 form stable half-molecules may be advantageous for the production of monovalent
   antibodies. Antibodies which form half-molecules may also provide a useful way to produce
   a bispecific antibody due to the formation of whole antibodies from half-molecules having
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                                30
   different specificities, wherein the whole antibody is bispecific and monovalent for each
   antigen. The heavy chains of such a bispecific antibody would be associated non-covalently.
                Antibody 3 retains C239 in the hinge region but appears unable to form interhinge
   heavy chain disulphide bonds, presumably due to efficient formation of a disulphide between
 5 the C-terminal light chain cysteine and the hinge C239. A comparison of antibodies 2 and 3
   shows the extent of the ' reach' of the Germinal cysteine of the light chain, in that the light
   chain disulphide bonds more efficiently to C239 than to C242 in the hinge region.
   Furthermore antibody 3 shows increased stability compared to antibody 2.
                Whilst the mutated antibodies according to the present invention are described above
10 with respect to the IgG4 isotype, the skilled person will appreciate that the mutations made to
   the IgG4 antibody may also be applied to other antibody isotypes or classes which have the
   same disulphide bond arrangement as an IgG4 antibody in order to provide an improved
   antibody. Specific examples of antibodies which have the same disulphide bond arrangement
   as an IgG4 antibody are IgG3 antibodies, IgM antibodies and IgD antibodies. As shown in
15 Figure 1b, IgG3 and IgM have a cysteine at position 127 in the CHI domain and IgD has a
   cysteine at position 128 in the CHI domain which is equivalent to the C127 in the CHI
   domain of IgG4 which forms an inter-chain disulphide bond with a cysteine in the light
   chain. Further, it can also be seen from Figure lb that upper hinge regions of IgG3 and IgD
   and the C-terminal region of the CHI domain and the N-terminal region of the CH2 domain in
20 IgM do not contain a cysteine residue which is equivalent to the residues of the upper hinge
   region of IgG1. Accordingly, the present invention further provides an IgG3 antibody, an
   IgD antibody and an IgM antibody wherein the cysteine in the CHI domain which forms an
   inter-chain disulphide bond with a cysteine in a light chain is substituted with another amino
   acid and wherein one or more amino acids which are in a structurally analogous position to
25 the upper hinge region of IgGI or IgG4 are substituted with cysteine.
                Accordingly, the present invention also provides a symmetric bispecific antibody of
   the class IgG3 comprising two heavy chains which each comprise a variable region, a CHI
   domain and a hinge region, wherein in each heavy chain:
                        a. the cysteine in the CHI domain which forms an inter-chain disulphide bond
30                             with a cysteine in a light chain is substituted with another amino acid; and
                       b. one or more of the amino acids positioned in the upper hinge region is
                               substituted with cysteine

   variable region in each heavy chain is different..
                In a preferred embodiment of the IgG3 antibody aspect of the present invention, the
   cysteine in the CHI domain which forms an inter-chain disulphide bond with a cysteine in a
 5 light chain is the cysteine at position 127, numbered according to the Kabat numbering
   system, as shown in Figure lb and 2b.
                In a preferred embodiment of the IgG3 antibody aspect of the present invention, the
   one or more amino acids positioned in the upper hinge region which may be substituted with

10 230, 232 and 233, numbered according to the Kabat numbering system, as shown in Figures
    lb and 2b.
                The present invention further provides a symmetric bispecific antibody of the class
   IgM comprising two heavy chains which each comprise a variable region, a CHI domain and
   a CH2 domain, wherein in each heavy chain:
15                      a. the cysteine in the CHI domain which forms an inter-chain disulphide bond
                               with a cysteine in a light chain is substituted with another amino acid; and
                       b. one or more of the amino acids positioned in the CHI domain or CH2 domain
                               is substituted with cysteine
   wherein the constant region sequence of each heavy chain is similar or identical and the
20 variable region in each heavy chain is different.
                In a preferred embodiment of the IgM antibody aspect of the present invention, the
   cysteine in the CHI domain which forms an inter-chain disulphide bond with a cysteine in a
   light chain is the cysteine at position 127, numbered according to the Kabat numbering
   system, as shown in Figures lb and 2c.
25              In a preferred embodiment of the IgM antibody aspect of the present invention, one or
   more amino acids positioned in the C-terminal end of the CHI domain or the N-terminal end
   of the CH2 domain are substituted with cysteine. Preferred amino acids position in the C
   terminal end of the CHI domain which may be substituted with cysteine are one or more of
   the amino acids at positions selected from 223, 223A, 223B and 223C, numbered according
30 to the Kabat numbering system, as shown in Figures lb and 2c. Preferred amino acids
   position in the N-terminal end of the CH2 domain which may be substituted with cysteine are
   one or more of the amino acids at positions selected from 243G, 243H and 2431, numbered
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                                32
   according to the Kabat numbering system, as shown in Figures lb and 2c. Accordingly any
   one or more of amino acids 223 to 243 may be substituted with cysteine.
                The present invention further provides a symmetric bispecific antibody of the class
   IgD comprising two heavy chains which each comprise a variable region, a CHI domain and
 5 a hinge region, wherein in each heavy chain:
                        a. the cysteine in the CHI domain which forms an inter-chain disulphide bond
                               with a cysteine in a light chain is substituted with another amino acid; and
                       b. one or more of the amino acids positioned in the hinge region is substituted
                               with cysteine
10 wherein the constant region sequence of each heavy chain is similar or identical and the
   variable region in each heavy chain is different.
                In a preferred embodiment of the IgD antibody aspect of the present invention, the
   cysteine in the CHI domain which forms an inter-chain disulphide bond with a cysteine in a
   light chain is the cysteine at position 128 numbered according to the Kabat numbering
15 system, as shown in Figures lb and 2d.
                The hinge region of an IgD antibody may be defined as R224-P243, according to the
   Kabat numbering system.
                In a preferred embodiment of the IgD antibody aspect of the present invention, the
   one or more amino acids positioned in the hinge region which are substituted with cysteine
20 are one or more of the amino acids at positions selected from 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232
   and 233, numbered according to the Kabat numbering system, as shown in Figures lb and 2d.
                The IgG3, IgD or IgM antibodies provided by the present invention may comprise
   one or more further mutations to the hinge region as discussed above with respect to the IgG4
   antibody.
25              In this aspect of the present invention, the antibody is preferably of the class IgG4.
                The term ' antibody' as used herein includes intactwhole) antibodies and functionally
   active fragments which comprise two heavy chains which each comprise a VH domain, a CHI
   domain and a hinge region.                   The antibody according to the present invention preferably

   and a hinge region and the light chain comprises a variable region VL and a constant domain
   CL
                In one embodiment there is provided a dimer of Fab' according to the present
   disclosure for example dimerisation may be through the hinge.
 5              In one embodiment the heavy chain comprises a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain and
   optionally a CH4 domain. In one embodiment the antibody comprises two heavy chains each
   of which is as defined above in the first or second aspect of the present invention.         The
   antibodies according to the present invention also preferably comprise two light chains,
   wherein the constant regions of the light chains are preferably identical. In this embodiment
10 wherein the antibody comprises two heavy chains and two light chains, preferably both heavy
   chain constant region sequences are identical as defined above by the first or second aspect of
   the present invention, and both light chain constant region sequences are identical.
                In a preferred embodiment the antibody of the present invention is a whole antibody
   comprising two light chains and two heavy chains, wherein each heavy chain comprises an
15 IgG4 CHI wherein the cysteine at position 127, numbered according to the Kabat numbering
   system is substituted with another amino acid, an IgGI upper and middle hinge region, an
   IgG4 lower hinge region, a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain.
                The complete hinge region of an IgG4 antibody typically consists of residues 226 to
   251 (numbering based on Kabat numbering system. However the hinge region may be
20 shortened or lengthened as required. For example, antibodies according to the first aspect of
   the present invention, the wild type amino acid is substituted with a cysteine residue at
   position 227, 228, 229 or 230, the hinge region may end after the new cysteine residue at
   position 227, 228, 229 or 230. Antibodies according to the present invention may also
   comprise one or more further amino acids positioned N-terminal and/or C-terminal of the
25 hinge region. In addition other characteristics of the hinge can be controlled, such as the
   distance of the hinge cysteine(s) from the light chain interchain cysteine, the distance
   between the cysteines of the hinge and the composition of other amino acids in the hinge that
   may affect properties of the hinge such as flexibility e.g. glycines may be incorporated into
   the hinge to increase rotational flexibility or prolines may be incorporated to reduce
30 flexibility.              Alternatively combinations of charged or hydrophobic residues may be
   incorporated into the hinge to confer multimerisation or purification properties.          Other
   modified hinge regions may be entirely synthetic and may be designed to possess desired
   properties such as length, composition and flexibility.

   also be used.
                In one embodiment each heavy chain comprises IgG4 CH2 and CH3 domains wherein
   the arginine at position 409 (EU numbering) is substituted with lysine, threonine, methionine
   or leucine in order to inhibit aggregate formation at low pH (US 2008/0063635 Takahashi et
10 al.)     Mutations at L235, D265, D270, K322, P331 and P329 (numbered according to EU
   numbering system) are also taught in order to attenuate CDC activity (US 2008/0063635
   Takahashi et al.).
                Each heavy chain may comprise the mutations as taught in W02008/145142 Van de
   Winkel et al. which discloses stable IgG4 antibodies that have a reduced ability to undergo

                In one embodiment each heavy chain comprises an IgG4 CH2 domain and an IgGI
   CH3 domain, as shown in SEQ ID NO: 280.
                In the embodiment of the present invention wherein the antibody is a mutated IgG3,
20 IgD or IgM antibody, each heavy chain preferably comprises a CH2 domain and a CH3
   domain, and optionally a CH4 domain. In the IgG3 antibody each heavy chain preferably
   comprises IgG3 CH2 domain and a IgG3 CH3 domain. In the IgD antibody each heavy chain
   preferably comprises IgD CH2 domain and a IgD CH3 domain. In the IgM antibody each
   heavy chain preferably comprises 1gM CH2 domain, a IgM CH3 domain and a IgM CH4
25 domain.
                In one embodiment mutations at C127 in the CH1 domain may be made at equivalent
   positions in other IgG isotopes (1, 2, 3) or in other antibody classes. These mutant antibodies
   may comprise one or more further mutations, for example in the hinge region and/or CH2
   domain and/or CH3 domain. Examples of specific mutations in the hinge region and CH2 and
30 CH3       domains are described previously with respect to the other aspects of the present
   invention.
                Specific examples of the above mutant antibodies are the mutant IgG4 antibodies 4, 5,
   5P, 9, 10, 11 and 14 listed in Table 1.

                Accordingly the present invention provides an antibody comprising two heavy chains,
   wherein each heavy chain comprises a CHI domain and a hinge region and each heavy chain
   comprises the mutations of an antibody selected from 4, 5, 5P, 9, 10, 11 and 14, as shown in
   Table 1. Accordingly, the present invention provides an antibody comprising two heavy
 5 chains, wherein each heavy chain comprises a CHI domain and a hinge region and each
   heavy chain comprises one of the following sequences: SEQ ID NO: 270, SEQ ID NO: 271,
   SEQ ID NO: 272, SEQ ID NO: 273, SEQ ID NO: 274, SEQ ID NO: 275 and SEQ ID NO:
   276.
                In a further embodiment, the present invention provides an antibody comprising two
10 heavy chains, wherein each heavy chain comprises a CHI domain, a hinge region, a CH2
   domain and a CH3 domain and each heavy chain comprises the mutations of an antibody
   selected from 4, 5, 5P, 9, 10, 11 and 14, as shown in Table 1. Accordingly, the present
   invention provides an antibody comprising two heavy chains, wherein each heavy chain
   comprises a CHI domain, a hinge region, a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain and each heavy
15 chain comprises one of the following sequences: SEQ ID NO: 308, SEQ ID NO: 309, SEQ
   ID NO: 310, SEQ ID NO: 311, SEQ ID NO: 312, SEQ ID NO: 313 and SEQ ID NO: 316.
                Antibodies 4 (C127S, C239S and C242S) and 14 (C239S and C242S) have been
   shown to form significant quantity of so-called half-molecules (HL).           These mutants may
   form whole antibody molecules (H2L2) in vitro under non-denaturing conditions but any
20 non-covalent associations between the heavy chains and/or between heavy and light chains is
   removed under non-reducing SDS-PAGE conditions. Whilst it often taught to be desirable to
   reduce the formation of half-molecules, antibodies which have an increased tendency to form
   half-molecules may be advantageous for certain uses, for example in vitro formation of half
   molecules may facilitate heavy chain exchange and facilitate the preparation of bispecific
25 IgG4 antibodies according to the present disclosure.
                Antibodies 2, 3 and 8, as described above, have also been shown to form significant
   quantities of half-molecules and, therefore, may also be used in situations where half
   molecule formation is desirable.
                Antibody 3 retains C239 in the hinge region but appears unable to form interhinge
30 heavy chain dulphide bonds, presumably due to efficient formation of a disulphide between
   the C-terminal light chain cysteine and the hinge C239. A comparison of antibodies 2 and 3
   shows the extent of the ' reach'       of the Germinal cysteine of the light chain, in that the light

                                                     36
   chain disulphide bonds more efficiently to C239 than to C242 in the hinge region.
   Furthermore antibody 3 shows increased stability compared to antibody 2.
                Antibodies 5 (G230C), 5P (G230C and S241P), 9 (G230C and C239S), 10 (G230C
   and C242S) and 11 (G230C, C239S and C242S) comprises two cysteines (a cysteine at
 5 position 127 in CHI and at 230 in the upper hinge) with which the cysteine in the light chain
   may form a disulphide bond. Accordingly, these antibodies may comprise a non-disulphide
   bonded cysteine in the heavy chain CHI or hinge region which can advantageously be used
   for attachment of an effector molecule at the non-.disulphide bonded cysteine.             Further
   antibody 5 comprises two hinge cysteines at C239 and C242 and, therefore, will be resistant
10 to a mild reduction step required to activate the free thiol of the non-disulphide bonded
   cysteine to insert an effector molecule. Further antibody 11, comprises no hinge cysteines at
   239 and 242, and therefore this reduces the chance of any effector molecules being attached
   to these positions in the hinge.
                The term ' antibody' as used herein includes intactwhole) antibodies and functionally
15 active fragments which comprise two heavy chains which each comprise a VH domain, a CHI
   domain and a hinge region.          The antibody according to the present invention preferably
   comprises at least one light chain. Accordingly, the term "antibody" in the present invention
   covers bi, tri or tetra-valent antibodies, Fab' and F(ab' 2)fragments, half-antibody molecules
   or half-molecules comprising a single light chain and heavy chain pairing and whole
20 antibody molecules comprising two light chain and heavy chain pairings.
                As is well known in the art, a typical Fab' molecule comprises a heavy and a light
   chain pair in which the heavy chain comprises a variable region VH, a constant domain CHI
   and a hinge region and the light chain comprises a variable region VL and a constant domain
   CL
25 In one embodiment there is provided a dimer of Fab' according to the present disclosure for
   example dimerisation may be through the hinge.
               In one embodiment the heavy chain comprises a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain and
   optionally a CH4 domain. In one embodiment the antibody comprises two heavy chains each
   of which is as defined above in the first or second aspect of the present invention. The
30 antibodies according to the present invention also preferably comprise two light chains. In
   this embodiment wherein the antibody comprises two heavy chains, preferably both heavy
   chain sequences are identical as defined above by the first or second aspect of the present
   invention.

   In a preferred embodiment the antibody of the present invention is a whole antibody
   comprising two light chains and two heavy chains, wherein each heavy chain comprises an
   IgG4 CHI wherein the cysteine at position 127, numbered according to the Kabat numbering
   system is substituted with another amino acid, an IgGI upper and middle hinge region, an
 5 IgG4 lower hinge region, a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain.
                The complete hinge region of an IgG4 antibody typically consists of residues 226 to
   251 (numbering based on Kabat numbering system.                  However the hinge region may be
   shortened or lengthened as required. For example, antibodies according to the first aspect of
   the present invention, the wild type amino acid is substituted with a cysteine residue at
10 position 227, 228, 229 or 230, the hinge region may end after the new cysteine residue at
   position 227, 228, 229 or 230.               Antibodies according to the present invention may also
   comprise one or more further amino acids positioned N-terminal and/or C-terminal of the
   hinge region. In addition other characteristics of the hinge can be controlled, such as the
   distance of the hinge cysteine(s) from the light chain interchain cysteine, the distance
15 between the cysteines of the hinge and the composition of other amino acids in the hinge that
   may affect properties of the hinge such as flexibility e.g. glycines may be incorporated into
   the hinge to increase rotational flexibility or prolines may be incorporated to reduce
   flexibility.              Alternatively combinations of charged or hydrophobic residues may be
   incorporated into the hinge to confer multimerisation or purification properties.             Other
20 modified hinge regions may be entirely synthetic and may be designed to possess desired
   properties such as length, composition and flexibility.
                The constant region domains, in particular in the Fc domain, where present, employed
   in the present invention, are preferably of IgG4 isotype where antibody effector functions are
   not required. According each heavy chain preferably comprises an IgG4 CH2 domain and a
25 CH3     domain, as shown in SEQ ID NO: 279.
               In one embodiment, the antibody is a monoclonal, fully human, humanized or
   chimeric antibody fragment. In one embodiment the antibody is fully human or humanised.
                Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared by any method known in the art such as the
   hybridoma technique (Kohler & Milstein, Nature, 1975, 256, 495-497), the trioma technique,
30 the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al., Immunology Today, 1983, 4, 72) and
   the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., "Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy",
   pp. 77-96, Alan R. Liss, Inc., 1985).

                Antibodies for use in the invention may also be generated using single lymphocyte
   antibody methods by cloning and expressing immunoglobulin variable region cDNAs
   generated from single lymphocytes selected for the production of specific antibodies by, for
   example, the methods described by Babcook, J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1996,
 5 93(15), 7843-7848, WO 92/02551, W02004/051268 and W02004/106377.
                Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species having one or
   more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a
   framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule which optionally comprise one
   or more donor residues from the non-human species (see, for example, US 5,585,089).
10              The antibodies for use in the present invention can also be generated using various
   phage display methods known in the art and include those disclosed by Brinkman et al., J
   Immunol. Methods, 1995, 182, 41-50; Ames et al., J Immunol. Methods, 1995, 184, 177-186;

   transgenic mice, or other organisms, including other mammals, may be used to generate
   humanized antibodies.
20              Fully human antibodies are those antibodies in which the variable regions and the
   constant regions (where present) of both the heavy and the light chains are all of human
   origin, or substantially identical to sequences of human origin, not necessarily from the same
   antibody. Examples of fully human antibodies may include antibodies produced for example
   by the phage display methods described above and antibodies produced by mice in which the
25 murine immunoglobulin variable and/or constant region genes have been replaced by their
   human counterparts eg. as described in general terms in EP0546073 B1, US 5,545,806, US
   5,569,825, US 5,625,126, US 5,633,425, US 5,661,016, US5,770,429, EP 0438474 BI and
   EP0463151 Bl.
   The antibody starting material for use in the present invention may be prepared by the use of
30 recombinant DNA techniques involving the manipulation and re-expression of DNA
   encoding the antibody variable and constant region(s).              Standard molecular biology
   techniques may be used to modify, add or delete amino acids or domains as desired. Any

   alterations to the variable or constant regions are still encompassed by the terms ' variable'
   and ' constant' regions as used herein.
                The antibody starting material may be obtained from any species including for
   example mouse, rat, rabbit, hamster, camel, llama, goat or human. Parts of the antibody may
 5 be obtained from more than one species, for example the antibody may be chimeric. In one
   example, the constant regions are from one species and the variable regions from another.
   The antibody starting material may also be modified. In another example, the variable region
   of the antibody has been created using recombinant DNA engineering techniques.                Such
   engineered versions include those created for example from natural antibody variable regions
10 by insertions, deletions or changes in or to the amino acid sequences of the natural
   antibodies.              Particular examples of this type include those engineered variable region
   domains containing at least one CDR and, optionally, one or more framework amino acids
   from one antibody and the remainder of the variable region domain from a second antibody.
   The methods for creating and manufacturing these antibodies are well known in the art (see
15 for example, Boss et al., US 4,816,397; Cabilly et al., US 6,331,415; Shrader et al., WO
   92/02551; Ward et al., 1989, Nature, 341, 544; Orlandi et al., 1989, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.
   USA, 86, 3833; Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature, 322, 323; Bird et al, 1988, Science, 242,
   423; Queen et al., US 5,585,089; Adair, W091/09967; Mountain and Adair, 1992,
   Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev, 10, 1-142; Verma et al., 1998, Journal of Immunological
20 Methods, 216, 165-181).
                In one embodiment the antibody comprises a variable domain pair forming a binding
   domain is a cognate pair. Cognate pair as employed herein is intended to refer to a natural
   pair of variable domains, that is to say isolated from a single antibody or antibody expressing
   cell.
25              Variable domains may have been optimized and/or humanized.
                Optimised/humanized variable domains derived from a cognate pair will still be
   considered a cognate pair after optimization/humanization.
                Thus the invention extends to human, humanized or chimeric molecules.
                In one embodiment the molecule specifically binds a target antigen. Specifically
30 binds as employed herein is intended to refer to molecules having high affinity for a target
   antigen (to which it is specific) and which binds antigens to which it is not specific with a
   low or much lower affinity (or not at all). Methods of measuring affinity are known to those
   skilled in the art and include such assays as BIAcoreTM.

                The antibody molecules of the present invention suitably have a high binding affinity,
   in particular, nanomolar or picomolar. Affinity may be measured using any suitable method
   known in the art, including BIAcoreTM.              In one embodiment the molecule of the present
   invention has a binding affinity of about 100 pM or better. In one embodiment the molecule
 5 of the present invention has a binding affinity of about 50pM or better. In one embodiment
   the molecule of the present invention has a binding affinity of about 40pM or better. In one
   embodiment the molecule of the present invention has a binding affinity of about 30pM or
   better.         In one embodiment the molecule of the present invention is fully human or
   humanised and has a binding affinity of about 100pM or better.
10              A derivative of a naturally occurring domain as employed herein is intended to refer
   to where one, two, three, four or five amino acids in a naturally occurring sequence have
   been replaced or deleted, for example to optimize the properties of the domain such as by
   eliminating undesirable properties but wherein the characterizing feature(s) of the domain
   is/are retained.
15 In one embodiment the antibody molecules of the present invention comprise one or more
   albumin binding peptides. In vivo the peptide binds albumin, which increases the half-life of
   the molecule.
                The albumin binding peptide may be appended from one or more variable regions, a
   hinge or C-terminal of the molecule or any location that does not interfere with the molecules
20 antigen binding properties.
                Examples of albumin binding peptides are provided in WO 2007/106120.
                It will also be understood by one skilled in the art that the antibody may undergo a
   variety of posttranslational modifications. The type and extent of these modifications often
   depends on the host cell line used to express the molecule as well as the culture conditions.
25 Such modifications                may include variations   in glycosylation,  methionine   oxidation,
   diketopiperazine formation, aspartate isomerization and asparagine deamidation. A frequent
   modification is the loss of a carboxy-terminal basic residue (such as lysine or arginine) due to
   the action of carboxypeptidases (as described in Harris, RJ. Journal of Chromatography
   705:129-134, 1995).
30              If desired a molecule for use in the present invention may be conjugated to one or more
   effector molecule(s). It will be appreciated that the effector molecule may comprise a single
   effector molecule or two or more such molecules so linked as to form a single moiety that
   can be attached to the antibody molecule of the present invention. Where it is desired to

   obtain an antibody according to the invention linked to an effector molecule, this may be
   prepared by standard chemical or recombinant DNA procedures in which the antibody is
   linked either directly or via a coupling agent to the effector molecule.                         Techniques for
   conjugating such effector molecules to an antibody are well known in the art (see, Hellstrom
 5 et al., Controlled Drug Delivery, 2nd Ed., Robinson et al., eds., 1987, pp. 623-53; Thorpe et
   al., 1982 , Immunol. Rev., 62:119-58 and Dubowchik et al., 1999, Pharmacology and
   Therapeutics, 83, 67-123).                     Particular chemical procedures include, for example, those
   described in WO 93/06231, WO 92/22583, WO 89/00195, WO 89/01476 and W003031581.
   Alternatively, where the effector molecule is a protein or polypeptide the linkage may be
10 achieved using recombinant DNA procedures, for example as described in WO 86/01533 and
   EP0392745.
                The term effector molecule as used herein includes, for example, antineoplastic
   agents, drugs, toxins, biologically active proteins, for example enzymes, other antibody or

   immunoglobulins, toxins such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin, a
   protein such as insulin, tumour necrosis factor, a-interferon,                      p-interferon, nerve growth
   factor, platelet derived growth factor or tissue plasminogen activator, a thrombotic agent or
10 an anti-angiogenic agent, e.g. angiostatin or endostatin, or, a biological response modifier
   such as a lymphokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), granulocyte macrophage
   colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), nerve
   growth factor (NGF) or other growth factor and immunoglobulins.
                Other effector molecules may include detectable substances useful for example in
15 diagnosis. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups,
   fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, radioactive nuclides,
   positron emitting metals (for use in positron emission tomography), and nonradioactive
   paramagnetic metal ions. See generally U.S. Patent No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can
   be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics.                     Suitable enzymes include horseradish
20 peroxidase,              alkaline     phosphatase, beta-galactosidase,       or acetylcholinesterase;  suitable
   prosthetic groups include streptavidin, avidin and biotin; suitable fluorescent materials
   include               umbelliferone,         fluorescein,       fluorescein      isothiocyanate,    rhodamine,
   dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride and phycoerythrin; suitable luminescent
   materials include luminol; suitable bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and
25 aequorin; and suitable radioactive nuclides include                 125 1,31  ii In and 99Tc.
                In another example the effector molecule may increase the half-life of the antibody in
   vivo, and/or reduce immunogenicity of the antibody and/or enhance the delivery of an
   antibody across an epithelial barrier to the immune system. Examples of suitable effector
   molecules of this type include polymers, albumin, albumin binding proteins or albumin
30 binding compounds such as those described in WO 05/117984.
                Where the effector molecule is a polymer it may, in general, be a synthetic or a
   naturally occurring polymer, for example an optionally substituted straight or branched chain
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                           43
   polyalkylene, polyalkenylene or polyoxyalkylene polymer or a branched or unbranched
   polysaccharide, e.g. a homo- or hetero- polysaccharide.
                Specific optional substituents which may be present on the above-mentioned synthetic
   polymers include one or more hydroxy, methyl or methoxy groups.
 5              Specific examples of synthetic polymers include optionally substituted straight or
   branched chain poly(ethyleneglycol), poly(propyleneglycol) poly(vinylalcohol) or derivatives
   thereof,               especially     optionally    substituted    poly(ethyleneglycol)     such    as
   methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) or derivatives thereof.
   Specific naturally occurring polymers include lactose, amylose, dextran, glycogen or
10 derivatives thereof.
                "Derivatives" as used herein is intended to include reactive derivatives, for example
   thiol-selective reactive groups such as maleimides and the like. The reactive group may be
   linked directly or through a linker segment to the polymer. It will be appreciated that the
   residue of such a group will in some instances form part of the product as the linking group
15 between the antibody of the disclosure and the polymer.
                The size of the polymer may be varied as desired, but will generally be in an average
   molecular weight range from 50ODa to 50000Da, for example from 5000 to 40000Da such as
   from 20000 to 40000Da. The polymer size may in particular be selected on the basis of the
   intended use of the product for example ability to localize to certain tissues such as tumors or
20 extend circulating half-life (for review see Chapman, 2002, Advanced Drug Delivery
   Reviews, 54, 531-545). Thus, for example, where the product is intended to leave the
   circulation and penetrate tissue, for example for use in the treatment of a tumour, it may be
   advantageous to use a small molecular weight polymer, for example with a molecular weight
   of around 5000Da. For applications where the product remains in the circulation, it may be
25 advantageous to use a higher molecular weight polymer, for example having a molecular
   weight in the range from 20000Da to 40000Da.
                Suitable polymers include a polyalkylene polymer, such as a poly(ethyleneglycol) or,
   especially, a methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) or a derivative thereof, and especially with a
   molecular weight in the range from about 15000Da to about 40000Da.
30 In      one       example         an antibody   for use  in   the present   invention   is attached to
   poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) moieties. In one particular example the PEG molecules may be
   attached through any available amino acid side-chain or terminal amino acid functional group
   located in the antibody, for example any free amino, imino, thiol, hydroxyl or carboxyl
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                        44
   group.         Such amino acids may occur naturally in the antibody or may be engineered into the
   antibody using recombinant DNA methods (see for example US 5,219,996; US 5,667,425;
   WO 98/25971). In one example the molecule of the present invention is a modified antibody
   wherein the modification is the addition to the C-terminal end of its heavy chain one or more
 5 amino acids to allow the attachment of an effector molecule. Multiple sites can be used to
   attach two or more PEG molecules.
                In one embodiment a PEG molecule is linked to a cysteine 171 in the light chain, for
   example see W02008/038024 incorporated herein by reference.
                Suitably PEG molecules are covalently linked through a thiol group of at least one
10 cysteine residue located in the antibody. Each polymer molecule attached to the modified
   antibody may be covalently linked to the sulphur atom of a cysteine residue located in the
   antibody.             The covalent linkage will generally be a disulphide bond or, in particular, a
   sulphur-carbon bond. Where a thiol group is used as the point of attachment appropriately
   activated effector molecules, for example thiol selective derivatives such as maleimides and
15 cysteine derivatives may be used. An activated polymer may be used as the starting material
   in the preparation of polymer-modified antibody as described above. The activated polymer
   may be any polymer containing a thiol reactive group such as an a-halocarboxylic acid or
   ester, e.g. iodoacetamide, an imide, e.g. maleimide, a vinyl sulphone or a disulphide. Such
   starting materials may be obtained commercially (for example from Nektar, formerly
20 Shearwater Polymers Inc., Huntsville, AL, USA) or may be prepared from commercially
   available starting materials using conventional chemical procedures.               Particular PEG
   molecules include 20K methoxy-PEG-amine (obtainable from Nektar, formerly Shearwater;
   Rapp Polymere;                    and SunBio) and M-PEG-SPA    (obtainable from Nektar, formerly
   Shearwater).

   herein.
                In a further aspect there is provided a vector comprising said DNA.
                General methods by which the vectors may be constructed, transfection methods and
   culture methods are well known to those skilled in the art. In this respect, reference is made

                Any suitable host cell/vector system may be used for expression of the DNA
   sequences encoding the molecule of the present invention. Bacterial, for example E. coli, and
   other microbial systems may be used or eukaryotic, for example mammalian, host cell
   expression systems may also be used.              Suitable mammalian host cells include CHO,
 5 myeloma or hybridoma cells.
                The present invention also provides a process for the production of an antibody
   molecule as described herein comprising culturing a host cell containing a vector (and/or
   DNA) of the present invention under conditions suitable for leading to expression of protein
   from DNA encoding an antibody molecule of the present invention, and isolating an antibody
10 molecule.
                For production of products comprising both heavy and light chains, the cell line may
   be transfected with two vectors, a first vector encoding a light chain polypeptide and a second
   vector encoding a heavy chain polypeptide. Alternatively, a single vector may be used, the
   vector including sequences encoding light chain and heavy chain polypeptides.
15              The antibody molecules according to the present disclosure are expressed at suitable
   levels from host cells making them conducive to commercial processing.
                The antibody may be specific for any target antigen. The antigen may be a cell
   associated protein, for example a cell surface protein on cells such as bacterial cells, yeast
   cells, T-cells, endothelial cells or tumour cells, or it may be a soluble protein. Antigens of
20 interest may also be any medically relevant protein such as those proteins upregulated during
   disease or infection, for example receptors and/or their corresponding ligands. Particular
   examples of cell surface proteins include adhesion molecules, for example integrins such as
   p1    integrins e.g. VLA-4, E-selectin, P selectin or L-selectin, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7,
   CD8, CD11a, CD11b, CD18, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD25, CD33, CD38, CD40, CD40L,

30 antigens, KDR and VEGF, PD-1, DC-SIGN, TL1A, DR3, IL-7 receptor A and where
   appropriate, receptors thereof.
                Soluble antigens include interleukins such as IL-i, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8,

   respiratory syncytial virus or cytomegalovirus antigens, immunoglobulins, such as IgE,
   interferons such as interferon a, interferon        P or  interferon y, tumour necrosis factor TNF
   (formerly known as tumour necrosis factor-a and referred to herein as TNF or TNF4 tumor
   necrosis factor-p, colony stimulating factors such as G-CSF or GM-CSF, and platelet derived
 5 growth factors such as PDGF-a, and PDGF-P, WISP-1 and where appropriate receptors
   thereof. Other antigens include bacterial cell surface antigens, bacterial toxins, viruses such
   as influenza, EBV, HepA, B and C, bioterrorism agents, radionuclides and heavy metals, and
   snake and spider venoms and toxins.
                In one embodiment there is provided a method of generating a symmetric bispecific
10 antibody comprising the step of mixing a first IgG4 antibody with a second IgG4 antibody ex
   vivo, under conditions conducive to heavy chain exchange, wherein the antigen specificity of
   variable regions in the first the antibody are different to antigen specificity of the variable
   regions in the second antibody.
                In vitro conditions conducive to heavy chain exchange include reducing conditions.
15 Suitable reducing agents include GSH, 2-mercaptoethanol, 2-mercaptoethylamine, TBP,
   TCEP, cysteine-HCl and DTT.
                Suitable concentrations of the reducing agents are in the range 0.01 to 10mM such as
   0.5 to 5mM. In addition, reduction may be achieved using redox buffers, that is to say
   different relative ratios of oxidised and reduced variants of reagents such as for example:
20 GSH :GSSG and Cys:diCys
                Suitable conditions include ratios of antibodies are in the 0.5:5 to 5:05, such as 1:1 or
    1:2.
                Suitable temperature include 15 to 40'C, such as 37 0 C.
                The reducing conditions may be selected to be between the reductive stabilities of the
25 homodimers and the heterodimers.
                In an alternative embodiment the antibodies if the disclosure are prepared employing
   a mixed cell culture, for example~50% exchange occurs. This may yield in the region of 1
   2g/l of the desired bispecific.
                In one embodiment there is provided an antibody or fragment obtained or obtainable
30 from a process or method described herein.
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                     47
                In one embodiment, the antibody may be used to functionally alter the activity of the
   antigen of interest. For example, the antibody may neutralize, antagonize or agonise the
   activity of said antigen, directly or indirectly.
                The antibody molecules of the present invention are useful in the treatment and/or
 5 prophylaxis of a pathological condition.
                Thus there is provided an antibody according to the present invention for use in
   treatment, by administering a therapeutically effective amount thereof, for example in a
   pharmaceutical formulation. In one embodiment the antibody according to the invention is
   administered topically to the lungs, for example by inhalation.
10 The antibodies provided by the present invention are useful in the treatment of diseases or
   disorders including inflammatory diseases and disorders, immune disease and disorders,
   fibrotic disorders and cancers.
                The term "inflammatory disease" or "disorder" and "immune disease or disorder"
   includes rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, still's disease, Muckle Wells disease,
15 psoriasis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), asthma,
   allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, Type I diabetes mellitus,
   transplantation and graft-versus-host disease.
                The term "fibrotic disorder" includes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), systemic
   sclerosis          (or scleroderma), kidney fibrosis, diabetic  nephropathy,  IgA nephropathy,
20 hypertension, end-stage renal disease, peritoneal fibrosis (continuous ambulatory peritoneal
   dialysis), liver cirrhosis, age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), retinopathy, cardiac
   reactive fibrosis, scarring, keloids, burns, skin ulcers, angioplasty, coronary bypass surgery,
   arthroplasty and cataract surgery.
                The term "cancer" includes a malignant new growth that arises from epithelium,
25 found in skin or, more commonly, the lining of body organs, for example: breast, ovary,
   prostate, lung, kidney, pancreas, stomach, bladder or bowel. Cancers tend to infiltrate into
   adjacent tissue and spread (metastasise) to distant organs, for example: to bone, liver, lung or
   the brain.
   The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical or diagnostic composition comprising
30 an antibody of the present invention in combination with one or more of a pharmaceutically
   acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier. Accordingly, provided is the use of an antibody of
   the invention for the manufacture of a medicament. The composition will usually be supplied
   as part of a sterile, pharmaceutical composition that will normally include a pharmaceutically
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                      48
   acceptable carrier. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may additionally
   comprise a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant.
                The present invention also provides a process for preparation of a pharmaceutical or
   diagnostic composition comprising adding and mixing the antibody of the present invention
 5 together with one or more of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier.
   The antibody of the disclosure may be the sole active ingredient in the pharmaceutical or
   diagnostic composition or may be accompanied by other active ingredients including other
   antibody ingredients, for example anti-TNF, anti- IL-i anti -T cell, anti-IFNy or anti-LPS
   antibodies, or non-antibody ingredients such as xanthines. Other suitable active ingredients
10 include antibodies capable of inducing tolerance, for example, anti-CD3 or anti-CD4
   antibodies.
                In a further embodiment the antibody or composition according to the disclosure is
   employed in combination with a further pharmaceutically active agent, for example a
   corticosteroid (such as fluticasonoe propionate) and/or a beta-2-agonist (such as salbutamol,
15 salmeterol or formoterol) or inhibitors of cell growth and proliferation (such as rapamycin,
   cyclophosphmide, methotrexate) or alternative a CD28 and /or CD40 inhibitor. In one
   embodiment the inhibitor is a small molecule. In another embodiment the inhibitor is an
   antibody specific to the target.
                The pharmaceutical compositions suitably comprise a therapeutically        effective
20 amount of the antibody of the invention. The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used
   herein refers to an amount of a therapeutic agent needed to treat, ameliorate or prevent a
   targeted disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic or preventative effect.
   The therapeutically effective amount can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays or
   in animal models, usually in rodents, rabbits, dogs, pigs or primates. The animal model may
25 also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration.
   Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in
   humans.
                The precise therapeutically effective amount for a human subject will depend upon
   the severity of the disease state, the general health of the subject, the age, weight and gender
30 of the subject, diet, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction
   sensitivities and tolerance/response to therapy. This amount can be determined by routine
   experimentation and is within the judgment of the clinician.         Generally, a therapeutically
   effective amount will be from 0.01 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg, for example 0.1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg.
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                      49
   Pharmaceutical compositions may be conveniently presented in unit dose forms containing a
   predetermined amount of an active agent of the invention per dose.
   Compositions may be administered individually to a patient or may be administered in
   combination (e.g. simultaneously, sequentially or separately) with other agents, drugs or
 5 hormones.
                The dose at which an antibody of the present invention is administered depends on the
   nature of the condition to be treated, for example the extent of the disease/inflammation
   present and on whether the molecule is being used prophylactically or to treat an existing
   condition.
10 The frequency of dose will depend on the half-life of the antibody and the duration of its
   effect. If the antibody has a short half-life (e.g. 2 to 10 hours) it may be necessary to give
   one or more doses per day. Alternatively, if the antibody has a long half-life (e.g. 2 to 15
   days) it may only be necessary to give a dosage once per day, once per week or even once
   every 1 or 2 months.
15 The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier should not itself induce the production of antibodies
   harmful to the individual receiving the composition and should not be toxic. Suitable carriers
   may be large, slowly metabolised macromolecules such as proteins, polypeptides, liposomes,
   polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids, amino acid
   copolymers and inactive virus particles.
20              Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used, for example mineral acid salts, such as
   hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates and sulphates, or salts of organic acids, such as
   acetates, propionates, malonates and benzoates.
                Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers in therapeutic compositions may additionally
   contain liquids such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol.                Additionally, auxiliary
25 substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering substances, may be present
   in such compositions. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical compositions to be formulated
   as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries and suspensions, for ingestion
   by the patient.
                Suitable forms for administration include forms suitable for parenteral administration,
30 e.g. by injection or infusion, for example by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Where
   the product is for injection or infusion, it may take the form of a suspension, solution or
   emulsion in an oily or aqueous vehicle and it may contain formulatory agents, such as
   suspending, preservative, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the molecule of
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                                50
   the disclosure may be in dry form, for reconstitution before use with an appropriate sterile
   liquid.
                Once formulated, the compositions of the invention can be administered directly to
   the subject.                The subjects to be treated can be animals.           However, in one or more
 5 embodiments the compositions are adapted for administration to human subjects.
   Suitably in formulations according to the present disclosure, the pH of the final formulation
   is not similar to the value of the isoelectric point of the antibody, for example if the pH of the
   formulation is 7 then a pI of from 8-9 or above may be appropriate. Whilst not wishing to be
   bound by theory it is thought that this may ultimately provide a final formulation with
10 improved stability, for example the antibody remains in solution.
                The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by any
   number of routes including, but not limited to, oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-arterial,
   intramedullary, intrathecal, intraventricular, transdermal, transcutaneous (for example, see
   W098/20734),                    subcutaneous,  intraperitoneal,   intranasal,  enteral, topical,  sublingual,
15 intravaginal or rectal routes. Hyposprays may also be used to administer the pharmaceutical
   compositions of the invention. Typically, the therapeutic compositions may be prepared as
   injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions. Solid forms suitable for solution in, or
   suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection may also be prepared.
                Direct delivery of the compositions will generally be accomplished by injection,
20 subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously or intramuscularly, or delivered to the
   interstitial space of a tissue. The compositions can also be administered into a lesion. Dosage
   treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule.
                It will be appreciated that the active ingredient in the composition will be an antibody.
   As such, it will be susceptible to degradation in the gastrointestinal tract.                    Thus, if the
25 composition is to be administered by a route using the gastrointestinal tract, the composition
   will need to contain agents which protect the antibody from degradation but which release the
   antibody once it has been absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
                A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically                  acceptable carriers is available in
   Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Company, N.J. 1991).
30 In one embodiment the formulation is provided as a formulation for topical administrations
   including inhalation.
                Suitable            inhalable preparations   include   inhalable powders, metering      aerosols

   The heavy chain of antibody 48 (Sequence ID NO: 266) was generated by PCR and
   restriction enzyme cloning. The PCR product was generated by a forward oligo encoding the
 5 IgG1 upper and core hinge region sequence and a restriction site BglII and a reverse oligo
   encoding the restriction enzyme DrallI.                The PCR fragment was then digested with above
   mentioned enzymes and ligated into the hG4 single gene vector containing the appropriate
   variable region.
   2. Expression of the mutated IgG4 antibodies
10 All mutant DNA was transfected into CHOKI cells. Cells (2x 108 cells/ml) were resuspended
   in 1 ml Earles Balance Salt Solution (Sigma) and mixed with 400 pLg of DNA (200 ptg heavy
   chain DNA and 200 pg kappa light chain DNA). 800pl aliquots were transferred to 0.4 cm
   cuvettes (Biorad). For a 500 ml culture, six cuvettes were electroporated under the following
   parameters:              1 ms, 9.6 Amps; 10 ms, 0 Amps; 40 ms, 3.2 Amps. The transfected cells were
15 incubated for 24 hrs, shaking at 140 rpm in a 5% CO 2 humidified environment at 37'C and
   continued from day 2 post transfection at 32'C for 10-13 days. On day 4 post transfection 1.6
   mls 1 M sodium butyrate was added to the culture. Once the cells reached 40% viability or
   up to day 13, the supernatant was harvested. Cultures were centrifuged for 45 minutes at
   4000 rpm.               The supernatant was put through a 0.22 pM Stericup filter (Millipore) to be
20 purified.
   3. Purification of mutated I!G4 antibodies
   Supernatants (200-500 ml) were purified using a Protein A 5 ml HiTrap MabSelect SuRe
   column (GE Healthcare, Amersham UK). Samples were prepared by adding                     1 /5 0 th of the
   supernatant volume of 2 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5. Samples were loaded onto the column at 1
25 ml/min. The column was washed with PBS pH 7.4. To elute the samples, 0.1 M sodium
   citrate, pH 3.4 was run through the column at 1 ml/min and 0.5 ml fractions were collected.
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                             55
   Peak fractions were neutralised by adding 0.125 ml of 2 M Tris-HCl pH8.5 to each. UV
   detection was set at 280 nm.
   4. Characterization of purified mutated I!G4 antibodies
   SDS PAGE analysis:
 5 Crude supernatant was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 mins and quantified on the OCTET.
   Antibody samples (25-30ng) were prepared by adding the appropriate amounts of antibody,
   4x Loading Buffer (Invitrogen) and 2 pl 100mM NEM. A total volume of 20 pl was made
   up using dH 20. The samples were then boiled for 3 mins at 100'C and loaded onto a 15 well
    1.5 mm 4-20% Tris-Glycine gel. Gels were run at 150 V for 1.5 hrs in 1x Tank buffer.
10 Antibodies were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot dry transfer system
   set to transfer for 8 mins. The membrane was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) in
   PBS-TM on a shaking platform, followed by incubation with a rabbit anti-human IgG Fc
   HRP conjugated antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) or goat anti-human Kappa light chain
   HRP conjugated antibody (Bethyl) for 1 hr, shaking at RT. This was followed by 3 washes
15 of 5 mins each with PBS-T. The blots were revealed using a metal enhanced DAB substrate
   kit according to the manufacturer' s instructions (Pierce).
   The results of the Western blot analysis is shown in Figures 7, 8, 9 and 10. In Figure 7-10, H
   stands for heavy chain and L for light chain, H2L2 is a whole antibody molecule comprising
   two heavy chains and two light chains and HL is a half molecule comprising one heavy chain
20 and one light chain.
   Figure 7 shows the Western blot analysis for antibodies 15, 16, 6, 7, 8, 17, 18, 19, 5, 5P, 9,
    10, 11, 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 13 and 14. It can be seen from Figure 7 that the antibodies show a good
   level of H2L2 except for antibodies 4, 8 and 14 which show no or very little H2L2 due to the
   presence of both hinge mutations C239S and C242S. However, antibodies 4, 8 and 14 can
25 form H2L2 by non-covalent bonding between the heavy chains. Mutant 3 also shows little
   H2L2, this mutant retains C239 but is unable to form inter heavy chain disulphides in the
   hinge, presumably due to efficient formation of a disulphide between the C-terminal light
   chain (LC) cysteine and the hinge C239. It can also be seen that antibodies which comprise
   the mutation C239S but not C242S (antibodies 2, 6, 9 and 12) show reduced formation of HL
30 compared to antibodies which comprise neither C239S nor C242S or antibodies which
   comprise C242S but not C239S. Antibodies 5P and 16 which comprise the S241P mutation
   also show reduced formation of HL. A comparison of mutants 2 and 3 shows the extent of
   the ' reach'             of the Germinal cysteine of light chain to form a disulphide bond with the heavy
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

   chain, it appears that the light chain cysteine bonds more efficiently to C239 than to C242 in
   the heavy chain.
   Figure 8 shows the Western blot analysis for antibodies 15, 6, 7, 8, 28, 29, 30, 31, 17, 19, 32,
   33, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39. It can be seen from Figure 8 that the antibodies show a
 5 good level of H2L2 except for antibodies 8, 31, 35 and 39 which show no or very little H2L2
   due to the presence of mutations C239S and C242S in the hinge region and therefore no
   disulphide bonds form between two heavy chains. However, antibodies 8, 31, 35 and 39 can
   form H2L2 by non-covalent bonding between the heavy chains.               It can also be seen that
   antibodies which comprise the mutation C239S but not C242S (antibodies 6, 29, 33 and 37)
10 show reduced formation of HL compared to antibodies which comprise neither C239S nor
   C242S or antibodies which comprise C242S but not C239S.                Mutant 15 is able to form a
   disulphide bond between the light chain and G230C in the CHI and inter heavy chain
   disulphides hence resulting in a fully assembled and disulphide bonded protein. Furthermore,
   a comparison of mutants 15(C127S G230C), 28(C127S Y229C), 32(C127S K228C) and
15 36(C127S S227C) shows that the position of the introduced cysteine in the upper hinge
   improves inter LC-HC disulphide bond formation. G230 and Y229 are particularly preferred
   positions to introduce a cysteine. Mutant 28 (C127S Y229C) shows a low level of HL and H2
   and therefore has low disulphide bond heterogeneity.
   Figure 9 shows the Western blot analysis for antibodies 15, 6, 7, 8, 44, 45, 46, 47, 17 and 19.
20 It can be seen from Figure 9 that the antibodies show a good level of H2L2 except for
   antibodies 8 and 47 which show no or very little H2L2 due to the presence of mutations
   C239S and C242S in the hinge region and therefore no disulphide bonds form between two
   heavy chains.                 However, antibodies 8 and 47 can form H2L2 by non-covalent bonding
   between the heavy chains. It can also be seen that antibodies which comprise the mutation
25 C239S but not C242S (antibodies 6 and 45) show reduced formation of HL compared to
   antibodies which comprise neither C239S nor C242S or antibodies which comprise C242S
   but not C239S. In particular, mutant 44 shows that insertion of three amino acids in the upper
   hinge can also reduce the formation of HL and H2 and hence has lower levels of disulphide
   heterogeneity than the comparable mutant 15.
30 Figure 10, shows the Western blot analysis for antibodies 48, 17, 18 and 19. It can be seen
   from Figure 10, that antibody 48 shows a good level of H2L2 and very little HL. Mutant 48
   contains the IgGI upper hinge sequence EPKSCDKTHT SEQ ID NO: 320 in place of the
   IgG4 upper hinge sequence along with a core hinge S241P mutation. Hence mutant 48 has
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                     57
   the upper and core hinge sequence EPKSCDKTHTCPPCP SEQ ID NO: 321. Mutant 48
   shows lower levels of disulphide bond heterogeneity compared to the wild type IgG4
   antibody 17 and approximately equivalent low levels of disulphide bond heterogeneity
   compared to the IgG4 S241P mutant 18 and wild type IgG1 antibody 19.
 5 Thermofluor assay:
                Thermostabilities of purified mAbs were analyzed in a thermofluor assay using
   SYPRO@ Orange to monitor the thermal unfolding process of proteins. 5 pl of mAb at 1
   mg/ml, 5 pl of 30xdye, and 40 pl of PBS were added together.              Ten pl of the mix was
   dispensed in quadruplicate to a 384 PCR optical well plate and was run on the 7900HT Fast
10 Real-Time PCR System (Agilent Technologies UK Ltd, Wokingham UK). This PCR System
   contains a heating device for accurate temperature control set at 20'C to 99'C; a charged
   coupled device simultaneously monitors the fluorescence changes in the wells.
                Figures 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 show the results of the thermostability analysis of the
   IgG4 Antibody mutants compared to wild-type IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies.
15              A comparison of mutant 15 with wild type IgG4 (mutant 17) shows and increase in
   the Fab Tm due to the altered disulphide arrangement. A comparison of mutant 15 and 28
   shows further improvement in Fab Tm for mutant 28 comprising Y229C mutation compared
   to mutant 15 comprising G230C mutation. A comparison of mutant 15 and 44 shows that the
   Fab Tm of a G230C mutant can be further increased further by insertion of three amino acids
20 in the upper hinge. Comparison of mutants 17 and 18 show that the S241P middle hinge
   mutation does not increase Fab Tm even though it significantly reduces HL formation.
   Mutant 48 also shows significantly improved Fab Tm when compared to both wild type IgG4
   (mutant 17) and mutant 15.
                Figure 15 shows the overall ranking of the thermostabilites of selected IgG4 mutants
25 according to the present invention. Mutants 48, 44, 44P, 46, 45, 6, 29, 30, 28, 28P, 31, 8, 47
   and 15 all show significantly higher Fab Tm values compared to the wild type IgG4 (mutant
    17) and wild type IgG4 S241P (mutant 18).
   5. Fab arm exchange
   a) In vitro heavy chain exchange
30 A first IgG4 antibody and its potential exchange partner were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio at a
   total concentration of 100 ug/ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (in mM: 150 NaCl, 10
   NaH 2 PO 4 ; pH 7.4). To allow disulphide bond reduction, samples were supplemented with
   reduced Glutathione (GSH; Sigma) to a final concentration of 0, 0.5 or 5 mM. At the start of
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                            58
   the experiment (t                 = 0 hours) an aliquot of the mixture was taken, quenched with N
   ethylmaleimide (NEM; Sigma) to a final concentration of 10 mM (to inactivate potentially
   reactive thiol groups) and incubated alongside the rest of the mixture for 16 hours at 37oC (t
   =   16 hours). After incubation, the t = 16 hours sample was quenched as above.
 5 b)Detection and quantificationof heavy chain exchange in vitro
   The presence of functionally active bispecific antibodies was determined using a sandwich
   MSD assay in which quenched reaction samples provided in Example 5 a), serially diluted in
    1 % BSA in PBS (PB), were pre-incubated with 1 ug/ml biotinylated-antigen 1 (antigen of
   first antibody) in PB for 1 h at RT with agitation (200 r.p.m) before being transferred to PB
10 pre-blocked streptavidin coated MSD plates (Meso Scale Diagnostics).               After 1 h incubation
   at RT with agitation, wells were washed three times with PBS/O.1 % Tween-20 before being
   incubated with 1 ug/ml of sulfo-tagged antigen 2 (antigen of second antibody in PB. After
   incubation, plates were washed as above and signals revealed and measured using the
   manufactures read buffer and Image Sector 6000 instrument, respectively. Background
15 values obtained from control parallel reactions in which biotinylated-antigen was substituted
   for a non-biotinylated alternative, were subtracted from all signals. Duplicate values from at
   least 3 independent experiments were used in all calculations.
          The higher the MSD signal the larger the amount of heavy chain exchange that has
   occurred.
20              The following antibodies were analysed:

                                                               P238KTHT, S241P
   9994710_1 (GHMatters) P97845.AU.1

                                                           59
                Figures 16 to 20 show the results of the quantification Fab arm exchange in vitro,
   where the y-axis show the MSD signal, wherein the higher the level of the bar the higher the
   quantity of Fab arm exchange.
                Figure 16            shows heavy chain exchange for IgGI wild-type, IgG4 wild-type and
 5 mutants IgG4P, 28, 28P, 15, 44, 44P and 48 at two concentrations of GSH and at various
   timepoints.
                Figure 17            shows heavy chain exchange for IgG4 wild-type and mutants 15, 44
   and 48 at two concentrations of GSH at various timepoints.             It can be seen that the more the
   IgG4 hinge is mutated to be of the IgGI type the more exchange is reduced, as shown by
10 mutant 48 having the lease exchange.
                Figure 18            shows heavy chain exchange for IgG4 wild-type and mutants 15 and
   28 at two concentrations of GSH at various timepoints. It can be seen that the mutation at
   position 229 (mutant 28) reduces exchange over 4 to 16 hours at both concentrations of
   reducing agent to a greater extent compared to the mutation at position 230 (mutant 15).
15              Figure 19            shows percentage change for mutants IgG4P, 15, 28, 44 and 48 in 0.5
   mM GSH compared to wild-type IgG4. The exchange can be ranked as follows: IgG4 wt >
    15 = 44 > 48 > 28.
                Figure 20            shows percentage change for various mutants in 5 mM GSH compared
   to wild-type IgG4. The exchange can be ranked IgG4 wt > 15              = 44 > 48 > 28.
20 In good agreement with the literature (Labrijn 2011, Lewis 2009, Stubenrauch 2010, Labrijn
   2009) we show that the S241P mutation in the IgG4 core-hinge represents a tool for
   preventing Fab-arm exchange.               It can also be seen that mutant bispecific antibodies of the
   present invention would demonstrate less Fab arm exchange than has been shown at 0.5 mM
   GSH, which is 100 times higher than the 4-6 uM physiological GSH concentration of plasma
25 (Zilmer. et al, 2005. Drug Design Reviews).                Accordingly, bispecific antibodies may be
   created in vitro by Fab arm exchange under reducing conditions, which would then have
   significantly reduced Fab arm exchange in vivo compared to IgG4 wt.
   Antibody Affinity:
   The affinity of selected mutant IgG4 antibodies of the present invention to the target soluble
30 cytokine may be measured by BiacoreTM.                 The assay format is capture of the IgG' s on an
   anti-Fc surface followed by titration of soluble cytokine.

 5 Size exclusion (SEC) HPLC Analysis:
   Approximately 50ug purified antibody was run on the HPLC using a S200 column. Abs 1 to
    19 were used for the analysis. This result shows that non-covalently associated H2L2 is
   formed despite alterations to the DSB arrangements of a human IgG4 molecule.
